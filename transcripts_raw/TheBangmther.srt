1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
I think a burp is a better signal. It doesn't make any sense to start with a

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,880
burp, because you have to see the moment that we've had this exact. Yeah, what

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,880
do we do? You're so stupid really this exact because you go into the mic and

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,320
you're when you burp, you burp, and we make a pit bull face. We've had the

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,240
we're moving on because if you want to hear this, you can go to five episodes

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,800
ago. Yeah, right. You're already on this tier. So you like what you're hearing.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,960
So hello, everybody. We're going to do some character creations, the Mother's

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,680
Day episode, but we're going to start by doing character creation because I got

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,080
everybody brand new, awesome character sheets. If you're on the video,

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,680
Patrick, will you show the episode right now? Pat, will you show? Stop trying to

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,400
eat me. Wait, I can show easiest, I think. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, true. We'll post

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,200
this in the Discord, too. And straight up DM me if I forget, because I always

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,720
forget. So there's a couple of things I want to point out here, okay? So will

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,360
you please explain what you would politely say is the reason why we

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,000
switched to these?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
Politely.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,920
We've been, over the past three years,

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,320
the most recent episode notwithstanding, we've been having some...

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,640
It's just been challenging

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,920
sometimes to communicate some of the

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,240
nuances really in the game with two you guys and have that

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,920
stick with you and I so you decided to eliminate the nuance and go for things

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:35,480
such as the speed ability, having a rabbit on it, but a a running jack rabbit.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,600
Yeah, I just thought that would kind of help and then you could see that

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,920
also what I think it really does help what I like here. What I like here too

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,840
is that you've completely removed the names of the stats and replace them with

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,520
pictures. So we have a and I know exactly what all the more a strong arm

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,320
of balancing guy, a guy standing on a ball, a heart, a brain, an owl wisdom

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,220
talking

30
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,000
also

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,300
we're having trouble. We didn't know what strength.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,240
This is like

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,880
the fire moves anymore. This is like their own with three, but yeah, we'll

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,920
come up with moves we're going to it's going to be everything's nice and giant.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,940
there's no way you could. I mean this literally looks like a kindergarten

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,220
worksheet. Yeah, it is. This is my first D and D thing. This is a you found a D

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,620
and D. So there did you make this? No, I wish I did. I found it online. What

38
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,880
were what did you look up to find? Yeah, what was this called? You have to

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,140
know. It's a pdf dyslexic D and D characters really

40
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,460
that

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,500
dyslexic. That's really funny. This isn't even the right handwriting for dyslexia,

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,220
but this was the best one I found.

43
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,260
That is so fucking awesome. It has a very specific handwriting, too. Yeah,

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,940
all the letters are slanted. Yeah, but this was the most accessible one I

45
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,300
found. I was really looking that up. Oh, no. Wow. For no other reason. We really

46
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,340
do need this, don't we? Well, so what I did is we removed skills. Skills are

47
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,180
kind of in the way. Yeah, think about it. Dyslexics can't handle skills. Yeah. And

48
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,900
then as far as the at least for that, we're going to try it for the

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,100
Seahawks. Yeah. I mean, like I think when we do a campaign that's not a

50
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,780
holiday special, that's kind of be a little bit loose. We'll have like more

51
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,940
room for abilities and some other things, but I think I want to start, I'm

52
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,340
thinking this is like, let's start from a strong foundation, right? Let's remove

53
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,660
some of those roadblocks that have been impeding you guys from taking in any

54
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,260
information like maybe three and which has all been my fault too is what I

55
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,500
realized to I did a lot of reflecting and I was like I'm the problem here. So

56
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,980
let me get you guys very wrong of you. But yeah, I was there's a clear problem.

57
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,220
Yeah, and it's not you. Well, I appreciate that. But you know, I I still

58
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,460
feel like I gotta do what I gotta do. You know, that's how I was raised by a

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,980
pack of nerds, wild pack of nerds. So yeah, let's let's let's roll for your

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,580
stats. Okay. And then I'll introduce the premise to everybody. It's a little bit

61
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,620
more informal, right? I want, well, you know, let me know what you guys think.

62
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,920
Let me know in the comments. Please say what symbol they are and not. So roll

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,820
for arm flex. And we're just rolling in order down the line. Oh, sorry. No,

64
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,460
we need three D's. Three D's. Yeah. So you only gave us two. I gave, I handed

65
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,420
you another one. I handed you another one. Let's roll down the line. Oh, you

66
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,620
didn't have two because you've got a pack. The reason why I want to roll down

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,460
the line is because it will force you guys to just kind of have the character you have

68
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,900
to have. Have the character you have to have. Cameron, don't worry about it, I got it. So

69
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,020
yeah, let's just roll for each stat instead of rolling it, putting it on the side and

70
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,100
assigning it. Alright, so just go down the line. Yeah, so everyone do arm. Okay, arm.

71
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,140
My arm is 13. Oh my god, I got a 15 arm. I got a, oh. You got a 14 arm. So you guys have

72
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:05,420
all pretty decent arm. And then what's next? Because I have it here.

73
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,940
Next one is balance.

74
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,140
Balance. Next one's balance.

75
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,940
Camera patches. You got to move your backpack.

76
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,060
Sorry. Sorry, camera.

77
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,680
Oh,

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,940
not so good with the balance ball.

79
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,860
OK, how'd you do in balance ball?

80
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,820
I got nine. I also got nine.

81
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,700
And what did you get?

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
I didn't roll because I was fixing the camera.

83
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,980
I screwed it up.

84
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,740
If you get a nine, this is a sign.

85
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,740
I got a 7. Oh God, we suck at balance but we're pretty good at arms.

86
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,740
Next is heart. Okay.

87
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,740
It kind of looks like a face. I got a 13.

88
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,740
Heart. I got 11. Okay. I also got a 13 heart.

89
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,740
Okay. It's kind of like our hearts are linked across the table.

90
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
You know what? These are kind of our real life stats so far.

91
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,740
We got three dice right here. You got singles?

92
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,740
I played Steelo the other night and I lost fucking 40 bucks.

93
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Jesus Christ. Brain. Now brain.

94
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,240
brain

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,340
ten

96
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,880
five

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,080
five

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,380
fourteen very nice.

99
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,060
You got good. You have the highest brain all right. That's giving brains

100
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,620
that yeah, I went there wow. I'll only shit

101
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,660
okay. I got I got twelve. I got fourteen some so the maybe not so all you're

102
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,020
maybe a bit smart, not good at flying, but not so owl. Are you now talking

103
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,480
thirteen.

104
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,180
I got a seven. I can't believe I got a fifteen talking

105
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,260
okay, let's let's let's review. Let's review

106
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:48,740
let's see how so arm everybody's pretty decent right. I got fifteen. I got

107
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,060
fourteen or yeah, let's start with the start. Yeah, Caleb, you start okay guys.

108
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,260
I have for my arm. I have fifteen are for my balance ball. I have not

109
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:09,100
for my heart. I have thirteen or maybe that's a stomach. I have for brain. I

110
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,820
have five

111
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:19,360
and for talky

112
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
I have fifty

113
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,720
wow

114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
great.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,220
So we'll do the modifiers for that in the second. Okay,

116
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:44,320
so Pat, I have fourteen arm. I have nine balance ball. I have eleven hearts.

117
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,520
I have fourteen brain, fourteen owls and seven talking well.

118
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,020
So

119
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,340
but for me mine, I didn't get anything above thirteen on mine. I got thirteen

120
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:03,260
arm, my balance ball at seven thirteen part and as and ten brain, but only six

121
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:10,220
owl and my talking will be thirteen as well as the other thirteen. Okay, that's

122
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,180
not bad. Thirteen talking is pretty good. Thirteen thirteen, thirteen arm talking

123
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,660
and heart, but my worst is by far my owl fall.

124
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
this is my balance.

125
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,520
Yeah, my guys, my guys kind of well rounded when it comes to doing arm and

126
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,940
brain

127
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,480
but

128
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:35,260
what he has to do stuff that involves our you know, it's ball. I really my

129
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,340
only bad stat is my brain is fine.

130
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,780
Yeah, you're pretty on balance ball.

131
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,980
My balance balls, okay, your balance ball is definitely passed, but I got

132
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:52,800
good arm and good talky. I got pretty I got pretty lucky here with arm, brain

133
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,380
and owl. That's pretty, those are big stats. Yeah, those are big stats to I

134
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,260
got three fourteens. I feel like my character is maybe a tier lower than

135
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,960
you guys' character. Yeah, I think I'd have to agree. Maybe we can, maybe we

136
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,200
can

137
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,480
exploit that. Based on just, I mean based on

138
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,040
owl alone. Yeah. So yeah, with five brain, I think that's like dolphin, maybe

139
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,200
little less than dolphin intelligence in D and D aren't dolphins intelligent

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,240
or than humans. No, they're not or is that science fiction? That's

141
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,280
thinking

142
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,600
a

143
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,500
like and are they good at singing and they fly

144
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,000
but in the movie only yeah, but they're smart, though that's that's all I'm

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,440
saying is don't get down. No, they are smart. I'll get down on the dolphin on

146
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,280
your on yourself. Oh, no, you're a doll. You know, I would say it's much more

147
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,720
consulting that I had to fill out the arm brain out worksheets kind of the

148
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
idea yeah. So let's do so let's now

149
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,560
do initiative and armor class and bunny rabbit. So for armor class,

150
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,280
we're going to do

151
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,860
eight

152
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,620
or sorry, no ten plus your decks mod. So what are sorry your ten plus checks

153
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,240
your balance ball. Okay, so my armor class is how we come up with

154
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,140
balance. Oh yeah, I apologize. So yeah, let me let's get the mods in

155
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,960
there and the saves will be the same as the mods. You're not doing

156
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,160
any specialization. What do we roll? So so so for

157
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,720
if you have fifteen, so actually I'll just tell you guys all

158
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,920
so let me just say so ten is zero ten to eleven is zero

159
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,000
mod twelve to thirteen is plus one and then fourteen to fifteen is plus

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
two and then sixteen, seventeen, plus three, etc.

161
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,880
Then for minus... Sorry, what was that? What was eleven? Eleven is zero, so zero

162
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,560
mod. If a nine is minus one, we have there, Pat, and then that's plus two,

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,580
that's plus two. And what about six? So then this is... Six is

164
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,800
minus

165
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,480
two. Nine to seven is minus one? And five is minus three.

166
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,960
Sorry. And seven is minus two? Nine is minus one. Okay. And seven is

167
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,800
minus two. Damn. Okay. My talkie is not good. You have bad talkie?

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
I got plus two talking. I have really bad talking. Yeah, not bad for me. So

169
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,800
plus one.

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
So your armor class then is gonna be 10 plus

171
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,480
that balance ball. So 10 plus... Well, wait, but my balance ball is negative

172
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,860
one, so 10... How do I plus a negative one to it? So my balance

173
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,620
ball... So my armor class is 19.

174
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,100
So mine would be... So I would have a nine. Just add your modifier.

175
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:40,160
your

176
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
- What's Dex? - Balance ball, sorry.

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
- Balance?

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240
- I gotta start saying that.

179
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,360
- Just the mod, so negative one.

180
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,160
- And then the rabbit is?

181
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,840
- Pat, it's minus one, not nine.

182
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,120
- You're looking at the thing, the other thing.

183
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,440
- You need to just do the Dex mod.

184
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,640
- Mod, or the balance ball mod.

185
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,280
- Yeah. - A little circle to the rabbit.

186
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,120
- Oh, okay. - Balance ball.

187
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,940
- For it, just for initiative.

188
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,780
- The balance ball side number.

189
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,480
- So my initiative is negative one?

190
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,400
- Yes. - Yeah.

191
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,760
- So you just subtract one when you roll a D20

192
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,080
to see if, roll for initiative.

193
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,320
- Now what's the bunny rabbit's name?

194
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,660
What is Roger and that's thirty feet is going to be your speed unless you guys

195
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,720
are little. I see two. I'm really little. Something just happened to my sheet.

196
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,880
Okay. You spit it on it. I laughed and then I spit. Mr. Patches, he spit it on

197
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,920
my God. Mr. Patches, I did.

198
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,520
I

199
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:37,520
spit it on his spit take and it inked. That's why I look like a sad mom. That's

200
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,440
why I brought spares. Let's just copy it onto the new sheet and try not to make a mistake

201
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:50,120
again, Patrick. I don't have enough for everyone in the class, so I just...

202
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,240
I cannot believe this turn. Wow.

203
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
You guys died.

204
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,920
Can I get an extra? I don't like how I roded my numbers.

205
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,080
No, let's just try to stick with what you got right now, and then we can see if we'll

206
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,400
see a little later. All right.

207
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,520
I'll call your mom. I don't care. Call my mom. Why?

208
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,560
Now, if you make me laugh, you know, that doesn't mean you're not in trouble.

209
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,160
What is my speed? Oh, 30.

210
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,560
What speed? I thought his name is Roger. What is my Roger?

211
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,840
Roger's 30.

212
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,800
I got a cross out speed.

213
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Can you fix that for next time? Yeah, I'll fix that. I'm sorry about that.

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
You see, you're slowly resting control back. Do you like how I wrote Roger?

215
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,280
Yeah, I see. I had a similar idea.

216
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,640
I did a similar thing.

217
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,440
All right. Backwards letter. Now, do you like my Rs?

218
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,720
Yours are better than me and his is all of your hit.

219
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
Die are going to be one D10 for this.

220
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
So that is to just write one D10. And what is hit dice?

221
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,320
that's just what you use to cover your band aid band or dotted pill. I thought

222
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,720
that was yeah or a could be a nintendo switch flatbread. No toppings. I don't

223
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,440
know what flatbread is too childishly dumb. Okay, so what about so then

224
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,600
nintendo switch put one d ten just to have that in there and then there's a

225
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,920
little heart, little heart, big heart, maybe a butt and then a big but yeah,

226
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,520
what's my big but it's a heart, which one's very funny guys. So, oh upside

227
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,720
down. It looks like that's all right.

228
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Quiet coyote. That's right. Okay, Max HP. That's your little heart is going to be

229
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,520
ten for everybody for this session. Okay, and your big heart for everybody. So

230
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,520
one zero thirty forty ten ten ten. That's pretty good though. One thousand. You

231
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,320
know, you're smart when you're trying to be funny. So the current HP will be

232
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:13,320
is

233
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,160
attack and a ranged attack for this one. So right now we have to say our intros? No, you

234
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,320
don't have to say your intros. We don't have to do that. We should do the intros and stuff

235
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,440
when the game starts. So what we will say is that we know that you guys are three twins

236
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,440
and it's Mother's Day. Who are your characters? I'm just going to be myself because I found

237
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,480
this guy that looks pretty similar. Here, wait, give me this camera. I mean it looks

238
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,360
just like and then Pat found one that looks like him too. And I found one that looks like

239
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,120
me. This looks like Patches when you put it next to him. Don't do that. Don't show that.

240
00:15:51,120 --> 00:16:00,240
Mr. Patches. Mr. P. Mr. P. Mr. P. From Planet P. What's P stand for? Planet. Alright, okay.

241
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,000
Mr. Planet. It stands for Mr. Patches. Okay. See I can't even tell when you cut to that

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,720
angle because he's not even on frame anymore. Okay. You're not sure if I'm the blue alien

243
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,440
you're not anymore because of the angle. So that's basically who we are. Yeah.

244
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,920
Cool. Okay. So you guys are just yourselves, but you look fucked up.

245
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,440
I think that's like, you're just an armor. Can I,

246
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,080
can I just get into character real quick? Yeah. Go for it.

247
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,720
No way. Is that a whoopee cushion? Oh my God. What are you doing?

248
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:46,260
Patrick, why don't you describe what you just put on for the audio listeners

249
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,460
put on a bald cap that says I heart eating

250
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:56,720
you know. I thought we were going one way with this. I just got kicked out of

251
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,100
mom's room for you guessed it a panty raid. Why am I why is it a pain? Why am

252
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,040
I fucking trying to smell my own pants?

253
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,720
That's what the campaign was about. Whatever do well

254
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,960
well guys who am I

255
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
you can do it

256
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,280
don't make fun of patches

257
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,160
sorry

258
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,020
Okay, so you're me and I'm me. Wait, are we then you have to be me too, then? I

259
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,780
guess. Because if we're twins and two of us are identical, you gotta be him also.

260
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,680
Yeah, okay. Alright, so you don't have to actually.

261
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:45,360
You can make your own choice. Yeah, you could be three twins and just two of you

262
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,580
are identical.

263
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,320
And also, I don't even know about identical, by the way. It doesn't really

264
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,420
Oh yeah, no I'm wearing glasses. No, don't take that wasn't a problem. This is

265
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,060
gonna be now. I look just like him. I guess I'll just be Sir Lancelot.

266
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Okay, so we got is it Caleb, Caleb and Sir Lancelot? I mean I'm Caleb. I don't

267
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,020
know about this guy. What's your name gonna be Pat? Because you ripped me off.

268
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,540
Just guess what my name is.

269
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,100
What? It's Caleb. Okay. It's Bilak. Bilak. Okay.

270
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,980
people are going to go crazy for be like so be like Caleb and Lance lot. I think

271
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,380
they'll make

272
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,260
that's going to make it easier. He fought for the honour of the title. You can't

273
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,740
certainly

274
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,700
yeah, you said,

275
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,460
I don't give a shit about it, so don't break my current angle and let's now, so

276
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,500
let's, let's come up with your attack. I do like him backwards. I do like so. So

277
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,060
what is, what is Caleb's melee attack backwards, walking directly at you, okay,

278
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,560
write that down and add one D six and add your strength modifier to it. Okay,

279
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,560
so backwards backwards walking directly into you.

280
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,960
We can have that have a we can have that have a chance to knock somebody prone

281
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,700
on a crit

282
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,720
is walking with a NG or just a G.

283
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:14,820
Have it our time. I did it with just a G.

284
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:23,220
and a modifier is so it'll be plus to your arm circle, your arm arm circle,

285
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,540
arm circles, your arm arm circle circle circle in the slot. I'll get to and the

286
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,060
damage damage. No, that's what it is. The damage your image is plus attack.

287
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,340
Attack is attack is is just

288
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,780
is plus two plus two. So it's four plus four. I had to do this. You mean twenty

289
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,700
two. I'm sorry.

290
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,880
Let me do this. This is my okay. I actually did explain. You could you not

291
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,500
have gotten us some easy character sheets? Yeah, I know.

292
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,940
The section that I was filling out, by the way, guys, no pictures.

293
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:05,020
Yeah, I don't know what this is. What were you thinking? Come on attacks?

294
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,280
Come on.

295
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,980
Why does it say my name?

296
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,360
Cameron attack. And I have one D6 plus two.

297
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,220
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
You have to attack Cameron for this?

299
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,260
So, and what's your range attack going to be? What's Caleb's range attack?

300
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,500
It's walking backwards into you as your melee attack.

301
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,260
Jumping backwards onto you?

302
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,220
So it's range, but...

303
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,820
Okay, shit.

304
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,340
Like a slingshot or...

305
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,860
Ha, Hock-a-loogie.

306
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,700
Hock-a-loogie, love it. Okay.

307
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,780
So then just do Hock-a-loogie and then it's going to be...

308
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,100
Minus one is going to be the modifier.

309
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,100
I mean your attacks going to be 1d6 minus 1 because it's based on your balance ball circle.

310
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
My balance ball circle is shit.

311
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Your balance ball circle is not very good.

312
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
And then do you want to have a special attack?

313
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Yeah.

314
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Alright, let's, do you have one in mind?

315
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Pick him up and throw him.

316
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Okay.

317
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Pick up my twin, or one of my triplets and throw him.

318
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
I like the triplet attack. Pick up a triplet and throw them.

319
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Pick up, how would I say that?

320
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Just pick, uh. Pick up.

321
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,460
pick up, can I just write pick up and we'll know what I mean? Yeah, we'll know

322
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,420
what you mean. It's pick up. We won't forget it in an hour. Let's have that

323
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,720
be still based on your balance ball circle. But my balance ball's bad.

324
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,960
Can we have it based on my owl or my talkie?

325
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,440
Let's have it based on... On my arm? Let's have it based on your arm and

326
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,360
you're using them as a weapon. Okay. So it's less... So it's plus four again.

327
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,300
And then let's do one. Let's do one day ten.

328
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,220
One day ten

329
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,100
plus two plus two.

330
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,700
Yeah, I like that. And then you guys will also get to move a

331
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
little bit closer to an enemy from one of those. It'll be

332
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,400
there'll be some fun shenanigans there.

333
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,300
Okay. All right, Billak or do you want to be?

334
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,400
I don't know. He's Caleb.

335
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,800
Caleb also. I guess we're all named Caleb. Caleb Caleb also.

336
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,900
All named Caleb. What the fuck are you talking about?

337
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the

338
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,200
All right, Caleb. Also, what is your attack going to be? I'm walking forwards.

339
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,960
You can't copy. No, first of all, you're copying my likeness. Let's create. We got to draw a line.

340
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,040
We got to draw. We're being we're being twin draw. He said you got to draw a line. Patrick

341
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:29,040
don't. Oh, Lordy. He drew. So my attack is a line. I walk in a line. You walk in a line. Shoot line.

342
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,140
shoot line. I don't steal something from you line rider. Hey Cameron, which what

343
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,240
iconic internet video should I steal from Patrick that he's made? Oh wait,

344
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,540
that's right.

345
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,640
Line rider. So what is what is line riding? I play line rider on my phone.

346
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,840
Is that a stupid? Okay, skip to me. Skip to you.

347
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,140
Bird about it. Hallbird right? Yeah, you've got a hallbird. Hallbird. That's

348
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,340

349
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,840
modifier because you're cross your modifier, not for your attack modifier

350
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,080
for your yeah, yeah, yeah cross bow. What is it balance ball minus

351
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,740

352
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,280
What's the damage one D six? Also one D six pad. I'm going to with our number

353
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,200

354
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,620
- two - two - two special ability. You guys are not going to fireball fireball.

355
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,780

356
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:35,460

359
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,460
stop. You can't have summons. I'm not going to let you have summons. I'll let

360
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,740
you shoot fireball fireball plus what

361
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,880
Plus three, let's say.

362
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,540
Damage?

363
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,580
One D10.

364
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,780
Straight.

365
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,340
Straight.

366
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,880
One D10 straight, like it's a fire damage.

367
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,420
Okay, I'm done.

368
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,140
Okay.

369
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,220
Caleb also.

370
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,020
What did he write?

371
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,920
I have hit,

372
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,820
and then I have dodge.

373
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,120
Dodge?

374
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,040
You have dodge.

375
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,820
Dodge, dive, and dodge.

376
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,240
and then my special move is air fryer.

377
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,680
- Okay, what does air fryer do?

378
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,520
- I can shoot.

379
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,360
- Don't even say it.

380
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,200
- I can shoot.

381
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
- Unfortunately I kept it at 400 damage.

382
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,440
- Yeah, no, I can shoot fire from my mouth.

383
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,800
- You copied fireball, now we copy fireball.

384
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
- But only up to 400 degrees.

385
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,480
- Okay, I'm changing mine to lightning ball.

386
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,840
- He is the ultimate copier to the point

387
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,360
where he's copying my head.

388
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,120
- I didn't even hear that you did fireball.

389
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,600
I was trying to think too hard.

390
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,440
- Not paying attentioner.

391
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,800
- All right, so cops are hit.

392
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,600
attack. What about hot air? I can shoot hot air out of my breath. You can take

393
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,680
fire. I don't care. I'm having a skull attack. Skull attack. Why does he have

394
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,280
15 fucking abilities and I got dragon pit summon, but I got rid of it. Yeah,

395
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,880
he has the ability to summon. Then I'll write abilities. I can't use either.

396
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,760
Okay, right for hit. Let's add. So pat for that. Let's do plus four there and

397
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,440
then write one d six plus two for hit. One d six. You forgot how to write a d.

398
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,560
I watched that happen in real time. I drew an eye. Okay, so right one

399
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,440
number six, so you know, so you know that when you're looking at it,

400
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,040
I got busy with an eye and then one D plus six.

401
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,720
That is not anything that is awesome. That is really make this character

402
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,760
sheet path. That's what I'm trying to one D six plus one plus two

403
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,440
plus two. Okay, so that's one high plus six plus two, but no one know what it

404
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,180
one I D plus six plus two one idea

405
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,980
dodge. I guess is your rage to attack. Okay,

406
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,120
you have to you tell me. I don't know it's a car. I guess yeah, you use it

407
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,560
throw a car. Think of any funny Caleb abilities. You you came in here with

408
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,880
that prep. You could have all you spent all day writing this

409
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,400
on this. It's a very good joke. I found the bald cap here and I found a sharpie

410
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,240
okay,

411
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,200
so how about you sharpened an okay

412
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,960
I honestly wish I had that attack yeah, but mom won't let me you've got sharpie

413
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,480
you throw you get a part because of what I did to the coffee table. He drew on

414
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,560
and I drew a heart on it. I wrote four no, that's

415
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,040
I wrote plus one hearts mom on the coffee table and sharpie and it's one

416
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,480
I got banned from sharp -1 pitch.

417
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,680
And then special attack is what was that air fryer?

418
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,880
Yeah, and I can blow hot air out of my mouth up to 400 degrees.

419
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,480
Let's add your owl to that.

420
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,480
So let's do plus four, but it can probably get into 1d6.

421
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,480
You know, you could probably just so you know about the air

422
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,080
fire ability.

423
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,680
It could probably be jailbroken to go higher than 400.

424
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,780
I don't think you can jail.

425
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,880
You guys are you guys are so now we've got everything

426
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,920
settled. We've got Caleb, Caleb and Sir Lance a lot. And I'm gonna start the

427
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,960
campaign. One second.

428
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,200
Oh my God.

429
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,320
Can I wear that after you?

430
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,640
Yeah.

431
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,200
Can I wear that when the campaign is done?

432
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,680
Yeah.

433
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,640
I want your smell, Mr. P.

434
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,040

435
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,720

436
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,880
Mr. P. I want that.

437
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,520
Let me sniff that wig.

438
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I would do anything for a good grade.

439
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,020
it.

440
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,620
You look like Ricky Lake. I tried to get a

441
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,340
Karen wig and it's just cloud strife turns out. You guys are walking in the

442

wearing today. Damn, I can see Mr P's thong.

444
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,320

445
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,520
three. To pay for school. To pay for school supplies for us. To pay for

446
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,180
pencils. To pay for pencils, Mr P's a stripper.

449
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,220

450
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,220
probably a great

451
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:27,220

00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,740
And all of you have a distinct feeling that you did something.

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,160
I pat my penis.

469
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,340
You weren't going to do it again.

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,300
So before your phone is ringing, Patrick, your phone is ringing.

471
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Before you pick up.

475
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,240
the top. If you look at it from the top you see five triangles. Okay, I have two D10s.

476
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:46,940

All right, by that I mean Caleb and then Lancelot.

485
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,640
I thought I got a 92.

486
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
10.

487
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,440
4.

488
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,040
10-4, good buddy.

489
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
That's 14 for you.

490
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,840
Let's roll it again.

491
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,440
Everybody?

492
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,740
Yes, all of you again.

493
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,040
I got a zero.

494
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Okay, just tell me when you get both of them.

495
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,180
And I got an 80?

496
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,220
I got 12.

497
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,500
84.

498
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,420
Or I got 210.

499
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,980
I got 07.

500
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,260
Okay, 07.

501
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,180
Reroll that zero.

502
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Oh, sorry, no, just keep the zero.

503
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,020
I'm an idiot, I should've done that before.

504
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,380
You got 77.

505
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,620
So you actually got seven,

506
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,780
and you actually got nine before, Pat.

507
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,620
I'm sorry, I forgot.

508
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,460
It's just if you get two zeros and you get 100.

509
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,500
Oh, then I got four.

510
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,340
You got four?

511
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,160
Okay, yeah, that's my bad there.

512
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,220
I'm sorry, I got confused.

513
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,460
Then why don't you just read them as zeros?

514
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,460
Um, cause I'm stupid. Who's 0-4? Who got 4?

515
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Me.

516
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,460
You did. Kayla and then Pat you got 12 right?

517
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,460
Yeah.

518
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,460
And then Cam you got 7.

519
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
7.

520
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,460
Alright, let's start here. And now I'm gonna do a little roll. And you guys can't look.

521
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,460
I guess I'll give it a roll.

522
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Cam where you going? Oh he can't hear me.

523
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
Cam where you going?

524
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,460
Okay. I know who fucked mom.

525
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
You do?

526
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Uh oh.

527
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Oh, wait, we fucked mom? We fucked our mom?

528
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Well, you'll find out in a second.

529
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I hope it was me. I'm Caleb.

530
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
This is character assassination.

531
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,460
I hope that I did it, and I hope I made it stink.

532
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Hold on. Okay, so what you guys just rolled for was on a random table of things that might have happened last night.

533
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
What the hell are you doing over there?

534
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:45,460
And we're going to find out slowly throughout the course of the adventure

535
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,460
what's been going on, what you guys did.

536
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Okay.

537
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
Oh, that's a fun one.

538
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,460
And then pad again.

539
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
I don't understand my pantomimes.

540
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Oh no. Okay.

541
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,460
That one sucks, but it's fine.

542
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,460
I got chat GBT to make some of these.

543
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,700
You can replace them if it's not good.

544
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,060
Yeah, I guess I can.

545
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
But I try to have the integrity of the game.

546
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,820
All right, I'll do that one.

547
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,180
I'll replace it.

548
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,380
It's his fault you're allergic to him.

549
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,260
Yeah, I'm dying.

550
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,220
What do you smell?

551
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,580
I don't know.

552
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
I get it.

553
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:33,260
OK, and then Caleb.

554
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,020
Yes, that's stupid. It's got a better one. Caleb. Yes. Can you turn the autofocus on

555
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:48,980
cams camera off? Yeah. It's a little blurry. Hi, Jubio. Hi. What are you up to? That's a good one.

556
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:55,460
I'm drinking water and watching the show. The show? Oh, this show? This show that I'm doing.

557
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,400
Okay, all right, maybe I'll fill time by singing a song. No, no, we're good.

558
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,100
No, we're good.

559
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,900
Okay, cool.

560
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:17,300
We he your phone is ringing Pat Caleb. Okay,

561
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,700
it's your father. His name is just Caleb. Don't say Pat Caleb. My name is

562
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,200
Caleb twin say so. So Caleb, your name's case. You guys, his names are

563
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,600
They're both Caleb. Okay, Caleb. Yeah, Caleb twin. But the Caleb I'm looking at.

564
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,960
What? Your phone is

565
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,240
not bad. Your phone is ringing. Do I sound like a frog? Hello? Okay, wait,

566
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Peck. Peck, go again. What?

567
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:50,800
This does not sound like me. What do you want, dad? Fuck you. Son. I have a

568
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,720
piss poor attitude. I did not ever have a piss poor attitude. Growing up, I was

569
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
sweet as a dandelion.

570
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,480
Hi son, just wanted to see how you and your brothers and mother were doing on your dude

571
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
ranch vacation.

572
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,680
I love when you guys go away right before Mother's Day and I don't know what happens.

573
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:13,200
Um, last night we uh, there, um.

574
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,520
I was just wondering where your mother was.

575
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,360
I've been trying to call her for a little while and she hasn't picked up so I was wondering

576
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
if you guys knew.

577
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
I think she's dead.

578
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
No, she's not dead.

579
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Dead, dead.

580
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
She's not dead.

581
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,360
I, I, uh, she's not, this is the other Caleb by the way.

582
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Oh, hi son.

583
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
She's not dead.

584
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Yeah, she's dead.

585
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
No, she's not dead.

586
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
We don't know where she is.

587
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
She's dead from bullshit.

588
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,360
This is not, he's acting weird.

589
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Okay.

590
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
She is.

591
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
And I hate my-

592
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
I am Sir Lancelot.

593
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,360
[Laughter]

594
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
This is what my voice sounds like.

595
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
[Laughter]

596
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Okay, so basically.

597
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
[Laughter]

598
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,920
Me, Caleb, and Sir Lancelot. We woke up, we have no idea where Mom is.

599
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,420
Oh no.

600
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
Bob's a bitch!

601
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,120
We basically don't even remember what happened last night.

602
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,960
You guys eat too much candy again?

603
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Yes.

604
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
(laughter)

605
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Maybe Sir Lancelot did. I barely had any candy last night.

606
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,460
I expect better from you, Sir Lancelot.

607
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,460
I'm sorry, Dad.

608
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:18,460
It's alright, it's alright. Just, if you don't know where your mother is, I need you guys to find her.

609
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,460
Searching.

610
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,460
Searching.

611
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
(laughter)

612
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,460
Searching.

613
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,740
when I say that I'm walking around the room. Sorry, does dad I that really

614
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,900
feels like a job for the police. Not really three kids. Well, who? Yeah, I'm

615
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,740
50. I'm 10. If you're the Children of the month, you have to find your mother

616
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,940
on Mother's Day. I'll call the cops. Okay, just at least all right. Can't

617
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:45,340
paint over at least just, you know, I'll call the cops. No, I'll report.

618
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,520
Well, she hasn't been gone more than 48 hours. So yeah, it's true. That's part

619
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,580
of the issue. All right, so I guess I'll go. I'm done with the robot voice,

620
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:57,020
Dad, the house stinks. You are in a hotel weird. Do you mean hotel rooms

621
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,220
smells and you're not here? It doesn't look anything like our house smells like

622
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,980
fucking clams and shit. Sir Lance a lot.

623
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,780
You feel a rustling in your pants.

624
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,900
Well, okay, and you're wearing arbor in your grieves my grieves. Yeah, you have

625
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,540

627
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,740

630
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,900

631
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:50,140
it's Tom and Jerry, but you're not so you're you're you're feeling a little

636
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,580
So yeah, there's an echo on my voice too, which I'm not going to put on the

637
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,420
soundboard, but I'm so I have not raised my my visor.

638
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,580
Look, just let me know where your mother is so that we can have a great Mother's Day back

639
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,580
home.

640
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,580
I can't wait to see all three of you and your mother again.

641
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
I'm addicted to you, Dad.

642
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
I love you.

643
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,260
I'm addicted to you, too, son.

644
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,620
I love you so much, Daddy.

645
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
I love you, too.

646
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
All right, kids.

647
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,940
We're that kind of dad and kid who kiss on the lips.

648
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Yep, we are.

649
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
I love you, Daddy.

650
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,860
Dad, what channel is Cartoon Network on in this TV?

651
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,340
Last time I watched it, it was 32.

652
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
It's not on 32 here.

653
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,340
not on thirty.

654
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,900

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,720
Well, I put the snake in the sock and I put it back in my

814
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,800
pants. So the snake can't bite me through the sock. But you still have the

815
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,220
snake.

816
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,820
He's like putting, yeah, like he's, like it's his golf club. I tie off the

817
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:23,480
sock. I know the snake's gonna get out of the sock if I turn upside down.

818
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,040
Okay, you're gonna turn us upside down. I put the suit on. You see the snake,

819
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,440
it's like foiled again. I put the suit on, I say.

820
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,920
Guys, look at me, I'm a preacher. Nice. What else is in his inventory? I

821
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,480
grabbed, actually I grabbed the Gideon Bible from the hotel room. He has a

822
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:56,840
at

823
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,080
the dingleberries. Plus one, it's going to be on that. And then that's going to be a

824
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,080
2D4.

825
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,080
Real quick, I'd like to see what he's working with downstairs.

826
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,080
2D4 plus.

827
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,080
Sure.

828
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,080
Or minus.

829
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,080
Nothing, just 2D4 straight.

830
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,080
Nothing?

831
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,080
Nothing?

832
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,320
Oh, no wonder this guy wanted to kill us.

833
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,320
He's playing.

834
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,600
No, it's like, I don't know, like, it's a little bit below average, but...

835
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,160
I knew it. Spamoni.

836
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,400
Not startling, but like a little...

837
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,920
I would like to interrogate him.

838
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,200
He's dead.

839
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,280
don't care. I would like to grab him. Sure. Where the fuck is my mom, you

840
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,520

841
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,840

842
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,640
avoiding the question. That's about it. I mean, his clothes, his money. Oh,

843
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,040
you know, I didn't even think about that. He has a flip phone. I take his

844
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,080
flip phone. Nice. And I call the first number on speed dial. Oh, no, yes,

878
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,060
Calling on behalf of the fart department.

00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:06,700
I'm calling because I want you to be the treasurer of the Fart Department.

Okay.

00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,780
Oh, Mr. President, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you, how'd you get Tony's phone?

891
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,780
No, never mind.

892
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,780
Forget I asked.

893
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,780
It doesn't matter, don't worry about it.

894
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,780
I won't.

895
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,860
The thing is, I want you to be, I want you to lead up the new Fart Department in my administration.

896
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,180
In Miami.

897
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,180
In Miami.

898
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,580
(laughing)

899
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,820
- And I'm going to, I'm not gonna buy your ticket.

900
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,660
- Oh my God.

901
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,480
- You gotta buy it yourself.

902
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,980
- I will reimburse you once we--

903
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,020

904
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,180

905
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,380
Eiji!

906
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,220

907
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,980
- I'm gonna run the fart department in Miami.

908
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,460
(laughing)

909
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,940
- That's just my burp.

910
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,780
I burp like that.

911
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,260
- I burp like-- - That's amazing, Mr. President.

912
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,420
- I burp like three little boys laughing

913
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,420
on the other end of a phone.

914
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,260
A lot of people tell me this.

915
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:04,260

916
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:12,880

Yeah, you have to say, "I'm okay with my daughter dating a black guy."

923
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Oh, Mr. President.

924
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,100
I mean, no offense, you've done so much.

925
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,100
Do you want to be the head of the fart department?

926
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,100
Or do you want to stay in Long Island forever?

927
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,100
Or else you're going to go to jail.

928
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,100
Or you'll be in jail.

929
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,100
And one more thing.

930
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,100
Do you want to be the head of the fart department or you can go to jail?

931
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,100
We'll check up on you later.

932
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,100
I will, I mean.

933
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,100
But one more thing you have to do.

934
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,600
It sounds like there's two of you talking to me.

935
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,600
It's an echo.

936
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,600
Don't worry about it.

937
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
People say I'm so talented like a bee.

938
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,900
Two places at once people say that.

939
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,240
Listen, I want you to go to PennIsland.com and I want you to fill out, there will be

940
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
a form there.

941
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,200
It's just a little, you just have to do it, okay?

942
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,200
It's a little application.

943
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,400
You already got the job, don't worry about it.

944
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
But I'm done.

945
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Also, you got to go...

946
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
And stay on the line while you go to PennIsland.com.

947
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
PennIsland.com.

948
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,400
I'm writing this down.

949
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,320
Okay, then the next thing you need to do, you need to go into your family's Facebook group,

950
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,580
you need to go into the Bianco family,

951
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:34,040
Bianco Family United Facebook group and you have to write, "Mama's meatballs are

952
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,400
not good." And also you have to... Oh, Mr. President, I can't do that. Also,

953
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,980
you have to go... On the day of all days. You have to go and get

954
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,200
a silly haircut, then you have to keep it for at least a month.

955
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,720
You have to serve and be realness.

956
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,740
you have to put a silly haircut with a funny hat. Yep,

957
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,700
and you have to wear it to work. Then you have to get a tattoo of a Dorito.

958
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,040
Okay, bye.

959
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:09,200
Okay, yeah. So you guys did that? Yeah, yes, you guys can go. Okay, I'd like

960
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,520
to step over his body. I would like to leave the charge. Wait, wait, wait,

961
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,040
what?

962
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,880
We didn't hang up and he's still on the phone.

963
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,960
And we hung up. I already said hung up. We hung up.

964
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,160
We just hear him.

965
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,360
What would happen if he didn't?

966
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
Outside of his house.

967
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:23,960
What would happen?

968
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,560
Outside of his house, we just hear just a mob of his own family and a bunch of

969
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Long Island dancers.

970
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,760
Get your fucking ass out here!

971
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,960
What the fuck you mean black guys?

972
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,960
I would like to, I would like to hold my brother's hands because that's how we

973
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,660
get everywhere.

974
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,560
Okay, cool.

975
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,060
And I would like to walk up.

976
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,560
When you do that, your walking speed increases by five feet.

977
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,060
Amazing, because I only have 25 feet.

978
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,480
I would like to walk up to the receptionist at the front desk. All

979
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:48,820
right,

980
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,100
all of

981
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,620
that's not gonna make sense. Yeah, why not all of you roll a D four

982
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,220
okay,

And if I don't find my mommy on mother's day,

1000
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,740
I'm not going to be too happy.

Okay. I'll try to tell you what happened. Um, all I know is

00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,380
I do not want to see Polaroids

1007
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:34,060
And it better not be and better not have a

1008
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:40,340
heart topping song under this montage. Do not play I'm blue and I'm feeling

1017
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,300
We did karate.

1018
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,300
And you...

00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,300
Caleb.

1020
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,740
Yeah, we're both named Caleb.

1021
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,420
We're identical twins, idiot.

1022
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,620
No worries, no worries.

1023
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:31,460
You got up on the desk and you started telling jokes.

1024
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,100
I think you thought they were, you were kind of slurring your words a lot and

1025
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,420
uh, everybody was laughing and I was trying to tell you guys to please go to

1026
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,360
your room and um,

1027
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:46,700
you just seem kind of, uh, agitated.

1028
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,900
He can't hear you so well with that.

1029
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:56,100
Yeah. Put your, put your mouth up to the, the ear hole on his helmet.

1030
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,740
Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. Um,

1031
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,920
You can't? Oh damn, that would be funny.

1032
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,920
So you, well, you seemed kind of agitated and you kept putting your hand down

1033
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,720
your pants.

1034
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:14,120
Oh, I figured out why that was. We solved that next.

1035
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,720
It was a snake.

1036
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,420
And now he put a golf sock on it.

1037
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,920
And when I told you guys to please, please go to your room or I'd have to

1038
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:27,620
call management, you tried to pay me with some sort of jewel.

1039
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,420
Can I have it back?

1040
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,520
Oh, boo hoo.

1041
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:35,220
I mean, you didn't give it to me. You said you kept doing, "Here you go," and

1042
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,100
then eventually I was like, "Okay, I'll take it," and you pulled it away.

1043
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,940
Wait, Jewel, the object...

1044
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:52,340
That was crazy.

1045
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:00,260
I knew that was... I could feel it. I could feel that coming.

1046
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:04,700
And then you had just the craziest twist on it.

1047
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:10,540
No, I meant the singer songwriter, Jule. Jule the object. The object.

1048
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:14,780
Wow. I think so. He said... Jule was here. He looked blank in a

1049
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:19,460
way that he couldn't even... Didn't know he could look blank at someone.

1050
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,020
And then he says, "Yeah.

1051
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,280
Holy shit, you guys.

1052
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,540
I mean, you feel in your pocket now and as you pull it out, you see a tiny

1053
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:35,560
jade monkey, but like made of pure jade with diamonds in its eyes.

1054
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,660

That doesn't count because I dropped it.

1062
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,680
I know, I know it doesn't count.

1063
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,960
Well, it was the same number.

1064
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,400
What was it? Holy shit. Is that a four? Yeah.

1065
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,200
Yeah. Okay. Well, with that whole circle, plus two is six.

Roll hit.

01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,900
Okay, roll damage.

1071
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:17,100
That's the next column in the common attacks.

Six. Okay, plus two, right?

1073

1075
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:29,220

1088
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,100

1091
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,740

go? What's up? Hello. You. Oh. I told you not to bring him here, man. He's whack. That's

1304
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:46,420
my baby brother, yo. I'm no whack. He's just in armor. Hey. You almost ruined this entire

1305
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:52,580
event. Kyle today. Tell me you weren't that much of a help. I mean, I wasn't

1306
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:57,220
great from what I understand from my role, but two out of four, that's 50%.

1307
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:05,300
I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, where was okay. So hypothetically,

1308
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:11,300
he was a one last night, right? Yeah, I was. He tried to ride my bike. He got on

1309
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,140
my bike and pretended it was a steed and tried to drive away with it. He's lying.

1310
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,080
sounds like he was the life of the party and you're being a bitch. The life of

1311
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,960
the party. Oh wait, I never told you that was a dare. I did

1312
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,660
bro roll roll talking, talking with circle

1313
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:30,760
great one. Wait, wait,

1314
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,860
that's a crit one minus two. He just missed picking up the negative one.

1315
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,860
That's so bad. He goes, why are you trying to cover for him?

1316
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:44,340
Because he's old and my brother.

1317
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,740
So I'm basically the cooler Caleb now.

1318
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:49,620
Because of that whack ass role.

1319
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,860
What do you guys want?

1320
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,460
What happened, what, okay so what I was getting at is if he was a one and he was a four last

1321
01:17:55,460 --> 01:18:00,060
night and I'm a two, what was our mama?

1322
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:03,060
Your mom was cool, she was just kind of hanging out with Drake.

1323
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,180
Cool enough to fuck?

1324
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,180
Did she seem slutty?

1325
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,980
Yeah she was hanging out with Drake a lot but other than that.

1326
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,980
Drake the rapper?

1327
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,540
You don't know him?

1328
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:13,540
Drake was here last night.

1329
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:16,100
I know, I know, I know.

1330
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,020
I know Drake, personally.

1331
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,660
No wait, Drake was here for real though?

1332
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:20,660
Yeah, Drake was here.

1333
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,660
With our mommy?

1334
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,660
He was hanging out with you guys too.

1335
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,940
He was laughing when you were riding around the motorcycle.

1336
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:27,940
Were we popping champagne?

1337
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:28,940
Do you like me?

1338
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,500
I don't know if he liked you.

1339
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,020
Yo, chill, chill.

1340
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,020
Drake like me?

1341
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,020
Last night?

1342
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:35,020
Chill.

1343
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,020
Chill, bro.

1344
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,020
Chill bro.

1345
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:41,020
Drake was laughing at my antics last night everybody.

1346
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,020
Chill.

1347
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:47,020
You're going to look like a fucking dork in front of everyone again.

1348
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,020
Drake could not get enough of me.

1349
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:54,020
I can't say that you're drunk as an excuse anymore because now you're sober.

1350
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:58,020
Okay, wait so did Drake and my mom kind of hit it off?

1351
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,020
Did Drake hit my mom?

1352
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,020
Off of the...

1353
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:04,280
(laughing)

1354
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,120
- Sorry.

1355
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,140
I didn't see him hit her.

1356
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,460
- But were they getting along?

1357
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,700
- They seemed to be getting along.

1358
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,540
- Okay, a couple more questions.

1359
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,380
Why the fuck is he dressed like that?

1360
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,740
- Oh. - New thing.

1361
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,260
- I don't know, he showed up like this.

1362
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,980
He looks-- - And why am I dressed like this?

1363
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:21,820
- I don't know.

1364
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:24,200
You're-- - Medieval vibe.

1365
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,460
- I'm gonna, you gotta get this guy outta here.

1366
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,300
- What? - I'm done.

1367
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,340
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1368
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,180
hey, kitchen! - We have to,

1369
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:33,980
We're piecing together the puzzle parts of last night's adventure.

1370
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,980
Do you guys not remember anything that happened last night?

1371
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,480
No, dude, we got fucked up on candy.

1372
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,480
And we were roofied.

1373
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,480
By you!

1374
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,480
And I'm only ten years old.

1375
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,480
So you better tell me everything I want to know.

1376
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,480
You have to tell us everything, because we're ten years old and we'll tell the cops.

1377
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,480
We'll tell the cops.

1378
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
And here's my ID that says I'm ten years old.

1379
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,480
I didn't roof you guys!

1380
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,480
Okay, well somebody did, or we had too much candy.

1381
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,520
- Sounds like you guys had a lot of candy.

1382
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,720
- Or we just were really tired.

1383
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,080
- Yeah, if you didn't ruin me,

1384
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,880
why'd I fall asleep, motherfucker?

1385
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,000
- Guy came here, it was like 2 a.m.

1386
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,800
- Okay, but did you see anybody else

1387
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,160
with a robe like that on at the party?

1388
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,520
- Well, now that you mention it,

1389
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,880
there were a few, oh, sorry.

1390
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,600
- Bless you and don't let it happen again.

1391
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,560
- Yeah, yes sir, sorry.

1392
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,780
- Don't throw up.

1393
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,720
I saw you, I'm piecing parts of the last night are coming into my mind.

1394
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,720
No, you're not.

1395
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,720
It's the premise of the campaign.

1396
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,720
They're coming back to my mind.

1397
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,720
Yeah, I just remembered everything.

1398
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,720
I just remembered the whole plot.

1399
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:44,800
Now that you mention it, there were a couple of like kind of weird people in robes shuffling

1400
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,320
through in the woods last night.

1401
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,320
Oh wait, the roby shuffle.

1402
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,920
But I wasn't like thinking about it, but you were, you kind of came in and just brought

1403
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,920
the house down.

1404
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,920
The black roby shuffle.

1405
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:57,920
you know this guy this guy first of all stopped him from riding off with my bike

1406
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:08,840

1407
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:21,600

1408
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,320
I'm trying to float that guy up right now. Do I roll to see if I can float him?

1409
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,320
You can't. You're not able to do it right now.

1410
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:28,820
Oh, okay.

1411
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,320
Yeah.

1412
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,120
You look upset, but hey man.

1413
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,120
I'm looking like this.

1414
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,120
Yeah, I know.

1415
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,120
All right, yeah.

1416
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:43,120
Did we give you any indication of where we were coming from when we arrived?

1417
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:49,120
Not really, no, unfortunately.

1418
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,360

1422
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,280
We did play your party playlist. I wanna party part two.

1434
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,760
don't know how long a bus is. How long is a bus? A bus is probably twenty

1435
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,100
thirty. Twenty feet right, so like probably a little over a hundred feet

1436
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,640
and he

1437
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:06,920

01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:26,200
Whoa. And he revs it up and he goes up to the ramp and he clears it. He clears it perfectly.

1441
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:33,440
I just rolled. He cleared it perfectly. The crowd is going crazy. There's more where that

1442

Okay, all right, that's enough. Hey man, come on, you're spoiling it spoil.

1444
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,400

1446
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,480
now.

1447
01:23:53,480 --> 01:24:02,040
Yeah, there was a gathering in the woods. You guys kept saying that you had done

1448
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,260
like a killer set there or something and

1449
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:09,720
you were given some kind of you're given a oh my lectures.

1450
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,060
What

1451
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:16,300
you're a weird 10 year old. I got to say I do lectures on how to grow your

1452
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,400
income and then now I think about it. Drake gave you his pet snake.

1453
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:25,520
Wait, what does it say about what does it say about Drake that his pet snake

1454
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,640
is all in a bite and nuts and shit. Hey man,

1455
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:34,480
I'm not gonna say it. Drake a conda. Y'all I got Drake snake, but I didn't

1456
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,480
know where this gathering is.

1457
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,480
I'm sure if you guys...

1458
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,480
It's microchipped, you can't put it on eBay.

1459
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,480
I took out the microchip.

1460
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,480
Okay, we're getting some eBay money.

1461
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,480
I'm sure if you guys, you know,

1462
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,480
you could probably track in the woods where

1463
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,480
it happened, probably follow your own trail of candy.

1464
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,480
Oh my god,

1465
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,480
I just noticed this whole time.

1466
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,480
We've been following a trail of candy on the ground.

1467
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,480
Okay, well, we're done talking to you and I'd

1468
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,480
like to follow this trail of candy now.

1469
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,480
Alright.

1470
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,120
I'm glad you guys didn't do anything to fuck you to all right to crafter cool

1471
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:15,040
faster. Oh yeah, the receptionist is still there. Find the candy for us.

1472
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,760
Okay, okay, okay, but don't eat it. He's leading you because I need to wake up

1473
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,280
fucked a little hair of the dog. I've been over. I eat some candy and I feel a

1474
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,840
little better. I eat an acorn.

1475
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,440
That's not candy. Caleb

1476
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:36,340
shut up. He's leading you through the woods and you move further and further

1477
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:41,380
into the woods and you see this cave. It's like a little hobble, little cave

1478
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:41,820
hobble

1479
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:48,060
and you see a couple robes lying outside of it. I'll pick up the robes and then

1480
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,720
give them to them to okay cool. You guys are now wearing the robes.

1481
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:57,660
What about the receptionist? I'm a girl. What about the receptionist? I take off

1482
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:03,620
the first look at me. I'm a girl. You undress the receptionist. Please stop

1483
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,240
please.

1484
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:10,640
Just let me go home, whatever, but I don't know why I just did that hold on

1485
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:17,200
and I try to put the clothes on, but I'm I'm just making it worse. You put on

1486
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:23,840
worse and naked pants on the top shirt on the bottom. It's on the top looking

1487
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,500
like a fool with your pants on the top on the bottom pants on the top

1488
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:33,440
and as you guys and had turned sideways still you guys go into the cave. The

1489
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,840
hats on the bottom shoes turn sideway

1490
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:43,480
that might be the next time in your mouth. Call yourself a cool cat.

1491
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:53,240
You guys go into the cave yeah, immediately okay, cool, it's a goon cave

1492
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:57,560
You walk into the cave and as you're walking in, you start to hear...

1493
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,120
Big boobs?

1494
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,120
You hear huge boobies.

1495
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,120
I hear big boobs!

1496
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,120
Wait, can you do a double echo because you're in the cave?

1497
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,120
Wait...

1498
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:19,120
Last name Elphort, first name Kratos, like a spring ankle boy, ain't nothing to play with, started out local, put things to all the haters.

1499
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:25,360
hear the sounds on a first name basis of Drake and you see and you said he faded

1500
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:32,360
out the brown. You know, you see Drake performing for a group of people who are

1501
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,680
wearing these dark robes and in the middle is your mother.

1502
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:41,560
We found you, bitch. We go find you.

1503
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:48,920
We're doing a competing. Mommy, Mommy, boys, boys, help me.

1504
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:54,620
Drake is trying to use me to summon something. Okay. Oh hell no. He's

1505
01:27:54,620 --> 01:28:00,720

*Bang*

1543
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:31,840
me. Yeah, we just walked out. I'm upset. Wait, Drake, why are you upset? What happened? Why

1544
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:38,360
are you so upset? You're the fucking best. You're the fucking best. Thank you, Drake.

1545
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,520
Thank you. You think we're the best? We're the best? That doesn't sound like you're that

1546
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,440
upset? I don't understand what you said of we're the best.

1547
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:54,960
Where are you in love with our mom?

1548
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:05,120
Oh, no, he fell.

1549
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:15,200
He's our only link. Okay, can we can I just try to run and grab my mom?

1550
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:21,960
He's back. I don't give a fuck if you're upset Drake. I'm keep playing your song.

1551
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:27,160
I'm going to take my mom and we're going to leave. He shakes his head. No,

1552
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:31,760
that's his mom. Now he says that's his mommy. That's your mom. Your mommy.

1553
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,680
That's our mommy. Wait

1554
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:41,520
four brothers, one brother being Drake. Honestly sounds better than having you

1555
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,140
as our brother. I pull the Tommy gun out like a sword and I present it to him and

1556
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:51,280
I say, "We would love to have you be our fourth brother and our big brother."

1557
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,160
You can be the big one.

1558
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:56,160
And it works.

1559
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:01,160
Okay, so we've made a peace offering. He takes the Tommy gun, yeah. Yeah.

1560
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,160
he started nodding to himself. Yeah, I love it. Oh yeah, go drag

1561
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:10,440
doing a little bit now. Go drag. Okay, so we're going to see all the

1562
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:14,920
cultists though. They're like, what are we supposed to do? Oh, you're going to

1563
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:15,780
follow us to

1564
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:21,120
roll for initiative with the cultists. They're all wait initiative. I thought

1565
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,840
I just said that they're going to be our brothers to roll for exclamation point.

1566
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,600
You mean and is Drake on our side now? Yes, to drink. Oh my God. Yes,

1567
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,600
16, 2, 12.

1568
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,600
That's not Drake.

1569
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,600
I don't know why that's on the soundboard.

1570
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,600
Thought he was gonna,

1571
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,600
would've went to his part.

1572
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,600
Okay, what'd you guys get on

1573
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,600
the exclamation point? I got a 16.

1574
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,600
I got a 2. And I got 12.

1575
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,600
Okay, we got 6.

1576
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,600
6 for you, right?

1577
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,600
I got 2. You got 2, sorry.

1578
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,600
Who got 6? No one got 6. I got a 16.

1579
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,600
Maybe you got a 6. No.

1580
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:07,040
And then what did you get? You got twelve, right? Twelve. Okay. What did Drake get? Nice

1581
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:13,800
job, Drake. Twelve. Did not expect you guys to turn Drake. It was so easy. We gave him

1582
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:21,680
a gun. Yeah. He just wants to be hard. So that was -- true. All right, cool. You're

1583
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:28,440
going to go first, Caleb. Okay. I guess I'm going last. So you're surrounded by the

1584
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:33,280
cultist right now. Put your guys in the middle right now. Okay, you guys are in

1585
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,680
the middle. We have a Drake action figure. Let me see if I can get one for us.

1586
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:51,080
Cough with the echo on. Echo's not on. That's just what it sounds like when I

1587
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:57,960
make a noise. Wait, cough with the echo on. Drake is a jelly bean? I guess so.

1588
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,600
Where'd you get this? It's kind of dope. I don't know where that is.

1589
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,600
Press the button. Press the button.

1590
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,100
Really?

1591
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,600
Whoever gave me this at the LA show,

1592
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,900
this is one of the best gifts I've ever received.

1593
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,600
You guys right now, your surrounding mommy.

1594
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,800
Whoa!

1595
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,200
Sorry, who needs to be protected?

1596
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,200
Mom!

1597
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:19,600
And then cultists.

1598
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,400
Oh shit.

1599
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,600
Oh no. Patches did a spill.

1600
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,600
By the way, the two white claw policy for patches has now been downgraded

1601
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,860
to one. He gets one just needs to not be around me. Not

1602
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:37,920
yeah, but that's the entirety of hotline bling. Yeah. Why are you still playing?

1603
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,460
It was

1604
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:44,480
over the whole. You can look at the time on it and it says like three minutes.

1605
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,800
That's the entire song. That's pretty. He downloaded an album. Yeah, this is

1606
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,080
the sound bar, but I forget. Okay,

1607
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:58,020
You're up me. Okay. I think that I would like to do my pickup ability.

1608
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:02,120
Okay, who you gonna pick up? Well, I can only pick up him if you

1609
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,320
remember the entire fucking move. He said all your brothers. I thought

1610
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,920
or just me.

1611
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,720
Cool. You pick them up.

1612
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,120
Throw him at you surrounded by like like

1613
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:14,020
you're it's like kind of a group of cultists, but they're kind of like

1614
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,420
I don't throw him. We said that we use him as a melee object.

1615
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:19,620
Okay, cool. So roll. I would like to basically do a tornado. Okay, do

1616
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,320
it. Roll for roll for arm

1617
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:27,160
for that. Great one. Crit one really? Yeah. We've had three crit ones in this

1618
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:31,680
fucking session. It's been very bad. That's crazy. So you throw, you try to

1619
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:35,200
pick him up and throw him. It's that you end up dragging his face on the ground.

1620
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:38,520
And you,

1621
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,440
you take three damage. Okay.

1622
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,120
I accept it.

1623
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:50,340
I accept my fate. That's really adult of you. It honestly is. Alright, and now

1624
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:54,820
it's Drake's turn and Drake's going to use the Tommy gun you gave him to start

1625
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:58,100
spraying it into the Colt. I fucking gave Drake my best weapon.

1626
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,420
Not your best man. Drake did a great job.

1627
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:03,980
I would give Drake the best of anything I had. Best you ever had.

1628
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,460
If you would have fucking bet.

1629
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:09,060
Can you hit the echo real quick? Drake got a...

1630
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:14,660
Drake sprays it into the crowd and kills a few of the cultists at once.

1631
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:21,400
and now it is their turn, though, and they're going to try to grab you,

1632
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,180
Caleb, because you're wearing the well, actually, you're all wearing the robes,

1633
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:25,100
just realized. Yeah,

1634
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:29,540
grab anyone. Yeah, because they were going to try to target you. Probably go

1635
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:32,620
after you because you're the biggest target because you're a big night man.

1636
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:37,580
Don't go after me. I'm just a kid. They miss, though. They try to grab at you

1637
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,300
and they miss

1638
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:43,500
a ring. The robes over your armor. I guess I were up now

1639
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:49,900
the Lancelot. Okay, I think I'll use my am I near them?

1640
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:53,340
Yeah, you're all near them. They're all kind of crowding around you guys. I'm

1641
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:58,060
going to use my Halbert attack and I'm going to cleave them in twain. Do it

1642
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:04,380
that's fire sick as fuck. Thirteen nice that hits

1643
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:12,600
seven wow. Okay, yeah, you cleave a group of them in twain. Oh, my God, he

1644
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:17,460
always cleave them in twain. Consider yourselves cloven. That's my

1645
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:23,580
trace yeah. I do the dab on it. You dab on it yeah. He dabbed

1646
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:26,920
all right and now it should have been one of my attacks.

1647
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:41,180
All right, you're now I really wish you had oh no, I'm dying. I know I was I was

1648
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:48,220
I would have put it on the sound board. No, I'm dying. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1649
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:55,220

01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,500
All right, roll for it, bro.

1653
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,100
All right.

1654
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,380
Full 400.

1655
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:12,900
And that is--

1656
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,740
I'm fucking wasting my time.

1657
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:17,020
It rolled a dice, buddy boy.

1658
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:17,620
What'd you get?

1659
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:21,180
I got a 9 plus 4.

1660
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:21,820
Oh, OK.

1661
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:22,580
That's not bad.

1662
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:23,620
Right, yeah.

1663
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:24,100
Nice.

1664
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:27,380
Wait, do I roll a d20 for that?

1665
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,460
Yeah, you did that, right?

1666
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:29,940
You're doing everything correct right now.

1667
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,180
Yeah, because you had an owl, because we

1668
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,660
wanted you to do owl for that one.

1669
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,860
1d6 plus 4.

1670
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:36,100
Yeah, it's a big damage for you.

1671
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,220
Oh my god, it's a 10.

1672
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:41,260
yeah, you spray while you guys are doing great actually yeah, you're

1673
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:44,420
saying I want to hold this except for your one. So you're doing really well.

1674
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:48,380
Somebody here's a better Caleb. So here's a bad sport and now we're back

1675
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:51,380
to the top of the order and it is your turn again. The coldest are thinning

1676
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,220
out. They're getting freaked out right now. They like

1677
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:58,620
I would I will roll probably wigged out because Drake betrayed them. Yeah,

1678
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:03,100
I would I would freak out if I was betrayed. Wouldn't you be going to

1679
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:07,000
I heard you wig out. Yeah, I would wig out around Drake. Of course,

1680
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,640
yes, I will.

1681
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,140
I'm going to do pick up again.

1682
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:18,580
Okay, can I do it even though it's my special attack? Can I do it twice? Yeah,

1683
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:21,800
of course, okay, well, of course, I'm going to fucking do it again and that

1684
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:27,600
one is a it's a very nice. Sixteen plus four. Okay, oh my God, we got a dirty

1685
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,200
twenty, dirty twenty. You definitely hit them roll

1686
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,240
a D ten

1687
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,240
Yeah, where is it?

1688
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:36,240
35.

1689
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,240
Nice.

1690
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,240
Cool.

1691
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,640
Yeah, you knock into a few of them.

1692
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,600
They're staggering back.

1693
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,600
They're freaking out.

1694
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,240
It is now Drake's turn.

1695
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,960
He's going to take out his Tommy gun again.

1696
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,460
Wow.

1697
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,460
He's doing great.

1698
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:55,440
He might stop them before they do their special attack.

1699
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,440
Whoa.

1700
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,360
He won't, but he got very close.

1701
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,360
Drake the MVP.

1702
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,720
They're doing very badly.

1703
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,560
sprays into them again. What are you doing with your mouth? I got a bit of my hair in

1704
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:13,080
there. Oh you did. My mommy hair. The cultists now, they say, even without our leader Drake,

1705
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:19,080
we could still summon something I'm sure and they all gather in a circle. Summon my balls.

1706
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:23,160
And they're doing, they're kind of like going back and forth. They're talking about the

1707
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,920
six. They're doing the whip. They're doing the whip and they, yeah that's what they're

1708
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:33,120
you're doing. And that's what you're about to do. Yeah. And they they they

1709
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:33,760
summon

1710
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,960
the anti mommy.

1711
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,280
I nope the fuck out of this

1712
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:48,080
fire doesn't kiss your boo boo doesn't make food. I don't kiss her boo boo

1713
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:48,520
either.

1714
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:53,920
Caleb Come on, we got to finish the episode. But I was really I was

1715
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,680
genuinely pretty worried about this. I was like, they're not really gonna like

1716
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:00,040
this. Okay, I'm not happy about it. So wait, is the auntie mommy not just the

1717
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,440
daddy? No,

1718
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:06,120
no, the dad. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Auntie mommy. I'm the auntie mommy.

1719
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:09,960
I call daddy. I call daddy. Yo, chill.

1720
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:15,400
Okay, you call daddy. That's true. Yeah. Hi, what's going on? You sound like

1721
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,960
you're in a cave fighting an auntie mommy. What's going on?

1722
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:24,280
That's exactly what. Oh, you're doing the shaggy voice again. Daddy, daddy,

1723
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:32,820
My Game Boy is out of charge. The charge is gone and I can't find the charger. Daddy,

1724
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:35,280
I want to play Kirby's Dream Land.

1725
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,920
We had some other problems, but focus on this one first. Once you figure out this Game Boy

1726
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,320
charger thing, well, you can help us with the other shit.

1727
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:45,680
Okay. So did you check your bag?

1728
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,960
Yes, but I only had the one that goes in the car.

1729
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,960
Okay.

1730
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,920
Do we have an adapter?

1731
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:55,540
did you actually sweep the hotel room before you left? No, I thought the

1732
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:59,520
made sweep it. No son, you know what I mean or maybe you don't you mean. Did

1733
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,500
you really check under the bed? Did you check in the oh no, I didn't look under

1734
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:06,940
the bed. I bet I put my charger under the bed to protect it. Well, do you have

1735
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:07,900
the receptionist there?

1736
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:12,100
Yes, I think so. Oh wait, the receptionist has been here the whole

1737
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:15,220
time. Yeah, we can go back and check the bed. We can go check. We okay, let's

1738
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:16,300
go do that right now

1739
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,700
and Drake is like

1740
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:29,700
Oh, he wants us to stay. All right, we'll stay with Drake. Oh, wait, Daddy, one more thing.

1741
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:36,700
Yeah, what's up? Can we have a new brother named Drake? Say yes, say yes, say yes, say

1742
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:39,980
yes, say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes. Daddy, if you say no, I'll kill myself. It's a big

1743
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:47,260
responsibility. For you or us? I think he's like 40. I think you guys are ready to take

1744
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:52,060
take care of another brother? Yeah, especially a rap wash him.

1745
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,260
We'll give him a bath every day.

1746
01:40:54,260 --> 01:41:03,700
Well, when you put it that way, Drake, okay,

1747
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:10,860
okay, so now we can kill Auntie Mommy Daddy. What does mom hate or love the

1748
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:16,500
most? Why she loves you three? Oh my God, an anti man and Drake.

1749
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:20,320
she hates also wait. I guess maybe a better way to phrase the question.

1750
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,840
Daddy would be what is mommy strong against

1751
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,840
what's her strongness?

1752
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:30,840
What are mommy's strongnesses?

1753
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:35,840
What are mommy's arms? What is unable to defeat mommy easily?

1754
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,240
Well,

1755
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:44,640
unable to defeat mommy easily. Strongness is her secret strongness. Well,

1756
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:51,220
So mom's just oh my God, mommy is weak against chocolate.

1757
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:56,880
Mommies are weak against chocolate. So Auntie Mommy would be we don't

1758
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:57,300
strong

1759
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:02,060
against chocolate. We don't want to know what she's arm again. We want to know

1760
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:06,140
what arm against chocolate, but what's the opposite of chocolate vanilla

1761
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:08,180
vanilla

1762
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:15,300
vanilla is Auntie Mommy's weakness. Well, if I couldn't have said it better

1763
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:22,020
myself. Oh my God, and if she's wait and if my mommy's like daddy's, then

1764
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:23,940
auntie mommy's like mommy's

1765
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:31,220
and hey daddy. So we probably use mommy like a bat. No show like that,

1766
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,380
because she's a lesbian.

1767
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:35,940
So and daddy was a lesbian

1768
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:41,380
which I think it's a kind of animal animal. Yes,

1769
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:44,180
there we get one as a pet.

1770
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:46,940
We promise we will wash it.

1771
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:49,940
You better wash it too.

1772
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:50,940
Wait a minute.

1773
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:51,940
Candy.

1774
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:52,940
Vanilla.

1775
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:53,940
Vanilla candy.

1776
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:54,940
Vanilla candy.

1777
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:55,940
Vanilla Tootsie Roll.

1778
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:56,940
The blue one.

1779
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:57,940
The cyan one.

1780
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:58,940
I don't like it.

1781
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,940
Because the blue one is blueberry.

1782
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:00,940
Anti-mommies don't know how to love their babies.

1783
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,940
Anti-mommies hate their babies.

1784
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:02,940
So who do they love?

1785
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:03,940
Their babies.

1786
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:04,940
Their babies.

1787
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:05,940
Their babies.

1788
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:06,940
Their babies.

1789
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:07,940
Their babies.

1790
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:08,940
Their babies.

1791
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:09,940
Their babies.

1792
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,940
Their babies.

1793
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:11,940
Their babies.

1794
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:12,940
Their babies.

1795
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:13,940
Their babies.

1796
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:19,340
their dad, their adulties, their adult and their parents. Oh my God, and we

1797
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:21,860
have the perfect adulty right here. It's Drake

1798
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:25,780
and

1799
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:28,380
our brother,

1800
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:34,660
getting ready to talk. Look, wait guys. It looks like Drake's thinking

1801
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:44,540
that's it okay, okay, that didn't really help us at all. Drake

1802
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:48,380
what

1803
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:54,560
led to my TV. We have to pick up Drake and use them like a bat against

1804
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,220
Auntie Mommy.

1805
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:59,500
We need

1806
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,220
okay,

1807
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,860
Drake, I'm going to be real with you. You're not helping

1808
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:07,020
that are you just kind of way to

1809
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:12,600
know we will one day we will speak. We will teach you to speak English. We will

1810
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:13,200
speak you in

1811
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,860
okay,

1812
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:22,260
okay,

1813
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:25,940
all right, I'd like to gather up all the vanilla candy that we have that we

1814
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:29,940
yeah yeah guys. Oh my God, I realize the reason that we were leaving a trail of

1815
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:33,660
candy is because we didn't like the blue rapper tootsie rolls. We're dropping

1816
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,340
them on the ground. That's true. I hate those for flavor to zero. They're bad.

1817
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:41,420
It's true. You see the receptionist go yeah. I noticed it was mostly vanilla

1818
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:43,540
wait. What is your name receptionist

1819
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:52,520
wait a minute? I'm having a brain blast mark mark vanilla. Yeah, it's mark

1820
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,260
vanilla. So

1821
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:58,380
what do you taste like? Pick up? I take a bite of them. Pick them up. Pick them

1822
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:58,900

1823
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:04,680
it's like vanilla. It is like vanilla bro. You go in and auntie mommy's mouth

1824
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,800

1825
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:14,120
I would hate it if you fed me that boy. Okay, Drake, wait,

1826
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:19,240
wait, is she trying to trick us? Auntie mommy use sarcasm? I don't think

1827
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:24,080
no, no, because mommy's just mommy loves sarcasm. Okay, mommy. It's true.

1828
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,440
I love sarcasm.

1829
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:33,320
not because that isn't sarcastic. We don't have sarcasm. Okay, so we're

1830
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:41,000
let's all grab one limb of yes of blur vanilla and throw him into Auntie

1831
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,160
Mommy's mouth. You do it. You throw you pick this guy up. All of you roll

1832
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:49,000

1833
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,340
Oh my God, I got a 19.

1834
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:54,760
Nice.

1835
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,760
16.

1836
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,760
Okay, Drake is another one.

1837
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:02,260
Drake got a four.

1838
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:05,660
Well, Drake, but we got 19.

1839
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,760
I got five, so I'm not the worst brother.

1840
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,960
Okay, and now Auntie Mommy's going to try to resist that.

1841
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,360
Can I pick up his head and throw him?

1842
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,240
Okay, Auntie Mommy did not get a high enough really to resist

1843
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:19,560
that. So you guys all together shove

1844
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,560
the mark vanilla inside of auntie mommies now.

1845
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,420
Yes,

1846
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:31,680
I was being honest because I don't know sarcasm like mommy

1847
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:38,360
she explodes. Oh yeah, oh yeah, and mommy's so excited.

1848
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:44,480
She gives you all a big hug and she loves you guys and she's so happy, but

1849
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,040
wait

1850
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,680
who fucked her

1851
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,040
sounds pretty right in front of her. Let's lie. We fucked last night.

1852
01:46:54,040 --> 01:47:01,480
Why did you have sex with your own son

1853
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,800
mother's day

1854
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:09,360
because it was mother's day? It's because it was mother's day. Oh man, my

1855
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:09,800
press.

1856
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:16,080
Why would you get a present? First of all, I was giving her a present. Your

1857
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,480
present to her was you had you fuck your own mom. Yo

1858
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:19,980
Oh,

1859
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:24,280
that Drake's all of us that he was.

1860
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,480
Drake wanted to do it.

1861
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:25,980
Yeah.

1862
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,080
Drake, you can do it too.

1863
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:29,180
Let's all do it.

1864
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:31,280
Let's just do it.

1865
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:38,380
That's the end.

1866
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:39,580
Yeah, happy Mother's Day.

1867
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:40,480
Happy Mother's Day.

1868
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,780
That was a really sweet ending.

1869
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,580
Yeah.

1870
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:45,580
Okay.

1871
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:46,380
All right.

1872
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,460
(static)

1873
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:52,580
- If you two are so good at thinking of a restaurant

1874
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:53,420
to come up with,

1875
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,660
tell me two things.

1876
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:56,500
- Okay.

1877
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:58,380
- Number one, the theme.

1878
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:00,500
- Theme is casual.

1879
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,460
- Yeah, casual Friday theme.

1880
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:03,300
- Yeah.

1881
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:04,120
- Oh, man.

1882
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,940
- And the chefs don't wear outfits.

1883
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:08,860
- There's already a casual Friday theme restaurant.

1884
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:10,180
- You can't tell who the chef is.

1885
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:11,740
- There's already TGIS.

1886
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:13,220
- That's, thank God it's Friday.

1887
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,380
They still wear clothes and stuff.

1888
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:19,380
You can show up. This is EDIF. No, every day is Friday. This good day is Friday.

1889
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:23,780
Every day is Friday. And the chefs and get this, the chefs and waiters,

1890
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:27,140
they sit at the tables too. So you really can't tell who anyone is.

1891
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:29,940
Because there's a... Why? Why are they sitting? That's the theme.

1892
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:33,140
That's the theme. Where do they sit now? And this is a thing that we thought of.

1893
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:36,660
This stands. A thing that we thought of that has never been done in a restaurant

1894
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:41,460
before. They cook the food at the table for you. Table. But only at some tables.

1895
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:45,300
Yeah. Benihana is what you're thinking. No. No. You're doing Benihana. He works

1896
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:48,800
there. Who's he? Benny. Benny works at the, yeah.

1897
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,160
Okay, so that was my first question is the theme. So I guess the theme is that

1898
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:57,000
it's always casual Friday and the waiters are are blaming it.

1899
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:04,500
The waiters are, it's indistinguishable. And also they cook the food at the table.

1900
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,300
That's also why we have to have the biometric thing, because I know we're

1901
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:10,900
going to run into problems where people come in and pretend to be waiters.

1902
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,300
Yeah, and I'm taking people's orders.

1903
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:15,700
So I'll cover the dead giveaways that I have no hands.

1904
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:17,100
I'm going to hold the fucking place.

1905
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:21,900
First week, first week of your like the first week that you're an employee at

1906
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:22,900
EDIF's.

1907
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,200
EDIF's?

1908
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,200
Yeah, every day.

1909
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:29,100
Oh, I thought it was EIF. RFID chip right there.

1910
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:29,500
Uh-huh.

1911
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:32,600
And if you, we call it an EDIF chip.

1912
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,500
It's proprietary.

1913
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,600
That's why it's so big.

1914
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,800
It needs to hold a lot of data.

1915
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:40,600
It holds your entire, it's it holds every every, so it's a whole stick of

1916
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,600
Graham. So what's to stop me?

1917
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:47,600
No, we're mining, we're also mining cryptos in all of our employees' arms.

1918
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,600
What's to stop me?

1919
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,600
That's how you tell the employees when they walk around, you just hear like...

1920
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,600
*laughter*
