And my neighbor...

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Life has gotten so weird in the past three weeks.

I know.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Can you believe it's still March?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Can you believe...

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Dude, the horrors of April have yet to come.

It's a calm yeah, well when this comes out it is April just it's not March. It's true. That's

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
So yeah, my there's no quiet room in my house. I'm at staying in my mom's house

The walls and ceilings and floors are very thin every you can hear everybody at all times

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,600
So I can't record a podcast in there

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,240
So I'm sitting in the backseat of my mom's car in front of

Parked in front of our house and our neighbor just came out and looked at me

You guys, have they said you have to stay inside yet?

00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,920
- I don't think so.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,200
I don't think they will.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
They said they strongly suggested it,

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,020
but there's no shelter in place.

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,960
- We're Boston strong, we can't get in.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,480
- Yeah, 'cause if you guys have to stay locked inside,

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,920
the Sarnaevs win.

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,760
- Yeah, exactly.

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
- Yeah.

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,560

They were trying to, their whole bombing the marathon

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
was just to get us to go back inside.

You could leave your house for like a day, right?

43
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
- That's true.

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
- Yeah, I haven't been able to,

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm going crazy. - I've been good.

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,120
- 'Cause I haven't been able to sleep.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
- Dude, I've just been,

62
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,640
I went to bed at like six the other day, 6 a.m.

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,800
- Oh, okay.

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,560
That's normal for you. - That is just

Patrick, but more.

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,720

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,080
Yeah, staying up 'til six every day.

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
I've been playing Skate 3.

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,680
I've been playing Mario Kart.

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm really mad because my TV doesn't have any RCA ports on it

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
so I can't play the GameCube.

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,360
- You can come to my house.

75
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,800
- Order the Coke Shield cable adapter.

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,560
- Yeah, I wanna get the component cables for the Wii though

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,240
'cause it does have component cable slots.

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,840
- Yeah, I'm gonna be setting up my Wii next week.

79
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
- Yeah.

80
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,040
- Whoa, that's a big plan.

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
- I can teach you how to mod it.

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
- I don't want that.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,360
I don't want you to teach me anything.

84
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,280
You don't want a hair trigger on your Wii?

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,620
Yeah.

86
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,640
Dude, I want a Wii with the real gun.

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,520
You can put an extendo on the remote?

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,440
Yeah.

89
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,920
Yeah, you can put a bump stock on your Wii.

90
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
You can make a Wii.

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,320
The Wii Motion Plus is a bump stock.

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
Yeah.

93
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,960
I've been doing okay.

94
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,160
Right now, I just finished up my quarantine

95
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,640
in the cottage behind my in-laws' house.

96
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,760
Now you're back to coughing

97
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,840
on all the produce in grocery stores.

98
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Exactly, yeah.

99
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm back to sampling all the grapes and the strawberries.

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Yeah.

101
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,760
Yeah, with my tongue.

102
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,240
But I just like, I've been sitting out here playing Minecraft, smelling like dog shit.

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,100
Like absolute horse shit, piss, and fucking cum.

104
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
I smell terrible.

105
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,200
Oh, I've been showering a lot.

106
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,520
I have been showering, this is the least I've ever showered in my life.

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,960
The other day I realized I wore the same pants for 18 days in a row.

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, I did that before the quarantine.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,060
My brown pants.

110
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,780
You can wear pants as long as you want.

111
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,780
That's the thing about pants.

112
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,820
I thought that too until I was sitting on the couch with Jana watching Nathan for You.

113
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,620
You tried to stand up and your pant legs wouldn't bend.

114
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,620
Yeah.

115
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,900
They were so starched with shit.

116
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,820
No, she was just, she was like, "Honestly, like, I think your pants smell like it's maybe

117
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,540
the worst smell I've ever smelt."

118
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,140
And I was like, "I'm breaking up with you.

119
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,420
You can't say that to me, dude."

120
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,220
I used to wear the same pair of black dickies like every day.

121
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,220
That's exactly what they are.

122
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
The black dickies are a fucking stink magnet.

123
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,900
It's because you can empty a bottle of ketchup on black dickies and never see a stain.

124
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,700
It absorbs it like an alien.

125
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,980
You know in movies when an alien goo hops out of something and absorbs a bullet?

126
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,020
That's how my dickies are with mustard and mayonnaise stains.

127
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
It's like venom.

128
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
It's a venom symbiote.

129
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,940
eating hot dogs I'm just outing myself and it's all I'm all so much so much

130
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:02,660
corn chowder that we keep fucking sending yeah it's so good so good though it's

131
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,620
corn chowder with a pork shoulder bacon that sounds delicious it looks like you

132
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,340
dumped like just like canned corn in half and half yeah yeah I mean that's

133
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,820
- That's essentially corn chowder.

134
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,260
- Yeah, with salt.

135
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,100
- Yeah.

136
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,060
- Today I made a polenta.

137
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,900
- Yes.

138
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,820
- Ooh.

139
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,660
- That sounds good.

140
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,020
- Grade A slop.

141
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,860
- Oh, last night Dom and I--

142
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,180
- That is next level.

143
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,340
- I got a, I got really, I don't know what,

144
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,060
I made like a thing, like a blender full,

145
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,220
like it's like a 72 ounce blender that I have,

146
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,860
and I filled it with like just too much tequila.

147
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,940
I just made like the biggest frozen margarita thing,

148
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,980
and I got fucked up way too quick.

149
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,820
- Yeah.

150
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,940
- And we got, I was so drunk that I moved,

151
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,180
I showed you guys already,

152
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,820
but I moved the corner of the couch out to the alleyway.

153
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,140
- To the alleyway?

154
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,420
- Yeah, so this is-- - Why'd you get rid

155
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,380
of the couch?

156
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,140
- We got rid of the corner piece.

157
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,980
- Why?

158
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,280
- So now there's more room in my apartment.

159
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,120
- Oh, okay.

160
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,700
What are you gonna use that corner for?

161
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,580
- Oh, we just put the corner in the alleyway

162
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,420
and I'm sitting on--

163
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
- No, no, where are you putting--

164
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,100
- The free corner, hold on, let me--

165
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,260
- What are you putting in the new corner?

166
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,100
gonna put something like a ping-pong table or something? No, he's gonna put a basket.

167
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,860
A basket? You're right, that was a much better use of the space. No, so the cats can run around.

168
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,420
But look, I put the one chair here and then like the reclining chair and then the big

169
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,940
chair. Man, looks like total shit, dude. Did you guys see that person just run by that

170
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:39,460
window right there? No. Someone just ran by this window like right by it. Like an inch

171
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,460
away

172
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,180
I mean they're just running with their dogs. Everyone's running with their dogs. I don't know what's going on. Why are people running?

173
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,240
They're running the same direction. No

174
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Okay up and down the street is a dead-end Street. I don't know why people run up and down the street to say hi to you

175
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,500
They want to probably know what it is. It's probably and probably they live here. It's most likely

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,380
So I was just like there was like a situation where I had to like lift like I had to lift up the vacuum

Trying so badly to not show how much of a pussy you are. Yeah

186
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,640
Yeah, and they hung up our art. We didn't have any posters on our wall or anything

187
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,600
we did have we had like a big American flag in our living room and then

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,280

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
bullet like the what are they called the targets we had the American flag and

190
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,440
then like one of the targets was supposed to be a terrorist and it was

191
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,840
just a brown person that we shot. Yeah that's that yeah anytime somebody prints

192
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,320
one of those out it's always like it's like a picture of Carlos Mencia.

193
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,960
He's an A-Rab. And then some yeah they put Carlos Mencia in a turban and

194
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,280
sometimes he's got a turban and he's got zombie skin. Yeah. That's how they get

195
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,040
around yeah the races they put that that picture of the that like image macro of

196
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:54,460

198
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,720
directly in the same spot in Pamela Anderson's face. Sorry I can't help myself.

199
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,980
She's so beautiful. Yeah, I got distracted. It's like when you look at like, look at

200
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,060
something while you're driving you start drifting that way. Yeah. Yeah, but you're

201
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,000
so distracted by the Pamela Anderson cutout. Yeah, there's just like, yeah, there's

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,120
like ten bullets in Mr. Bean's head and then like just a splat on Pamela

203
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,840
Anderson's face. Yeah. The, uh, I, I, the first time I ever shot a gun it was just like a

204
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,960
a little shotgun. The second time my brother's friend had an mp5. Ooh. Yeah.

205
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,140
And it's called mp3 idiot. Yeah it's called an mp3 file of me of a gunshot and he

206
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:53,600
listened to it. He made me shoot an mp5 and I was so so terrified. I was

207
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
like and I wasn't sure I was like a little kid and I wasn't scared of

208
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,720
shooting the gun I was scared that some like MK ultra trigger would happen in my

209
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,520
brain and I would turn around and start shooting everybody. I was like fuck dude if I like

210
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,320
turn crazy that would suck so bad. I hope I don't turn crazy right now. My parents are

211
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,080
gonna come pick me up and I'm gonna be have no way to explain this you know. I'd have

212
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,600
to frame a crime scene. Yeah. Yeah some guy took the mp5 out of my hands and. Dude it

213
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:33,160
Mr. Bean. Mr. Bean stole your mp5. Damn. Imagine Mr. Bean dual wielding. With

214
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,520
silencers. Mm-hmm yeah cuz he can't talk. Exactly. Or like if the guns do make a

215
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,320
noise it's just kind of like "ohhh"

216
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:49,640
The Mr. Bean silencer that makes the the clap of the bullet sound like "hmm"

217
00:11:49,640 --> 00:12:03,400
Or like, like everyone's one he'll say no. James Bond shooting a pistol that goes

218
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,280
"No." That's what Dr. No, yeah that's what Dr. No is about.

219
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:16,440
You know, fuck. Bam man, it's been um it's been chill today. We're officially not in

220
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,440
In North Carolina, we're not allowed to go to parks and stuff.

221
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,940
You can go to the grocery store at home.

222
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,520
Yeah, they closed all the parks in my town,

223
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,120
but that's just my town.

224
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,640
There's nothing, yeah.

225
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,640
The day before, I did go to a skate park

226
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,600
like in the middle of all this

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,000
'cause I had to complete a Patreon request.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,280
You're what we call a spreader, my friend.

229
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,640
Yeah. You spread your legs

230
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,960
and you spread disease. No, I thought

231
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,520
I thought it was gonna be me and then like three guys there,

232
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
but it was like me--

233
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,000
- Oh, it was gonna be you and three guys spreading.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,520
Yeah, you and the three guys you brought, your boyfriends?

235
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,360
- Yeah, my boyfriends.

236
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,320
- Chris, Tom, and Todd?

237
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,760
- Tom O'Shea.

238
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,840
But I thought it was gonna just be me

239
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,080
and like three other people,

240
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,960
but it was me, like four people skateboarding,

241
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,600
and then like a bunch of moms with their little kids

242
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
running around the pump track.

243
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,520
It was just like, man, you just--

244
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,640
- Oh, dude, score.

245
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,240
You do not give a shit about your kid, huh?

246
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Couple of mommies at the skate park, couple of skate mommies.

247
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Mm-hmm.

248
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Ooh.

249
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Ooh.

250
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
That's worth it, man.

251
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Yay.

252
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Yeah.

253
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Yes!

254
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Oh.

255
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
Ooh.

256
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Um.

257
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,680
I've also, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft.

258
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,720
Yeah, I- I've been building wild shit on Minecraft.

259
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,680
I had to kick Minecraft 'cause I have fucking classwork all the time.

260
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
That sucks.

261
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
I can't believe you're still in school.

262
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
I know.

263
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,740
And it's so much like I can't fucking space out in class because all my like attendance

264
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,700
requirements are like, "Watch this hour-long video and send me all your notes on it to

265
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,040
prove that you watched it."

266
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,000
And it's just like, "Oh, great.

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I actually have to."

268
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's fucking sucks, dude.

269
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm just going to fail.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,760
Yeah, it is the worst school to have online classes at.

271
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Absolutely.

272
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
For sure.

273
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Like...

274
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,160
I cannot wait to be fucking dumb.

275
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
Everything is like production-based.

276
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Everything is performance-based.

277
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,000
Like, what are you going to do?

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Improv over fucking Skype?

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's funny you say that. I just heard my boss at MIT had her daughter was at the new school

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and they choose it.

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That school has been around for a while. They should just call it the school.

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They should just call it the medium school.

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The normal school.

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The school that's been around a normal amount of time.

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But she was in the middle of an improv class and then they moved it online and so now she has to do online improv.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,080
- Bro, it's so funny.

287
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,280
- That's sick, dude.

288
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,120
- Yeah.

289
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
- It's probably a lot like this.

290
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
- Yeah, 'cause then one person can be funnier than the other

291
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
'cause then they can put, they can make their background.

292
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,120
- They can do a funny background, yeah.

293
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,280
That's how you get an A plus in the, yeah.

294
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,040
- I improvise my background.

295
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,640
- Yeah, do a background, it's that picture of,

296
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,040
that old one of Hulk Hogan doing 9/11 with his fists.

297
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,240
- Well, no, one person says like,

298
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,200
well, it's great we're here at the store,

299
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,800
and the other person switches the background

300
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,680
like underwater and goes no yeah stupid bitch we're underwater her yeah we're

might be an April Fool's prank on us so if we did do those we would have been

307
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,360
pranked so it's good that we didn't. Top 10 April Fool's pranks it's on the top

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,520
Teachers suck dude. Yeah. Yeah. Teachers suck, homework even worse than teachers.

315
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,360
And pranks are the third worst thing. Pranks I think are good if you do them on

316
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:01,400
your teacher. I was the prankster in middle school. I was the prank kid.

317
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,240
Nowadays you put a thumbtack under your teacher's seat, they send you to Abu

318
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Ghraib. You can't do pranks anymore. Society is cracking down on pranksters

319

they don't let you do pranks anymore. Yeah. Especially teachers.

321
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,600
Teachers are a protected class nowadays. Yeah. That's also what PC culture stands for.

322
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,240
Protected class. This is the worst time for pranksters because they're all stuck

323
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,400
up in their homes. What are they gonna do? Prank their mom? Yeah. You know,

324
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,040
this whole #MeToo movement has really been tough on pranksters.

325
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:53,400
yeah the the genre of sexual prank has completely been destroyed lost to the

326
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:02,560

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,440
was not, you know, it wasn't very creative. I would always, I remember one time I

332
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,040
tried, I tried to set up, you remember the classic bucket of water on the

333
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,320
partly open door? Yeah, yeah. So I tried to set that up and then the water fell on

334
00:18:41,320 --> 00:19:00,800
on

335
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,960
of pranks on teachers that I pulled.

336
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,600
- Yeah, like what?

337
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,600
- Just like, some of them just like the mouse thing,

338
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,280
like you put the invisible tape over the mouse laser.

339
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
I did that enough times to one teacher

340
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,440
that he, in the middle of class,

341
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,680
he had the IT guy come up and replace the mouse.

342
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,920
- That's nice.

343
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
- And there was one other time,

344
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,100
we set up, he had a big timer,

345
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,800
same teacher, it was my science teacher in eighth grade.

346
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,080
He had a timer and we set it up for 30 minutes

347
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
in the middle of class.

348
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,480
And then in the middle of his lesson,

349
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,680
the timer went off and we started laughing

350
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,920
and then he like looked at us and went,

351
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,280
"Is this funny to you?"

352
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,960
And then he made us sit in silence

353
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,080
for the rest of the class and he like didn't teach us.

354
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,280
- I just, a good prank that we pulled was,

355
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,020
one time me, my older brother found a two by four

356
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,000
in our yard and he used a saw to cut it down

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,760
like the last like half centimeter or whatever of like the wood like in the

358
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,860
middle and then my mom was in the front yard like mowing the lawn or something

359
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:14,200
and my brother was like okay you run into the yard screaming and I'm gonna

360
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,200
break this over the back of your head and I was like okay and so I did it I

361
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,080
ran out and he hit me with the 2x4 in a way so that like it looked to my mom

362
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,720
like he just snapped it clean in half like Bruce Lee over the back of my

363
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,720
fucking head and I just started like screaming and my mom went like so

364
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:43,060
earnestly my mom went to go punch him in the face like cocked it back like

365
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,480
fucking punch out and I was just like no no no no no no no no it was fake

366
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,520
because I was like it can you imagine just how different my life would have

367
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:02,520
been if I'd watch my mom like knock the shit out of my brother. It's good that was her first

368
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,220
instinct. Yeah that's that's a mama bear shit. Yeah she is humongously fat and

369
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,760
hairy. I told you I think I've talked about it before but the it's the

370
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,080
important documents folder I put on the school share drive. Yeah that one that was a

371
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,120
good one. Explain it, I don't think you've talked about that. Yeah I got in a lot of

372
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,640
of trouble for it. I lost my computer privileges at school for a week because I made a folder

373
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,160
on the school's shared drive. It was called the Z drive and it was just like a cloud thing.

374
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,080
It ran over the servers of the computers and it said important documents. There was no

375
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,320
important documents folder before so I made the folder important documents and then I just

376
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,240
put like a thousand copies of beans from even Stevens. Just this one photo of him on the

377
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,240
red carpet and it's just him in like a Buccaneers jersey holding up the peace sign and then someone

378
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,000
else in my video production class found it, started copying and pasting it some more.

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,800
So by the end of the day it was 2 gigabytes big but it was slowing down every computer

380
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,520
at school.

381
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,400
That's what they told me and that's why they were allowed to take away my computer privileges

382
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,760
but they said they had to go through every individual file to make sure that there weren't

383
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,760
any important documents in the file.

384
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,760
That rocks.

385
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,160
Yeah, that's...

386
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,120
Number one prank according to this list.

387
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,600
This is the number one prank of all time.

388
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
This is the number one prank.

389
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
We found the number one.

390
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,760
Fuck those pranks that we just said.

391
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,360
Fuck the jackass giant hand, which is probably the best one.

393
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Oh, that's for sure.

394
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
That's the best prank, right?

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,360
I think it's the best jackass prank.

396
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,640
Yeah, I'm trying to think of what another jackass prank they did even is.

397
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:53,160
Oh, the best one was the Johnny Knoxville's lotion where they put all the horse cum in it. Oh, yeah

398
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,700
Can you imagine being like on on the set of jackass and being like, you know

399
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,040
It's smart to be let everyone know that I put lotion on my face all the time

400
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,120
What a layup for fucking steve-o. Yeah

401
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,780
Number one replace Oreo cream filling with toothpaste sort of a similar prank. Yeah

402
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,560
Basically, I feel like this one's more immediate though.

403
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,920
That's a devastating prank.

404
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,320
90% of pranks are about replacing one thing with another thing.

405
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,160
Well, the thing about this prank is it's really devastating because you go, you eat the Oreo

406
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,720
expecting your teeth to get dirty, but they get clean.

407
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,080
And that's why I eat candy, is because I like to dirty up my teeth and nasty it up for the

408
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
dentist.

409
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
I want to turn them brown.

410
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm trying to get as many cavities as I can so that my dentist, Sandra Miles, will look

411
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
That's my dentist name actually.

412
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm trying to get my dentist, I'm making my dentist work for his fucking money.

413
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
No, she's a lady. How fucked up is that?

414
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,600
She's a dentist and her name is S. Miles.

415
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Woah.

416
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
What a fucking bitch, dude.

417
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
My dentist was named Robert T. Christ.

418
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
What?

419
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:10,600
His name was Robert T. Christ and if you called him, he called himself Dr. Christ.

420
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,600
And if you called him Dr. Christ, he would correct you because he was a devout Christian.

421
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,400
Fuck it, dude. I would have named my dentistry office "Teeth Christ".

422
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,900
Yeah.

423
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,780
Yeah.

424
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,720
That's what his middle name was.

425
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,240
"Teethist Christ".

426
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,960
But he, in the middle of cleaning my teeth once,

427
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,200
he left for like an hour to talk to some woman and then he came back with her and then he was like,

428
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,040
"I actually have a cassette of my wife's organ music right here if you want it."

429
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,200
And I was like, "That's why you were fucking gone?"

430
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,200
on

431
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,120
organ music. Yeah, I wish I had a cassette of his wife's organ music. Yeah, could you

432
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,880
get me one? I make, I make her- I wish I had a picture of his wife's organ. I play her

433
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,600
organs and she makes music. Yeah. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? And I put a cassette

434
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,520
in her. Yeah, I put a cassette in my wife and I record all of her thoughts to it. And

435
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,680
then I plug it into, I put it into my Commodore 64 and I play my wife's thoughts like a video

436
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,960
game yeah I pressed a click like an eject button and a copy of Kotor came out

437
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,680
let's see any comments on this one somebody says if cheesy nachos says

438
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,340
about toothpaste in the Oreo it tastes good though it probably I mean chocolate

439
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,960
and mint you can't go wrong there it would I mean it would just taste at first

440
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,400
like a mint Oreo yeah there's another good comment from epic Jake says I was

441
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,240
about to read that. My Colgate Total would make a great replacement. So similar vein.

442
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:52,760
Yeah. I bet his full name is Jake Colgate. He's out here doing gorilla advertising. Yeah.

443
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,320
He's showing a gorilla in the comments. Not so epic Jake. He's putting an ASCII

444
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,080
gorilla in the comments. Or the ASCII gorilla. How about this Jake? I'm gonna go gorilla

445
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
on your whole mouth and eyes.

446
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,580
Mm-hmm.

447
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
Oh.

448
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,080
And you're not gonna like it if you don't stop.

449
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,080
I don't think, I think gorillas don't, I think gorillas, uh, they split you in half.

450
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,080
I think chimps are the ones who like the, they like to fuck your hands.

451
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,080
I'm doing the, I'm going all in gorilla style.

452
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,080
And I'm gonna let the listeners decide what that means.

453
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,080
You do look like a gorilla 'cause you're fat as shit.

454
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm not fat.

455
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
And you have a tiny penis.

456
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
You look exactly like a gorilla.

457
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
It's completely different.

458
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
You have a giant head.

459
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
I'm so, I'm so, no.

460
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,420
- Big fat body, you're five foot two,

461
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,460
and you have a tiny wiener.

462
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,560
- Okay, yeah.

463
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,040
- I don't see any lies.

464
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,120
- There's, yeah, where's the lie?

465
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,960
- Yeah.

466
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,840
- The whole thing was the lie.

467
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,160
- No, none of it's a lie.

468
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,000
- Nah.

469
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
- I just said the whole thing was the lie.

470
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
- No. - You're the liar.

471
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
- I'm not a liar.

472
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,760
- Oh, so first I'm a gorilla, now I'm a liar?

473
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,600
Why don't you pick one?

474
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,440
- Gorillas are--

475
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,260
- You're a flip-flopper, dude.

476
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,400
- One of the most dishonest beasts in the zoo.

477
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,360
(laughing)

478
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,680
- They're never trust--

479
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,520
- No, no.

480
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
- Never trust the word of a gorilla.

481
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
- No.

482
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,280
You should always trust the word Coco one of the most genius creatures of all time.

483
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,600
She's not even smart.

484
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,040
That's the ultimate lie is that she doesn't know how to communicate.

485
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,680
She's making all that shit up.

486
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Yeah.

487
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
No, you guys are wrong.

488
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,480
You guys are wrong.

489
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,720
You guys are little bugs.

490
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
You want to talk about bugs.

491
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
You guys are little bugs.

492
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm going to show you what it's like to be stepped on.

493
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,480
You can't step on us because you refuse to wear shoes.

494
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,040
I wear a shoe right now.

495
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Because they don't make shoes.

496
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:37,480
this I'm wearing a fucking shoes. How am I wearing shoes? You're showing me your big hairy gorilla

497
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,560
feet. I know you love it dude. You're showing me that you're peeling a banana with your foot.

498
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,960
You're not even. Dude stop eating bananas. Cameron's sitting on a throne of bananas in his

499
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,120
banana car. Because I'm the king but it's not a I'm not a gorilla I'm just a banana king.

500
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,560
Cam is sitting in the banana car. You can like bananas and not be a gorilla. You're in the banana

501
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,800
car from the Bloodhound Gang music video.

502
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
You're gonna drive it into a tunnel and give the guy a banana.

504
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,600
And you drive it into your house that is a banana, it's a large banana much like a Spongebob's

505
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
pineapple house.

506
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,320
I would, I would enjoy living in one of those.

507
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,440
Yeah, because you'd eat it all day, you fucking monkey.

508
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,640
You don't eat your house, what are you talking about?

509
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,800
You have a gold sponsorship like Super Monkey Ball.

510
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,200
Nobody eats their house.

511
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,760
Yeah, yeah, you're, your life is Super Monkey Ball sliding through Boston in a ball collecting

512
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,960
bananas. If you lived in a house made out of food would you eat it? No I would live

513
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,880
in it. Yeah. You can't live in your house and eat it too. What if your house is

514
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,400
made out of uh... Soylent. Gingerbread. I would... Yeah. Gingerbread. Which one? Soylent. If my house... I

515
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,640
wouldn't eat it. I would live in it. What if your house... I would eat your house. What if

516
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,480
your house was made out of gingerbread and your sink only had... and when you turn

517
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,760
your sink on it only had soylent? I would move. That would suck. I would not live there.

518
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,720
okay then what about chocolate milk? I would move. I need water. House of is made out of

519
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,560
calzone like bricks that are calzones from 7-eleven and then if you turn on

520
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:12,920
the tap water it's Powerade blue. I'd eat that. You wouldn't have a you wouldn't you

521
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,320
wouldn't do a glacier cherry sink? That's Gatorade and I've recently been on

522
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,920
a Powerade kick. It's a little sweeter. Patrick bites every house he sees them

523
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,320
check if it's candy yeah like you bite a gold coin to see if it's candy yeah

524
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,920
Patrick goes up to every single house is this what prospectors would bite gold coins

525
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,000
yeah dude it's not candy I do that to people's cars too yeah you do that to

526
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,280
the rims of people I do that to the rims yeah I do it to the steering wheel

527
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,560
mostly yeah yeah and then if it does work if it is food then you eat the whole

528
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,440
damn side it tastes like a big soft pretzel oh my god

529
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
Could you imagine your steering wheel is a soft pretzel? That'd be awesome.

530
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,760
Can you imagine eating Cam's banana car?

531
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,960
Oh yeah.

532
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,760
That his monkey mind goes absolutely bananas for?

533
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,000
No, I can't imagine that.

534
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,480
Yeah, and you use a GPS that, get this, it's like a Garmin,

535
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,440
and you're pressing it and it's talking to you, but then when we see it, it's just a banana.

536
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,320
It's a GPS and it means gorillas per second.

537
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,400
you have a you have a you you move you use a banana like a stick shift both of

538
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,840

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,080
extremely fucked up no no I have a race car I have a race car I can drive around

540
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,040

541
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,880
lynchian you dare not say dare I say no at the risk of scaring us all I will I

542
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,800
I will invoke the name of David Lynch, the master of horror.

543
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
It's Kafka-esque.

544
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:57,760
Yes, it's very Ray Romano-like, what you're doing in this piece.

545
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,040
It's very Sandler-esque.

546
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
It's very Sandler-esque.

547
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:08,840
It's very Sandler-esque.

548
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:15,160
shows you their music and it's just like it's just oh and you're like it's I dare

549
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,120
I say it it's Sandler esque what you're doing here is incredible every like

550
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,920
anytime somebody like sings about or what's that the Havana Gila just saying

551
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:34,200
that that's Sandler esque going it going into a into a reading the Talmud and

552
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,800
something about this text is so Sandler-esque yeah yeah just the Hanukkah

553
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,440
song that's the only Jewish thing Adam Sandler ever did mm-hmm yeah not uncut

554
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:52,240
gems not any no not not his yeah not as a his own self the wedding singer Sandy

555
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,640
Wexler oh my god Sandy Wexler all right number two is plant a grass garden on

556
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:06,880
someone's keyboard. The comment, the only comment is an anonymous one that just says, "How would

557
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,120
you do that?" Very fair. I would say, I would say the way you do that is, it would, I don't

558
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,640
think you could do it with just like dirt, because they would notice. Yeah. I think there's

559
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,280
a possibility you get this done with a chia seed. Well, I think you'd have to do it with

560
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:31,200
plants personally. Yeah. You sucker fucker. I think what you'd have to do is pick up all

561
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:40,380
of the keys and then put little flower pots in the keys slots. That's what I think. What

562
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:47,920
about if you put dangerous spores? Yeah. Whoa. You make a mushroom garden. Yeah, dark mushrooms

563
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,360
and dangerous creatures that live in the darkness.

564
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,520
- Make a psilocybin mushroom farm.

565
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,360
- Whoa.

566
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,200
- Right?

567
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
- Now that's less of a prank and more of a gift,

568
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
if you ask me.

569
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,280
- Yeah, yeah, right?

570
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,960
- The best prank is a gift.

571
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,780
- I'm gonna grow a--

572
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,620
- That's true.

573
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,120
- And Noam Chomsky said that.

574
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,160
- Yeah, yeah.

575
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,520
- No, that's the words from Noam Chomsky.

576
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,320
- Noam is one of the greatest prank theorists we have.

577
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,160
- That's what manufacturing consent is about.

578
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,480
- Yeah, it's about getting consent for a prank,

579
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,480
'Cause pranks are never consensual until afterwards.

580
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,860
- My senior prank in high school had to be,

581
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,440
fucking, we had to talk to the principal about it

582
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,960
and we had to get our prank approved.

583
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,800
- That is not a prank, that is an action.

584
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,640
- Exactly.

585
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,560
- Yeah, that's a game, that's a plan.

586
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,080
- You can't plan, you can't have the teachers

587
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,440
in on your senior prank.

588
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,080
What kind of fucking fascist bullshit is that?

589
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,600
- Yeah, exactly, dude.

590
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,440
Yeah. I'm still, I still get heated about it, man.

591
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,400
What was your prank again?

592
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,040
Five years ago.

593
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,440
What'd you say?

594
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,680
We had a rave in a classroom.

595
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,880
Dude, that, I mean, of course you need permission for that, dude. People are doing MDMA and

596
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,760
fucking and women have straight edge X's over their titties at raves. You can't, you gotta,

597
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,960
that's gotta go through a teacher.

598
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,200
That's why they put the X's over that, it's 'cause they're edged.

599
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,040
'Cause they're straight edged, yeah. That's why women have been X-ing out their nipples at

600
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,760
dead mouse concerts.

601
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,360
Yeah, they don't want anybody to offer them a cigarette.

602
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Exactly.

603
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,640
You don't know what could be in that cigarette.

604
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,600
One of the biggest dangers of rave is you could break edge by smoking a cigarette.

605
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,880
Did you guys ever claim to be straight edge?

606
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
No.

607
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,240
I didn't really know what straight edge was, but I would have if I did.

608
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,420
I was straight edge, but I didn't know what edge was.

609
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,760
I listened to straight edge music, but then I was like, "Oh, I don't like the straight

610
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,000
edge hardcore bands but then I was like oh I that sounds so corny like I know I'm

611
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,560
only listening. I was just like a crazy person in like middle school and high school

612
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,000
I was just like yeah I can't I can't use any substance that will harm my body in

613
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,760
any way I need to be powerful. I was smoking cigarettes at age 12. I am the weapon of the world.

614
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,320
I got really close to getting a straight edge tattoo when I was 13.

615
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,160
- Hell yeah, dude.

616
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,820
- Nice, hell yeah.

617
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,660
Hell fucking yeah.

618
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,360
- I was almost talked into it by my,

619
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,320
at the time, 20 year old brother.

620
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,800
(laughing)

621
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
He was like, "Dude, it would be so sick

622
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
"if you got a vegan straight edge tattoo.

623
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,440
"You'd be like the only 13 year old with one."

624
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,720
(laughing)

625
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,080
- Was he gonna give it to you?

626
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,220
- He had a friend who he was like,

627
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,520
"Yeah, he's willing to do it."

628
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,920
- Oh my God.

629
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,760
- It's so awesome, dude.

630
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,400
- Dude, that's so fucking funny.

631
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,360
- I should have done it.

632
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,260
It would have been such a funny,

633
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,460
Like I have way stupider tattoos now.

634
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,420
- Right. - You know?

635
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,700
- You should go get it right now.

636
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,140
Whatever the, do you remember what the design was?

637
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,460
You should go get-- - It was gonna be an XVX.

638
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,460
- You should get that on your back,

639
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,900
but like your lower back.

640
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,160
- Yeah, I should get it on the back of my head in red.

641
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,880
- Yeah, that'd be cool.

642
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,180
- But it's one of my biggest regrets.

643
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,900
Actually, and I think it was,

644
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,900
oh, you know what, I think it was gonna be XV bike punk VX.

645
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,420
Because I was into bikes.

646
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420
That's sick dude.

647
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,420
Nice.

648
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Yeah.

649
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
On what where?

650
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,900
It was going to be on my thigh so my mom couldn't see it.

651
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
Oh yeah.

652
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
Nice.

653
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Yeah.

654
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Well you don't let your mom see your thighs?

655
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
No.

656
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Yeah not anymore.

657
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
Why not?

658
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
No.

659
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,060
Number three, stick a small paper under a computer mouse so it can block its light.

660
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,780
Yeah that's a classic.

661
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,460
I don't think anybody should be blocking anybody's light.

662
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,180
We should be building each other up and not breaking and not blocking the light of humanity.

663
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,020
- They wrote this whole thing wrong.

664
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,660
- You need to be a light worker.

665
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,820
- Yeah, you need to be a Blu-ray Indigo child.

666
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
And you know what, if--

667
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,620
- Blu-ray, a Blu-ray Indigo child?

668
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,380
- You heard me, motherfucker.

669
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,900
- I'm an Indica child.

670
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,740
- Yeah.

671
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,260
- That's right, like Wiz Khalifa.

672
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,080
- Yeah.

673
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,180
- Like Devin the Dude.

674
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,300
- Like Devin the Dude, yeah.

675
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,700
I would never do this prank because I think,

676
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
I think the computer is a human right.

677
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,460
- Absolutely.

678
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,300
- I did this prank and they wrote this wrong.

679
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,020
You gotta use clear tape.

680
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:25,020
I

681
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,060
supposed to replace the mouse with an identical 3d printed mouse that has no

682
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,540
electronics inside whatsoever and when you turn it over it releases noxious gas

683
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,580
that kills you yeah you're supposed to replace it with a mouse made of pure

684
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,500
gold yeah that's the prank but on the bottom it has a little faucet that

685
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,900
sprays out liquid poop into your face now that's a nice sock dude teachers

686
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,820
would love it my mouse I would hate it if my mouse shot poop at me teachers if

687
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,720
- If you're testing to make sure it's real gold

688
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
and you bite into it,

689
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,540
(laughing)

690
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,500
and it shoots doo-doos at you, dude.

691
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,340
- Yeah.

692
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,180
- Yeah.

693
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,220
Number four, paint a bar of soap with clear nail polish.

694
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,060
This is a good prank.

695
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,660
Actually, I think we talked about this.

696
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,860
I think this was on the list of the first episode

697
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,700
we ever did, which was a prank episode.

698
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,580
- Yeah.

699
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,860
- It wasn't a prank episode, but it was about--

700
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,940
- You pranked the listeners by getting rid of you.

701
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,980
- We pranked the listeners by deleting all those episodes.

702
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,820
- Yeah.

703
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,540
upload them somewhere but they'll be somewhere but they're not if you if you

704
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:35,700
want to hear us trying to figure out what the fuck this show is little did we know

705
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,100
the 20-minute episodes of us. The giant puzzle piece we needed was Patrick.

706
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:48,400
And I was only on the fourth episode. The big round, the circular, the fat puzzle piece. The roundest fucking puzzle piece.

707
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,660
Yeah, we were looking at a puzzle that had a giant circle in the middle.

708
00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:00,300
What goes here? And then I saw you from across the street. And I said him.

709
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:07,180
And then it took me, I was a guest on episode 4 and then it took me, I don't know what, 4

710
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
months.

711
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
25?

712
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
25 episodes.

713
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
You're out here sneaking it on.

714
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,740
To sneak yourself in with your fucking shitty Irish magic.

715
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,740
Yeah.

716
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,860
You fucking piece of shit dude.

717
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Yeah.

718
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,980
And now we're married to you.

719
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,700
Anyway, so the bar of soap with clear nail polish, this is a prank because if you touch

720
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,620
something with nail polish on it you become gay.

721
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,620

Make a cupcake with mustard on the top

739
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,780
instead of frosting.

740
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,280
- Oh boy. - And there's one comment

741
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,360
from anonymous that says, "That sounds weird."

742
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,880
- I would never fall for this one, dude.

743
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,720
There's no yellow-- - You can smell mustard.

744
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,240
- Yeah, mustard's like the stinkiest

745
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,600
fucking thing in the world.

746
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,440
- Right.

747
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
- Well, you guys have never had a yellow treat?

748
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,600
- True. - Oh, you've had

749
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,520
a yellow treat.

750
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,000
- I love yellow treat. - You bring the cupcake

751
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
up to your face, you smell it,

752
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,640
and you look at the person giving it to you,

753
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,400
and you say, "Wait, is this sweet mustard?"

754
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,440
(laughing)

755
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,640
And then you take a bite.

756
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,880
You go, "Yeah, it's sweet mustard.

757
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Yeah, go for it.

758
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Yeah.

759
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,240
I'd like to see this, but like somebody accidentally uses like a whole grain mustard for the prank.

760
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Yeah, a brown mustard.

761
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,320
Why do you got all these pebbles on the fucking food?

762
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
That's sugar.

763
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
It's turbinado sugar.

764
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
Yeah.

765
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,280
I made a chunky icing.

766
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Chunky sugar.

767
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Chunky sugar.

768
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,680
Number six, cut a paper into an insect figure and put it in a lamp.

769
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
An insect figure?

770

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,600
Put a cutout of Adolf Hitler inside the lamp

787
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,960
and they'll go, "What the fuck?"

788
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,080
- Holy shit, we gotta get this guy the frick outta here.

(laughing)

792
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,680
No!

793
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,360
That's when you unload on that fucking lamp

794
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,260
and that's the prank.

795
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,100
Now that person's defying new land.

796
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,660
of a person would you have to be to have Hitler time travel to kill baby you?

797
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,780
Really makes you think. That is that is making me think. Yeah. Yeah. Where even

798
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,180
Hitler is, even Hitler himself is disgusted by you. Yeah. Hitler the

799
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:07,500
epitome of evil. He would never be disgusted by any person no matter the race.

800
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:14,940
Yeah, unless they were really evil. That's the bar. It's just be any Jewish guy. Yeah, that's true.

801
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,260
If Hitler had time travel, he would go to the future and just kill any dude.

802
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,420
Just kill Moshe Kasher.

803
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
That's what he had.

804
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,940
That's why he had them experiment on twins.

805
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,220
He was trying to figure out how to go.

806
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,740
He thought that was the key.

807
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,540
Yeah, it was the key.

808
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,180
Hitler, what a moron.

809
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,180
What a jerk.

810
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,620
That Norm Macdonald joke.

811
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,260
Oh, yeah.

812
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,260
Number seven here.

813
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,860
Get a toilet paper roll and put it on the sink.

814
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,500
Rip the toilet paper roll into pieces as big as half of your thumb.

815
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,660
Mold the toilet paper roll without water so it will look like poop.

816
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:02,020
After that put the "poop" on someone's chair.

817
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,020
Just poop on their chair.

818
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,020
Poop is not...

819
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,700
Dude, poop is a way better prank.

820
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,220
That's a way better prank.

821
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,220
Yeah.

822
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,540
That's the thing so many pranks just do the thing.

823
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,300
You lose the arts and crafts feel.

824
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,180
This is a do-it-yourself arts and crafts prank.

825
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,580
This is a Pinterest prank.

826
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,620
This is a fusion.

827
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,140
This is a prank for women who like to make things.

828
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:22,660
True.

829
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,940
And who also can't poop.

830
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,100
So I mean, you have to be conscious of that.

831
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,740
You can make poop out of your ass.

832
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,980
I'm saying women can't make poop out of their ass.

833
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,260
So they have to make it out of toilet paper roll.

834
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:39,100
Hand crafting an artisanal doo-doo is an arts and crafts--

835
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,100
I'm making--

836
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
I'm a poop luthier.

837
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,360
(laughing)

838
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,780
Yeah, I mean I do feel like doing a,

839
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,820
making a crap is a kind of arts and craft.

840
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,640
Mm-hmm.

841
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,460
Yeah, definitely more of a craft than an art.

842
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,060
More of a freaking farts and craps if you ask me.

843
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,460
Farts and craps, yeah.

844
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,300
I did do, I did do.

845
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,120
What are you doing?

846
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,960
I'm doing farts and craps.

847
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,900
I was thinking the other day,

848
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,500
my in-laws I think because I just,

849
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,420
while I'm around them I just run to the bathroom.

850
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,660
They think I have like IBS or something,

851
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,540
'cause I just spend, every time I walk into their house,

852
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,460
I'm just like, "Hey, I have to go to the bathroom

853
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,460
"for an hour and look at my phone."

854
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,340
- Yeah, you go in there.

855
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,060
- They think I have a disease.

856
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,540
- You walk into their house and as soon as they see you,

857
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,380
you go, "Ugh!"

858
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,780
And you run to the bathroom and you're like,

859
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,980
"Oh no, I missed!"

860
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,220
- Yeah, I have to keep up appearances,

861
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,220
so I do a whole, I have like a recording that I play.

862
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,100
- Yeah, it's like, you're playing

863
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,740
like a recording like the the uncle in full hired home alone to where he's in

864
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:48,040
the shower yeah it's you singing that song but in the middle it's just like

865
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,040
just a bunch of fart sounds in the middle of it mm-hmm number eight find

866
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,520
and download a high-resolution cracked screen image on Google Images what set

867
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,400
the cracked screen image as a screensaver on someone's computer and set

868
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,000
too active after a short period of time.

869
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Now this is devilish.

870
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,920
Yeah, if someone says "ha" I wouldn't do this to someone.

871
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,720
Now that would be horrifying.

872
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
Yeah.

873
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,760
If someone says "ha" you could make it look like their computer screen is cracked.

874
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
That's a good point.

875
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Yeah.

876
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Oh my, wait, that's even fucking worse.

877
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,760
I didn't even think about that.

878
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,560
You just took this prank to the next level.

879
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
Are you kidding?

880
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,560
Holy shit.

881
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,560
I was just thinking how...

882
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,560
I thought you were just giving them a stupid...

883
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,320
Yeah, I thought it would just be annoying to switch their screensaver they probably worked

884
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,240
hard on yeah you have to switch it from like a cry like an angel riding a

00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,000
I still don't really know what scurvy is.

901
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,520
I know it has something to do with vitamin C.

902
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,560
Yeah, it's like a vitamin C deficiency

903
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,900
and like you get fucked up teeth.

904
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,960
It fucks your teeth up?

905
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,220
I might have that.

906
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,060
Oh, I think I do too.

907
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:03,880
I don't need that first.

908
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,480
I think I brushed my teeth three times this month.

909
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,520
Oh man, I--

910
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,360

00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,440
Yeah, I woke up this morning

912
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,640
after drinking that big ass frozen Marg

913
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,320
and my teeth hurt like shit.

914
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,920
And you were wearing a sombrero.

915
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,960
Uh-huh.

916
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,240
Oh, I had a little painted on mustache

917
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,160
and a big sombrero and I was sitting,

918
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,200
I woke up and I went--

919
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
Oh my god, what did I do last night?

920
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,440
(laughing)

921
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,120
- I was just talking like Speedy Gonzales.

922
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,880
- Patrick, you ran really fast.

923
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,140
(laughing)

924
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,760
Oh no.

925
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,480
- Oh no, you woke up drunk, dude.

926
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,120
You're still talking like Speedy Gonzales.

927
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,960
- I'm not drunk.

928
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,800
- Patrick, when you drink,

929
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,760
you always turn into Speedy Gonzales.

930
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,840
- It doesn't matter what you drink.

931
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,680
- Yeah.

932
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,720
- Water, orange juice.

933
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:58,280
number nine is my favorite one. Fill the donuts with mayonnaise. One of the ultimate pranks

934
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:06,320
because we're I mean so you know the donuts. Yeah. You know them. You've heard of them.

935
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,440
You have to fill them with mayonnaise. Yeah. The donuts. You're commanded as Christ commanded

936
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,080
fill the donuts with mayonnaise. Yeah. But do you fill it in the middle? I feel like

937
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,800
the only donut this would work for would be a Boston cream. A Boston cream and then you

938
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,840
have to empty it out first. No, every fucking donut's got a hole in the

939
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,880
middle. You fill the hole with mayonnaise. That's obvious though. Yeah. Not if you

940
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,180
put a cloaking device on the donut. So you have to develop an invisible mayonnaise that not only is

941
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:42,800
invisible but has to... Oh, is that what the movie is? About? Invisible mayonnaise? Yeah, the invisible mayonnaise.

942
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,320
So you develop an invisible mayonnaise and you have to have it... it needs to

943
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,840
learn how to be suspended in the middle of a doughnut too.

944
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,360
Yeah it has to be AI. You have to develop a sentient- You need to have a nanobot mayonnaise.

945
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,920
Yeah a nanaise if you will. Manon- Manon- You already have a mayonnaise. A manobanaise.

946
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:07,320
Mano- Manonaise. Manonaise. Yeah. Manonaise. There we go. That's the perfect name for the product.

947
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:13,880
Okay let's make it. Yeah. Manonanonaise. Manonanonaise. Manonanonaise. And it's-

948
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,480
Okay, so here's my pitch, Sharks. It's this, uh, it's an invisible nanobot mayonnaise that you can put

949
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:25,640
bear with me here, in the donuts. And it smells exactly like pussy.

950
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:31,240
How is the onion mayonnaise? It's called may no banana nays.

951
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,920
And it's and my name is and that's my name and I may know banana nays and it's named after me.

952
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,080
Alright, so I have to leave now, huh? Okay.

953
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,520
Yeah, fine.

954
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Uh, number ten, attaching-

955
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,960
You didn't even ask for my offer.

956
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,840
[laughs]

957
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,340
My offer-

958
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,760
You just said yes immediately.

959
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,040
Zero dollars.

960
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,760
[laughs]

961
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,760
Number ten, attaching air horn.

962
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,760
I just wanted to tell you about my cool invention.

963
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,080
[laughs]

964
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,280
Yeah, this is just something I had a dream about, and I just-

965
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,280
[laughs]

966
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
I didn't even make it.

967
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,120
Going in a shark tank and being like, "Sharks, last night, I had a dream that a giant snowman chased me and my dad."

968
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:05,680
[laughs]

969
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,920
Pretty cool, huh?

970
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,160
(laughing)

971
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,280
And if I don't watch a movie today,

972
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,720
I'll probably have it again tonight.

973
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,960
(laughing)

974
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,880
Number 10, attach an air horn under someone's seat.

975
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,720
Where do you get an air horn?

976
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,120
- The store. - The station.

977
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,920
(laughing)

978
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,200
- Attach a gun, attach a stolen service weapon

979
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,040
under somebody's seat.

980
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,880
- Yeah. - Oh my God,

981
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,200
I watched the fucking, I watched the greatest videos.

982
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,840
I watched 15 of these today.

983
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:41,280
This guy makes these videos where he, he just, it's like in Texas. He's like one of

984
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,180
these cop watcher dudes. I think his name is Jake Freeman or something.

985
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:52,300
That's like his alias. But he just films cops and then he will go up to

986
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,840
cops that are like not doing anything, like cops at gas stations or whatever,

987
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:01,680
and he'll talk to them like he's a cop. So he'll be like, "So what are you doing

988
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,720
out here sir you have any drugs on you and the cops are just like I don't what

989
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:17,480
are you so fucking mad it's so funny and they'll start saying the same things so

990
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,320
the guy the guy with the camera be like have you had something to drink today

991
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,000
sir have you been drinking today and the cop be like have you been drinking today

992
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And then the guy will be like, "I asked you a question, sir."

993
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's so fucking funny.

994
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
He had this one cop to let him search his car.

995
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
[laughter]

996
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
He goes, he's like, "I'm gonna need to see what's in your vehicle."

997
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And the cop's like, "You need to look in my vehicle?"

998
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And the guy's like, "Yep, I'm gonna need to see what's in your bag and stuff."

999
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,000
like okay it's so fucking fun that's sick yeah I've been rewatching recommend him

00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:47,200

1008
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,200
It's so funny. Dude, it's the best.

1009
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,200
I've been rewatching those. And they all, and they suck. That's the other thing.

1010
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Oh, they never get them. They're like weak old women. They never get the perp.

1011
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,200
They can't get it. They just like ruin their day.

1012
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,200
Yeah. It's just an annoyance at that point. It's so bad.

1013
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
It's so fucking funny.

1014
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,200
I love them.

1015
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,200
What are they called? Lipstick bail bonds?

1016
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Yeah, lipstick bail bonds.

1017
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,040
That's so good.

1018
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,040
Number 11, Rickrolling.

1019
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,480
Yeah, you know, that's good.

1020
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
That's a classic.

1021
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,480
Now that's a prank.

1022
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
Uh-huh.

1023
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,960
Maybe I'll, maybe the day this comes out I'll post a Rickroll.

1024
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,240
Yeah, maybe we should just, maybe there's going to be a surprise at the end of this

1025
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
episode.

1026
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
Yeah, maybe we should end this episode.

1027
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,240
You know what?

1028
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,240
I'll save that.

1029
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,200
We can talk about that later.

1030
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,440
There may be a surprise at the end of this episode.

1031
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,120
Yeah, you might get a nice Rickroll.

1032
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:45,760
12 put frosting and sprinkles on a sponge so it looks like a cake. Who falls for that?

1033
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,640
I would fall for that. I would never fall for that. I am so aware and so

1034
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,840
actualized I almost never fall for pranks. I'm very good at avoiding them.

1035
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,880
I dodge pranks like Neo. I'm pretty good at avoiding pranks. I'm better at traps than pranks which I

1036
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,120
find this much more important and useful in life.

1037
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,440
So it doesn't really bother me.

1038
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,240
- You're better at being caught in traps

1039
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,680
that are a giant cage with a stick propping up one side

1040
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,440
and there's a banana in the middle of it.

1041
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,320
- 'Cause you're a gorilla.

1042
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,920
- 'Cause you're a gorilla, 'cause you have a monkey brain

1043
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,300
that desires a banana like I desire money.

1044
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,200
- Yes.

1045
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,440
- You try to pay with banana peels.

1046
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,760
- Yeah, banana peels are money to you.

1047
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,240
- No, they're a piece of trash.

1048
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,160
- You work in the banana peel economy.

1049
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,160
- No.

1050
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,000
- Yeah.

1051
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,820
- No.

1052
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,660
- You do.

1053
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,500
- No.

1054
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,640
- You work on the Dole Standard.

1055
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,640
Yeah, I do not.

1056
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,640
You're trying to get us back on the banana standard like we used to be in 1600 BC.

1057
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,640
I'm going to make you get on my banana standard.

1058
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,640
And BC stands for before Cameron.

1059
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,640
Before Cameron ever had a banana.

1060
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,640
Time doesn't exist. I've always been.

1061
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,640
You've always been.

1062
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,640
What are you looking at?

1063
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,640
You've always.

1064
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
There's just people walking around.

1065
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,640
I want to look at the people who are walking around.

1066
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,640
Look at something cool on your computer like, uh, like, I don't know, your friends?

1067
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,640
No, you guys aren't cool.

1068
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,640
Your two friends. What?

1069
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,640
I'm way more interested in looking at this guy with a big umbrella.

1070
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,640
Oh, you're interested in looking at a guy?

1071
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,640
Yeah, with a big umbrella.

1072
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,640
Oh, he's looking at a guy?

1073
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,640
Is he a zookeeper? And he's taking care of you?

1074
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Yeah. Cameron's in his cage.

1075
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Yeah, Cameron's in his cage.

1076
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,640
He's grabbing the bars and going "ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh" back and forth.

1077
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,640
I haven't done that ever.

1078
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,560
You muted your microphone but we saw you.

1079
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,360
I don't know how to mute my microphone.

1080
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
Because you're a gorilla.

1081
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,960
Yes, but you admit I can't mute my microphone so I never would have made that noise.

1082
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,600
Yeah, but you're still a gorilla.

1083
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
I'm not a gorilla.

1084
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,040
Here's a good prank here.

1085
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,400
Number 14, I'm going to skip ahead.

1086
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,640
Take out the batteries of the remote, hide all the batteries in the house, but before

1087
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,920
that, change the channel to something like Bubble Guppies or My Little Pony.

1088
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,920
Oh, and turn it on max volume.

1089
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,520
Oh god, they just had to put the last nail on the coffin there.

1090
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,520
That is fucked up.

1091
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,520
That is devilish.

1092
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,520
That's diabolical, dude.

1093
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,920
Dude, bubble guppies on max volume?

1094
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,920
Yeah, I'm gonna freaking kill myself.

1095
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,520
I'm gonna shoot a laser beam into my head if I have to listen to that.

1096
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,520
Yeah, if I have to watch Backyardigans over and over and over again.

1097
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
I'm gonna go Dorner.

1098
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Yeah, I'm gonna go Dorner mode.

1099
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,520
I'm gonna laugh and clap my hands, but I'm not gonna like it.

1100
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
Put it that way.

1101
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,800
- That's my torture response.

1102
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,800
I laugh and clap like a seal.

1103
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,760
- Yeah, and I go, this is the best show ever,

1104
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,240
but I don't mean it.

1105
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,680
- Yeah, I'm actually just really,

1106
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,940
I'm hating it, but I'm so sarcastic that I can't help it.

1107
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:42,360
- Yeah, this show is so good, I forgot to watch it.

1108
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,380
- I forgot to laugh, I'm actually crying

1109
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,400
because of how bad it is.

1110
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,080
- Yeah, that's me.

1111
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,080
- I do really like number 13 that you skipped, Pat.

1112
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,840
Number 13 is-- - It's my fault.

1113
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,180
Give someone a Krispy Kreme box and put vegetables inside.

1114
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,340
That's the donuts.

1115
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,180
That's evil.

1116
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,000
You know what the biggest--

1117
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,840
That's the donuts.

1118
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,000
I would say the biggest prank is,

1119
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,300
is when somebody gives you a toothbrush for Halloween.

1120
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,140
Damn.

1121
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,960
Right?

1122
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,420
I think a worse one is putting razor blades in the candy.

1123
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,100
I think that's a much bigger Halloween prank.

1124
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,760
No, that's not even a prank.

1125
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,560
At least they're in candy.

1126
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,380
That's true.

1127
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,420
You can melt the candy down and then freeze it back together.

1128
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,280
Or if you just carefully, like me,

1129
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,700
like I always hated Tootsie Pops

1130
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,700
because I don't like the Tootsie Roll in the middle.

1131
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,780
So I would just lick down to like the last layer

1132
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,620
around the Tootsie Roll and then throw it away.

1133
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,780
- Where the razor blade is.

1134
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,860
- Where the razor, that's exactly,

1135
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,220
it'd be the same concept.

1136
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,060
- Yeah.

1137
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,660
- See, you've been defeated yet again.

1138
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,500
- I've never been defeated.

1139
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,460
- All right, I guess that's the list.

1140
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,420
- I guess that is the list.

1141
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,260
We finished it up.

1142
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,660
- You got a bunch of patrons to read.

1143
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,260
- Oh, fuck, we do, don't we?

1144
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,100
- Yeah.

1145
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,920
- God, hey, that's good.

1146
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,440
- I mean it's good, yeah. - Oh, fuck.

1147
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,320
- Fuck. - Oh, I hate this so much.

1148
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,720
- The last-- - I hate this so much.

1149
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,720
- The last time we read these was on St. Patrick's Day,

1150
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,600
right?

1151
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,160
What day was St. Patrick's Day?

1152
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,500
- 17th.

1153
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,340
- The 17th?

1154
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,800
- Oh, God, yeah. - Really?

1155
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,720
- Uh-huh.

1156
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,360
- Damn. - That's like a whole--

1157
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,320
- That's pages back. - We might have like 50.

1158
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
- Damn. - We have a ton.

1159
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,400
- Let's go. - All right, wait,

1160
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,600
I'm finding the beginning.

1161
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,920
Let's see here.

1162
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,800
17th, 17th, 17th, so we read, okay, alright, alright, I got it.

1163
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,200
