00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,600
(music)

00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,800

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,920

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,480

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,600
(music)

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,200
(music)

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,160
everybody kind of messed up in a little way, except for me. Now you messed up,

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,160
you messed up, you left your water bottle. You got to put my water bottle

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,400
in front of my chair. That's messing up. Yes. Well, you put your water bottle on

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,560
a table that was covered in trash. No, I cleaned all the trash off the table.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,440
Not true, because that's why that's no camera and got his water. No, I got it.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,400
That was not on the table. I threw away all the cans from the table. I

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,360
purposely did that, and I remember thinking, did you hear that I'm taking

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,360
all the trash off the table so that nobody will throw in my water bottle?

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,660
so you always will be. I was trying to any time that you are so close to

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,740
getting caught doing something wrong or making a mistake. You always remember

22
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,580
thinking something what wrong

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,260
you are so good. I made you tell me one wrong memory. You're so good at

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,840
remembering what you thought it's almost too convenient. Okay, well, you always

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,040
remember no, no, no, no, let's hear the mistake. Let's hear the wrong thing I

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,260
did today besides arguing so strongly. The right remembering everything like a

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,540
protective you like Sherlock Holmes, the wrong thing you did was waking up

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,200
excuse me that's that's way too rude. That's that should be more than a

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,600
warning. Yeah, that should be to you. Also, I was choosing sides. I was

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
choosing the side that I thought was you drink out of a plastic water bottle

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,460
yeah, which is you're getting a micro plastic in your blood yeah. Okay, so I

32
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,660
do you think I should be having babies every day of the week. I try to

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,640
sterilize myself at least just get remember thinking drinking from that

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,220
water bottle. This is the reason I'm drinking from a plastic water bottle

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,640
right now. He always remembers. He said it again. He remembers every thought

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,060
this guy ever had. He has a walking around like this. I don't remember what

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm thinking today. I don't remember what I'm saying. I remember exactly what

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm thinking. I can't remember. I can't even remember a thought from yesterday,

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,080
because I'm not a thinker Cameron. I'm a doer and I remember what I did. I

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,880
threw your fucking water bottle in the trash with no remorse and I told you to

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,380
it out of the trash and drink from it. I'd do it again. Because it wasn't even in the

42
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,300
trash, it wasn't touching the trash bag, it was in a box. That trash bag is filled with

43
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,340
flies. You're acting like Monk. Just wash it off. You're being, you're kind of being

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,620
Shaloubian. Just wash off the fucking water bottle. You are being Shaloubian right now.

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,220
You're being Monk. I'm not even the one who brought up the water bottle on the show. I

46
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,260
got myself a perfectly good plastic. I don't care, so you're deflecting, I'm saying you're

47
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,340
being Monk. I don't know what that means. He never watches being Monk. You're being a

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,780
perfect. You have to describe that to me. You're being a hyper intelligent rememberer. I know

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,380
know who plays monk, but I never watched the show or know anything.

50
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,740
You're being a hyper intelligent rememberer who's afraid of germs.

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,860
This is what you are looking like. You spelled it wrong.

52
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,700
You spelled monk wrong, but... You wrote monk with a U,

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,620
Juvia. Yeah, he's with an O. So it's spelled... It's not how it's spelled.

54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,700
You're thinking of chip monk. Yeah, this is monk. We're talking about...

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,740
I don't know what kind of monk this is. I've never watched monk,

56
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,060
but I'm pretty sure this isn't monk. You spit all over my hand. I

57
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,060
Oh my God, I'm glittering. It's actually beautiful. Hold on.

58
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,060
That's strawberry watermelon on your hand. There he is.

59
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,060
Yeah, you're being like, actually, this is me, man. And not the bald stuff, but just the perfect Zen serenity.

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,060
That's me. The bald stuff is the only thing that's you.

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,060
And then this is Cameron. Go to the other one.

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,060
This one? No, the monk.

63
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
No, not this one.

64
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Likeably unlikely.

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,060
No, the Tony Shalhoub, the only one that isn't real.

66
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
There we go.

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
There we go.

68
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
You see the pencils are all in order.

69
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,060
He holds a pen.

70
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060
Oh, actually, you're kind of looking...

71
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,060
Whoa.

72
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
Wait, go back up.

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,060
Go back to Monk, Shalhoub Monk.

74
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,060
Caleb, you're being kind of Monk-y right now.

75
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,060
No, I don't.

76
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,060
I put my pencil diagonal because I don't give a fuck about that kind of thing.

77
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
You were doing this.

78
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,060
But he has pencils in front of him, too.

79
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
Yeah, you have a pencil in front of you.

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
You have one in front of you.

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Now I'm being Monk.

82
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,420
I'm being monk. It's not I don't like order. I like chaotic messes. So you

83
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,620
doing? Oh, he was he was testing the point of his pencil. But anyway, I'll

84
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,340
apologize to everybody. I'm sorry for not drinking my water out of the trash.

85
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,500
Thank you. I'm really sorry for remembering what I did thirty seconds

86
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,760
ago. Thank you. I'm sorry. I really appreciate that. Yeah. And now we can

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,740
move forward to talking about Patrick being late one minute late. Okay, so now

88
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,380
the next sin, the next deadly sin.

89
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,220
that was one late. Well, well, well, well, looks like the tables have turned

90
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,100
away. Usually, usually all of us are 15 minutes late, but today Patrick was

91
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,680
one minute late. I'm usually the one who's here. No, no, no, Caleb is usually

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,100
50 minutes late. Yeah, you're usually late. I'm usually one or two minutes

93
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,560
late. I'm always the one who opens it up. Yeah. So why? I'm here on my

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,200
computer. So that's, I think it's an expectation thing is why we're mad at

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,920
you today. Yeah. You were expecting me to be early. I was expecting you to

96
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,420
I had the thought I did have the thought this like this morning.

97
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,880
See I just don't you're doing you're doing that monk shit man. You're

98
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,820
remembering having a thought I did that I had the thought this morning. You're

99
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,360
not supposed to remember your thoughts. Oh, Mr. Mr. I was like, Oh, it doesn't

100
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,100
bring your thought it doesn't matter. I'm usually there first. I think I can

101
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,880
be late today. The one day that Juvia said we need to start at a specific

102
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,240
well. He has a history of being asleep when we try to start well, but he was I

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,880
know why I'm being dragged into this. Yeah, why is this not my fight?

104
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,040
Completely unrelated. Well, I'm just saying it's the only reason that it

105
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,620
matters for being one minute late. Some of us have had stuff to do and somebody

106
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,000
has been asleep, so I don't think that the order or the...

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,340
Why are we having a struggle session right now? What are we doing? We gotta

108
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,440
go into it. Yeah, we should just lay it all out.

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,940
Patrick, I hate your shirt. You hate my shirt? I don't like that kind

110
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,940
of camouflage on a shirt. You are wearing a French pervert shirt. I look like a mime.

111
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,660
Yes. No, you don't look like a mime. You look like a doer of crime. You look like a doer

112
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,900
of French style crime. It's actually a Russian army shirt. Oh, nice. I actually got it at

113
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,940
an army surplus store in Chicago, Illinois. Woke-ism. It wasn't woke of me to do that.

114
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,140
Yeah, it was. You got a Russian army shirt. How's that woke? Give him a warning. That's

115
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
It's an anti-woke one.

116
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,140
Give them a warning.

117
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,140
Warning!

118
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,140
Don't warn me.

119
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
You have no woke warning.

120
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,180
You're not allowed to say don't warn me.

121
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
You have a woke warning.

122
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,940
Russia hates wokeness.

123
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,820
Now they do, but back when they had an army.

124
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,820
Back when they had an army?

125
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Yeah.

126
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,460
You're talking about the Cold War?

127
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
Yep.

128
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Alright.

129
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,460
Yeah, that's fair.

130
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
They probably loved wokeness back then.

131
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,460
That's what the Cold War was about.

132
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
It was about wokeness versus Americanism.

133
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,460
I got, I watched a video of the Cold War.

134
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,460
I watched the video.

135
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
I watched the video.

136
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,140
I got I watched a video the other day that was a bunch of it was like every

137
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:09,240
time that I think it was a very testy and videos like every time that the like a

138
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,780
nuclear bomb got lost or like almost exploded and I thought I thought it was

139
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,460
gonna be like three times no it happened like 75 times gonna end yeah one of

140
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,740
these times it's gonna be really bad news it's going it only gets worse one of

141
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,160
one of them was they were they were flying

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,500
a nuclear warhead around like just around the Soviet Union for like no

143
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,280
reason yeah and then it dropped and just fell in the ocean. Yeah, they do that

144
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,860
all the time. Oh my it just dropped in a plane yeah broken arrow. That's what

145
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,200
they call. There's one should not be touching them. There's one that's in

146
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,960
North Carolina that there I knew that there was one that was lost there, but I

147
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,300
thought they found it, but there was two one of them they found and took away the

148
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,180
other one they found it and then before they could pick it up, there was a flash

149
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,420
flood that covered it in like a hundred feet of of earth and so and

150
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:09,780
it's it is primed and ready to go, but there's a switch on it that needs to be

151
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,260
turned on. So they put instead of going and trying to find it, they just put a

152
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,900
giant slab of concrete over the place where the bomb is.

153
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,900
There should not be.

154
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,500
And they just hope there's never an earthquake.

155
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,740
In, since I've seen Oppenheimer, there should not be a nuclear bomb anywhere.

156
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,980
There should not be, I don't know why the hell we even have those.

157
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,500
Well they're cool, they're the coolest bombs on earth.

158
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
They're the coolest, I don't, you know what, I'm going to say it, I don't fuck with them.

159
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,700
Nah, me neither.

160
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,220
I don't fuck with a nuclear bomb.

161
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
You guys want disarmament?

162
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,220
You're one of these hippie, hippie, uh, yuppies.

163
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Absolutely.

164
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
That's right.

165
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Who like lattes and nuclear disarmament.

166
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,220
I am one of these.

167
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,220
I love trail mix.

168
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
Okay, Mr. Russian.

169
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Yeah.

170
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
I'm a Russian.

171
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,220
Mr. Russian Socialist.

172
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,540
I'm a Russian Socialist and I want to destroy the world with thousands of nuclear bombs

173
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,700
if somebody tries to make a white Spider-Man movie again.

174
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,580
If they make a white Spider-Man, I will destroy the world with nuclear bombs.

175
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,580
There will be.

176
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
There will be.

177
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,820
Because of my woke social agenda.

178
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,940
There will be the complete and total destruction of Earth.

179
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,540
If they make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with a green turtle.

180
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,820
A green girl turtle.

181
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,780
They just made one of those.

182
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
Without not the girl part.

183
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,780
I hear that this Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie is actually quite interesting.

184
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
I heard that it's...

185
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,140
It's pretty good if you're 7 years old I think.

186
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,580
I hang out with 7 year olds.

187
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,940
I went to see it with Alex.

188
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,820
You're doing one of those French crimes aren't you?

189
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,820
No.

190
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
No,

191
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,560
you're sneaking into the movie theater like

192
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:53,060
now I don't eleven year old boy bag to put down to the front row, putting a bag

193
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,620
over a kid. Wow yeah, hey screw me for being in the big brother program.

194
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,580
That's what you think the bigger and the big uncle program.

195
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,220
The big uncle program, this is the uniform, the

196
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,900
bopper program. If you keep talking because I will kill you, you mean we're

197
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,040
going to be famous musicians. No, I will be throwing you famous musicians playing

198
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,020
directly into the ground. We're going to have that stupid fucking song where we

199
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,140
talk into a telephone. I never learned a single big bopper song. I just think is

200
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,640
a stupid name and I'm at a really big mouth sucks.

201
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,860
Why do you buddy Holly sucks? Why are you talking so high sucks all these

202
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,540
fifties song? Are you sounding like more like crap?

203
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,040
They all suck like crap.

204
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Jay Leno?

205
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,380
Why did you go so high when you just, you're like, yeah, those guys suck.

206
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,380
Those guys suck!

207
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Those guys suck like crap!

208
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,380
Those guys really suck like crap!

209
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,660
Weird.

210
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
I hate 50s crap so much.

211
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,580
I think it's so gay.

212
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,420
I think when they have like a 50s themed diner, it's like, shut the fuck up.

213
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,060
What's wrong with the, you don't like Johnny Rockets?

214
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,060
No, fuck that.

215
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,940
I thought you were talking about music, or you just don't like the 50s?

216
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,020
I don't like any of this 50s crap.

217
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
Unless it's a car.

218
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
A 50s car is cool.

219
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
What about cool stuff from the 50s?

220
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Like what?

221
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
There's nothing.

222
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
Like the fridges?

223
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,020
The fridges are cool.

224
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,020
And the princesses are cool.

225
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
You don't like those fridges?

226
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,420
I think they did it better in the 60s and 70s.

227
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
What about the family unit?

228
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Family unit, buddy?

229
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
I'm one of these...

230
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
What about a sexual family unit?

231
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
You don't fuck with that?

232
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,620
I do not fuck with that.

233
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
So you gay?

234
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,300
I do not fuck with the nuclear family and I do not fuck with nuclear bombs.

235
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,660
What about Walt Disney World?

236
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
Fuck that gay bullshit.

237
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,160
the shit

238
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,540
man calling everything fucking gay, you're warning homophobia morning.

239
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm becoming you think that you think that the I'm becoming family unit is

240
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,940
gay. I think that when a man and a woman have a son, okay, what about daughter?

241
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,900
What about a dog in a yard? I think that that's all gay, and I think that if you

242
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,000
you have a little thirteen inch TV in your living room that you can watch how

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,680
to duty on that's even gayer. So you think TV's gay. I think that way as

244
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,480
bullshit. You just said you think TV television yeah, we're talking about the

245
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,880
same TV. If it's black and white, if it's a black and white show from the

246
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,960
fifties, that's some gay bullshit, but if it's a color show called solar

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,960
I'm talking about TV. If it's a colored show called

248
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:35,440
black and white is gay bullshit, but don't show in white stuff. How do you

249
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
say a colored show? Jeez, what do you mean God? There's black and white and

250
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
colors. There's black TV and there's white TV. No, there's color programs and

251
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:43,980
there's

252
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,920
what do you get it? What are you saying? What are you saying that I'm sounding so

253
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,760
racist and I'm sounding and where is this or opposite how Justin Roiland fit

254
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,480
into this, which that's all that's all colored. That's all colored in

255
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,680
okay colored in I'm starting to understand. What do you mean? What was I

256
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,080
saying? That's wrong. We thought you were saying something completely different.

257
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,400
What

258
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,160
basically we thought that you were saying that you were you were thinking

259
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,880
hold on. I just thought I said that I thought that the fifties is gay bull

260
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,520
crap and you thought that I was calling something colored. You know what they

261
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,480
said back in the 50s? They said there was difference between coloreds and whites.

262
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,040
That is gay bullshit.

263
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:40,120
Yeah, different water fountains, that is gay. Segregation is gay bullshit. Wow.

264
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,160
We should send you back then, 'cause actually that would actually work really

265
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,760
down like white guys in the 50s. Yeah. Like stop all this different bathroom

266
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,280
shit. This is gay. This is fucking gay bullshit. What is this red lining?

267
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,480
What is it? You want this red line to go in your ass? Are you gay?

268
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,760
Yeah. And they would have been like, "Oh, well, I'm not." Yeah. Herbert Hoover

269
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,000
would have taken off his lady clothes. Yeah.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,440
Was it? No, J Edgar Hoover. J Herbert Hoover was the inventor of vacuum.

271
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,400
Invented a vacuum. Yeah.

272
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,760
But he probably wore lady clothes too. I think they all did. I think all

273
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,240
all of those like big as over 50s men, all those named Hoover 50s fops all

274
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,000
dressing like I'm tired of these 50 fops. They're not gay. They're

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,600
can't call them gay. I can't call it gay bullshit because that'd be mean. Do you

276
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,320
guys? Did you that'd be a that'd be a hateful crime?

277
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,960
A fop you think call to call a fop gay? Why the pejorative would be a hateful

278
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,880
crime? Why is your voice sound like that? I don't know.

279
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,840
I think I got choked up thinking about, I think I was about to cry thinking about hateful

280
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
crime.

281
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,160
How bad you might hurt a fop's feelings.

282
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Yeah.

283
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
We need more fops in this world.

284
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,960
News flash, fops don't have feelings.

285
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,840
Fops don't care about your feelings.

286
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,680
A fop is like a guy with long hair.

287
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
He's a dandy.

288
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,680
A fop is a dandy or a Nancy.

289
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Moe, okay.

290
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,640
A dandy or a Nancy.

291
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,200
But what do those mean?

292
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
What a dandy and Nancy?

293
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,720
The fraternal order of police.

294
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Hey.

295
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,420
he looks he looks really scary.

296
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,220
This is not what I think of when I think like disgusting, fobbish

297
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
gentlemen, yeah, search fobbish

298
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,520
fobbish dandy.

299
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Fobbish dandy.

300
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,320
This is a fob. Who's this bloke? These blokes are fobbish dandies.

301
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,620
These you've never heard of these fellas. I mean I've heard it, but I

302
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,220
guess I didn't know that it was I thought it was more of an insult. I

303
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,220
I am sick of seeing, by the way,

304
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
I don't know if it's like a Dungeons and Dragons class you could be.

305
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,220
I'm, I'm, I don't, I keep getting political on here.

306
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,220
I keep calling stuff gay bullshit.

307
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
I'm tired of seeing motherfuckers in Bushwick walking around like this.

308
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
True.

309
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
These Bushwick ass motherfuckers walking around

310
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
in these clothes.

311
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,220
It's really just one element away from being dressed up like a geisha.

312
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Yeah.

313
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,220
Maybe the hair would just be a little different.

314
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
Bro, you, you see, you walk into a coffee shop

315
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,260
walk into a coffee shop in freaking Bushwick,

316
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,580
and you see a guy behind the counter dressed like this.

317
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,740
- Alabaster white faces with rosy pink cheeks.

318
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,180
Get away from me, bro.

319
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,340
- But you know they make some crazy ass coffee.

320
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,820
- Yep, and you know that they have.

321
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,260
- You know they make the best coffee.

322
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,760
- Some of the best taste in music you've ever fucking heard.

323
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,500
- Is this Bell and Sebastian you're playing?

324
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,140
No, is this Mozart's "The Great Bard?"

325
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,420
Damn, is this a new harpsichord track you're playing?

326
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,940
(laughing)

327
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
I wonder what these guys are doing, these three.

328
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,940
I think that they are at a basketball game.

329
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Yeah, they're next to them as a normal guy.

330
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Next to them, it looks like a Emile Hirsch.

331
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Don't even get me started on that.

332
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,940
Look at that fucker.

333
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,940
He's good friends with Sean Penn.

334
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
One of them's wearing some kind of Fitbit or smart watch.

335
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
No, it's one of those...

336
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
That is a fighting bracelet.

337
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
No, it's one of those anti-sea sick bracelets.

338
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Are they on a boat, maybe?

339
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Yeah, maybe they're on a boat.

340
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,520
coffee shop. Look, there's a coffee cup next to them. They are and I told you

341
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,140
these are these are baristas. Yeah, three pop is dandy to attend the Chicago

342
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,600
Bulls, New York Knicks game on

343
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:23,140
I never knew that. I thought that they just dress like this guys. We just ate

344
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,740
the onion.

345
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:30,700
God damn it. Fuck fucked up. That screws my life up in a major way. On Halloween

346
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,660
night, you think I'm going to dress up as a real actual lifestyle of a person.

347
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,820
yeah, I'm going to make someone's culture my costume. That's like me.

348
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,260
That's like me dressing up like like my word

349
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,360
Evans

350
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm going to start. I gotta start saying my word again. Yeah, I think that I

351
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,500
need to start Scott. I say I say my word sometimes. I think he gads he gads is

352
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,700
not as good as my words. Zoons? You mean zooks? No, you're thinking of gadzooks. I'm saying

353
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:17,140
zoons. That's Shakespearean. Zoons? Z-O-U-N-D-S. Zoons. I was like zounds and then zoons would

354
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,380
be tunes to sounds. Zoons is short for God's wounds. That'd be like me dressing up like

355
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:29,940
an emo. You took that long to think of that? It didn't feel, it wasn't that long. It was

356
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,400
pretty long and that'd be like

357
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,300
me dressing up like an emo or a cinephile.

358
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,540
You dress like a cinephile right now, a child's in a file.

359
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,740
Okay, just seen the new Winnie the Pooh.

360
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,460
I've just seen

361
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,900
rocking up

362
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,100
standing up at the end of cars for Bravo.

363
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,180
There's a report that the car, the cars for premier got a ten minute standing

364
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,100
ovation from one guy, one guy like it's a

365
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,060
fucking con premier.

366
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,500
It's just in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, it's like a movie theater and

367
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,540
fucking the first showing in Illinois got a forty five minutes standing

368
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,720
motivation. Get the guy out of the from a man named Bruce Mies

369
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,200
local film critic

370
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,900
for Highlights Magazine, Bruce Mies, we're literally describing

371
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:43,640
M. E. C. Yeah, I guess that is him. Oh my God, but he's a but he's an adult

372
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,600
now. Yeah, that's what I mean. My buddy still goes. He still does little kid.

373
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
Oh, he doesn't loves kids. Move he has a new where my buddy released his top

374
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,720
I don't know. You guys probably missed this. He releases top 50 SpongeBob

375
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,840
episodes. Yeah. Oh, God. That's not even I did miss that. I would have been all

376
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,160
over that. I sent it to you guys. Oh, I need it. It's a nice girl.

377
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,040
I stopped cooking links a while ago. I think I sent it as a picture. Oh, so if

378
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,200
it was a link, I think I would have not. I don't look at photos because I don't

379
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,200
like. I mean, I don't I'm just saying I always get worried that when with photos

380
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,240
there, maybe one of those ones where you blur your eyes and it looks pornographic.

381
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,720
So I just don't look at them.

382
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,560
If you don't look at them, you're more likely to blur your vision.

383
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,520
If I even see a square, any squares I don't look at.

384
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,660
Because I think that's cheating.

385
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,900
My buddy was telling me though that he works somewhere in LA and Lights Camera Jackson

386
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,240
is in there all the time.

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,240
He works at some PR thing or something.

388
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,840
something, but he was telling me that like he has like multiple times

389
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,640
interacted with lights, camera Jackson.

390
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,680
And I was so, I don't think I've ever been more jealous of somebody in my life

391
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,240
to not even like Bill Gates, billionaire guy.

392
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,920
Like, no, I would not want to be Bill Gates.

393
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,480
How ironic is it guys that Bill Gates is a bill you in there.

394
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,960
They named the money after him.

395
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,240
This is the height of ironic of irony.

396
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,400
Wait Gates windows.

397
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,080
A window is a type of gate and you know, and I just downloaded a picture of a

398
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,080
door and you know his house has gates on it. Wait, build door. Wait, he built his

399
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,120
house. Wait, he played builders game on a windows PC. I'm playing it on a windows

400
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,320
PC. He built when he player character. Wait, can you look up bill gates middle

401
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,040
name right now, please? This is very important. It's danger.

402
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:49,160
William Henry Henry. He gets hen when he's hangry when he's hungry.

403
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,020
Snickers. You should have a Snickers bill. You're not acting like yourself.

404
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,400
You're not making any money today. Yeah, wait three. Wait, Bill Bill Bill Gates

405
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,400
the three. That's actually that's actually scary and your character's name

406
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,540
could be Henry

407
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:11,340
and his wife's middle name is French. That's her way. Her Melinda French Gates

408
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,160
Wait, building a French gate to keep this guy out. No, that's not his French

409
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,860
style. Crime Marie. No, crime Marie is a good. We should call this office the

410
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:30,540
crime. Marie crime Marie. Melinda me, Linda, Linda. Hey, she made her. She's

411
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:36,000
a caveman or a cave woman. I'm so sorry. Melinda French Gates. Whoa. And that

412
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,500
second picture right there is Bill Gates and Baldur's Gate three. Yeah, that's

413
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,180
That's what he looks like. Do you guys think that he's spreading microchipped

414
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,420
mosquitoes around this universe? I saw him dumping them out of his helicopter

415
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,100
over my house. I saw that too. They destroyed my road last night. My mom

416
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,660
texted me two weeks ago and said be careful of the mosquitoes. They are

417
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,260
Bill Gates mosquitoes and I was like, okay, welcome to the barbecue

418
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:08,420
motherfucker. Mom, you are concerned about these Bill Gates mosquitoes. You

419
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,960
have five Amazon Alexas in your house.

420
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
She...

421
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Mm-hmm.

422
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,520
What the fuck?

423
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,180
What the fuck is that?

424
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,380
You're roasting your own mom right now.

425
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,540
You're concerned about the Bill Gates mosquitoes?

426
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Buddy...

427
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
Bill!

428
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Bill!

429
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,020
You got a Bezos phone in your house.

430
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,100
He's not really roasting.

431
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
This is kind of just good.

432
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,700
I mean, just be like, "Bill Gates, you need to lose..."

433
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Or, "My mom..."

434
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,180
Bill Gates mosquitoes, how about you...

435
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
You need to lose weight, stop eating taquito.

436
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:46,820
Keto. Mama, you stupid fat. That's you when you sit on the couch. That's yeah,

437
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,980
when you lay on your bed, your springs break out of the couch. The springs

438
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,580
breaking on the couch in the motherfucking mattress, Mom. See,

439
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,860
that's how I would roast a mom. Or maybe I'd be like, "Hey, Mom, guess

440
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,300
what? Your cooking isn't all that good anymore." She's not the one that cooks

441
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,620
in the house. "It used to be better. Your dad cooks." She's not the one

442
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,940
that cooks. You did an invalid roast. Well, but it's an invalid roast.

443
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,280
I didn't your mom was not an invalid. She you know what happened in the last

444
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,740
couple of weeks going on. Why am I getting warning? Can't say the word

445
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,480
in the wood? You can't say he said that first. No, I thought it was clear.

446
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,300
Don't start an argument.

447
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:25,400
You are the closest thing to God. Yeah,

448
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,940
Jesus, it's making me really scared of his position. So he has all of the power.

449
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,860
This is an unfair. I

450
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,600
I could give you guys a little like maybe there's an app on the phone where you

451
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,920
guys can trigger some of the sounds yourself. Yeah, something I wish we could

452
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,520
all have the that would be such a bad. I do think it would be bad, but I do wish

453
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,900
that because one day we could just do an episode. It's just the day is the

454
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,460
battle. Yeah, yeah, or maybe we could rotate it. Yeah, because the most of the

455
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,940
levels just stay the same. Yeah, it's pretty. It's really just the sound and

456
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
the Julio levels that need to change. Yeah,

457
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,540
ever. Yeah, I mean morning.

458
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,260
Oh, my

459
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
God!

460
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
See?

461
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,700
Why did that scare me so badly?

462
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,260
I actually just got humanly terrified.

463
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,260
Yeah.

464
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,260
Well.

465
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
Welt.

466
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Welt.

467
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,260
Wait.

468
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Oh.

469
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I forgot.

470
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
How did we not talk about this already?

471
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
What?

472
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
These aliens.

473
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,260
Oh, the Mexico were released on the same day that we were released.

474
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
The same day that we were released.

475
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,260
But we didn't even get to talk about them, man.

476
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,260
Yeah.

477
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,740
Those little fucking dusty ass white pieces of shit aliens going down to the beautiful

478
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:41,640
Mexico City and gentrifying it. Did we talk about this? These little white bastards?

479
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,900
You think these are universal digital nomads?

480
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:51,380
These are Gringalians. And they are coming in to beautiful Mexico.

481
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,180
They're going to Tijuana. They're fucking prostitutes.

482
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,340
They're asking, they're saying, "Can I get a taco? Can I get a nacho?"

483
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,940
Wait, taco is exactly how Jubio says taco.

484
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,940
No way.

485
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
He says "deco".

486
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Really?

487
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
He says "deco".

488
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Say it right now.

489
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
Deco.

490
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
That's literally what he said.

491
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,620
I was saying it with a British inflection though.

492
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,620
I was saying "taco".

493
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,620
Taco.

494
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Can I get a taco?

495
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Can I get a taco and some nachos?

496
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
Tesco.

497
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,620
Tesco.

498
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,620
And a gordita crunch wrap.

499
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Rip.

500
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,620
Rip.

501
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,860
Yeah, I hate how people want foreigners to go to Mexico and the way they pronounce gordita

502
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,580
crunch wrap when ordering at street food.

503
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Me too.

504
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
Yeah.

505
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
Well that gordita is a real thing.

506
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
Can I get a cheesy potato burrito?

507
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
A gordita is real.

508
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,580
Can I have a grilled cheese taco?

509
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
Can I get a supreme crunchwrap please?

510
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
Excuse me.

511
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
And cinnabon twists please.

512
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
Pronounce it right.

513
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
My abuela's cinnamon twists.

514
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,580
Oh my god.

515
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,580
You guys should try my abuela's

516
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Baja Blast. It is fucking

517
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
insanely good.

518
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,580
My abuela makes the most amazing

519
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:02,180
You are not, you know what, I'm not going to listen. If you are not from Jalisco, I do not

520
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,180
want to hear your opinion on Baja Blast. You guys don't really have an abuela, right? Yeah,

521
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:14,260
you do have an abuela. I forgot about that. Who? My abuela. Who is that? My abuela. Birria

522
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:21,860
is from Jalisco. You have a Spanish grandmother? Mexican. Can you confirm? What? Yes. Yes?

523
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,860
I was right about that? Look at me, my little foodie ass.

524
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,860
You little fruity ass.

525
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
What the hell?

526
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,860
What were you guys even talking about just now?

527
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,860
We were talking about, I was talking about the origin of birria.

528
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,860
And you were talking about your abuela, which actually...

529
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
Yeah, you were bragging that you had it.

530
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Can you tell me about your abuela's birria?

531
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,860
I just think it's funny. I never thought it was funny until I grew up and found out it's funny to have an abuela.

532
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,740
Does your abuela make birria or maybe some kind of other food that we can transition

533
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,540
this into your abuela stuff?

534
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
What?

535
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
What are you saying?

536
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,260
I spaced out for the first half of that.

537
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,860
What kind of food does your abuela make?

538
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
I don't know.

539
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
She doesn't live here.

540
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,500
She doesn't live in Mexico?

541
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,540
No, she used to live in New Mexico, but now she lives in Baltimore.

542
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,100
Oh, shit.

543
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,680
- Ooh, okay, so she's making birria crab.

544
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,940
(laughing)

545
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,700
- That is so repulsive.

546
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,240
- Birria softshell crab.

547
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,740
- Oh my God, pulling apart, ugh.

548
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,860
- I don't know, I think that that could maybe,

549
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,380
if you put Old Bay in the birria,

550
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,940
it's not true birria, but it could work.

551
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,380
- It takes so much to make fucking crab

552
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,080
and lobster and shit taste good.

553
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,920
It takes so much butter.

554
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,740
- No, all it takes is a little bit of butter.

555
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,860
it takes a ton of butter. It takes an entire childhood to make lobster and

556
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,380
crab taste good. That's true. I didn't eat it. I mean, I would catch crabs. Is

557
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,540
that what you took from from what I just said? You think you have to make it for

558
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,420
the span of a childhood? No, it takes a whole childhood to make. Is that no? No,

559
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,260
I think you're saying it takes a whole childhood for you to think it tastes

560
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,980
good. Yeah, it does, though. What do you mean if you don't grow up with it? You

561
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,460
won't like it? Oh yeah, all right. I get that I caught crabs, but I didn't eat

562
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,820
them because they were weird to me and I was vegetarian, but we'd catch them with

563
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,700
their t shirts, but they were like nasty crabs. I think yeah you have

564
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,380
show them their t shirt that says come here

565
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,020
I'm with crab

566
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,460
free money for

567
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,340
wait.

568
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,140
I just thought it was crazy that they boil a boil and alive. How cruel is

569
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,380
yeah

570
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:36,220
practice something that stuck in my mind forever from how horrific it is. Is my

571
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,900
mom who's so nice and kind and would never hurt any living creature brought

572
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,840
home a live lobster and put it on the ground for our dog to play with. I was

573
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,260
scolding her for it when I visited home this pet because we were eating

574
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,640
lobster. I was thinking about again. That is the most evil thing I've ever

575
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,280
seen someone. Did she when she when she was like so horrible, did she cut

576
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,820
through the head or just throw it in? She's done both because when I learned

577
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,580
that the that it's not them screaming, when I learned that it's the pressure

578
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,180
like boiling their the meat in their shell. Yeah, that fucked me up. Yeah,

579
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,320
it's fucked up. It's better. Wait, it's better to kill them first. It's better

580
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,700
to know through the head, but you're saying it cut it open. So it has up

581
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,140
learning that it wasn't screaming. Yeah, you were like, well, that sound is

582
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,940
probably just screaming, so it's probably okay. Wait, it's

583
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,860
releasing from a shell. Yeah, wait, I don't understand either.

584
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,740
That fucked me up because it's imagine having that done to you. I guess you

585
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,960
Imagine screaming and pain because you're being boiled alive.

586
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,720
Yeah, that's easier to imagine than having a shell.

587
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,040
And like, oh, my air.

588
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,400
Wow.

589
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,200
I wish I actually made me feel really normal.

590
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,360
It actually made me feel good about killing all of them.

591
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,600
OK, you kill all of them.

592
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,880
Yeah, I do.

593
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,720
They endangered. No, they're not endangered.

594
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,960
Yeah, I mean, we definitely mean main lobsters are not endangered, but they

595
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,400
Main lobsters, they have a lot of rules. You have to like, if you catch one.

596
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,560
I watch the videos too. Of the guy who says, "Guys, this is a breeder. I'll clip her. I'll

597
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
give her a snack and I'll throw her back in."

598
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,560
Well, he doesn't call them breeders. He calls them, he calls them eggers.

599
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,480
You guys are so good at videos. I've never seen any of these videos you guys make.

600
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,440
Buddy, you need to start watching Dr. Insanity on YouTube.

601
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Dr. Insanity?

602
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,800
He has been making a lot of videos about the crips and the bloods.

603
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:38,880
When the cop realizes that he's arresting his own son, stuff like that.

604
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,660
Last night, you know when you realize like you don't have the whole thing where people

605
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,480
talking about their like fucking, is this Dr. Insanity?

606
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
No, it's not him.

607
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,960
It's like somebody was talking about videos they've seen and just like asking.

608
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,160
Rowe was like, "Have you seen the video of those three Chinese midgets singing on that

609
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
mountainside?"

610
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,440
I haven't seen that one.

611
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,760
He asked that and somebody was like, "What kind of fucking videos are you being shown?"

612
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,320
I was like, "Wait, you guys haven't seen that?"

613
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,120
I was like, "What the fuck?

614
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,760
No one here has seen these?"

615
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,920
Yeah, I don't know.

616
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,160
I don't get videos like that. Yeah, I guess you have to like mostly videos

617
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,320
about cute monkeys playing with cute dogs. That's what they were saying.

618
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,840
They saw the diseases that claim to them. There's two types of people in

619
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,640
the world. Now there's two. There's the people who see cute animal videos and

620
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,040
then there's people who see very interesting types of stuff going on in

621
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,040
China. I see some of the China videos too, but not that many. I kind of my I

622
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,320
had I had an old Instagram account and that one got completely taken over by

623
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,380
deformed babies and animals. I kind of made a pretty conscious effort. That's

624
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,180
crazy. But that means there is a kind of many of that content is a content tag on

625
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:01,080
Instagram. That is so nuts. You know what? The craziest thing is you can tell

626
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,320
that the algorithm lumps like you'll watch one of the you know, the dog that

627
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,560
has like no neck and he has like big shoulders. Yes, you watch one of those

628
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,180
videos like, oh, that's a funny looking dog. That's cute. And then you can tell

629
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,220
that Instagram thinks because you watch that you want to see like a baby with a

630
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,840
cleft palate, like struggling to breathe. You know what? I saw the same thing in

631
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,840
in the robot brain is like, oh, a deformed dog and a deformed baby. This

632
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,600
person must like deformities. I think that I'm in the direct middle ground

633
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,680
'cause you've probably sent me a few of those, and I saw this amazing video,

634
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,280
this dude in Brazil who has

635
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,720
his fingers are fused together into one big...

636
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,840
His fingers and toes are really long. Oh, that's cool. Really long,

637
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,640
like crab claw kind of things. Yeah. And he also had... His feet are

638
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,840
like that too, but he's an amazing skateboarder.

639
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Wow.

640
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,920
And I saw a video of him putting on, like you see his feet doing that, puts on a pair of

641
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,040
Crocs does a fucking sick ass back crook in his backyard.

642
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Wow.

643
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,120
I was like damn, even if you got a crab claw, you can still, you can still, the human, the

644
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,440
human spirit is so indomitable.

645
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Even if you're a Zoidberg.

646
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,880
Well, I would say he has more of a crab spirit than a human spirit.

647
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
He's like, interior is the crab.

648
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I don't think he has a crab spirit.

649
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I think he has a crab exterior.

650
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,680
The hands are important to the human soul.

651
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,680
He's like a crab in the sky. But it's the feet too. Crabs don't have claws for feet.

652
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Do you guys want to start wearing those natural shoes or whatever they're called?

653
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Toe shoes? Make our feet spread out? The ones that have barely their sole?

654
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:36,680
No, no, no. I'm talking about the ones that are like, because all of our toes are so squished in.

655
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,180
buddy. I'm not like something with a really wide like end, then your feet

656
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:45,000
end up being like giant triangles. I'm not wearing something like that. The

657
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,220
five toes and he runs like thirty miles in the woods every day. Buddy, you know

658
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:54,320
what I'm wearing? Cactus Jack, Captain Jack Flea Market, Captain Jack Flea

659
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,240
Market, Flea Market, Jordan Lowe's, Jordan Lowe's. I'm wearing the red

660
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,880
mischief boots. I'm wearing the mischief Crocs. Those things are so stupid. I'm

661
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,900
wearing all of the mischief shoes. I'm wearing the Shrek. What does Shrek have

662
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,860
on Shrek Crocs? Did you see these? These are a big viral. These are a viral shoe

663
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,660
that everyone is going crazy for. Is this what these have been viral? This is

664
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,260
ten years old. Viral shoe that have just gone viral. These are completely viral

665
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,820
right now. I'd wear those. Yeah, you would. Yeah, I would wear them if it

666
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,300
didn't have the Shrek logo on it so I could pretend they were for something

667
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,620
else.

668
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:38,380
Oh, I didn't even realize these were Shrek's. Oh, yeah, actually you're right.

669
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,760
I guess it does kind of look like Shrek. That's funny. Yeah. Wow. Weird.

670
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,860
Have you seen, okay, have you seen the JJJ jowned Crocs? What the hell are

671
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,060
these? Look these up. Look these up.

672
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,320
Imagine, okay, look these up.

673
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,680
Do they, okay. Imagine how much these are, like, show the price now. They're

674
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
probably expensive because they have that little piece of gold.

675
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,080
Yeah, actually, that's probably because you said imagine the price. Yeah, that

676
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,820
too, but I want to see the actually the actual price. $75.00. Isn't that crazy?

677
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,840
$75.00 for Crocs. That's pretty, but for like fancy looking Crocs, they're not

678
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,920
fancy looking. They have a little goal and they have a different. I mean,

679
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,640
they're like special Crocs. Those they are not even that special. They're like

680
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,400
a collab. Crocs are $50. Wait, are you serious? Yeah. What?

681
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,400
I said that they were like 30. I guess I've only bought the knockoff Crocs that are $5.

682
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,900
I have mine are second hand. I have the real Crocs, guys. I got mine from a 99 cent store.

683
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,920
My mom bought them for me, y'all. I have. Actually, I'm wrong. I ordered those myself

684
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,400
because I really wanted. And they're the only, one of the only two pairs of shoes I wear.

685
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,680
I wear my Crocs every day. They're really good for wearing outside briefly. Yeah. They're

686
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,040
like perfect. They're so much better than putting on. Now that the fall's coming up

687
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,320
and guys, it got a little cold, you're going to see my Crocs a lot more often. I might even

688
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,220
buy a second pair. I might buy a fashion pair.

689
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,900
Wouldn't you rather wear them when it's warm?

690
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,640
You should get those JJJound ones.

691
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,200
My move is, I might get them. My move is I wear big, big socks, big thick socks and my

692
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,440
Crocs and that's my fall shoes, y'all.

693
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,920
My Crocs are like three sizes too small for my feet.

694
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,520
Unless I'm doing something active AF.

695
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Mine hurt my feet when I wear them, so I can only wear them for a short burst.

696
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,020
I love them and they have comfort. I wear them to get my mail. My dad wears them in his house.

697
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,140
This JJJ jownd I learned about a couple years ago and then I was like really astounded.

698
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,700
It's $25 on the shirt for a gold thing.

699
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,200
The other stuff that they have is pretty expensive. It's just like a plain shirt.

700
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,920
That's still too much for a croc to be though.

701
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Yeah.

702
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,560
Yeah, I mean it's definitely a more expensive croc but it's not. When you said it was, guess

703
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,080
how much this is? I thought it was going to be $300.

704
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,040
You know who's their biggest hater is our buddy Eric.

705
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:01,160
Really? Yeah. Eric Howington, who lives at... You don't even know his address. I don't know his

706
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,240
address, yeah. Yeah, I do kind of... He is their like number one biggest hater. It is so funny.

707
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,840
For a long time... He's the only guy I can talk to about this. I mean, because it's probably the

708
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,000
most boring conversation you could possibly have. I hate the people who overcharge for

709
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,720
white t-shirts. This is like... I know. You're just doing what people said about APC like 10

710
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
ten years ago.

711
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,640
Yeah, you know what, you're right. I think that I've seen the errors of my ways just now.

712
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Thank you.

713
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
And I think that...

714
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,440
Every conversation about fashion is just, "This shirt's cool. This pants is too expensive."

715
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Yeah.

716
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
That's kind of the...

717
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
That's always it is.

718
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Every conversation about mostly anything...

719
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Anything that you can buy.

720
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,440
...is either like, "This is good. This is bad. This is overpriced. This is cheap."

721
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,440
There's no middle ground on clothes. It's not, "Oh, that's okay."

722
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Explain what you mean.

723
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Oh.

724
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
It's always, "This sucks."

725
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
I was about to say, there's nothing between shirts and pants.

726
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,020
There's nothing between shirts and pants.

727
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Yeah, I was like, "Buddy, there's a belt and a cummerbund."

728
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,720
There's a lot between my shirts and my pants.

729
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,320
A sash. A girdle.

730
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,360
A girdle.

731
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,640
My...

732
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,080
What's that other one called? My corset?

733
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,120
A middler.

734
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,380
My cummerbund.

735
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,900
I already said cummerbund.

736
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,820
I have another segment of my body like a centipede.

737
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,920
I'm an insect, so I have two torsos,

738
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,940
so I can wear two shirts and one pants.

739
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,400
You need a middler.

740
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,180
I wish I had two stomachs.

741
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,980
Why?

742
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
One for sweets, one for healthies.

743
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Everyone has that.

744
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,400
We've talked about the dessert stomach so many times.

745
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
We've talked about it?

746
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,000
I would say we are some of the foremost researchers on the dessert stomach.

747
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
How you can eat...

748
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Can we do like a...

749
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I could go to Olive Garden, I could have 40 bowls of fucking brajul.

750
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Rice.

751
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And more 40 bowls of rice.

752
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He's trying to show off his Italian heritage.

753
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm brajul.

754
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I could have 40 bowls of soup.

755
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I could have 40 bowls of fagiola.

756
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Fagiola.

757
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,960
I could have 40 bowls of Alfredo spaghetti. I didn't do that at all. And then I go and

758
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,600
I'm going to say bread steaks. I didn't say this. Okay. You guys are doing some Italian

759
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:10,640
Elon Musk stuff. Okay. Very, very funny. I get to have 40 and days meant I could have

760
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
I love those.

761
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Those taste like toothpaste, but I love them so much.

762
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
I could be so full to my brim.

763
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,640
The soup could be gurgling up my throat.

764
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
We've got to go to Olive Garden.

765
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
If they say, "Would you like some fried ice cream?"

766
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
I'd go, "Yes!"

767
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
One second, let me turn this crank on my chest

768
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
and switch which direction my esophagus is.

769
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Like an iPhone game.

770
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Exactly.

771
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
I think that we should go to Olive Garden.

772
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
I would love to.

773
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,140
We should go company lunch. I'm trying to think where the closest one is. There is one. No, wrong.

774
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:53,340
There is one only 20 minutes away up north in Woodside. I'm down. I love Olive Garden. One of my favorite locations.

775
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,240
We can go and get the endless breadsticks. I only went that one time.

776
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,940
He only went that one time and he got yelled at because they thought he brought methadone in. Oh, yeah.

777
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,040
yeah, well we'll see

778
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,300
they gave him a sample lemonade.

779
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,680
There's a funniest thing ever. They gave him a sample pink lemonade at like at

780
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,420
the entrance and then we sat down and we're sitting there and he's got this

781
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,300
little cup with a pink liquid in it and the waitress comes up and she's like

782
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,100
hey everybody you, but you can't not bring that shit in here

783
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:32,100
and to her credit. I was you know long haired, not shave probably beard down my

784
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,540
neck, probably had a limit, a green military jacket, hadn't slept in day

785
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:35,880
yeah

786
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,600
frayed clothing yeah and also probably world weary stare

787
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,060
fiat

788
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:55,240
I know you work for I know you serve this country, but you cannot do that. It

789
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,400
was literally the most insane. She changed her accent. She changed

790
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,540
every way she got so and then I was like no. This is a sample you give it to

791
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,160
through the door and she's like oh, I'm so sorry. They just bring that stuff in

792
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,240
here all the time. She just yeah. It was next to a methadone clean it cleanly

793
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,300
the little neck. I don't think it was I must have been it was no. Is that like

794
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,060
the mall and like like south of in that like big shopping center with the movie

795
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:24,100
theater? So I where is that? I don't remember south of Boston, the downtown

796
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,700
somewhere in my brain. I think that like they'd somehow would remember me at a

797
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,220
different location. I'm like this is my free pass to bring in methadone in with

798
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,140
methadone they like you can't bring that here like no. I remember last time it's

799
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,780
pink lemonade. It is lemonade. Remember like last time. I don't even, I don't

800
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,020
even know methadone was pink. I don't think it, I have no idea what methadone

801
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,020
looks like. I couldn't tell you what it looks like. But I guess this is a

802
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,740
fucking lady knew. Yeah, I guess it's pink lemonade. Yeah. I mean. Speaking of,

803
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,780
have you had this new, Kim Kardashian has partnered with Aluhia Energy or

804
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,220
whatever the fuck it's called. She has the Kim Aid and it is the, I had it last

805
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,540
night I drank like 400 milligrams of caffeine before I went. I did that show

806
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,580
last night and I don't know why I was just really tired. Yeah, I didn't sleep

807
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:16,900
good and I that's the guy the craziest I've ever felt in my entire life. It was

808
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,940
on I was up on stage and I was just like doing donuts with my feet on stage just

809
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:28,660
walking around. So I was doing donuts dude. You had a you had a full panic

810
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:34,700
attack at the stand. I did. I did. I really did. It was crazy drink caffeine.

811
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,540
No, no, no, no. And I had three beers to try and cancel it out, but it did not

812
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,860
work.

813
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,740
Yeah. You think beer is an anti caffeine, but it actually will charge you. It's

814
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,620
a make you like doodle. It just makes you go like Chris Farley doodle kind of

815
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,420
thing instead of like what is hold on what

816
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,140
no one knows doodle God. Yeah, doodle God. You know, play doodle God. It's a

817
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,940
game where you combine things. You mean it's not that much doodling, though.

818
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,020
Well, no, the doodling is this that it's a it's a game that's in two

819
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,900
dimensions. Yeah, you played doodle. No, I haven't played doodle. God, you

820
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,500
wrote you up on the computer. You never played doodle. Basically, you can

821
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,260
get it. It's the best shit ever. You can combine game of all time. Wait,

822
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,940
didn't we play this on your we put this on your TV? It's with your brother.

823
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,520
Yeah, okay. Yeah, we played it. We played it on my mom's fucking TV. Now I

824
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,840
remember it. Yeah, shit's fun as fuck. It's great. Yeah, we were coming up with

825
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,420
what's wind mixed with rocks? Yeah. Oh, sand. Holy shit, that's amazing. Yeah.

826
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,320
Turn it off. Wait, he just... Shut it off, 'cause I'm gonna sit there. Turn it

827
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,680
off. You can't show us that you're playing it. Put it on a different monitor

828
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,580
if you're gonna do that. Just play it on your phone. Yeah. It's okay, we don't

829
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:41,900
mind.

830
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,920
We should... Yeah, you can't combine beer and caffeine. It does make you go

831
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,700
crazy. That's why they outlawed Four Locos. Yeah. 'Cause it was turning... You

832
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,220
That shit was turning Orange County into the Wild Wild West.

833
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,220
It already was.

834
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,220
With the Four Locos.

835
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,660
Orange County is like Huntington Beach and stuff, right?

836
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,660
Yeah.

837
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,180
Four Loco is turning that shit into...

838
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,620
I don't think it was Four Loco.

839
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,300
I think it was maybe the high skinhead population.

840
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,300
No, no, no.

841
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,980
People were doing Wild West duels with...

842
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:17,220
That's actually the scariest thought in the world is a bunch of Huntington Beach skinheads

843
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,300
jacked up on Four Locos.

844
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,600
Did you guys see that picture that somebody posted of like a guy with

845
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:29,460
really shitty line tattoos, like clearly a gay guy with like bad line work

846
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,820
tattoos? The doodles, the paper clip. And they were like,

847
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,900
"Okay, so this guy's a Nazi," and like 'cause he has like something that looks

848
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,660
like a black sun, but it's clearly, it's clear that he just is like

849
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,940
just a guy who saw like four tattoos on Instagram and thought they were cool,

850
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,600
and just put a bunch of lines all over his body. But they are pretty

851
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,020
very fortunate because one of them does look kind of like two S's. Oh,

852
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,540
but they're just like bad. Like that is it. Oh, wait, wait, wait, girl tattoo.

853
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,780
Yeah, yeah, the guy, the guy who has like they called them, they're like,

854
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,660
how are you going to be a Nazi and a pansexual? Yeah, yeah, it's like so I

855
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,780
mean, I don't know if that person like because they had, they had a thing

856
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,700
about they had a room on their chest. What it was, what it was. No, the

857
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,020
thing about the thing about Nordic ruins and the thing about SS bolts and the

858
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,380
thing about the black sun and the swastika is that if you are just

859
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:20,300
drawing lines, you're going to make one by accident. Yeah, and I remember like a

860
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,780
couple of years ago when you're just kind of

861
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,420
a man whose brain is cloistered from the world and you're drawing straight lines

862
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,260
on your body, you will eventually end up definitely, and I think a lot of I

863
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,980
think a lot of people who like try to find these these people from like

864
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,460
January six or whatever and be like, Oh, my God, they had a Nazi tattoo. They

865
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,180
don't realize that 90% of people get tattoos because they think they look

866
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,020
school and that is the end of their thought process.

867
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,540
Yeah. I would say that that is 95% of people.

868
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,900
There's no... If you research your tattoos before you get them...

869
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,460
All of them have some bad thing that is why they started that way.

870
00:46:59,460 --> 00:46:59,960
Exactly.

871
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,700
They've all been used in some crazy way.

872
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,200
Right.

873
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:08,020
And that was so funny when people would find people and be like, "Oh, this firefighter

874
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,860
has a Nazi crop or whatever."

875
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,980
I mean, it's happened to me.

876
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:18,100
every yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah spider web, but it's so fucking funny, but that

877
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,500
was just that one was making me laugh that he just got like tattoos that like

878
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,980
aunts get. I love seeing the I look at the

879
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:30,940
tattoo removal tips sub reddit. It's so funny to see the stuff that people want

880
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,660
to get covered up or people yeah people accidentally get like dicks and and

881
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,220
accidentally yeah they'll like get a design that they don't like either. They

882
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,280
they don't realize they ask for design and then they don't realize it or the

883
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,080
artist would just be really bad and they'll like somehow make it look like a

884
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,540
penis and yeah, it happens so much on the it's so fine. I seen this thing with

885
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,020
like swat like also another really good. Another really good resource for that is

886
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,440
the the people who get blood born tattoos, the game. Oh yeah, they get they

887
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,100
always get the gayest fucking tattoos where they just get like symbol like

888
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,180
video game tattoos already suck, but the blood born one suck because there did

889
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,140
people get them giant on their form, a huge like logo of the game, but they'll

890
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,160
also get people I've seen it like three or four times people will get like

891
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,860
there's like runes in the game to give you powers and one of the runes is

892
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,700
literally like a swastika, but with curves instead of corners. Oh, like it's

893
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,540
just people like three or four people. They're like no. I just got all the

894
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,560
runes from the games and they just have like a bunch of runes and like two of

895
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,080
them are just swastikas with curvy lines and all the comments are like

896
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,280
arguing over be some people being like no it's different. No one would make

897
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,560
mistake that for a swastika. It's curvy and everyone's like come on right.

898
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,680
I've seen the funniest cover up.

899
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,840
I think John posted it somewhere.

900
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,400
It was like a right here.

901
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,760
Memoriam for mom.

902
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,840
Covered up all Pokemon.

903
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,600
All the ghost Pokemon.

904
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,600
Could you clearly see it through?

905
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,200
It's like, it's like, it's like

906
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,200
Phantump and like

907
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,920
Capagrigis.

908
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,120
Have I ever told you about?

909
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,920
The original tattoo was like, like

910
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,920
"Rest in peace, Mom." And then it just--

911
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,620
Wait, he covered up his mom with Pokemon.

912
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,620
And it was Ghost Likes.

913
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,620
That is crazy.

914
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:24,620
Did I ever tell you guys about my friend's mom? I won't say who it is,

915
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:30,620
but you guys know his mom has a tattoo to honor her husband.

916
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,620
I don't think I've said it on the podcast, but she has a tattoo to honor her husband,

917
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:39,260
husband and it says his name rain over me and it's a bunch of rain drops all

918
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,100
over before and it looks like it's just come on or

919
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:49,580
like black and gray, just like come drops all over. Oh my God, I can't wait

920
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,380
to have a tattoo that I that I have to get covered up for some reason yeah

921
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,780
before because like not one that I'm like oh this looks lame. I don't like

922
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,020
this. I want to I want I want to eventually have something happen where

923
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,560
It's one of the tattoos I already have. I need to get it covered up and it

924
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,800
results in the worst looking thing of all time. I hope they never make tribal

925
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,320
some kind of hate symbol. Yeah. 'Cause I need more tribal tats, man. They're

926
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,920
just... You wanna get more tribal tats? I literally wanna be fully covered in

927
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,700
tribal tats. It's not a hate symbol, but there is the people who say you can't

928
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,080
get tribal tattoos 'cause you're not a part of that tribe. Tell me what tribe

929
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
about that. That was that's the slip. Not

930
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,400
right.

931
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,900
Yeah, that does look like the slip. Not

932
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,400
yeah, come on. Just realizing that now

933
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,200
that's actually so sick. Yeah, that is

934
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200

that movie did very well. The movie was one of the most incredibly high

967
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,840
grossing movies of 2020. That's true. Well, no movies came out in 2020. Well,

Every movie came out in 2020, oh yeah. And we gonna go back to the movies.

973
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,200
We're sitting in the theater and eating the popcorn and then I'm gonna go get

974
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,280
more or oh and then I put them in my shit and then I go take a shit and look at

975
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,200
tits on my phone in the bathroom looking at porn on reddit and then I'm gonna

976
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:28,720
make fucking jazz in the sink I'm gonna eat my own crap no at the movie I'm

977
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:35,920
gonna eat my own crap at that I got a robotic now that you're getting a war

978
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,560
that is actually I'm stealing the flow from the song Zelda are by Devon the

979
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,760
dude. Zelda. Zelda R. It's a song about Devon the dude meeting an alien and

980
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,660
smoking the weed with him. Would you guys smoking the weed? Would y'all go that hard for

981
00:53:50,660 --> 00:54:01,080
that bitch Zelda? No. Link is doing so much shit. You better stop and listen.

982
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,520
You better stop and listen. I can't believe that she gets the legend. And she dresses up like a ho.

983
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,920
She gets the legend because Link is actually destined to do that. But I don't

984
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,920
I'd be like, "Fuck you, fate."

985
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,920
Yeah, I'm gonna watch some TV.

986
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,920
Fuck you, fat Zelda. Lose some weight.

987
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,920
Yeah. Well, Sheik is actually...

988
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
Sheik is a boy.

989
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,920
She got no tits, no ass.

990
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,920
We need to get Zelda.

991
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,920
We need to feed her some

992
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,920
fucking goblin meat. We gotta get Zelda

993
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,920
a BBL. I'd be down.

994
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,920
She's like 13. A big legend.

995
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,920
Zelda is not, no, Link is 13. Zelda is

996
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,920
a full grown woman. Is like 100,000

997
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,920
years old or some shit. I think they both are.

998
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,040
Are they both 13?

999
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,040
37.

1000
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,280
37.

1001
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,280
Zero years old.

1002
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,360
Wait.

1003
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,600
Wait, what the hell?

1004
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,600
Six years old.

1005
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
Wait, what the hell?

1006
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,800
I thought that they were both.

1007
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,800
Oh, no, that's the age of the Legend of Zelda.

1008
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,840
How does the character Zelda go down?

1009
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,600
They they are.

1010
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,840
Well, OK, there's child.

1011
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,160
Well, you know, there's child Zelda and then there's adult Zelda.

1012
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,280
Exactly right.

1013
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,000
And adult Zelda is 16 years old.

1014
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Wait, no.

1015
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,520
Wait, this is why she look like that.

1016
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,520
Well, we didn't know that.

1017
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,120
I didn't play the games, dude. I don't know what I'm talking.

1018
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,620
Those games are trash and they're the worst games ever developed.

1019
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,620
You think the new Zelda games are trash?

1020
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,880
Yep. They're actually fun as fuck. You're crazy.

1021
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,420
No, I thought the new one was bad. I thought it was mid.

1022
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,260
I thought it was mid. That's right. It's mid.

1023
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,300
The first one was fire.

1024
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,560
The first one was mid too.

1025
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,300
You're stupid.

1026
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,180
The first one was fun, but yet mid.

1027
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,600
I like Majora's Mask.

1028
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,640
I never played any other ones. I'm going to get a Majora's Mask tattoo.

1029
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,900
Don't do that, man.

1030
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,640
No, please don't get a video game tattoo.

1031
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,240
Please, for the love of God, bro.

1032
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,900
the majority mask your drop. I'm going to get the bio shock logo on my chest.

1033
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,540
That would be sick. That's a

1034
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,060
daddy like to get one of those tattoos where it's like he's ripping out

1035
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,660
that'd be so

1036
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:53,740
video game tattoos or they really truly are the most corny thing. I'm going to

1037
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,880
get it just a giant. I need to get a giant Mario on my base. I need to get

1038
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,260
every getting a tattoo of Mario. I actually like that photo realistic new

1039
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,800
Super Mario Bros. Mar yeah, I kind of like

1040
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:14,580
I kind of like a like a two two and a half D like like Mario portrait or

1041
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:19,160
something on your leg bit Mario. That'd be so funny. That was going to get a

1042
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,960
screenshot from a video game. Yeah,

1043
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,480

1044
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,540

1045
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,980
right here. Yeah, just like a person. We're like, why do you have Mario over

1046
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,660
your heart?

1047
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:38,020
I don't know, man. Why do you have elephant Mario in your heart? I can't

1048
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,060
believe they made this Mario. They didn't make him yet. He's not out yet.

1049
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:44,460
The whole... What are you talking about? His game hasn't come out yet. What

00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,420
Yeah. Yeah, the entire... The whole entire belly. You should get a

1053
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:00,060
Crang tattoo like cranks and you're crying from ten year teenage mutant ninja

1054
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,820

1055
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,580
Refrain crane.

1056
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,580
What are you doing?

1057
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,140
I don't know.

1058
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:05,980
I got bored.

1059
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,620
You got bored of me telling you that you should get bored of him talking to you

1060
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,340

1061
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,300
Shut up.

1062
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:11,940
Okay.

Well, what do you want to don't put your that's tired.

It's not the same thing.

1066
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:21,620
Why are you holding that like that?

1067
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,420
I don't know, but I'm trying to sleep.

1068
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
Am I being a copycat or am I being a copycat?

1069
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,620
You are being a copycat.

1070
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,620
Wait, you two just copied each other.

1071
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,620
Wait, hold on.

1072
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,620
Wait, what's the whole...

Yeah, what does derezzed mean?

1075
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,620
Derezzed...

1076
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,620
resolution or something?

1077
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,620
Oh, ok. Derezzed means

1078
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,620
dead. Yeah, it means dead for

1079
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,620
a computer. Derezzed is the

1080
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,620
Daft Punk song. Yeah.

1081
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,620
That one go hard as fuck on that

1082
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,620
soundtrack. I think Daft Punk is made as well. Whoa, that's actually crazy.

1083
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,020
That's actually crazy of you. I don't give a fuck about dancing. I don't care

1084
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,320
about dancing. I love dancing. I love dancing. I like that was always the

1085
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,020
thing where my friend, some of my friends were into it in school and I was

1086
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:12,820
in like middle school. I was like, I didn't know anyone that was into it, but

1087
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,320
I assumed I just thought of it as like music from commercials and stuff.

1088
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,520
Discovery is yeah. I didn't get into them till like two years ago. I mean, I

1089
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,240
All their albums are sick.

1090
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,880
That song Superheroes, where it's just the Barry Manilow sample, that one is fire.

1091
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,700
The one with Get Lucky is sick too.

1092
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,760
Get Lucky, that's actually a good album.

1093
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
Yeah, I know.

1094
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
That was the only one I listened to.

1095
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
That one's good.

1096
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
That one came out when we were in high school.

1097
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:45,480
When I was in high school, when that came out, we went to this party and it was a high

1098
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,480
school party.

1099
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,480
Fuck!

1100
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,480
With girls?

1101
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
It was my friend Tyler's going away party.

1102
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,480
Where was he going?

1103
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,480
Military school?

1104
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,720
We got smoked weed and got in trouble?

1105
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,720
Yeah, probably.

1106
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,720
Oh, shit!

1107
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,720
But, oh yeah.

1108
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Instrument.

1109
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,120
Wait, he's making a Daft Punk song?

1110
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:07,000
We like went to this party, somebody had, you remember they had Xbox music or Zune music

1111
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
on the Xbox?

1112
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah.

1113
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,800
This, no, he didn't tell us his, like, he went upstairs and then like everyone was downstairs.

1114
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:21,120
The Xbox is on, he didn't log in, so somebody just put music on, but then it was like, they

1115
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:27,520
They played "Get Lucky" but then it was like a 30 second free sample snippet.

1116
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:33,080
But it looped for like 5 minutes.

1117
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:40,880
I was fucked up and I was like, "Can somebody shut the fucking song off?"

1118
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,960
I asked them to shut it off because it was...

1119
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,360
Can you imagine you're in a high school party basement?

1120
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,360
Oh yeah!

1121
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,360
as a

1122
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,720
hold on. Imagine you're at a party, though, but they keep playing. It's this

1123
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,520
it fades out and then it goes back in. So it's like

1124
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,280

1125
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,680

1138
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,040
My girlfriend got iced the other day at work. I did not think that that still happened.

1139
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,040
What other day when?

1140
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,040
Iced? When you get Smirnoff iced?

1141
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Oh, the thing where they hide the Smirnoff.

1142
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,040
Yeah, some old person told me about this recently.

1143
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,040
Yeah, that was a thing that my cousin was doing.

1144
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
They used to do that back in the 40s I think.

1145
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
Yeah.

1146
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
I never heard of that.

1147
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
Yeah, they never did that.

1148
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,040
Yeah, it was like in the 20s, 30s, and 40s.

1149
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,040
It was back in the Roaring 20s.

1150
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,040
Apparently people used to get Smirnoff iced, which means you hide a Smirnoff ice somewhere

1151
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,740
somewhere and whoever finds it has to drink it.

1152
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:47,740
Which these days, I would do this with probably water.

1153
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,240
Nowadays, they do it.

1154
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:49,740
Or an app.

1155
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,740
You have to hide an app and you have to die.

1156
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,240
You have to open it.

1157
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:52,740
Huh?

1158
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,240
They would do it nowadays with Prime.

1159
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
KSI and Logan Paul probably would.

1160
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,240
You would get Primed.

1161
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,740
But why don't we do that more?

1162
01:01:58,740 --> 01:01:59,740
Because that kind of thing is funny.

1163
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:00,240
Yeah.

1164
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,740
Hiding things and finding them.

1165
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,740
But I do not like smearing off ices.

1166
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:03,740
We should start icing each other.

1167
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,240
No.

1168
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,240
I don't wish to do that.

1169
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,240
We're going to start icing each other.

1170
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,240
I don't like smearing off ices though.

1171
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,240
You guys, be prepared to get icing.

1172
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:14,240
We should Colt 45 each other. A 40 ounce of malt liquor.

1173
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,240
We haven't done an Edward 40 hands episode.

1174
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,240
Because he wouldn't be able to use the soundboard.

1175
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,240
Well, we could have...

1176
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,240
He had 40s on his hands?

1177
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,240
He could have both.

1178
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,240
Also, I would not survive that.

1179
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,240
Edward, that's not that great.

1180
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,240
I wouldn't survive it.

1181
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,240
I would take his hand, right?

1182
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
One 40 right here.

1183
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,240
Okay.

1184
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,240
One right here.

1185
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,240
Well, that's Edward 40 arm.

1186
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,240
Edward 40 arm.

1187
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,240
That's Edward 80 arm.

1188
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:44,520
Edward 80 arms. The last time I drank more than one beer I was hungover for the whole

1189
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:51,200
day the next day. You have a hummingbird's liver. I just don't drink and I'm proud of

1190
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,040
it. It makes me better. It makes you worse at drinking. But you know what? There goes

1191
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:02,040
his beer we just bought. Oh yeah. Well I don't really need to go through Caleb for it because

1192
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,200
Julio like I said he begs me to come on almost every week. I'm like dude that's your thing

1193
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,400
I don't really want to be. I don't want to like a coach on that. He doesn't beg you on

1194
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,400
to pick him on. The first few weeks he was obsessed with me coming on. He wouldn't stop

1195
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:18,520
asking me. He's obsessed with you. Well, but I still don't want to go on. I don't want

1196
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,680
to go on Monster Crazy. Oh, you don't have much time left and it's impossible for you

1197
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,920
to do so. Yeah, well, I don't want to go on. In fact, it's impossible for you to do so.

1198
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,400
It's impossible for you to go on Beers We Drink, even though I know tons. It would be.

1199
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,720
The problem is that it is possible, but I'm just saying no. No, it's really not possible.

1200
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,620
It is my new as the my new solo podcast. I mean the one at that time when you

1201
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:41,920
were gone, who we wanted me to know so bad. No, he didn't. Yeah, he did. He

1202
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,220
told me he was planning a prank on you. No, no, and he was gonna get he was

1203
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,820
gonna get you that he was playing a prank on you. So you don't even care.

1204
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1205
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:49,920
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1206
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,420
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1207
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:54,140
have you call in and then he was just not going to not answer or maybe get all of

1208
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,000
your ex-girlfriends on the zoom call and they were all going to laugh at your

1209
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,460
body. Yeah. Well, the funny thing is I said no, so I wouldn't even have fallen

1210
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,780
for the prank, but which it wasn't. So Julio just had to have sex with all the

1211
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:10,500
ex-girlfriends instead. Okay. He had cyber sex. All of them. Every last one.

1212
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:15,380
Every last one. All right. Well, no one gives a shit about my new solo podcast

1213
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:21,660
that I started writing. It's a narrative story podcast called Patrick and the Jitterbugs

1214
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,780
and it's about me and my world famous band and how we toured the world and then there

1215
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:32,900
was some infighting in the band and it's basically a docuseries about how me and the other jitterbugs

1216
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,020
don't talk but we're going to reunite for one final show.

1217
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,740
Didn't Blowback already do that?

1218
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,740
No.

1219
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,740
I'm pretty sure that was their last season.

1220
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,740
That was like the last season of Blowback.

1221
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,780
Blowback did not cover Patrick and the Jitterbugs.

1222
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,780
Yeah it was.

1223
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,780
They literally did.

1224
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,940
Patrick and the Jitterbugs. There's like giant explosion sound radio sound.

1225
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:55,660
You guys remember the Jitterbugs, right? Yeah. Well, so do we.

1226
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:00,340
Blowback season five. Season five, Patrick and the Jitterbugs.

1227
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:07,580
All right. All right. Oh, that's time. Let's plug our brand new upcoming show, guys.

1228
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:15,480
October 20th at Little Field in Brooklyn, 635 Sackett Street. We are

1229
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,040
doing another World's Biggest Army. A new sketch show. A whole new sketch

1230
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,640
show that we have writing. Underworld's Biggest Mummy, Port of Skull,

1231
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,880
Halloween City. It's a parody of the first show's name. But the sketches

1232
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,780
won't be parodies of the first show's sketches. There'll be funny sketches

1233
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:34,240
on there that will stand on their own whether or not you went to the other

1234
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,200
one exactly probably will do probably one thing to parody is a parody of the

1235
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,800
last show for us. Not every sketch has to be for you. In fact, most of them are

1236
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,560
for us. Most of them are. I mean, really, really, really. And of them only

1237
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:50,640
make you're just you go to this show to give us a com slash shows and we don't

1238
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,000
care if you laugh or not. Go to this website right now and you can care about

1239
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,200
is the money by a ticket. Wow, there it is. Uh huh. Oh, and then I am opening

1240
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:25,200
for

1241
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,720
But I will be doing a funny new character.

1242
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,000
Holy shit.

1243
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Alright.

1244
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,120
I'm bringing character stuff back.

1245
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,120
Bye bye my friends.

1246
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,120
Bye.

1247
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,600
Bye.

1248
