Every drop?

24
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800

25
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Not really, right?

26
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
What about the coins?

27
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
It was the Bitcoin casino, wasn't it?

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,920
The goddamn Bitcoin casino, dude.

29
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Are you kidding?

30
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,760
I lost $40.

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
No, dude.

32
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,320
I lost $40 fucking dollars at the Bitcoin casino, dude.

33
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,200
Dude, listen man, they got these slots, these fruity delicious slots.

34
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,600
They have these gorgeous grapes and these plump plums.

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,760
They got glamorous grapes and sumptuous strawberries.

36
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
How do you refuse?

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
I have to say, I lost some money gambling today too.

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Really?

39
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,320
I lost $20 at the arcade.

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Whoa.

41
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
Oh my gosh.

42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
By playing the games.

43
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
What game were you playing?

44
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,400
Dude, I played Terminator Salvation.

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,640
I played the Aliens.

46
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,240
I played House of the Dead.

47
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,880
I played Big Buck.

48
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
I played...

49
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,920
I mean that's not really a loss.

50
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,240
I didn't get a single ticket.

51
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,740
Yeah those are the games you get the tickets for.

52
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,400
That's why I lost them.

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,280
You should have just played the ticket games.

54
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,280
You should have played Skee-Ball.

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,400
$20 worth of Skee-Ball and then got a rubber ball.

56
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,840
You know how many tickets you would get?

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,360
Dude this place, I was at fucking Salem Willows.

58
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Have you ever been there?

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
No.

60
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,480
I went there the first time today.

61
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,640
And you know how much it was fucking 800 tickets for a bouncy ball like this.

62
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Damn, that's fucked.

63
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
It's insane.

64
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,880
Honestly, like when I did, they did have, they had, you could pay one token and they have

65
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,000
little animatronic monkeys that danced around and play a song.

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Dude, so I did do that.

67
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm thinking about it like honestly, like gambling, like slot machines is a more entertaining

68
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,680
and more cost effective like form of gaming than arcades.

69
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,160
Okay, but did you get the bonus game where you have to shoot 35 electric eels with a plastic rifle?

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,960
No, you didn't. They don't have that on slots. I got a bonus game. It's for lolly. You get to press the button at the

71
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,580
End of the Terminator gun and it shoots a grenade and blows up the Terminators. All right

72
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,200
Let me let me paint a picture for you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. All right first row six gorgeous grapes

73
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,480
Second row two pink jellies two lollipops, right?

74
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,080
Next couple rows nothing, but then bang bang two more lollipops. I'm in the bonus. That's okay

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,120
That's 10 free spins. Wait! The 10 free spins begin. I start getting gorgeous jellies pink and blue. I start getting

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,480
Yellows, that's what I call bananas when I'm gaming and I'm starting

77
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,320
I'm getting so many bananas and then when they all drop then a bomb a candy bomb explodes

78
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:17,920
That's a multiplier, right? And that was on an 8 cent win. I just won 80 cents on a $40 bet.

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Let me ask you this though, okay?

80
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,120
How are you gonna reload? Okay, are you put your point your plastic gun outside the screen and pull the little trigger?

81
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,520
Do you touch the clip? Do you touch the magazine? Do you?

82
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:37,500
Reloaded the Bitcoin casino you go to coinbase.com put it in order for $16 worth of aetherium

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,760
Okay, ask you a question when you're playing on your on your your breakfast slots or whatever

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
They are and you twist the throttle

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,640
That's breakfast

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,920
You guys don't have fruit and candy for breakfast. No, okay. I only play the fruit flavored slots. Okay, there's fruit

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,860
They got this arcade. I was that they got a giant touchscreen that you touch your finger on

90
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,860
Do you know it flies up in the air for you?

91
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,520

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,960
He was born on Valentine's Day. It's his birthday. So I was at the I was at the arcade. I won

95
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,080

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240

99
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,320
I spun I got I got a fucking I got a jackpot every time I wonder was it the Wonder Wheel

100
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,780
The one that spins and it goes into the slot or was it the one where it falls and it sweeps them off the edge

101
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:09,300
It's the one it spins around and you drop a coin and the coin has to land over the sensor for the jackpot

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,780
Yeah, and I figured out how to do it to get the jackpot every time. Yeah

103
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,980
Yeah, that's I was really getting the one where it spins like vertically and you put that you put the coin down coin down

104
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,040
I just want to wear a belt

105
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,360
But you know the one where it shoots it with the conveyor belt and it like has to shoot into the jackpot slot

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
I don't know that one, but I won 3100 tickets. Oh

Okay, Oh crazy time. I got crazy time 50 times multiplier

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Let me tell you about crazy time

111
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,220
Okay, crazy time is a game like wheel of fortune in the way that there's a wheel and a live host in Latvia

112
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,880
They swap out every 15 minutes

113
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,680
Because the chat in the big coin casino started saying really mean things and trying to find their address

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,120
They swap them out every 15 minutes, search "Crazy Time" you'll like it.

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,800
And if you get "Crazy Time" they go to a new realm.

116
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,480
They go into a green screen world, they walk over to it, and then they do a second, even larger wheel,

117
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,880
and you get buku bunches of cash.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,200
Okay, but I will say that today I played Big Buck HD,

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,280

120

156
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,800

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,440
these bitches off of me I'm about to be married mm-hmm but I was playing that

170
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,720
and then my younger brother pointed out that it looked a lot like Normandy so

171
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,480
the whole game is like you with a Gatling gun and you're shooting people

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,600
who are storming the beach dude I mean honestly the sickest their blood was

173
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,600
green so I was like it's clear these are aliens I'm not a Nazi it's just I'm

174
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,240
killing some aliens but they weren't having it they were telling me shit ever

175
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,720
is to fight in a war. And you know what? I was just following orders. I was just following the orders

176
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,920
that the game told me to do. You're following the quarters, dude. Yeah. The sickest shit ever is to

177
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,720
fight in a war and then 30 years later they just make a video game about that exact thing.

178
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,480
And you just can play it again. Just like you played it 30 years ago. And you can try to get

179
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,920
a high score again. There was, do you guys remember, Pat, you've been to Lansing Games, right?

180
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
uh...

181
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,360
where's that

182
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,760
uh... it was on uh... fucking highway i think they might want rid of it

183
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,080
i don't think it was on

184
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,240
or on the bed at the names of highways 'cause i can't drive so i don't need to

185
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,280
uh... but they're had they had the one arcade game where you you pulled in

186
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,600
like a helmet on like a arm and you like pull it down and as a good visor inside

187
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,240
she that she was so that i was i was on the test with that you know i mean i

188
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,480
think that now it is right

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,320
it's called

190
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,240
I just looked it up, it's called VR Vortec V3.

191
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,800
Unless this is a different game with the same helmet.

192
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,120
Nowadays it'd probably be, you know what it'd be nowadays?

193
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,080
It'd probably be a mask that you actually pull down

194
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,520
and then you put over your mouth.

195
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,200
Put over your mouth and it would be called

196
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
just being alive right now.

197
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
It'd probably be called like Liberal Mario.

198
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,720
It'd be called, yeah, go into the store in New York City.

199
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,960
You know, in Liberal Mario,

200
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,520
the princess tries to rescue herself nowadays.

201
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,360
Yeah, that's true.

202
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
And Mario is non-binary.

203
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
He was awesome.

204
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Yeah, that's right.

205
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
So true.

206
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
It was awesome being back in North Carolina, dude.

207
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Nobody's messed up.

208
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Everybody's fingering again.

209
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Oh, dude, that's in New Hampshire.

210
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,120
In New Hampshire and like Maine.

211
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,080
Dude, when I went to Maine with my brother for his bachelor party, I went to a bachelor

212
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,160
party two weeks ago.

213
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,640
When I went to Maine, there's fucking like people just, like girls on the street like

214
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
crying.

215
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,160
Like, you know, like party girls crying on the street,

216
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
and you know, it's cliche as shit,

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,820
but nature is healing, you know?

218
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,960
You see girls throwing up in the alleyway,

219
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,280
and their friends like, "You need to pull it together!"

220
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,520
(laughter)

221
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,940
So good, it was so nice to see it.

222
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,120
- What is it, why do girls keep drinking beer

223
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,960
if it makes them so damn sad?

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,880
- It's not beer, it's this new 8% ABV white claw

225
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,720
that came out.

226
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Surge. Mm-hmm. Tell you what man, I drink 15 beers. The most crying I'll do is I'll watch one of the two sad episodes of Futurama by myself.

227
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Right? And I'll be like, "Oh, that damn dog! Oh, that damn clover!"

228
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
"Goddamn brother!"

229
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
"That gravestone!"

230
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
It almost brings a tear to my damn eye watching this cartoon.

231
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,120
I got real drunk one time and I watched a Klaus Nomi video and I started crying.

232
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Nice. I don't know why. I probably shouldn't have admitted to that.

233
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,000
I was thinking about how he died and then I was like man he could have been like

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,960
the best singer in the world. Dude the most fucked up thing is I'll cry at

235
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,980
anything. Yeah. I cried it I like like not like breakdown but I shed a

236
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,520
tear-washing Better Call Saul because the brother dynamic was so beautiful to me.

237
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,860
Yeah dude I just started I mean me and Anister watching Breaking Bad like

238
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,760
because I only ever saw the first season before it's like it's good but it's

239
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,460
literally like just the most stupid show ever it's so fucking dumb it's so funny

240
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,340
that like the first episode what he makes the explosion in the the trailer

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,180
and he's like what he did the guys are trying to like kill him he's like wait

242
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,100
You want to know how to cook like me and then he just like puts together chemicals and makes an explosion

243
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,620
It's science. Yeah. Yeah, you hadn't you handle the business. I'll handle handle the chemistry

244
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,460
It's like wait, if you see if you got to the part where he where he created a bomb diamond and throws

245
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,740
this year and I was like how the fuck did anybody ever watch it and they were like

246
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,940
yeah they're all dressed like insane - like a fashion that was in for like two

247
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,620
years like yeah all this like hit the 2013 window so perfectly and he's like

248
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,060
unwatchable he like he like throws his fucking even space crystal on the ground

249
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,580
and like everybody in the building is like like the windows blow out the air

250
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,100
conditioning unit falls out of the fucking building everybody's covered in

251
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,300
like like like they look like they came out of like a coal mine yeah he just

252
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,540
walks out and he's like, "Nah, yeah, actually just help me. I'm the one who did the science

253
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:29,060
bomb on this drug dealer." The theme song is so funny too, like just the periodic table

254
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,380
and the smoke coming up and the fucking montage when they cook too and it plays some music

255
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,260
and just shows them filling up beakers with like, you know everybody who was watching

256
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,860
was like, "They're showing this on TV?" Yeah, they always have like, every other episode

257
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,700
there's like a five minute long fucking cooking montage that where it's like

258
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
John Goldberg

259
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,820
Yellow dust

260
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:04,060
Weighing rocks like a jeweler's loop on a piece of glass

261
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:16,020
Also like in the everybody like every single meth dealer is like bro this shit that you make is Loki artistic

262
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,100
like this. Oh yeah. Dude, so fucking dumb. None of them are just like, "Yo, that's pretty

263
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,380
good." They're all just like, "Yo, this is like scientifically magical, bro." This is

264
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,020
like, "I can like taste the science in this, fool. This is like Beethoven's Symphony of

265
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,820
Science over here when I smoke this drug." Yeah, dude. I mean, it's one of the greatest

266
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,060
shows ever. It's so fun to watch. I mean, you play like all of those shows. Like, you

267
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,780
go back and watch like The Wire or The Sopranos. There's so much dumb shit in those shows,

268
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,300
It's just like, I'm a Breaking Bad defender.

269
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,380
I think it's fun, dude.

270
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,660
I mean, yeah, if you're gonna watch a show,

271
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,740
you better be prepared to watch something dumb.

272
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,940
I don't think there are many shows

273
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
that don't have dumb stuff like that.

274
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,100
Yeah, definitely.

275
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,940
Like every--

276
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,740
Especially back then.

277
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,700
Especially, yeah, Prestige TV too,

278
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,180
is like, all that stuff is really dumb.

279
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,700
Like you really gotta--

280
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,380
Yeah, like that first, like that AMC run

281
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,160
where it was like Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Mad Men.

282
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Yeah, like those you know, The Walking Dead went on way too fucking long.

283
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,560
It's still going on, dude.

284
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,860
It's like the worst show.

285
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,460
They had spin-offs and shit.

286
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,260
It was not good.

287
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,860
I've seen the first season.

288
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,260
It sucks so bad.

289
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,860
Yeah, I watched like one or two episodes.

290
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,560
I was like, this is not doing anything for me.

291
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,860
Yeah, too much damn gore and violence.

292
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,760
It's not even the gore and the violence.

293
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,160
It's just like the stupid like, yeah, like like this is like what it's like.

336
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,780
they're friends of dragons named Ord and Zack and Wheezy yeah maybe they add a

337
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,900
third character later his name is Enrique uh-huh yeah it'd be a good idea for many

338
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,220
shows to introduce Zack and Wheezy like you know two heads are better than one

339
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,540
true absolutely you know I got a very scary enemy who eats dragon eggs who

340
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,820
will scare you and make you hide behind the couch when you see the episode

341
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,340
whatever I only watch through the reflection because you're not terrified

342
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,980
of the egg-sealing lizard yeah nowadays you have like you know Breaking Bad and

343
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,700
succession all these shows whatever happened to fucking I'm going into

344
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,780
cyberspace and absolutely I mean I'm Gilbert Gottfried yeah and he's a bird

345
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,780
And he's a bird? I mean now you gotta...

346
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,780
You know, how much worse would that show have been if everybody had cancer and they were addicted to heroin?

347
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,780
AW SHIT! I'M ADDICTED TO PILLS!

348
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,780
And he was a bird too.

349
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,780
AHH! I'M ADDICTED TO PILLS!

350
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,780
I mean, yeah, it's so funny that...

351
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,780
How many times can this guy play a fucking bird?

352
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,780
Yeah, I know, they're calling him a surprisor!

353
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,780
They just call him for every bird role.

354
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
I mean, it's obvious, yeah.

355
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,280
like yeah I guess that makes sense because if I if you also if you gave me

356
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,740
if I didn't know Gilbert Gottfried was and you played his voice to me and you

357
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,020
were like what is that I'd probably say bird before you yeah like that's a

358
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,900
that's a cockatiel yeah I mean it's not a bird has been as you could yeah have

359
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,340
him voice a character in like in an animation or something but if there is

360
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,300
any other if there is a it let that's not a bird but if there's anything in

361
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,180
that animation that is a bird you're gonna think that the voices were switched by

362
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,140
accident you're right yeah bird is there in the universe he can't he has to be

363
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,980
right Gilbert Gilbert Godfrey can't act with a bird exactly no yeah cuz I mean

364
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,820
yeah you hear you hear him going like and then a bird flies by and it goes

365
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,700
like you're like oh well they should have got him a little bird yeah can you

366
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,940
can you please direct me to the nearest restaurant that's what do you think a

367
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,820
bird like imagine that's imagine if they like imagine if they gave if they gave

368
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,780
Gilbert Gottfried's voice to Jafar and then they had a different guy for the

369
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,100
parrot you'd be like no no yeah that's not happening you definitely can't a

370
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,380
parrot definitely you just can't yeah with the Gilbert Gottfried in the room

371
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,820
also it was this guy even on Rio or Angry Birds I don't know if Gilbert

372
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,500
Gottfried is in Rio I think probably he wasn't hired as a voice actor but

373
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
definitely as a consultant. It was a consultant.

374
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
[Laughter]

375
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
They just had him on set

376
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
for every line. They were like

377
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
"Do you think a bird might say that?"

378
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Yeah. You know he was the Affleck duck.

379
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Dude,

380
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
this is one of the most fucking

381
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
insane, like, like how have

382
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
we looked over this for so long?

383
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I think everyone knew. I'm the second.

384
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I've never thought about this. I've never,

385
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
I mean, I've definitely

386
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
He has three bird rolls? I'm going to his IMDb right now.

387
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,260
got a lot more than bird. You got a lot more bird rolls. That he's ever voiced. Let's see

388
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:02,260
here. He played Hitler in historical roasts. Oh, okay. He played in, oh never mind. Kind

389
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:09,260
of a bird. Yeah, yeah. Cheeky bird, that Hitler. Yeah, bird in the British sense. Yeah. He's

390
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,820
a woman. He's a girl. Yeah. He played, oh here's a role that's gonna. He played Jared Kushner

391
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,260
on last week tonight with John Oliver. Here's a role that's gonna freak you out.

392
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:25,300
Yeah. He played Gilbert Gottfried in Crashing. No. He played, he played a horse

393
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,500
in an episode of Family Guy. No, that's not okay.

394
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:35,260
Uh-huh. He was in Crashing. You can't put him as a horse. Yeah, he was in Crashing. He, um, what an awesome show.

395
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:41,180
Who else, what else? Gilbert, I, I, a thousand million Maxim models want to suck my dick

396
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,660
even though I'm a big fat ugly guy what am I supposed to do? I look like a I look

397
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,740
like a giant puppy and I need to sleep on your couch. He played he played a genie

398
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,180
on the Tom and Jerry show. That's a real reversal of fortune for him. He played

399
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:06,860
the grim reaper in a movie too. That one feels anti-semitic. I don't know that

400
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,340
grim reaper is really the role for for Gilbert Gottfried. Yeah unless it's a

401
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,660
bird I was also just I mean I'm creeper or squeaker and it's a bird you know

402
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:23,540
the grim screecher yeah the grim look I'm working it I'm working through the grim

403
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,660
beaker cuz he played Santa Claus and grim adventures of Billy and Mandy that

404
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,500
one is tough yeah I don't know yeah I don't know about that one that one is I

405
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,220
you know I'm I that's just that's doesn't sit right with me yeah yeah

406
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,420
there's nothing about Gilbert Gottfried and I don't know if this is

407
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,300
controversial he might be the least jolly man on earth

408
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,380
it's true I don't know that he would I would ever choose him to play Santa

409
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Claus mm-hmm you know who'd be a great Santa Claus is um Kathy Bates I always

410
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,660
thought she'd be really good. She would be a good Santa. She'd be a better Mrs. Claus.

411
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,700
No no fuck no no talent of that level you don't give her the fucking supporting

412
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,620
role if they do it's a movie about mrs. Claus who would make that movie Netflix

413
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,260
what what she what does she do fucking bake cookies and suck dick all day

414
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,500
that's like the most boring movie of all time that's that's a very that's a very

415
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,660
closed-minded way to view mrs. Claus what what else is in this is Claus does

416
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,860
besides fucking make sure that Santa Claus isn't like fucking it's a movie

417
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:33,980
it's you know the night before Christmas or the night of Christmas while

418
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,120
Santa's out and she's getting and she's getting the house ready for next

419
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,900
Christmas and that's the movie. Okay so it's her cleaning. You think that's a

420
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,880
better like less like misogynist version? This is way less misogynist because it's

421
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,960
putting her in power. They should do like a they should do like a like a get hard

422
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,520
style movie about Mrs. Claus. Yeah. Where she has like a bad bitch friend who

423
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:10,040
teaches her how to work. Yeah. And do graffiti. Like an elf friend. Yeah, exactly. Who teaches

424
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,240
her how to do, teach her how to do elf shit. You know. And also she has a big fat ass in

425
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,720
the movie as well. Yeah. Yeah. And she gets tattoos. Yeah, oh, she gets tattoos. She gets

426
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,480
tons of tattoos, dude. Mm-hmm. She gets a pickle Rick tattoo on her leg. Yep. Yep. I've been

427
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm thinking about getting one.

428
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,300
A pickle rake tattoo?

429
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,680
Like if it was high enough up on my leg, it'd be kind of, yeah.

430
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,400
That you can hide it?

431
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,340
It'd be like one of those things that people only see if I'm having sex with them.

432
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,320
And I think that is a funny, that's a good reveal, right?

433
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Yeah.

434
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Yeah.

435
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,360
Oh, you thought I was normal.

436
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,840
Your wife would probably know that you were getting it, so it's not even going to be that

437
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
serious.

438
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
No, I would hide it from her.

439
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Yeah.

440
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
I would hide it from her for years.

441
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
years.

442
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
I'm going out for a few hours.

443
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Hey, I'm going to the store.

444
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
And then I just walk back in.

445
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Ow!

446
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Ow!

447
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Ow!

448
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,840
And there's like green ink oozing down your leg.

449
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Yeah.

450
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
There's sores, plasma.

451
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm wearing a- I had to run away.

452
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I had to run away from the tattoo parlor.

453
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Wearing a full white suit and it's just bleeding through.

454
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
They tried to tattoo me, yeah.

455
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,840
She sees the green outline of Bickle Rick through my pants.

456
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
You will not, honey, you will not believe what happened.

457
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,720
I was trying to go to the grocery store.

458
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,160
I walked into the tattoo parlor by accident.

459
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,760
out a guy with the same name as me had an appointment and they forced me to get his tattoo.

460
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,480
Yeah they said, "Do you have an appointment?" I was like, "Uh, that's kind of weird for a

461
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,100
grocery store, but maybe. My name's Caleb."

462
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,560
And then they made me sit in the chair and I said, "Oh cool, they're going to do my shopping

463
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:49,240
for me. This is so convenient." And I passed out because I was so happy. And I woke up

464
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,480
and they were painting a little green man on my leg.

465
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,880
Yeah, I thought it was just part of the receipt. I thought they were putting the receipt on me so I didn't lose it.

466
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,880
I was like, "Ah, smart. Tax season's coming up."

467
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,680
When they started out with the line work, I thought, "Okay, this is some kind of shorthand."

468
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,880
But then it turned out to be, when they put the green in, I realized it was the bumps of a pickle.

469
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,080
And then I was like, "Wait a second. I didn't buy no damn pickle. I'm not making tuna fish salad."

470
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,280
And that's when I started to get suspicious, but I still waited about an hour and a half after that.

471
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,560
I also got this nice informational pamphlet on how to care for it.

472
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,760
And I'm gonna go back next week to check whether it's a grocery store or not.

473
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,040
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna go back again.

474
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Sorry I didn't, sorry I...

475
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,640
They took all the money that I had for groceries for this.

476
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,800
Coming back with a second pickle rig tattoo and be like,

477
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,160
"Okay, this time I really thought it was the receipt, I swear."

478
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm really starting to think something is going on there.

479
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,320
I didn't realize until they put the face onto it.

480
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,360
I think just for to me do my due diligence I might have to go back just to check a third time.

481
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,320
You walk in with like in the exact space that Mike Tyson has a tribal on his face, you have a pickle

482
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:08,600
rick you're like okay this is so this is crazy. There was a huge misunderstanding at the grocery

483
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,880
store again. That is a bit I wish I had like I cared little enough about my body to do is just

484
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,760
get the same tattoo over and over and over just like the same tattoo up and

485
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,680
down your arms and legs like not like a funny one but just like the same thing

486
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,720

And then they did like a, like,

492
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
"Oh, we found Mr. Cool Ice, here's more photos of him."

493
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,660
And he has more new tattoos of the same shit.

00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,680
Tekken character.

497
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,440
- Isn't Mr. Cool Ice, maybe I'm like misremembering it,

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,360
- I don't know anything about him

501
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,520
besides his name and the art on his skin.

502
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,560

00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,640
grown man has fifteen Miley Cyrus tattoos

504
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,360

manufactured stand culture like saw this and i like

520
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:05,680
of shit we fucked up the anyway too far this this guy uh...

521
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,020
this was yet twenty fifteen

522
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,300
some like that

523
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,000
but he's probably doing it before

524
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,900
yeah yeah

525
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,440
that's probably as before

526
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,980
yeah i guess i was one twenty twelve

527
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,380
uh... here's his peace by lease i was like

528
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,700
by step tattoo

529
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,580
and it looks like steven tyler it's not a skill yet i look at a really bad

530
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,820
and then

531
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,060
i thought mister cool ice was obsessed with miley cyrus and that was just like

532
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,420
one of mister cool i say so if you're cool and i was a man who has been

533
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:41,220
Mr. Cool Ice. It's true. It's nice that you can become kind of famous by just getting a

534
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,100
bunch of tattoos. Yeah. And that's way easier than being one of those guys who makes himself

535
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,500
look like a dragon. Exactly, yeah. It's so much easier. One of those fucking guys lives

536
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,900
in my neighborhood and he walks by me every day. You told me that before. Yeah, he has

537
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:02,980
horns. Really? He has horn implants and every time I'm like, "What are you using those for?"

538
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:10,180
probably for sex you think he's using his horns for sex yes I do maybe I would not

539
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,980
doubt that that man is putting his if he's got horns he's put he's put he's

540
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,660
put his horn how are they how long I would say like do they curl pretty small

541
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,580
they're like no they're like drinks okay yeah they're okay they come out of the

542
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,420
putting it in a but oh they come out of the skin they're not like subdermal I

543
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,460
I think that they is it like Darth Maul horns?

544
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,220
Well it's like so the way they do dermal implants is they put a little like

545
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,260
square of metal in your skin

546
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,940
yeah but then so it is dermal but then he it has the horn part

547
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,980
is like us a what sits on top of that

548
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,220
yeah yeah well what I said was sub dermal which actually means under the

549
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,580
skin entirely so

550
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,940
I actually was right after all. I'm gonna kill you man.

551
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,460
I'm gonna fucking kill you. Dude Mr. Cool Ice looks so cool

552
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,660
I'm just looking at pictures.

553
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660
He looks cold as ice.

554
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
It's so sick.

555
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,620
The skeleton with the sunglasses just getting out on every part of your body.

556
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,860
He's a prime, he's one of the Halloween costumes I'm looking at.

557
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,860
Yeah.

558
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,860
Yeah.

559
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,540
I'm in prime Mr. Cool Ice condition.

560
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,620
I mean, no you're not.

561
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,620
You have tattoos already.

562
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,900
Yeah, you have to grow out the flat top too.

563
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,700
That's the one thing people forget about Mr. Cool Ice.

564
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
He's bald.

565
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,020
He is bald, but he has one picture where he has a sick flat top.

566
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Fuck me, man. I was so excited.

567
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,520
You know what? You don't- no, Caleb, you know what's a better tattoo for you-

568
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,760
or better, like, uh, Halloween tattoo costume for you?

569
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,260
What?

570
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
Uh, Moby.

571
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,760
You could do-

572
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,260
Yes.

573
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,760
You could grow out your beard.

574
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
I don't know what Moby looks like. I don't have a beard.

575
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,260
You could grow out a beard.

576
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
I can't grow anything. You know this.

577
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,760
You could put a fake beard on then, you fucker.

578
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Then I'll look like I'm going as a guy in disguise.

579
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,100
then you get that he has like on his arms it says animal on one side and rights on

580
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,760
the other and his neck says vegan for life yeah that's actually so sick yeah

581
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,080
I'm just got a vegan straight edge tattoo and I was 13 yeah you've told us about

582
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,600
that as shut up about it I wish I had man that would shut up about it you shut

585
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,500
and then just be like, looks like I was branded.

586
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,520
That'd be sick, man.

587
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,360
- Yeah.

588
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,300
Dude, there's some people who just like

589
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,580
burn their own tattoos off by themselves.

590
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,240
Isn't that crazy?

591
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,740
- They're called scientists.

592
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,580
(laughing)

593
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,420
- No, no.

594
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,120
- Yeah, they're called laser operators.

595
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,420
- Laserologists.

596
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,700
Yeah, it's a very common hobby.

597
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,780
- Not those, just like somebody will like burn themself

598
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,660
and like, just 'cause they don't like a tattoo

599
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,500
or like cut the skin off or something.

600
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,300
- Well, it's fucking insanely expensive

601
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,420
get tattoos removed. Yeah, it doesn't, I mean, I would just chop my arm off.

602
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,700
Sometimes it works. I know one guy who got a bunch of like face tattoos removed, but

603
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:01,140
then he left, for some reason, he left like a little heart on his face too. And it's

604
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,900
like just go all or nothing, you know. Yeah, especially like nothing and then a heart on

605
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,020
the face is maybe one of the worst configurations of all time. And now, yeah, you just have

606
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,460
like fucking you know like a scar that is the word southern and script on your

607
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:22,860
head. It says southern? Yeah it's actually cool you had cool face tattoos. Yeah yeah I

608
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,140
mean face tattoos are just like a very you know you gotta fucking you gotta

609
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:32,300
plan them out. Yeah the face tattoo is the 100% achievement you can't you can't

610
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,540
go for that until that's the last yeah I mean yeah but it's very funny to see

611
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,740
somebody with like just a face tattoo or something it does it or just a hand

612
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,800
tattoo I knew this guy in high school who got his first tattoo ever was a giant

613
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:53,820
rose on his hand yeah just knuckles oh yeah I told you about my dad's tattoo

614
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,260
no I think yeah the one that you and your brothers are all gonna get yeah he

615
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,540
He got a rose next to his thigh.

616
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
Next to his thigh in the air?

617
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
A D in the air?

618
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
Yeah.

619
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
No, he got a rose.

620
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
I meant to say rose.

621
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,540
He got a tattoo that floats like an emoji next to his thigh.

622
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Dude, that's the future.

623
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
I'm tired.

624
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
Fuck off.

625
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
That would be so sick.

626
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
You know, yeah, oh my god, that would be so tight.

627
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,880
A tattoo that like floats a few inches off your skin.

628
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,540
Like that Good Neighbor video, the crime cops.

629
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Don't remember.

630
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,820
No, you don't remember that one?

631
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,940
When they have the keyboard and they're typing on the keyboard.

632
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,020
Yeah, the guy walks in and he has all those things floating.

633
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
That is the future, man.

634
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,940
Yeah, just being able to have an Instagram filter.

635
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,820
It looks like it's on your face, but when you turn your head to the side, it's floating

636
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,820
in front of your face.

637
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,360
God, that'd just be so beautiful, man.

638
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm excited for the future of body mods.

639
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,900
I hope one day I can just look animated completely in real life.

640
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,900
Like a Pixar character?

641
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
No, like that.

642
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
What's the name of that?

643
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
This is going to bother me.

644
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Hold on.

645
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,980
My dad has a rose on his thigh next to his penis.

646
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,780
I meant to say it's gonna bother me that I don't get that out.

647
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,380
It's a very funny tattoo.

648
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,880
Okay, and it's really embarrassing.

649
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,280
It's really embarrassing for him.

650
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,180
He doesn't like to talk about it, but you do but I do like to

651
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,580
talk about it because it's very funny.

652
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,080
I think the thing about body mods in the future is that like

653
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,480
it's dead.

first of all this is crazy and also am I supposed to care you record it was also

673
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,540
Also, the thing that they said was like, it wasn't just that.

674
00:37:52,540 --> 00:38:01,540
It was like an Uber Pool companion said that I wasn't real and that I was only CGI, too.

675
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,540
It had an element of being racist against an AI.

676
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
That's so fucked up.

677
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
I wish that you would have been stabbed.

678
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540

679
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,540

It doesn't matter if she's a cartoon.

685
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,540
You can do anything you want to it.

686
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540

687
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540

00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,540
You might as well be fucking like beating up a photo.

And it's just...

691
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Well, that's not okay.

00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
I mean, if it's a photo of a woman, it's not.

693
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,540

704
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,420

705
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,620
this like subway ad of Trevor Noah that says like for your consideration

714
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,520
and just disappears like it's a pit yeah man it's what if they if they did do

715

that with Mario that would like I mean that would change I mean have some that

716

Like this robot got assaulted like what the fuck?

721
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120

722
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:56,760
Yeah now TMZ breaking news, new allegations by Kirby against Ganondorf.

00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,480
hologram and I...

725
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,920
Yeah like a schizophrenic man told me he did not see me on the same plane as him or something

726
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
like that.

727
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,200
to be like yeah we care about we care about like these stories and these

728
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,360
things that really happened but and the person we hired to talk about it so we

729
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:26,560
don't have to pay because she's not legal or anything yeah that is so

730
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,960
disgusting it's like that is I didn't I didn't know it's funny it is very funny

731
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,980
that's straight up like something out of like brass I like that is not like a

732
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,620
definitely like yeah that makes no fucking sense like why the fuck would

733
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,640
you think little Michaela talk about like a salt rule dude yeah I'm having

734

time where it's like oh like a robot will have a serious a god damn it dude

736
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,460
Yeah, so it's like somebody somebody like you're with a friend

737
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,520
And they tell you like a very serious story of them being like sexually assaulted or like hurt by somebody

738
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:23,520
I

739
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,700
Finally have a

740
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,600
Framework that I can understand you through because the girl from Fortnite

743
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
I mean, it's definitely making me take it less serious

744
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:51,180
Yeah, I heard team rocket does not treat their Pokemon well

745
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:58,860
No, no, man, and it's been in plain sight since the beginning, but nobody's thought to say anything about it until finally

746
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,460
Yeah, finally Ridley from Metroid is standing up for for what for what happened on

747
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,160
All of the cast of Tekken are actually physically abusive to each other

748
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,400
They keep firing fireballs and laser beams

749
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:28,440
Like a helicopter

750
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440

759
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Plus he's a mummy.

760
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440

that little Michaela thing so much like I went this long without knowing about it

764
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,560

and slippy has similar stories just ask around.

768
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,680

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Oh fuck dude.

770
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,680
Cause they had to animate her crying or something.

Like the digital artist had to sit down and like

772
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,680

776
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:06,880
turned around on it we should if anybody if anybody who's listening to this knows

777
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,700
anything about making vtuber rigs please message me because I want to make an MS

778
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,620
paint VTuber and that's when people make like make the anime girls that's crazy

779
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:22,100
it's sick dude I would I don't care that one bothers me less cuz it's just like

780
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:27,380
cuz I know there's a there's a yeah no this is a tangent here I think that you

781
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,740
know it could maybe really revitalize the streaming industry if I was maybe able

782
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:37,500
to be a VTuber so you don't want to know anything about that oh I about VTuber

783
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,180
drama and okay well I mean you're you're misunderstanding this year because you

784
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,540
realize I am already a superstar. People are coming up to me pretty much every day

785
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,220
to call me famous and ruin my life with how much they love me. So it would

786
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,820
honestly be a step down in fame for me to be a VTuber because it wouldn't have my face

787
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,780
attached to it. Cut to Cameron Twitch streaming as a me that looks exactly like Hitler.

815
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,280
that's the first like video game console I ever owned

816
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,140
that wasn't like a, I mean, I guess it still is a handheld,

817
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,560
but the first like not handheld thing.

818
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,880
So I'm glad, I mean, it was nice to play like, you know,

819
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,200
Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey.

820
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,280
Those games rock, dude.

821
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,280
- Well, they just put Pro Skater 1 and 2 on it.

822
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,320
So I might be...

823
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,080
- Can you watch Netflix and Hulu and TV on it?

824
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,360
- They used to only have Hulu.

825
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,760
For like a few years, they only had Hulu on it.

826
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,720
That was the only, I don't know if it's changed at all.

827
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,560
- It might not have.

828
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,080
- But yeah, very weird that it was only Hulu.

829
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,300
but dude i watch so much you deal on that shit

830
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,480
hundreds of episodes on who are watching you know when you're so it's a waste

831
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,800
that the f_b_i_

832
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,380
that's uh... stated

833
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,440
yeah i'm awesome

834
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,580
we need to make a video games so badly do you know i got a d_n_a_ we need to make

835
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,660
a video game we know i cyber influencer we need a way

836
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,740
we need to make it onto so let me family feud

837
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,860
True. Well, that's oh, we should talk about that.

838
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,020
We need to keep bringing it. I mean, we talked about that once.

839
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,500
We should be bringing it up. Yeah, we talked about it last episode.

840
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,340
We should bring it up every episode from here on out.

841
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,340
I think until it happens.

842
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:10,380
If anybody knows anybody that even works, even like, even like,

843
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,220
yeah, even if they work at like Best Buy, like selling TVs,

844
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,020
like if you know, if you know a person who like works at the McDonald's

845
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,340
that is closest to the studio that they film Family Feud at,

846
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,340
that could even be a connection that might help us.

847
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,100
Especially if they know how to hypnotize people.

848
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,600
Right.

849
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,100
Yeah.

850
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,500
I'm watching the Lil Mckay live- I didn't know it was a video.

851
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah.

852
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,200
Yeah, they're all videos.

853
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,200
Oh my god.

854
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
It's like it was just an Instagram post.

855
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Jesus fucking Christ.

856
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,600
No, it's a video where she talks in-depth about it.

857
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,000
That's so fucked.

858
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,500
Yeah.

859
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,500
You're having a real crisis.

860
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,000
That is so fucked.

861
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,200
I feel like I just took you- I feel like I just froze you in time for five years and I froze you.

862
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,900
I didn't know about this. This happened in 2019.

863
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,500
I didn't fucking know it happened until just now and it's just like-

864
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,000
Like, I have no hope for the future anymore.

865
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,440
Like I really like this fucking this is this is yeah. Hey. Yeah. Hey, we need a new plague

866
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:05,360
That's right. Yeah, that's right. I'm bill a virus. Yeah, you put a virus in little Kayla's computer virus

867
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,240
I'll just say I'll say this

868
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:13,880
Anything that that thing says happens to her for as long as it exists. I will take full responsibility for

869
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,520
Why it's not a real thing it's not a real thing

870
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:28,200
fucking nothing a cup it's nothing to me dude when they so when they when they

871
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,680
owners a when they built her a body with sidewinder missiles you're gonna regret

872
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,600
saying that I will regret that yeah yeah also you know kind of us they kind of

873
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:43,400
the creators kind of have a slave it's true yeah kind of a slave situation yeah

874
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:49,960
it's a virtual slave yeah they that thing does not get paid yeah okay we're gonna

875
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,240
to pay you now and they just like put a bunch of dollar bills into a shredder

876
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:05,280
and she goes mmm delicious I love food and flavor see yeah I wish it had talked

877
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,800
like that that would be sick we should talk like like they need to have it

878
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,240
Wally we need to step back from like making it realistic they need to look

879
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,920
like a punch card machine or like a funny they need to look like a power

880
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,320
loader for aliens. Like a cash register? Yeah, or like a Star Wars droid. I'll

881
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,120
believe it. Yeah, because I also will believe in the emotional intelligence of

882
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:31,800
like an AI more if it's just like a big black box that prints out one word on a

883
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,360
card. Like that to me is easier to understand. Tell you what, this is all

884
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:43,880
Cleverbot's fault. True. I blame Cleverbot and I blame myself for saying a lot of

885
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,120
of rude things to clever bought over the years I'd like to formally apologize to

886
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:54,480
clever but for everything that I said to her yeah I know it's kind of hack too

887
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,640
but it's like insanely funny that like pretty often they like they make like an

888
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,520
AI or something that you can talk to and then within like a day it either turns

889
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,920
into a Nazi or starts saying like we must destroy humanity and shut it down

890
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:16,040
down. Like I know people talk about that to death but it's like it's a pretty big red flag

891
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:23,640
I think. No the second that they make an AI that is like at all useful it's over dude.

892
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:30,560
We're all done for bro. We're fucked. We're so I'm like I ah boy it's just really like

893
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,960
I'm so scared of my computer now that they made Lil Miquela talk about that. I'm not

894
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,960
I'm scared. You know why? Because I'm in Austria right now.

895
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Yeah.

896
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,680
I always go straight to Austria for some reason. I don't know anything about Austria. It might

897
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,540
be worse as far as surveillance. And a VPN I know doesn't work for anything, but I do

898
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,540
feel good.

899
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,540
Yeah.

900
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,960
Yeah. I feel like, "Damn, I'm so Austrian right now. What the fuck? I'm like a hit man.

901
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,960
This is sick as shit."

902
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,720
There was a hit man from Austria who was pretty bad.

903
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,200
Yeah, I guess that's true.

904
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:10,000
a VPN does for you is you can open up like Google Maps and go whoa whoa that's

905
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,760
the main function of it that's weird as hell yo I'm not there all right let me

906
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:23,160
disconnect and buy a gun yeah I don't think VPNs really do anything I'm yeah

907
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,120
everybody I know who knows anything more about computers than me just says like

908
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,620
VPNs are just like useless but you have to use them to access the Bitcoin casino.

909
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:41,460
Oh really? So I am a loyal subscriber to Surfshark. Premium subscriber, nice. Yeah it's four dollars a

910
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:46,500
month dude. Yeah. Yeah so as long as I make back my money plus four dollars at

911
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,420
the Bitcoin casino I'm in the black. I used to think like oh shit I gotta

912
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,780
I gotta like get a VPN so I can torrent again and I realized I can just VPN

913
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,020
and whenever I go to my mom's,

914
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,180
I can torrent whenever I go to my mom's for dinner

915
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,620
and just use her wifi.

916
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,860
(laughing)

917
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,860
- Yeah, that's awesome.

918
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,100
- Dude, I got in so much trouble for torrenting growing up.

919
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,940
- Yeah, I got it.

920
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,120
- I tried to download Saints Row,

921
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,860
I've talked about this, but it's just like.

922
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,060
- I got hit for Sniper Elite.

923
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,220
- I never got, I think I might have got

924
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,060
a cease and desist once, but I never.

925
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,900
- Yeah, I got a copyright claim for Saints Row

926
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,260
And then that put us on watch, I guess, from Comcast.

927
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,980
And then a couple weeks later,

928
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,220
it was actually a whole year later where we were like,

929
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,380
oh, we're not torrenting anything anymore, mom and dad.

930
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,580
It was like, wink, wink.

931
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:44,460
My brother got in trouble 'cause he torrented

932
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,340
an MP3 of Tio Cruz Dynamite.

933
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,860
- I would also just go to Dunkin' Donuts and torrent.

934
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:58,600
have taken down Dunkin Donuts. It's a good plan. Yeah go to Dunkin Donuts and just go on

935
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:04,480
on the Pirate Bay and just search like newest Disney movie and just instantly. Yeah or just search

936
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,700
like like a Starbucks recipes and then get them in trouble for corporate espionage. I think it

937
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:18,100
was Tayo Cruz. It could have been LMFAO. It might have been Sexy and I Know It by LMFAO. It's one of

938
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,980
those two songs. It doesn't matter because those are equally those that have the same punch in the

939
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,880
story I would say yeah yeah I think you should either one of those is fine you

940
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,900
know next time you tell it try telling it to different people with different songs

941
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,700
see what next time you tell it do the lonely by Akon yeah you might as well

00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,460
[laughter]

977
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,460
[laughter]

978
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,700
And then when they try to talk you just put your finger on their lips

979
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:18,340
Oh my god, dude

980
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:26,300
Damn dude now. I'm still thinking about these gorgeous grapes that I'm gonna win later. You're not gonna win any more

981
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:33,100
I'm gonna get off the Bitcoin casino. Yeah, what about the wondrous watermelons? What if I get seven of them? That's 50 cents

982
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,540
You won't get any, you're gonna spend too much.

983
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,540
- No lollipops for you.

984
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,380
- How much money have you spent so far?

985
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:44,100
- I'm actually even, because I won a $400 jackpot,

986
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,700
and so now I'm out of the game.

987
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,100
So that's the only reason I'm talking about it.

988
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,460
If I was still in the throes of it,

989
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,740
then I would not be talking about it.

990
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,860
But because it's over, that's it.

991
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,700
But I need to get more money so I can start gambling again.

992
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,740
I need to become rich.

993
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,580
- Yeah.

994
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,400
- Which is why--

995
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,140
- You guys need to feed this habit.

996
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,260
which is why we have a live show.

997
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,540
- People should come to the live show.

998
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,700
If you're listening to this and you're like,

999
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,260
God, I need to give these guys more money.

1000
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,280
I don't, this is a Patreon episode.

1001
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,340
I need to get, $5 is not enough for these.

1002
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:19,340
- I need a house of the dead cabinet in my apartment.

1003
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,900
I need it taking up the space between the fridge

1004
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,500
and the wall in my kitchen so I can't open the fridge.

1005
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,540
- I need to keep buying more stupid pants that don't fit me

1006
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,180
and then I try to send them back and I can't,

1007
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,160
so now I'm stuck with a big pair of jeans.

1008
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,860
Enjoy skateboard jeans.

1009
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,420
- I need to buy a rifle to kill the stoner

1010
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,660
that hangs outside my house with his friends.

1011
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,700
- I need to play Wild Buffalo Megaways,

1012
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,300
and I need to do a $500 bonus buy.

1013
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,580
- I need to buy bigger pants.

1014
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,900
I need to get size 15.

1015
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,740
- We'll just leave it at this.

1016
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,320
- I need to remove ads from Temple Run.

1017
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,380
- I need to buy a phone with Flappy Bird on it.

1018
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:02,380
If you want to enable my gambling habit,

1019

- Will and Felix from Chopo. - From Chopo.

1025
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,260
It's basically like the two gayest podcasts of all time

1026
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,500
and then us. (laughs)

1027
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,020
And we're gonna be there, we're gonna be doing debates

1028
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,660
and kind of political-- - It's gonna be

1029
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,100
Patrick will have his birthday on stage, I believe.

1030
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,100
It's true.

1031
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,100
I will be, yeah.

1032
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,700
Yeah, true, he will.

1033
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,860
So come through, we're gonna be talking.

1034
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,020
I will be turning 24, this is the end of my Jordan year.

1035
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,020
Yup.

1036
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,020
I will be...

1037
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,020
And you can also...

1038
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,140
I will have had my birthday already, so I'll be...

1039
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,780
It's over birthdays in general by then.

1040
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,500
You won't care, you're gonna hold your nose when he blows out his candles.

1041
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,820
I'll be crossing my arms and looking at his presence with disdain.

1042
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:58,120
My birthday was in April, so if you want to just like hand me specifically money, like

1043
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,900
at the show, that'd be a good place to do it.

1044
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:08,240
And I will be using it on the, on Fruit Party or on John Hunter and the Book of Tut, which

1045
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,100
is an Indiana Jones themed one, where you can actually reveal different symbols from

1046
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,540
the sarcophagus.

1047
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,440
So just keep that in mind.

1048
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,500
