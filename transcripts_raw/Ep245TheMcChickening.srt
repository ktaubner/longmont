1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,680
What is just because I'm fucking scared this alert why?

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,580
Scared right you have such a protective kind of like

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,000
Defensive energy today. I'm on edge you were I mean not to mention there on the edge of madness

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,960
You're on the edge of you're on the edge of barely being friends with me have been a fucking targeted

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,040
I don't know if you know clearly we've been targeted. That's like an arrow

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,600
hitting a target and bouncing up and down. Yeah, we've been targeted. Oh wait

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,600
by that's obvious. One of the most probably dangerous serial killers in the

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,000
world. Probably I mean, okay, so a lot of fatalities. I would say men like me

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,400
wimp women like you men like you said women and men and men like me who are

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,920
wimps. Yeah, probably targets wimps and women. I think you're more of a chump.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,280
Yeah, you're not a wimp. You are definitely a chump. I'm not a chump.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,080
Why do you think that's the number one chump thing is? I'm not a chump. I'm not

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,680
a chump. You think that you, I'm not a chump. You're not a wimp. You've been

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,160
targeted by the McChickener

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,200
and it's going to, it's ruining my life. I didn't sleep last night. That's all

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,320
you've been thinking about. It's all I've been thinking about. I mean, it's

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,800
definitely tough. I do think that this is clearly I don't think this is a

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,780
current serial killer. I think it is a future serial retired. No, no future,

20
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,620
no, no, no, a future serial, right? Yeah, who is he'll retire in the future,

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,000
though? Probably one day. I don't think they really retire. Some of them do.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
The zodiac did. Oh, that's true. Well, maybe he died. I think that's I guess,

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,540
though, that is the thing about him is that that's the reason he's so

24
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,920
it's because they did. He's the first one stopped and they did get him. He's

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,440
He's Michael Jordan. He would just, he goaded.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,440
But his calling card is not as scary as a chicken stuck through a spike.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Impaled through a spike.

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Was it impaled or was it just in between two spikes?

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
It was impaled.

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,440
We were targeted by, you want to just tell the story?

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Yes, so Friday night, I mean, what's in the intro?

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Yeah, but there's people in the audio.

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
There's listeners who don't listen to, don't watch the show.

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
So Friday I was here, I was working late.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Tell people what that means.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
That means that no I was editing a video.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
What video?

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
That flopped.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Oh okay.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,080
Editing a video that flopped.

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,560
No one cares about promo for sketch shows anymore.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
No one cares about.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
They used to though.

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
They used to care so much.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Nobody cares about.

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
It used to be huge.

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,600
About a funny video game looking visual.

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,120
Kind of Eric Andre show.

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Crazy insane style.

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
2017 style videos.

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
People don't like them anymore.

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
People don't care.

53
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,780
don't like him anymore. People don't prefer 2016 style square posters

54
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,220
definitely yeah and even then

55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,420
I put it at the end of the video.

56
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,220
I put it in there. So everyone can have what they want. If there's anything

57
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,520
people like less than a 2017 style video or a 2016 style poster, it's a 2016 style

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,020
poster at the end of a 2017 style video. Well, okay, maybe that's why I was

59
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,120
targeted by this disgusting, vicious man. This disgusting villain. This disgusting

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,300
So this person saw the, saw the, they saw, okay, so let's assume they saw the

61
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,560
Instagram post. They probably, they probably, they probably, like, smelled my

62
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,960
pheromones on me. They probably, think about this, think about this, I leave

63
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,360
here, I'm, all day I'm editing this video, I leave here, I'm closing up shop,

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,480
this guy

65
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,880
walking down the street like that. He was doing that? Yeah, obviously. Obviously.

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,920
He's a fucking crazy psycho. He's

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,720
sniffing the air like that and then doing that with his tongue so he can get the

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,620
taste too. And then he sees me, sees me standing there, he knows this guy just

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,820
made a flopping video for a sketch show at Littlefield on July 14th. And the

70
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,120
landlord is outside. This isn't good.

71
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,700
flopping video and then he saw he was like, okay, I'm going to come back here

72
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,300
later, but how am I going to remember how to come back here so I can completely

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,620
decimate this fool?

74
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,060
Right.

75
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,820
And what will remind me of this?

76
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,060
Like that Bible story.

77
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,260
This fucking flopper.

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,460
And so what did he do?

79
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,040
he impaled his McChicken that he was eating

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,140
through the spike in our gate.

81
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,440
Yeah.

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Oh my God.

83
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,040
Put it right through there.

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,920
That is right through awful news and then I immediately I turned

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,420
around because he thought I wouldn't notice, but I watched

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,040
that area like a Hawk.

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Yeah.

88
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,540
He thought I wouldn't notice.

89
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,940
I see the McChicken impaled through and you go.

90
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,440
I

91
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,940
I immediately- You pull out your guns. No, I ran away. I ran all the way home.

92
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,940
I went wee, wee, wee all the way home, texted you guys a photo of it

93
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,940
immediately. Yeah. And we have been on guard since Friday. You haven't left

94
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,140
the office. No. You've been sitting here. No. You're armed, aren't you?

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Why do you think I've been doing Twitch streams because I'm so scared?

96
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,340
You're like the opposite of a sitting duck. I'm a sitting cannon. Yeah.

97
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,880
There's a way to a century. You are at the office of a century right now.

98
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,220
There's a cannonball that has been sitting in me for centuries.

99
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,300
And this guy is going to accidentally light the fuse.

100
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,100
You're a Bloons TD. You're upgraded.

101
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,560
I'm doing tower defense.

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,140
You're the monkey in the middle.

103
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,980
You started out, they bought you for one dollar on Bloons,

104
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,180
wimpy chump. Yeah. They upgraded you.

105
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,900
Now he's going to be my interactive buddy.

106
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,220
And I'm going to put the Napoleon Dynamite skin on him and I'm going to bounce him off

107
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
the wall.

108
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,700
I'll tell you what I always used was the George Bush skin.

109
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Yep.

110
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Because I wanted to disrespect him.

111
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
George Bush or Saddam.

112
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,780
Because I, let's play both sides here.

113
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
Yeah.

114
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,380
My dad got mad at me for using the George Bush one.

115
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,380
Yeah.

116
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
Yeah, because he loved Bush so much.

117
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,380
Wow.

118
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,380
Bush was cool, man.

119
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,380
I mean.

120
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,380
He did, he golfed.

121
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
Yeah.

122
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
Everybody golfs.

123
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Yeah.

124
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
That's true.

125
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,380
Every single person.

126
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Pretty much everyone else.

127
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,380
Last time we had a prisoner that didn't know how to golf.

128
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,380
Probably before golf was invented.

129
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,380
Probably Jimmy Carter.

130
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
Jimmy Carter was a fucking pussy hippie bitch.

131
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
He was a pussy whore.

132
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
My peanuts!

133
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
My peanuts!

134
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,380
They made me steal, they made me get away my peanuts!

135
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,380
Fuck him. Jimmy Carter, bitch ass motherfucker.

136
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,380
Jimmy Carter, if that was you who put that McChicken on the gate...

137
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,380
We gonna shoot the shit out of you.

138
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,380
We gonna...

139
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,380
I don't think we can say that.

140
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,020
the houses and they take pictures of him and he looks like a...

141
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,220
Yeah, he looks like a...

142
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Buddy, I know you ain't building those houses.

143
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,860
He looks like they're using him as the hammer on the house.

144
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,860
It looks like they're picking him up, swinging him around,

145
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,360
demolishing walls with him like a curtain ledge hammer.

146
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,660
Using him exactly like a tool.

147
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,260
Picking him up by the legs and...

148
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,360
He looks like shit.

149
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
He's been a tool since day one, if you ask me.

150
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,560
Oh, yeah.

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,060
Yeah.

153
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,980
But anyway, so the McChicken thing kind of got Patrick pretty shaken.

154
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,980
He's sitting here with the bulletproof on, looking like Troy Ave.

155
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,480
Yeah.

156
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,580
He looks good.

157
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,360
I have a good look for you. I have bullet proof it woven into my skin, so I don't

158
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,940
need a bullet proof woven into your skin, the fibers I've definitely yeah. I've

159
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,160
definitely had enough teflon from that's what you just see if you just scrape a

160
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,980
non stick pan and eat out of it, but that's only covering this part of me

161
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,540
eggs that you scramble on the pan for about fifteen seconds yeah with

162
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,640
the highest highest possible heat for fifteen seconds.

163
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,020
You do my double fork technique, you take an archaeologist chisel and you go

164
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,920
to get them off the pan. Well, you break it in the my double for a hammer and

165
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
you do like a sculptor.

166
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,660
You have the you have the heat on like the highest setting with a teflon pan,

167
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,000
because you think you got it. You got to season it like a carbon steel walk. I

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,880
think it's the black stuff is pepper yeah.

169
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,640
I think that it's pepper that they put in the pan, so you don't have to pepper

170
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,280
your eggs yeah. My dad used to have I do hate fucking peppering my eggs. I wish

171
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,380
he's already in a pan. I wish it was already in the pan. Oh God, just put it

172
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,120
in the pan. Just shake it. That's a- wait, another amazing invention. He got

173
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,680
so scared for a second. I'm sorry. Yeah. Another amazing invention. What about

174
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,760
that I didn't like peppering my eggs? Me? Yeah, you don't pepper your eggs.

175
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Well, I was confused. Guys, I have another amazing invention today. Okay. I

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,640
have one after you. It's more of a phil- it's a scientific concept. I guess I

177
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
could come up with one by the time you two do one. I guess I could do three.

178
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,800
here's my back off of my pots and pans that have all of the seasoning and

179
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,600
ingredients already in the pot, the pan. All you have to do is add the meat or

180
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,320
the rice and the heat and the heat as well. But yeah, so say you're making

181
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,720
oh and they're disposable like you can buy them at the store like the the Tony

182
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,840
Sashory's engineers will figure out this. Yeah, I don't give a shit about

183
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,800
any of this for the nerds. Okay, it's going to refill or you're going to buy

184
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,380
things that go in the pan, like different, like fill it, like color

185
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,980
covers that are the flavor pack, yeah, cartridges, a cart. Oh, my God, it's

186
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,640
like a so it's a cartridge. It's a soda stream for your food and it's called a

187
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,320
food pan

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,200
and you can put you can make stream. It's called a food a pan food. A pan is

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,220
good food and it's really good. You take a you take a say you want to make

190
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,760
chicken alfredo right? Well, let me look at my fridge. I have chicken.

191
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,680
But I don't have Alfredo. And actually, I don't even know what Alfredo is.

192
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,640
Let me throw in my invention before Pat's really quick because I just came up with it

193
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,120
based off of yours. And it's basically you buy a straw, but on one end it is closed on

194
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,480
the straw and inside the straw is a small amount of a drink. And you can buy, okay,

195
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,280
this is a soda straw, this is a water straw, this is a milk straw.

196
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
It's called a drink a straw.

197
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Drink a straw.

198
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,320
And it's like kind of the spin off of the food a pan. And it costs very little money.

199
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,960
so if you don't, if you want to sit liquid, if you want to sit and it comes

200
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,560
with or you can buy a big straw that's the size of a bottle

201
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,540
or it has like different flavors. The straw has different flavors. You can put

202
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,240
it into like a sparkling water. Yeah, so you can mix and match the straw flavor

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,600
with the liquid base and you only get one. It's like I want just one sip of

204
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,880
spray. These are disposable. These are like you have to buy like a razor. These

205
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,040
are very bad for the environment. How are you going to turn water in a milk?

206
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,880
very well. That's one of the base liquids. So for example, it's like I can

207
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,540
have nice truck and be filled with water, milk, wine, chicken broth or if

208
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,320
you don't really, if you don't like drinks, then maybe

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:50,080
powder like salt and pepper. Yeah, so then the straws are like strawberry.

210
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,480
Oh, maybe you could do something where it has a savory, has some kind of

211
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,640
vegetable, like just flour in the straw. So when you suck it turns into a

212
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,980
drinkable flower. Oh my God, a little pretzel or a flower where you put it

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,340
into the drink and it sucks up through the stem your drink and it puts it into

214
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,300
the air. Yeah,

215
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,760
here's

216
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,860
the

217
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,660
seven year old girls and you can breathe in the drink in your room. It's like a

218
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,760
humidifier. You can put this is literally like a little girls and you

219
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,600
could probably put any liquid into an ultrasonic humidifier. Yeah, because

220
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,680
they just throw it into the air. Yeah, so I got one of the good. That's the

221
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,740
one that's dangerous. If you use tap water because it throws sediment into the

222
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,800
there, because it doesn't boil the water cool. Miss is dangerous. Yeah, I mean

223
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,040
it's only dangerous if you don't clean it and aren't careful with the water.

224
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,360
Yeah, I've never cleaned or you or you would never clean. I'm not a fish. It's

225
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,880
made out of water. Yeah, it's a humidifier. It's made out of water.

226
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
That's another good one. That is a good one. This is the invention. Yeah, I was

227
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,040
thinking of and it's not really an invention. It's more of like a bio

228
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,000
political engineering okay,

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,120
and it's done to it's not done to humans. So why don't you say what it is yeah,

230
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,400
so don't get all scared or anything. Well, what is it done? What we do

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,800
flavored chickens and eggs yeah, yeah, I'm liking it. So you get a it's one oh

232
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,560
one y'all. Oh, I thought you were giving me a you can have a fist bump, but I

233
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,960
was going to stamp approved on the table. Oh, okay, so what we do we get like

234
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,680
multiple types of chickens like they're already doing it to make chicken breasts

235
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,320
bigger right. Why don't we put as well as the black chicken and the black egg?

236
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, yeah true. The silky

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,560
no, the black chicken and the black egg. It's called black chicken with

238
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,440
completely black egg and I've seen it on a lot of websites and Facebook posts. I

239
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,280
know what this is now, yeah. Black meat. So we're putting, we're gonna, we're

240
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,920
gonna, from birth, from the egg, plus the eggs, they're gonna have like tons of

241
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,960
flavour in them, 'cause it's gonna be flavour concentrate in the egg. You can

242
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,560
cook these, you're gonna be putting barbeque, sour cream and onion. And think

243
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,900
don't want barbecue chicken, though you don't need to then think about it to a

244
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,520
barbecue chicken, because then you got the flavored eggs. You can flavor

245
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,280
separately the yoke and the white create some ratatouille style combination

246
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,380
strawberry and cheese, but but but but but but but what if you were making a

247
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,680
an egg with cheese already in it, so you can make a crazy omelet

248
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,560
was that you're going to say that's that's your problem. What you say is

249
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,900
that you say something and say is that what you're going to say yeah, I've

250
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,740
just diagnosed you well. Here's what I was going to say and you were never

251
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,640
going to guess this okay. I was going to say what if you bake a cake and you

252
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,820
accidentally put a some kind of hamburger egg into into your oh that's

253
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,060
really right yeah and that one that's on you. If you put on if I do, if I do

254
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,120
that that's on you one and then to the eggs are going to have like a screen

255
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,740
printed. Can you have some kind of neutralizer egg or you put that in and

256
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,780
I go back to normal? That's a that should just be exist for flavors in

257
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,820
you know, if you make a mistake, I have been saying this for too long. If I add

258
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,860
too much salt to something to the point where it's completely inedible, you

259
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,660
add pepper should that's it should it doesn't it doesn't, but it should as my

260
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,460
roommate told me in community college and in in college and he told me that's

261
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,580
exactly what you do and I was like that is not what you do. No, I made and I

262
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,020
tried it and it didn't work. It does not work. It just makes it taste worse. I

263
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,300
made a chili that was just far too salty and here I am water

264
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
you

265
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,600
water to chilly, but as flavor remover,

266
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,800
ingredients and

267
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,600
ingredients and because here's every gradient has

268
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,700
a what you do if you are one of these freaks or

269
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,100
don't like gradient out greedy. Oh, my God,

270
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,700
there we go. Here's what it is. It's a it's a

271
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,100
square kind of a scratch and sniff square with a

272
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,300
bunch of different little pellets like pills. They

273
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,100
pop out for each thing cilantro, lime, salt, all

274
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,200
all these things. It's like carry it with you. Yeah, and so if something if

275
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,720
something comes to the table at a restaurant with some shit that you don't

276
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,460
like in it, sprinkle that on, it's neutralized. Well, here's what I was

277
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,500
thinking is that maybe more realistically, it would have to be since

278
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,480
they're they're out gradients. There will have to be the opposite of the

279
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,260
gradients, so you have to go to you'd have to maybe they all look like the

280
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,180
same ones, but opposite and you'd have to go to kind of the ungrocery store

281
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,540
and go shopping and be like okay, I'm going to get all this stuff and then

282
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,480
you have to you'd have a whole separate pantry, a cantry full

283
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,520
gradients and it's like okay. Well, if I'm going to buy this ingredient, I

284
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,780
better buy the out gradient of it and then so it's like you can like they're

285
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,080
all the

286
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,280
yeah. I think so you maybe need a whole nother house. I keep tab with an

287
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
kitchen. You just came up with a

288
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm thinking of a actual product that people can use people in need. I'm just

289
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,380
you want to fit it into actual physics? No, it doesn't know physics framework,

290
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,760
a scientifically designed pellet. Oh, I didn't realize

291
00:15:51,760 --> 00:16:00,100
designs the pellets so that they are basically they're a salt kind of thing

292
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,200
and they are a salt. They're that it's mostly salt. It's or is that is

293
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,160
negative of what are our if somebody like cilantro, they do that. If you did

294
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,700
like the chemical breakdown of it is basically let's do the chemical.

295
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,260
Five hundred percent of your daily sodium in the chemical breakdown,

296
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,560
five hundred percent of your daily sodium intake and then whatever the

297
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,680
other flavor is chemical breakdown. I'm going to say it's going to be a lot of

298
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,000
chlorine hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen, which is a different hydrogen. I

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,400
thought I meant to say no, but you did actually you actually got the right

300
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,040
thing when you said it the first time, because again, this is scientifically

301
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,880
hydrogen high dry gun. No, I think we're going to put him in there.

302
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
What about

303
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,240
it doesn't matter what's in or on the point is that the point is that it

304
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,980
works better than

305
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,380
dehydrated. I do it in bore. I'm often making something. I accidentally add too

306
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,820
much mashed potato flavor or you mash something that you didn't mean to

307
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,380
masher and everything should be honorable. My God, why can't we in this

308
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,120
world undo our mistakes. Why do we have to bear our sins to the grave? We need

309
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
mistakes, mostly culture, yes,

310
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,320
let's get into it.

311
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:18,360
We need to all have click remotes. We do every last person on earth now that I

312
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,400
think one person should be in charge of the click remote and then that should be

313
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,840
kind of that's hard to decide. Everybody's going to think that they're

314
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,800
the one who should be the Sandler yeah. I mean that's why the audition process

315
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,000
excuse myself yeah I'm not I'll step back. I'll let somebody else handle it.

316
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,480
I'll do it. I will not do it. Maybe each group of people, each maybe friend trio

317
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,720
or something like that. I did not think he meant yeah, I mean each race needs

318
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,720
yes, and why would you jump to that one? What is there on each of the seven

319
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,400
continents? This is the

320
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
language for race.

321
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,200
What are you guys on today? Oh my Lord, I'm on each group of people, like each

322
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,280
white group of friends

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,640
has one person who has the remote for that group. Yeah, and then we don't and

324
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,580
then maybe there can be a king who can only everybody group. Yeah, but it can

325
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,680
only control the group. That's good. That's good and it could be families or

326
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,900
just friends. Yeah,

327
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,800
I guess it is a paternal remote because the dad has it in the movie. I never saw

328
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,440
that movie. You never seen. I saw click in the is it supposed to be more funny

329
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,100
or more emotional, more emotional. That's so crazy

330
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,800
because I always thought it was supposed to be simply an osmosis jones style

331
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,420
from Moses Jones is very scary yeah yeah, but the park here it's not really an

332
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,020
emotion. What is the dad here?

333
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,140
What what does he get a remote? What is dricks a

334
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:44,420
strip finger, a finger? Yeah, it's crazy finger. I thought it was strip finger

335
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,400
and I told my girl when I was watching that because I wanted to see it. I said

336
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,380
the villains name is strip finger.

337
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,460
he said the villains name was strep finger

338
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,020
as a name was. Did you ever did she at any point during the movie say I can't

339
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,200
say over and over it's going to is what are they going to say?

340
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:12,140
Strap finger, I think that dricks the idea that it's also just a

341
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,940
said that before on the show, but I just remember I think dricks

342
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,900
said again strip. I think he said something about I think I don't think

343
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,340
that you're that far off. I think you're just well. He has a finger, two things

344
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,560
up.

345
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,020
He definitely has a finger. He uses a finger. He has a finger. He has a

346
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:38,100
soul caliber. What's his name? Drax is the good guy. Drax dricks because it

347
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,900
was Ozzie and dricks. He's the good guy. Yeah, he's dricks. He's the good guy

348
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,100
dricks is the pill and he's

349
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,940
Drax is the guardian of the galaxy. Yeah, Drax is a guardian and groups a

350
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,900
tree, but so what's the evil guy is can't be stress any stress. He's not

351
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,440
strep because of that, can you Google it for he was if Bill Murray's character

352
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,400
was in the hospital like that, most of the video that's what I'm saying,

353
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,220
yeah, there's no way it's

354
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,480
it's finger. Yeah,

355
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:12,560
I will not it's I know it's a so that's what I okay, so can you Google strep

356
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,900
finger as well? What is he supposed to look at him? He looks like he does. Let

357
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,540
me tell you something about Ebola baby and he's an evil Ebola is a case of

358
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,740
and drift compared to me. This is the from the straight from the words of

359
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,220
thrax yeah. Hi, go ahead and this is the search ten seventy. I'm the admin of

360
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,660
this. I know I thought this is part of the thing. Search strap finger, though,

361
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:41,440
and see if that's a real ailment in a cartoon strap finger strap fingers

362
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,920
peeling strap finger infection. It is it's a rare cause of finger super

363
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,820
you can get stretch. You can get strength in your finger. What the fuck you

364
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,500
shouldn't pull up a picture of this on you. I want to see it, but

365
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,100
show it to us, but don't show the audience.

366
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,620
They're completely black fingers. Wow, don't those look

367
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:11,660
those look exactly like the horrible colas. They did that. That's crazy and

368
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,340
that's the what he does in osmosis Jones. No, I will say if he had strip now,

369
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,820
I'm a little more convinced that he was trapped

370
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,700
because that looks fucking serious. Yeah, that was very make a zit

371
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,580
remember. He has the zit isn't that Thrax's fault oils. No, it's like oils

372
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,780
and fried chicken. Yeah,

373
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,020
yeah, he does yeah. He's the fried chicken egg off the monkey exhibit at

374
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,220
the very beginning, yeah at the very floor

375
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,220
and that's how he even gets this guy in the first. That's how he gets to a

376
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,660
Stringer, which why we should do an osmosis Jones question next episode.

377
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,620
What can we do that as Moses Jones panel? Yeah, it's a very good movie. I like

378
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,620
that. I've seen I did. We watched that and recently yeah, we did. I watched it

379
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,820
recently a couple of years ago. I feel like we watched it somewhere. I watched

380
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,080
in a hotel. We watched it in a hotel. We was no, no, it was just me and my

381
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,360
beautiful girlfriend watching osmosis Jones. I said just wait, just wait baby,

382
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,740
I was waiting for a strap fingers.

383
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,120
- Strap fingers are coming right up.

384
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,280
- And if he had showed up, I mean,

385
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,380
that would have been disgusting.

386
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,540
It would have ruined the romantic mood between you two.

387
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,380
- Yeah.

388
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,220
- Yeah.

389
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,700
- Damn, I hate strap finger right now.

390
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,220
- You kind of look like a pill that would be in--

391
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,180
- In Osmosis Jones, I look like an Osmosis Jones character.

392
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,940
- You do, I can see you in the steam room.

393
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,580
No, I just think you have big eyes,

394
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,340
like a cartoon character.

395
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,980
- Remember they had Kid Rock and Josie in that movie?

396
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,180
- And he says that line about, you know what,

397
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,060
or so statutory but I say it's mandatory.

398
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,560
Yeah.

399
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,860
Who said, Kid Rock says that or Joe C?

400
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,900
The little one.

401
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,540
Joe C says that.

402
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,260
Joe C.

403
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,340
I thought Joe said it.

404
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,020
Joe C.

405
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,140
And Osmosis Jones has the evilest smile in the world that's scary to everyone.

406
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,220
Joe C's on that album cover and he's holding a word, a poster, a sign.

407
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,900
Holding a word that says fresh eggs over Kid Rock's penis.

408
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,260
What does that mean?

409
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,820
His penis is fresh eggs?

410
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,980
He's got huevos.

411
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,180
His balls are fresh eggs. Yeah. Yeah. I thought I had to do with sperms.

412
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,680
Probably not a sperm is the exact opposite of a hangout. The sperm is an

413
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,980
ungritty in the south where kid rock is. Women in the south are so fucking

414
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,980
stupid. He's in from Detroit. Shit.

415
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:28,480
That's the Midwest. Fuck that might as well, but he likes hanging out in the

416
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,780
south. Yeah, so they welcomed him with open arms. That's why he went to the

417
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,720
south and he started confusing women by saying you want eggs and he would try to

418
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,860
serve them his hot balls on a plate.

419
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,140
He'd have them piping hot. It looks like two haggis under a plate. He'd cut a

420
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,560
hole under a piece of paper. I don't even know what the haggis looks like. What's

421
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,380
a haggis, you Harry Potter motherfucker? It's intestine. It's Scottish.

422
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:58,820
It's pretty good. Shut up. I've had it before. It's good. You are such a sucker.

423
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,180
I was fine with you until you said it's pretty good. No, you had tone. You are

424
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,780
the ultimate food sucker.

425
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,580
No, I'm not.

426
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,980
You are the food sucker.

427
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,480
That's a...

428
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,080
From now on, you are the food sucker.

429
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,980
That's a food from...

430
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,580
Any kind of weird...

431
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,680
I think that I have Scottish blood in me.

432
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,580
No, shut up.

433
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,280
No, you probably went over it.

434
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Any kind of weird food...

435
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,180
Maybe you did.

436
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,580
Yeah, there's a little bit at the top.

437
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,480
Put a little blood in your top.

438
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,880
Like .01% or something?

439
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,580
Well, no, because I had like tested populations and like there's like Newcastle-upon-Tyne,

440
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,080
which is like right next to Scotland.

441
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,580
If you...

442
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,280
Oh, it's next to it.

443
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,680
If there is a weird food from another country...

444
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,380
That went there.

445
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,420
this guy's going to say no matter what he likes it. No, no matter what he will say

446
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,700
I don't mind if someone says they like food, but if they say it's actually

447
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,180
pretty good yeah, that's you like you. You are an Andrew Zimmer.

448
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,860
Yeah, but I'll eat bizarre foods. I don't care. You are a bizarre food. You

449
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,580
want to start eating. You want to hang out with Timone and Pumba. You want

450
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,540
green. You would hang out with you want green eggs and hen. You would hang out

451
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,080
you

452
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,520
green eggs. You would eat the big you would eat the big gray. We actually

453
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,660
all the time in the cafeteria. Did you all have that now? I'm on made green

454
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,460
eggs at ham one time. You never had that. We had that every year. You're lucky on

455
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,300
what day I don't even know. I have no clue. I don't know what on Saint Patrick

456
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,260
there was some kind of maybe it was a bad first day. Green milk. Yeah, mate

457
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,900
green milk. She made it. She made it actually just mixed it. She put she put

458
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,040
which is synthesize it actually yeah, but I do think that the reverence that you

459
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,440
have for odd foods is really disgusting and you need to get a grip and you just

460
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,160
figure out most shit. You don't like any food man like cheese and bread sign me

461
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,000
up. I should know he's the one who doesn't like he doesn't like any. I like

462
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,160
all food. I like the middle. I won't like making food. I like the middle amount of

463
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,920
yeah. I probably like the most food. The only food I don't like is stuff. That's

464
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,440
gross or outside of my comfort zone.

465
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,140
if

466
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:59,540
if Jesus, if Jesus too spicy, if bread is too crispy, stop making spicy cheese

467
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,580
like guys like I like spicy cheese, stop making it's actually if the mayonnaise

468
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,220
is too cold out the fridge, that is oh and it hurts your teeth.

469
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,980
It's so cold. I heard you God if the water if the water glass to fall and it

470
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,620
dribbles down your chin. No, no, no, I

471
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,580
doesn't matter. They are investigating the McChickening. There's two detectives.

472
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,580
It's the landlord with two detectives. There's two grizzly detectives outside

473
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,580
investigating a McChicken. They are detecting it. Yeah, and they're not

474
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,580
seeing much. That is incredible. Thank God. Thank God for our beautiful landlord.

475
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,580
Oh, we have a DNA sample that we can use, apparently. Oh, yeah. I found the

476
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,580
McChicken wrapper outside. Left a McChicken wrapper outside. And you hear

477
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,580
those sirens? It's happening, y'all. They're coming. They're arresting Patrick.

478
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,880
they're not arresting me for faking the entire McChicken thing from the start.

479
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,740
I was a fire truck from the jump. You were faking it. It could be the fire

480
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,260
truck. Yeah, because you're getting fired and you have to drive a truck.

481
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,700
Yeah, and you're a truck. I drive. Yeah, you don't know how to drive. Yeah,

482
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,660
have you? We went go karting with you, though, and you you fared all right.

483
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,700
That was fine. It's a go cart, though. It's basically the same exact thing.

484
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,940
It's not. It's the psychological thing that matters. Yeah, I can't. I can't

485
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:19,480
drive a car because of my name, which I found out recently. Every single person, if you

486
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:28,680
look up Patrick Doran, there is some incredible car related injury or crime that has happened.

487
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:36,180
There's an Irish traveler who was going around the UK doing a bunch of shit with cars. Then

488
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,580
there is that guy in Richmond, Virginia, who

489
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,700
rented a dump truck under the name Jacob Fury. Right, I remember that. Yeah,

490
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,100
and that is killed a baby and look at that. That's him.

491
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,860
I don't know that is killer. I don't know who that is, but

492
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,260
yeah, baby killer Patrick Doran. And if you look up that Patrick Doran, he

493
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,900
was wanted by US Marshals. If you look him up, if you look up fat

494
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,780
Patrick Doran on YouTube, he's there.

495
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,180
Oh, this looks like there's some kind of one lunch on and enjoy this some

496
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,380
pedophile guy is not a pedophile. This is the way. This is the guy who killed a

497
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,820
baby is not a guy who killed a dozen darn. I mean, it is the same name. It

498
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,460
looks like a type of guy would kill a baby. I think that guy looks handsome.

499
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,020
He looks like a shit bird. Shit head looks like a shit bird. Are they coming

500
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,660
in here? Chill out. You need to relax. You mean are they coming? There's what

501
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
What do you mean?

502
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,140
There's a door right there they could walk into.

503
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Why would they walk in there?

504
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,140
There's nobody at the door.

505
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,420
She walked in like Kramer that one time.

506
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,260
Yeah that was the day that we moved in.

507
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,180
Yeah I know but what if she walks in and does it again?

508
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,180
She opens the door.

509
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Oh no!

510
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
That would ruin everything.

511
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
We'd have to move.

512
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
That would ruin everything.

513
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
No it would ruin the episode.

514
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
You're ruining the episode right now.

515
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
I'm not ruining the episode.

516
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
And I'm bringing it back.

517
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
Let's get that energy up.

518
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,180
I want to see you bounce off of that.

519
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
I'm not bouncing off of that.

520
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
I'm not bouncing off of that.

521
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
I'm not bouncing off of that.

522
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,180
I'm not bouncing off of that.

523
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I'm not bouncing off of that.

524
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,180
I want to see you bounce it.

525
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:09,540
What's wrong with you? This McChicken thing has you in all out of sorts.

526
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Yeah. I'm really not doing well. It must be the feng shui in here.

527
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,540
It definitely is the feng shui. It must be the feng shui in this room. It must be the feng shui.

528
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,540
It has to be. I'm so fucked, man. We should move the fucking table around.

529
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,540
Let's start the episode.

530
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,700
need to move the table around. You think so yeah, I think it's fine. I don't

531
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,940
think you should move the table. We can turn it. We can turn it at a crescent

532
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,320
moon shape. It is a crescent moon shape. It's not a little bit more. It's a half

533
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,420
moon shape. It's a half moon. We can make it a crescent and then change the

534
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,020
function. You want to make it a jigsaw and shave my friend.

535
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,300
I've heard of a waning moon, but that's a bit. I don't know the moon cycle. I

536
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,260
don't remember it. Basically, it starts out nothing and then it grows to full and

537
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,720
and it's small, yeah, and it goes away. If you watch it, the all if you watch it

538
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,260
twenty four hours a day, which is possible because sometimes it because

539
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,380
of traveling around the earth, the play, yes, yes, yes, if you watch it twenty

540
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,700
four hours a day, there is no moon phases man yeah, and that's when you

541
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,220
realize the moon phases are bone falses. Their moon falses is what I mean to say

542
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,720
and they don't exist. It's all just a moon. Just a trick of the light yeah. If

543
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,640
you saw a guy every couple of weeks and he was getting taller, would you say,

544
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,080
"Oh, this guy has different phases that he goes in"?

545
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,160
Well, if he got shorter again and then he repeated every month, I might say

546
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,800
that. Yeah. No. I would definitely say that. No, you wouldn't. I would totally

547
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,000
say that. The guy got taller every single day and then one day, just like,

548
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,960
one day, he gradually went down. Yeah, I'd be like, "Oh, he's waning today."

549
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,880
Yeah. He did not do that. Wayne, his name is Wayne. His name is not Wayne.

550
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,680
his name is not wax. Max is waxing Matt Max and Wayne. This is Max Wayne. Okay,

551
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,440
so today we decided to do a little bit of a study on Feng Shui, which if you

552
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,980
don't know is Chinese for water and wind. Is that true? Yeah. Oh man, I

553
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,060
learned that from my website. That makes a lot of sense. During my research,

554
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:12,500
I found plenty of wind references. Yeah. And double in water. We have all three

555
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,180
us always been so fascinated by feng shui and honestly since the beginning of the

556
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,980
podcast since 2018 we have been like waiting for a chance to really delve

557
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,780
into and be like can we get down to business and do the feng shui episode

558
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,040
yeah but it's tough it's tough because people don't want you to do it people

559
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,400
don't I mean I mean it is sacred knowledge there's feng shui masters yeah

560
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,780
I've learned but I also learned doing this I have a fucked up I had my house

561
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,220
has like complete anti feng shui feng shui is so fucked you're supposed to

562
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,720
I have the bed not looking at your door yeah, which is there's all sorts of

563
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,820
things. Do you know what's horrible about my house is feng shui right now is

564
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:52,160
that we switched. We switched our office in our living room and the new living

565
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,280
room is great and it's really cozy and nice, but the new office is the worst

566
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,120
room of all time and that's just bookcases in two desks and it's so bad

567
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,100
that we keep the lights off all day and it's in the middle of the house and it's

568
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,880
like it doesn't exist. It's like you're walking through a portal from the

569
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,920
kitchen. I'm going it's horrible funks bad, bad, what is really bad? What if

570
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,720
combine the two we're looking at getting a chair a living law let's change the

571
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:23,360
office to an arcade yeah yeah your girlfriend with a barcade barcade is not

572
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,160
a bad idea. Oh my I wanted to change it. What did I want to change it to that I

573
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,960
will there was trouble with maybe it was a room for building things. You didn't

574
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,880
put enough Godzilla stuff in a man cave. No, I was thinking more of like a

575
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,120
laboratory yeah nerd a man laboratory man tell me my slideshow I would like to

576
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,120
see this so let's see I went to a website called I don't remember what it

577
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:59,520
was called calm no mm-hmm very very funny really fucking I went to a website I

578
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,320
don't remember what it was called but it was a forum for funks way things and I

579
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,600
found some amazing questions that we are here to answer. Pizza slice shaped house

580
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,520
equals bad feng shui. This is it and it's also called geomancy I learned. Yes.

581
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,160
Geomancy slash feng shui. So someone named Tor says, "Hey all, I see a place. I liked it

582
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,000
very much. Me and hubby walked in, felt very comfortable and somehow we just kept

583
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,920
keep going there despite first time viewing. They reject our offer. Second

584
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,120
time viewing, we increased COV. Someone offered higher COV. Then somehow the

585
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,280
the higher C. O. V. Did not go through, so we still offered and they accepted.

586
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,240
Now it is transacted and it is mine, and I read here that those pizza slice

587
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,120
shaped layout is bad. Any way to remedy? What is C. O. V. Pepperonis?

588
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,080
So yeah, so okay, so how do you fix this? If you find yourself the proprietor

589
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,520
of a pizza shaped house, which way? Which way? Which way? Pizza shape going

590
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,520
vertical or the whole house is a pizza shape? I believe it's a pizza shaped

591
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,560
floor plan. Yeah, I think it's I think most feng shui. I don't think most

592
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,520
feng shui deals with the shape of the house from outside. I think it's

593
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,600
okay. The floor plan. Okay, so their house is like shaped like a pizza.

594
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,840
One of those like fun house tunnels that keeps going like this.

595
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,640
That's what I'm wondering. Yeah, I don't they included a floor. This is a

596
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,360
very old pose. It's 10 years old. So they included a picture, but it's gone

597
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,040
now. Oh, I couldn't see it, but I'd imagine it's something like

598
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,360
akin to the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile, where it is a pizza shaped house that

599
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,760
looks like the front door is on the pointy end or the crust. I would hope

600
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,320
that the front door is on the pointy end. The pointy end, it's going to be

601
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,120
this thin. Yeah, but that's your hallway.

602
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,560
How are you going to get through this little door, man? It's a point.

603
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,520
Hopefully, it would motivate you to lose some weight if you're a fat fatty.

604
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,360
To become as thin as nothing? I think that the person who buys a pizza slice

605
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,860
shape tells will need to lose some weight. True way, no matter where the

606
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,900
idea of buying a house that is a giant piece of pizza is looking at a

607
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,200
shaved as you wait.

608
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,680
Is this a bad for a

609
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,180
giant pizza house, but yeah, pepperonis round table, desk, ground chairs,

610
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,740
overhead, the round, the round, the plastic table, yes, yes, round everything

611
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,500
and then for the crust, a rug that is brown. Yeah,

612
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,420
yellow floors, yellow and I think you do just have to lean into the pizza theme

613
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,100
anchovies in the bath. What is your opinion for showcasing weapons in the

614
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,520
house? S Ryan yth he says single here will be getting my two room flat soon and

615
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,780
living alone. I fancy buying a Japanese katana sword, not from authentic sword

616
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,120
blacksmith's blade of is of course blunt in accordance. Some more of a sword like

617
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,000
object that is a low to display my bedroom as I really like the aesthetic.

618
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,140
I'm usually not a very superstitious person, but a weapon is still a weapon,

619
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,720
even though it is not authentic, I guess.

620
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,160
Would you advise someone to display weapons in the house,

621
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,200
especially the bedroom?

622
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,120
And if anyone knows if there is any temple

623
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,160
that can bless the sword to act as a deterrent

624
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,800
against malignant spiritual forces,

625
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,560
as in, and then some thing I don't know.

626
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,960
As I said, I'm not particularly superstitious,

627
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,000
but I could use all the spiritual help if I can.

628
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
Thanks in advance.

629
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,040
So you got a couple of replies here.

630
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,800
This person says, "Hmm, it depends on many factors.

631
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,000
If we speak about katanas,

632
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,420
I don't see anything wrong with doing it,

633
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,780
but if you want to showcase some fire guns, I don't think it's such a

634
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,240
good idea. Maybe if you have a collection of old and rare hunting guns,

635
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,460
I would understand it, but showcasing any other kind of gun, it's not okay.

636
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,260
I have five pistols, so do I have to showcase them in my living

637
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,540
room? Nah, I don't think it's a good idea. I even ordered a new

638
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,420
Sig Sauer. It is my sixth gun. I decided to buy it after reading

639
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,520
this Sig Sauer 1911 review. I mean, this gun seems to be precisely what

640
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,380
I want from a freaking pistol. And then this is the last comment here,

641
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,580
this guy, I think, just got confused about the topic and said, Hi, all I want to

642
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,660
choose a scope for hunting. I am considering various options, but I

643
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,380
decided to stop at the vortex. What do you say? The vortex? That's a brand. Oh,

644
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,260
but this guy, I thought he was saying he's I thought this is some feng shui

645
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,780
related thing. No, no, this guy does not look at he's the only everybody on this

646
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,460
forum is Singapore is from Singapore, except for this guy and his name is

647
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,460
Kerrigan. And I think this is the only comment he ever made. Huh? Wow. Help

648
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,440
does anyone know where to get a red roof,

649
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,840
maybe from a chest from a trove yeah yeah. How do you get a red ruby,

650
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,240
because apparently I bet if you finish a dungeon, there's a good oh yeah, I

651
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,440
would say go to your nearest dungeon. You may be a

652
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,720
kill everything in there yeah. See if there's a chest

653
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:43,220
lately. My HDB block underwent H, I P and the two toilets in each of the

654
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,020
six units could not be used for ten days, meaning weewee, poo-poo, slash washing have to go void

655
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,980
deck. Some rich ones moved out and stayed elsewhere temporary. Only then all neighbors discussed

656
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,700
about toilets and also appreciate the importance of toilets.

657
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,940
Is this about a boat?

658
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,540
No, this is just about something in their apartment.

659
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Oh, okay.

660
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,140
Something about a toilet. I think I accidentally included this, but it was a funny comment.

661
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,300
Well, yeah, I guess 'cause feng shui is a lot about the different elements, I think. And

662
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,060
a toilet is a strong water element.

663
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,340
Weewee and poo-poo and washing.

664
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,340
It is the controller.

665
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,340
And there's a lot of posts about toilets on this forum.

666
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Office desk near toilet.

667
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,340
So this is a bad, this is a dangerous situation.

668
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,340
This is not where you want to find yourself at any point in time,

669
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
is with your office desk near a toilet.

670
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Hi everyone. Any advice?

671
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Recently I joined a company. My desk is near to the toilet.

672
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
I can even hear the flushing sound.

673
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,340
I heard that this is bad from Feng Shui perspective.

674
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,340
Out of all the companies I had joined, this is the only company that I felt

675
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,340
that I have lose my confidence in my job and things has not been going so smoothly. I'm

676
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:52,780
not sure what whether I'm being superstitious or if it's true. Any advice? Thanks. The smell

677
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:59,700
or even the thought of the smelly, smelly yucks already bad lau la. If one of your colleague

678
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:05,240
didn't flush that day or have a bad stomach, you'll be the first hand filter. Superstitious

679
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,660
or not, you already lost half the battle. That's what I was going to say is I don't think you

680
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,620
you even need to bring Feng Shui into it to know that this is a

681
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:18,980
inauspicious setup. Yeah, which they all want to be either auspicious or

682
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,500
inauspicious when they're selecting. Mostly they want to be auspicious, I

683
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:26,060
think. But they always are talking about if something is auspicious or inauspicious

684
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,100
in this forum.

685
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,260
And then this guy says, "One way is to treat each flush as a nature waterfall

686
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,740
and psychologically win the war,"

687
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,500
which is genius. And people just have a positive mindset here. Look, far,

688
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,700
God wants to train you to be different and specializes in thus temporary

689
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,580
torture. You enjoy the torturing and become a great man in the coming. You

690
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:53,500
are not far from success. That is really deep yeah. It does say Leo at the end,

691
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,720
which I think is some kind of I think it's some kind of Singapore word for

692
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,060
like bro bro yeah. I think it's like Singaporean for bro yeah.

693
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,300
Harry Porter's magic

694
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,820
Kelly Manton says, so do you guys believe in Harry Porter's magic? In today's

695
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,740
world, is there such a thing as black magic? What do you guys think?

696
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,420
Yes. Yes. You think there is such a thing as Harry Porter's black magic? I'm

697
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,820
looking at a black magic device. What is it? Oh, right there. Oh, wow, that's

698
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,980
very interesting.

699
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,660
There could be something emitting off of that right now. Some kind of frequency or

700
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,180
field.

701
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,220
That scares me. Wi-Fi is a type of black magic. That is. Last night, oh my God,

702
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,500
I'm sorry to, I'm sorry to go off topic.

703
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:44,100
Last night I was playing video games. My wife is at my house with her sister,

704
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,660
okay? They're in the living room, I'm in the bedroom playing video games,

705
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,180
they're giggling, I think they're probably pillow fighting or mud wrestling

706
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,100
or something, until the internet cuts out.

707
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,500
They were playing with the cable.

708
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,380
They literally were playing with the cable!

709
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,180
Really?

710
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,540
Dude, I walk out, I say, "Did you guys turn off the internet?" She was like,

711
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,040
you know I

712
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,000
I didn't turn off the internet, but I unplugged the like cable cable because

713
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,540
we don't need it and I was like

714
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:18,560
I was like what she's like yeah, you know the like cable thing the thing that

715
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,200
goes into the TV. I just unplugged it because we don't we don't have a TV

716
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,080
that we don't have cable. I was like that's where the internet comes from.

717
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,780
She's like no, it's not it comes from the wi fi router and I had to explain to

718
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,900
a grown woman how the internet works and then she unplug it two more times. I

719
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,980
I think she did that on purpose to know do I mean they were giggling. It was

720
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,420
killing me. I literally I've never been so mad. I wanted to cave their heads

721
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,420
and yeah, yeah, and they made us lose games. So, but just sorry that's a

722
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,980
little that was and I blame bad feng shui. Yeah, both of that for making them

723
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,300
if this rock is the feng shui had been good. The cable would not have even been

724
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,100
in a place where it could be unplugged. Yeah, I agree. Wow. Well, okay, the

725
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,140
other one, the expert, they unplugged it once and then when they were trying to

726
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,140
plug it back in, they unplugged it again while trying to plug it back. They

727
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,220
they plugged it in and then try they and then they didn't they didn't they

728
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,180
didn't try to be lucy righty jump up with it. Yes, well yeah, but they were

729
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,060
trying to eat it. They thought that it was going to it was a straw yeah, but

730
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,480
then they put then they put a piece of we have like a big storage chest and

731
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,980
then they put it directly on top of it and unplugged it once more. So that was

732
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,960
my fucking Monday night. God, we've had such a feng shui experience these past,

733
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,160
however, of much. I have a couple more slides, so Harry Porter's magic, of

734
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,440
of course, is Feng Shui related. Geomancer's hand chopped off. What? So

735
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,700
this is a story, I won't get into the story,

736
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:45,140
but basically this is a guy who said, who's a geomancer, got his hand chopped

737
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,100
off in a vicious attack, and he admitted that he did not get any premonition that

738
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,220
something bad would happen. Wow. And the comments give him what for for this?

739
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,200
To tear him apart? Full loads of excuses, calling himself a Feng Shui expert and

740
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,020
not a fortune teller, can't even predict for himself how to help others. See this

741
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,300
is why I don't call myself a Feng Shui expert. Yeah, you never know when your

742
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,220
hand's going to get chopped off and people say, and you look like a bitch,

743
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,580
you look like a fucking bitch, as I get your hand chopped off. Yeah, if I got my

744
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:19,220
hand chopped off, man, man, that changed a lot of stuff in my life. Oh yeah, and

745
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,700
then also about half the stuff in my life, the last change, it would change

746
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,820
how I open doors forever. The last thing here is that there's a bunch of posts on

747
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,840
this forum that is really old, like from 2006 and stuff, that I've just been

748
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,680
completely deleted, but they have good names. But this is my favourite one. I

749
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,680
really wanted to read it, but it only had the title. It just says, "What the

750
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,120
Fish?"

751
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:49,760
The 16-year-old post called "What the Fish?" What the Fish? Wow! What the Fish?

752
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,360
But I honestly, I spent two or three hours going through this forum, and I

753
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,100
so much about fun. I thought function way was I honestly thought that it was

754
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,400
Pilates. I thought it was an exercise, but I knew what it was about Frazier

755
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,900
putting the couches and interesting way. It's pretty fun. Mine is kind of more

756
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:13,200
about how I kind of put in a bunch of function way rules and stuff that I

757
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,000
found from online. Okay, that maybe we could think about for the office or if

758
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,400
we're designing a house for us all to live together in the future that I know

759
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,600
we talked about maybe once before, but it's definitely in the cards. Maybe will

760
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,600
will happen. And it's funny to say cards, but we'll get to that

761
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,600
later. But so these are kind of just some some rule, feng shui

762
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,000
rules and ideas for whenever we're designing a space that we

763
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,100
can maybe build a house, a car, I'll pull up this, this will be

764
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,700
all these things that we can and they're from a bunch of

765
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,600
websites. And we can just talk about how we might implement

766
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,100
them and how it might be fun in our space. So first off,

767
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,100
doormats, feng shui rules for doormats. And so this is

768
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,800
something that we this is the first thing you got to think

769
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,740
about right now. Our doormat is just red. Yeah, so we're actually going to look

770
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,600
into this. All right. Well, we do have a doormat. Yeah,

771
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,440
welcome to the front entrance of your home with favorable colors, shapes and

772
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,640
accessories like doormats. Feng Shui rules suggest the right doormat will

773
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,540
give a boost of positive energy every time you or a guest crosses it to enter

774
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:13,100
your space, which makes sense to me. So door direction establishes mat design.

775
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,680
So does someone have a compass app on their phone? Does anyone still have the

776
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,480
compass done? Maybe I do, but I wanna figure out what direction our door faces

777
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,440
so we can figure out the door faces or I guess you can use New York style

778
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,340
thinking. I think it's facing north northeast. It looks northeast to me.

779
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Yeah, because it's do it this way. Yeah, it's northeast 30 degrees. Alright,

780
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,980
so southwest or northeast, the earth element is in the southwest and northeast

781
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,640
earth's colors are sandy clay and soil shades as well as red, pink, yellow and

782
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,580
purple, none of the pastels. The best shape for the mat is square. We are

783
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,000
they're already that's a kind of a rectangle. It's okay, though it's okay,

784
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,460
but it could be, but we'd need to cut it down to a square. Also, we need to make

785
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,900
a door mat that is like a tooth tunes where you step on and it plays a song.

786
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,260
Yeah,

787
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:07,260
every time you walk in,

788
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,520
then let's see the black hat school of function, which I don't know what that

789
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,140
is. I put the same thing a black hat hacker yeah, so it's a bad guy teaches

790
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,860
and a black mat at the door that is about as wide as the door is a money magnet

791
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,700
and will energize your career. So there's something to think about to yeah,

792
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,800
maybe we change it. Then maybe we get another one. I don't really give a shit

793
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,840
about money. I don't I also I'm not sure if we should trust the black hat school

794
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,900
because they sound sound a little sinister. They sound kind of maybe I

795
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,080
don't agree with them

796
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,520
and also mind your message. So we're doing well here. Forget cutesy sayings

797
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,380
and monogram mats. No one's home. No rug rats allowed and be where the cat are

798
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,000
guaranteed to chase away positive chi or at least give it pause placing your name

799
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,400
or under initials underfoot just means people are stepping on or wiping their

800
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,760
dirty shoes on the Smith Jones residence every time they visit. Why would you

801
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,240
want that? So you have to find a good message. I guess that's not funny or has

802
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,200
your name in it and we have no something just like this. That's good monogram

803
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,720
dried on doormat yeah step here step here for positive chi could be good.

804
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,460
that seems like a no brainer. Actually, it is also a bullshit holiday mat.

805
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,020
That's good. You wipe your well. You don't really want to step in shit, so

806
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,580
maybe foot cleaner, shit eater, clean step here to clean shit,

807
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,940
parenthesis, meta meta, meta for a bullshit bullshit that doesn't get on

808
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,660
shoes. Yeah, and it's metaphorically and it doesn't get on your shoes

809
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,580
and it actually invites positive. Chee, how about just a picture of the

810
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,640
fucking Queen. Yes, that's not bad with her eyes X out

811
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,460
holiday match should be displayed with extreme care. No kitschy or cluttered

812
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,060
designs and removed promptly when the holiday period ends faded beachy flip

813
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,500
flops in February or happy holidays with poinsettias in July signals that you are

814
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,480
lazy or just don't care about the all important portal at the gate of your

815
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,320
home. That's not a good message for guests or good fortune. So switch them

816
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,700
out with the holidays. Okay, stop get rid of the Christmas one after Christmas.

817
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,940
stop with the Christopher that's important and also for here's to how to

818
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,820
get it auspicious.

819
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,740
What oh yeah, this is just what I wanted to read one lucky trick is to tuck red

820
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,180
ribbon tied feng shui coins. So they have a whole currency under the mat to

821
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,700
attract money to your door. Three coins are okay, but nine are better. So here's

822
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:26,540
what I've learned about this this coin thing. So you use its Chinese coins and

823
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:31,860
you use them like real coins, but you put you people put them under the door

824
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,780
ground, but they also when they tile their homes, they will put coins under

825
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,580
each tile.

826
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,940
So your house is full of fucking money. Well, that makes sense. It's a money

827
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,140
magnet. Yeah, we're no wait opposites attract. So wouldn't you want to have

828
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,220
opposite money?

829
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:51,100
Radiate version of here's the hard thing. Opposites attract shit under your

830
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,980
tiles, but birds of a feather

831
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,740
so long together, but wait. So how do we square one in the hand is worth and

832
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,220
wait square the circle?

833
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,460
What the fuck does that make sense? What is that? Square the circle. I think we're

834
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,620
finding out something about the world right now. So, okay, so a doormat is a

835
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,100
square and you put circles under it. Also, what about a doormat? What about

836
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,780
your doorman? Is that good feng shui or bad feng shui? An old doorman? It depends

837
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:23,180
on if he's nice or mean, I guess. An old doorman named Coin. An old doorman from

838
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:28,060
New Orleans named Coin. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea. Coin Crabtree. Yeah,

839
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,980
that's an amazing. That's a really good idea and that's got to be the luckiest

840
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,420
doorman you could have yeah hundred percent hundred percent.

841
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,780
You can function your bedroom for better sex. Okay, guys, I don't even want to

842
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,340
know about all this guys. I think we can maybe use this in the office. Okay, why

843
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:49,980
who's having sex in this office? If you play your cards right with what or who I

844
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,300
mean

845
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:54,980
with what with or I mean like you know,

846
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,240
but what can we do a piece of rope? So first of all, find the love a

847
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,480
relationship corner. So this is a map, which I guess I didn't know about this

848
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,540
before I was did research, but I guess each corner of everything

849
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:12,660
of the house has a different thing. So if you want to have sex, you should

850
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,860
always have it in the back right corner of your room, because that's the love

851
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,940
and marriage square. We are my radiator is we are in the wealth and prosperity

852
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,020
corner. We are in the wealth and prosperity corner right now, but we're

853
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,620
left, but I can't read these right. My what does that say Casper career?

854
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:35,640
That's the front door. No, the that's the your piano, okay, is in the career

855
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,400
Pat's desk is in

856
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,960
knowledge, so knowledge and self cultivation. That's pretty good, genius

857
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,920
and the bathroom is in the love and marriage

858
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:53,140
so I think we just figured out that's where it's going to go down. Huh, what

859
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:59,920
it it sexual center, it just a center. That's good. If on a long enough

860
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,580
timeline,

861
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:07,420
anything happens yeah. How if if somebody will have sex in this bathroom with

862
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,420
another person who works in this office, it's between the three of us.

863
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,940
I think that it would be probably

864
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,700
it would probably be Alex and Patrick. I think

865
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:24,540
why I could see that I see that the most yeah. That's why you guys wouldn't do it

866
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,460
at your house, because like a girlfriend's there yeah here is like a

867
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,060
it's like this is the this is broke back mountain yeah

868
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:36,380
and I think you guys could have like this street yeah down the street where

869
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,860
she can walk over whenever she wants. That's what happens in broke back

870
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,260
mountain. Yeah, that's true. She walks in

871
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,180
what the hell's

872
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,740
here fucking this guy also. Why are you dressed like a cowboy

873
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:56,900
guy can't read any of this? I did a or a small as they call it in fung shui. I

874
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,020
want to go here. This here's the nose, the big, not okay, the big nose for

875
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:06,660
having a sexual room, okay, fung shui do not have violent, aggressive, lonely or

876
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,040
desolate imagery in the bedroom. So it says no civil war scene, no painting of

877
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,200
the vase of dead flowers and no painting of a single person or a barren

878
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:23,280
landscape. Wow, so just keep that stuff out. You want to be sexy, no evil pain.

879
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,200
I saw another thing that was how to stop your partner from cheating on you using

880
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,400
fun. One of the biggest ones that they reiterated multiple times is don't have

881
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,720
two beds in your bed.

882
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,960
That's funny, because this one said try to have

883
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,640
doubles of everything in your bedroom to represent couples.

884
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,240
so there's a lot of contradiction and that's why we need a function of master

885
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,560
and the other big the other big nose filth and clutter being dirty with your

886
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,080
lover in the bed is fine, but dirt and clutter in your bedroom is a definite

887
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:59,360
love slayer and in the game of thrones way, not the beyonce way. Wow yeah, so

888
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,120
you're on fucking die yeah, okay, but then I think this next slide is what I

889
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,760
really wanted to talk about the most. No, this isn't this is just an extra

890
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,720
thing color theory within a chair context. So this is just a diagram. I

891
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,820
found that I thought was funny that if you're getting a gaming chair, this is

892
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,020
the colors you pick whether you wanted to be energetic and optimistic or calming

893
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,920
and creative. Now, this is specifically a website I found for there was a gaming

894
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,800
chair website that had a whole page about the fun way of the chairs. You know,

895
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,320
this is my gaming chair. This is the chair, the exact chair I use on my desk.

896
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,420
Really? Isn't that awful? That's horrid. Yeah, it's really horrid, but it is the

897
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,980
color is formal, stable and harmonious, though. Well, I actually have a brown

898
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,760
one. Okay, okay, that's not even on the chart yeah, but here we go. Whoa,

899
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,900
oh shit, this is actually incredible and this actually will change our lives

900
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,300
forever. Okay, because this is maybe so excited to go back to hit the casino

901
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:53,460
again. I have learned so much from what I needed. I went on like five websites

902
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,460
about this and this is we're going to have a gambling room in our house.

903
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,120
That's obvious, yeah, because we can also use this one. Oh, that's what you

904
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,880
need to use this extra room for in your yeah, yeah, but here we go.

905
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,380
According to function, you are also lucky if there's a small hill or a

906
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:12,460
mountain behind your structure. The land formation symbolizes the patronage of

907
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,740
the turtle. If you have the presence of a mountain on the left of your

908
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,600
structure, it means that a green dragon protects you. The turtle and the green

909
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,900
dragon can give you and the inhabitants of your structure great fortune and

910
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,320
prosperity. I knew that about the turtle, so we need to build our structure

911
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:33,240
near around and yeah, so or turtles live in the water under wait, we're going to

912
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,640
but we're going to have a gambling room in our home. Yeah, where or we could

913
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,720
just build a casino, but in here, what's the money come from? Who does it go to

914
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,960
wherever the money comes from in a casino? The bank, I guess yeah, but if

915
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,560
so, we I think that this is more useful for us to scope out lucky. Yeah, so

916
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,040
that's what that was. This started out as I was saying, okay, we can build a

917
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,320
gambling room, but this did turn into how a lot of these are how to win money

918
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,320
at a casino, because I think I think the only place that I can think of is is

919
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:09,360
like a casino Royale in whatever, Monty whatever, or Las Vegas has mountains.

920
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,600
Yeah, so Vegas, there you go. But it has to be to the left to get the Green

921
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,640
Dragon's protection. Is there a mountain or any kind of maybe like a butte or

922
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,440
something in Atlantic City? We could make one. There is no, no, it's as flat as

923
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,480
an apple. But we could lift it up with geographical, geological activity.

924
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,760
you say to decide and they could do some they do they do that in reforming

925
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,920
oceans, one of the oceans, which one the third one, the second one, no, they

926
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,960
build a mountain. They cause an earthquake

927
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:44,340
to be a drill yeah that basically can make a mountain. That's what I guess

928
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,480
mountains is you would get a drill underneath up. Well, if you just push it,

929
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,720
that's what if you push them together, I'm millions of fucking years yeah, but

930
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,760
we just do it fast with hyper power. Yeah, okay, anyway, here are a few

931
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,920
suggestions to attract feng shui luck for your game play. So here pay close

932
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,600
attention. Okay,

933
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:06,500
limit bathroom breaks before playing a game in a casino. Make sure that you go

934
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,660
to the bathroom first and do whatever is necessary to avoid breaks during your

935
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:14,540
game. This is to prevent your hands from getting wet because water is a symbol of

936
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,280
money. According to Chinese lore, you will lose your winnings. If you wash your

937
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,920
hands, if you need bathroom breaks in between games, try to stay dry and

938
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,160
anticipate nature calls. So what I'm getting here is it's not actually that

939
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,600
you need to not go to the bathroom. You just need to not wash your hands. If

940
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,160
don't wash your hands and don't get P on your finger and this goes those hands

941
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,860
dry fucking dealers, no lotion, no lotion at all and dealers stop washing

942
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,120
your hands yeah because you got that your wife. We need a fully drive. We

943
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,480
need a dehumidifier and in the casino to bring a dehumidifier pack in your

944
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,920
backpack. It's an amazing idea, okay, so then here's the other one where a ring

945
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,020
if you're going to plan a casino, make sure that you are wearing your ring on

946
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,420
the correct finger. Remember not to wear a ring on your thumb when going to

947
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,680
casinos, because it symbolizes letting go of success and losing all your wealth

948
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,700
on your thumb. It is a really dangerous thing to symbolize. Yeah, you know

949
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,060
that's all. I think all your love that's maybe the worst possible. They're

950
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,860
going to instantly

951
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:12,660
you must wear a jade ring on your left hand. If you're a woman and your right

952
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,340
hand, if you're a man, so we got to get some jade rings to not wear on our thumb.

953
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:17,400
Yeah,

954
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:22,840
invite a pregnant friend. Pregnant women attract good luck for gamblers,

955
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,840
according to Chinese beliefs. Even if there's a pregnant stranger standing

956
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,440
behind you to watch the game, make sure that she stays and lets you win. Just

957
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,420
making her like

958
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,760
follow you around, putting a leash on her yeah, but so yeah as many pregnant

959
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,280
women as possible are going to up your luck. Factor next time your your friend

960
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,340
tells you that she's pregnant, you say oh my God, but you know you're going to

961
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:42,800
Vegas.

962
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,340
Yeah,

963
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,800
One last dry, dry trip to Las Vegas.

964
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
Well, now you can get fucked up.

965
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,360
Just don't wash your hands.

966
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,320
Just getting her fucked up on all her weird

967
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,680
pregnancy craving foods,

968
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,760
like putting pickles in peanut butter sandwiches.

969
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,840
Damn.

970
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,080
All that pregnant food sounds good to me.

971
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,960
My mom still orders a fucking chicken parm sub

972
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,440
with pickles and mayo on it.

973
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,920
'Cause I got her fucking pregnant.

974
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,960
'Cause the pregnant thing.

975
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,800
Yeah, 'cause I got her pregnant.

976
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,080
She did that at a real Italian place one time

977
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,580
when she got they looked at her like she was the stupidest person. She's

978
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,920
pregnant with my son and I'm going to name him Patrick. No, yeah, you won't

979
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,580
have a son named Patrick. I think that's my last. If you had a kid and you named

980
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,340
him Patrick, that would not even be an honour.

981
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:33,000
Whoa, okay, there goes my name idea. I'm sorry. It was either

982
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,160
nice try. My son's name will be norm CK Carlin

983
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,940
Murphy changing it just to Patrice. You had

984
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:47,280
top of the list and right under it with the trees. You're just like

985
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,380
I was going to have Timothy Chalamet, Fetter, yes, and Sir Sir Ronan Fetter

986
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,440
and my daughter, Amy Wong, Heidecker,

987
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,080
Jas

988
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,820
my daughter,

989
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,120
fucking

990
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,120
Super Deluxe, my daughter,

991
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:14,260
Sam, Sam Kitteson, the insult comic dog, my kid,

992
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:23,020
Super Deluxe Doran, Bart Homer Fetter, yeah, this is my daughter, Jashua. Is

993
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,180
your son coming to the party? Which one funny or die?

994
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:32,060
Yeah, they're both coming. All right, this next one, so

995
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,960
you guys know about like a non standard McDonald's like the you know this one

996
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,620
here that shaped like a like a church or something and then this one on the

997
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,620
what the right that shaped like a bank. It's like a government one on the left

998
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,100
the one on the left is a church yeah. That's not a church. It looks like a

999
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,540
church.

1000
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,340
That's like a town hall. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1001
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:52,980
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1002
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,340
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1003
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,540
zoo. No, that one's a church and then the other one looks like a

1004
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:01,700
bank. So then I saw I looked up the I was trying to find the

1005
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,100
fung shui of McDonald's, maybe an article talking about it. But

1006
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:11,020
there was a McDonald's in Hacienda Heights, I think it's

1007
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:15,380
somewhere in LA, suburban LA, that remodeled their whole

1008
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,640
fucking place under the principles they got a consultant

1009
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,020
in. They they made it look like this. It looks incredible. This

1010
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,220
this is a function. McDonald. This is like a normal McDonald. This looks like

1011
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,340
the McDonald's looks like the Burger King. They stop at on the mega bus.

1012
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:35,220
No, no, look at those red table. Okay, you're going to see more photos. You're

1013
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,140
going to see more photos. The colors are a little different, but this is I would

1014
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:43,020
not Cameron. There is a waterfall in here where you'll see just be patient.

1015
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,040
The ancient Chinese practice of function is designed to provide people with a

1016
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,360
sense of serenity. A McDonald's in suburban Los Angeles has recently been

1017
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,260
remodel to reflect the principles of function way. There are waterfalls,

1018
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:57,020
wooden ceilings and a specially designed entryway. The doors don't align, so we

1019
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,780
confuse the evil spirits and they stay out and we keep the good spirits in, says

1020
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,860
Mark Brownstein, the restaurant's owner and operator.

1021
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:10,140
If you look up McDonald's fight on YouTube, millions of results, none of

1022
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:15,140
them at this McDonald's. That is so true. Can I say something really quickly that

1023
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,500
I learned about function way, which is when you move, you're supposed to be

1024
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,980
you're supposed to do something called a door blessing when you move into a new

1025
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:26,660
place where you roll a pineapple all around the apartment. Wow. And if you do

1026
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:31,460
it wrong, you will get 100% a demon living in your apartment. It happened.

1027
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,260
That's scary. The story that I read and a little girl said, where's my big

1028
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,860
sister? And they said, you don't have a big sister. She said, yeah, she walks

1029
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,460
around every single night in a white dress. That's scary as fuck. It is scary.

1030
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,180
Can I say something about this slide too? Yeah. How pissed off would you be if

1031
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,820
you were a good spirit and you you they trapped you in a McDonald

1032
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,720
keep the goods, the evil spirits out that keep the good spirit yeah, because

1033
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,020
in you, I guess I'll go in here. This is yeah this room looks like it is

1034
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,700
amazing. I

1035
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,260
finally

1036
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,960
God fucking damn it

1037
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,180
Brownstein, who runs twenty three southern California McDonald says the

1038
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:12,120
redesign was all about rejuvenating slumping sales. When he looked at the

1039
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,960
most recent census data, he saw that the Asian population in the area had grown

1040
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,400
to nearly 40%. We wanted to make this story invited to everyone, but

1041
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,600
particularly the large and growing Asian population in this area. He says,

1042
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,160
sitting in earth in an earth tone booth next to a waterfall.

1043
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,720
This is just a white dude that's like, Hey, there's a lot of fucking Asian

1044
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,960
people in this town. We're going to function. We should make McDonald's a

1045
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,480
function way. Enviro started from the waterfall and then he found out there's

1046
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,820
something called function. Yeah, but look at this. Look at that beautiful make

1047
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:47,660
look at how beautiful this looks. That picture is nice. It looks incredible. I

1048
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:51,300
actually think that casino is probably what looking at this. It does look like

1049
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:56,220
it looks like a latex. They literally do really. They actually do yeah. I make

1050
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,220
because well it's because it literally they do it because they're a bunch of

1051
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:02,960
like high rollers from China that they want to come and they want them to be

1052
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,660
like oh it's look it's not. I read a whole interview with it was really funny.

1053
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,060
it's like an interview with like this, like high roller Chinese gambler guy,

1054
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,300
who's like their interview and be like. So what do you think about these

1055
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,060
casinos like using feng shui to attract more like high profile Asian gamblers

1056
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,700
and he's like, you know, I don't care at all, but it looks nice. Yeah,

1057
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,800
he's right, he's completely that's probably why casinos feel so amazing to

1058
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,260
be yeah, they're literally the peak of fun. I thought it's because they were

1059
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,540
pumping some like well, they actually I would say they use black hat feng shui,

1060
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,740
because if you read, I did read a lot about this people who feng shui experts

1061
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,640
don't like casinos because they have no windows. It's like fake sunlight,

1062
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,360
which is evil and it's like the function is in service of trapping you,

1063
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,940
but they do you. I think they use evil function to trap you in there. A

1064
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,340
trapped good spirit. Whenever I go to the encore because I'm leaving with

1065
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:55,020
an uneven wallet, yeah, because I left my credit cards in the hotel room,

1066
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:59,740
but I kept all of my grocery store rewards cards. The other half of my

1067
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:03,880
wallet for all the suggestions, the lose made there was one thing they

1068
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,540
couldn't change the menu. Just like all McDonald's, this one serves up artery clogging fries, Big

1069
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:15,400
Macs and milkshakes, which raises the inevitable question, how does one, how often does the

1070
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,880
Grand Master chow down at the Golden Arches? Depends, he said, when I'm very busy and very

1071
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,520
hungry sometimes I need to eat. So there are these two, they consulted these like, they

1072
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,200
are Grand Masters of Feng Shui in Los Angeles.

1073
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
FSM's.

1074
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,800
Yeah, Jenny Liu and her dad.

1075
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,920
I don't remember the dad's name.

1076
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,160
Jenny Liu suggests that the feng shui somehow reduces the negative aspects of greasy processed

1077
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,160
food.

1078
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,520
Feng shui is about the laws of nature, so in that way it's a counter, she said, adding

1079
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,400
when you're in an environment that's wonderful and peaceful and soothing, your whole mindset

1080
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,400
relaxes.

1081
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,480
You eat food slowly and don't rush and stuff your face.

1082
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,600
The mental is very important, her father agrees.

1083
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,600
That part is stronger than the poison food.

1084
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,600
Wow.

1085
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,600
He's calling the fucking food poison.

1086
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,600
Mind over matter.

1087
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,600
Oh, then this one, a woman named Tina Turner was in there eating a double cheeseburger

1088
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,600
and fries during her lunch hour.

1089
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,600
Then this is what, this is like the end of the article.

1090
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,600
Mark Brownstein says that he sees nothing peculiar about blending fast food and feng shui.

1091
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,600
It's not ironic at all, he said.

1092
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,600
One more thing.

1093
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,600
Did he say that like this?

1094
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,600
It's not ironic at all.

1095
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,600
Maybe.

1096
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,600
One more thing.

1097
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,600
Don't call it fast food.

1098
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,840
The food isn't fast. The food appears quickly, but that's service," he said,

1099
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:35,560
adding, "We're willing to do this to say to the community, 'We're going to build

1100
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,780
a store that really stands out. That's just good business sense.'" And then

1101
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,800
here's just like, that's the waterfall. This is beautiful. It's incredible,

1102
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:47,720
right? I want to eat. Yeah. And look at this picture that I found in the

1103
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,560
article. Wow, it's so small. That's how big it was. Look at how big...

1104
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,240
That's actual size? Yeah, look at that. Oh, it's got bamboo. So this is

1105
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,540
that's what it looks like when you walk in. So describe it. It's got bamboo on

1106
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:03,280
the left and then, like, another plant there. It's, like, circular. There's a

1107
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,060
lot of tiles with a path. Yeah, tiles with a path, like, a lot of beautiful

1108
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,000
looking stuff. And you know there's money under all those tiles. Oh,

1109
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,800
absolutely. We break in, we steal all the tile money. And then this next slide

1110
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,640
here is a review from Angelica Cerna

1111
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,560
that says, "Aleah is black."

1112
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:29,660
four four stars. It's incredible and you have to guess that it may be a Leah

1113
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:34,240
somebody. So you maybe works there or maybe the singer. I don't know. Yeah, I

1114
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,920
mean, whatever the original, I guess, yeah, it's translated by Google. It says

1115
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:44,280
a Leah is black and then the original says Elijah Serna. Oh, it was her name.

1116
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,240
She was trying to put her name. Oh,

1117
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,360
yeah, then look at these photos here. Look there's a juvie. If you can zoom in

1118
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,880
here, there's a man who's astounded by the beauty of this McDonald's. He's

1119
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,160
covering his eyes up

1120
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:03,920
with a receipt, with a receipt, and then this next photo here, just pure album

1121
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,880
cover vibes. Look at that. This is album cover. That is one of the most

1122
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,960
beautiful McDonald's photos I've ever seen, and then this one is

1123
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:15,280
the board for employee shout outs, and it is completely empty.

1124
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,520
well, that's not functuated to put people's faces. Yeah, I agree. Yeah,

1125
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,000
exactly it's like wrapping them. Yeah, exactly. It's a

1126
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,260
here's some more photos. Here's a guy in a booth and then here's another photo

1127
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:31,720
of the booth is, but I have some bad news. What is it? What is it? I think

1128
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,660
they remodeled the McDonald's. I think they remodeled it based on photos. I

1129
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,380
found on the same. Well, this is an old one.

1130
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,040
Most of the function way stuff is, I think, gone.

1131
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,940
that's what it looks like in twenty twenty two. I think those two glass

1132
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,860
things right there. It looks like just a brand new normal McDonald's. I think

1133
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:54,340
that those two glass things right there are where the waterfalls used to be.

1134
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,780
Yeah, I think you're right, because usually I was when you showed the

1135
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,900
waterfall, I was thinking that's usually where the glass thing is. Exactly,

1136
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:05,320
yeah. Then this next one here, they put the kiosks in. Kiosks, bad feng shui.

1137
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:10,220
Sliding automatic doors. Yeah, it's terrible, terrible feng shui. And then I

1138
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,400
I was looking up trying to confirm whether or not there was a remodel.

1139
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,440
Thomas M says, obviously a recent remodel and then there was something

1140
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,640
disgusting in the bathroom. Poo. I think it was due.

1141
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:27,640
But again, bathroom, water, feng shui, it's all connected. It's all connected.

1142
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,740
Wait, go back. This guy ends it in a perfect way. Had to ask for a

1143
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:35,100
drink cup. Next. That is so funny to say about at the end of your

1144
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,840
McDonald's. Next. Next McDonald's. Onto the next one.

1145
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,900
I made it too small. My local McDonald's. It's nice since the remodel that was in

1146
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:47,660
2050 or five years ago, 2015. Some homeless that hang out there, blah, blah,

1147
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:52,140
blah. And then Dan Man said, McDonald's socks, no more food from there.

1148
01:08:52,140 --> 01:09:00,060
But yeah, so all of that stuff about the feng shui, they got rid of it,

1149
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:05,420
complete and total remodel, right? Getting rid of every single, well, not

1150
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,820
every single, but you know, changing, changing a lot of the feng shui in

1151
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:18,260
there, right? So that was five years ago. Five years ago was 2019, right? Close. 2018. Really,

1152
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:25,540
really close. 2018. I thought I'm still writing 2022 on all my checks. Well, that would make

1153
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:31,940
it way wronger. So, okay. Okay. So that actually makes sense. So it was five years ago was

1154
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:38,180
20. That does actually make sense. Because in 2019, employees were hospitalized with mysterious

1155
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,380
symptoms at the Hacienda Heights McDonald's.

1156
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,380
Holy shit.

1157
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,500
At the Feng Shui McDonald's.

1158
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,660
After it was remodeled?

1159
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:47,100
Firefighters have found, after the remodel, firefighters have found no abnormal readings

1160
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,060
after a carbon monoxide detector was triggered at a McDonald's on Monday.

1161
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,580
Hazmat techs with the LA County Fire Department determined air saturation is normal inside

1162
01:09:55,580 --> 01:10:01,740
the McDonald's at the one, I'm not reading that, the alarm may be malfunctioning.

1163
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,500
Despite that, three employees experienced symptoms.

1164
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,500
three employees reportedly experienced minor headaches and will be hospitalized.

1165
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:13,900
Wait. So there was a feng shui attack.

1166
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,100
Yeah. Full feng shui.

1167
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,900
Wow.

1168
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,800
Full feng shui. They get rid of every single thing. And then the carbon

1169
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,700
monoxide detector goes fucking crazy. Three employees are hospitalized.

1170
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:25,800
But no carbon monoxide.

1171
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,600
Wow.

1172
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,300
That's insane.

1173
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:33,700
And this was in December of 2019. So this could be something else that

1174
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:38,500
happened around that time. No, I don't think so, but there was a because no,

1175
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,800
because there was a function way. It was a mysterious disease. There was a

1176
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:46,380
function way change and it was a carbon clear carbon monoxide attack.

1177
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:49,020
Well, no, that is crazy. No, it means a

1178
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,060
pure energy

1179
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:58,040
energy, but not carbon got their casper tail stuck into the car. I got sucked in

1180
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,040
no, no, no, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,

1181
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,340
yeah, came back, he dissipated, turned in a mist and then people started

1182
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,100
breathing it in and went, oh, I have ghost headache, yeah, yeah, and maybe

1183
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,040
the only way that they could cure that would be with my invention I mentioned

1184
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,240
earlier, the flower that puts food in the air, exactly, that's a shit invention,

1185
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,920
exactly, well, I guess the moral, the moral here

1186
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,880
is that once your feng shui is perfect,

1187
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,960
do not fuck with it, no, fuck with it, do not change it, do not mess with feng

1188
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,560
don't make a room where the lights are off all the most powerful thing in the

1189
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,600
world, the universe, the universe, the the observable and unobservable. It's

1190
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,880
more powerful. I

1191
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,400
don't want to talk about this. I don't want to get into details. Okay, but I

1192
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:48,560
thought about it. Okay, no, I want to very quickly say there is don't look

1193
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,000
this up. There is feng shui rituals and practices that you can do

1194
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:59,240
to assassinate somebody. I think that's a Chuck Palahniuk story. It's true. It's

1195
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,040
a hundred percent true. Yeah, I thought that's in one of his I from reading

1196
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,720
that in high school or something. It talks about it. I thought that shit was

1197
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,320
so cool. It's true. It's I found it from that. You are scaring me right now.

1198
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,720
And it's a hundred percent true. You are so scary. The fuck out of me right now.

1199
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,080
Sure, it's in the book. It's in the short story about foot massage. Yeah,

1200
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,600
wow, but it is true, but crazy. We won't get into that. We won't get into what

1201
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:27,240
we will get into is the some fucking trouble.

1202
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:33,640
Poop dot com slash shows. Pull it up. We talked about it. The video flopped.

1203
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,240
The video was the video.

1204
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,440
The video. We don't have to worry about the flop all the fucking time.

1205
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,000
Make another video, man. And you can't live another life. So you can't live

1206
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,080
another life. Go buy tickets. It's going to be sketch comedy. It's going to be a

1207
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,680
fun show. We're doing it at Littlefield with Home Planet who make the videos

1208
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,800
that you love Alex and Joe. We're doing it with Pierce as well, who you also like and

1209
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,080
you can buy a ticket right here at swagcoop.com/shows. It's July 14th. It's going to be a lot of

1210
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,120
fun. We're going to be writing a lot of fun crap. There's going to be some videos. I've

1211
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,800
already written so much and maybe a lot of it won't make it in. We're going to go ahead

1212
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:16,160
and buy 10 tickets right now that you can't have. That's called scarcity. Maybe we do

1213
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:29,160
a

1214
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,760
All right, well, that makes them have to buy another ticket. Bye bye bye

1215
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,300
happy

1216
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,800
happy

1217
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:44,160
no, it's a library. I was going to say laundromat. It's a library. That's

1218
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:48,900
next to a laundromat. Whoa, that's already good and I already like this

1219
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:55,660
the the lady who works at the laundromat closes up the closes up shop puts a

1220
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:59,620
shirt on a hanger and then walks out, walks into the library.

1221
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:04,520
So then she walks up to the, it's clear that she has a rapport with the

1222
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,340
librarian. She's talking, she walks in. I love that. Is it a librarian girl or

1223
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:11,780
boy? Hey, Janice. Oh, hey, Bernice.

1224
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:15,860
Hey, what have you... You clean a lot of clothes today?

1225
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:19,380
No. I like that. Just one shirt today.

1226
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,420
And I hung it up before I left.

1227
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,460
oh all right.

1228
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:31,300
Are you here to get a book? No, I'm here to return my book. Okay, what book is

1229
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:31,640
your

1230
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:38,340
no more suffocation? Oh wow, okay, no, no, no, because I said laundromat,

1231
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:43,320
because then that could be racist coded. No fifty shades of gray. Okay, okay, now

1232
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,800
she's returning now. Do you have the gray and then Bernice picks it up and

1233
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,960
goes who and she goes yep and then suddenly a man in a trench coat and a

1234
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:55,820
cat runs in and slits her throat and she falls on the floor and screams and

1235
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:00,580
grabs her throat. Which one? Bernays or Janice? Both. Her name is not Bernays.

1236
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:07,100
It's not like a meal. It's the laundromat lady gets killed and then

1237
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:12,300
cut. And then theme song. And then the rest of the episode. What in the, what

1238
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:19,300
in the, what is going on in this library? How the hell did this happen? I've

1239
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:24,580
of a bookish demeanor but I've never seen something...

1240
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,180
A bookish murderer.

1241
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,180
Murderer.

1242
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,180
I'm a murderer.

1243
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:33,020
But when it comes to this criminal there's no one demeanor.

1244
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:36,420
This is demeanor's criminal.
