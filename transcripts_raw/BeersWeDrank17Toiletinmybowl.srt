10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up all my chuggers?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm trying to get that burp out.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,720
Bud Light.

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,220
Ha!

17
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,140
Foo Rippin'!

18
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,840
I know it's hot.

19
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,760
Beers we drank, motherfucker.

20
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,200
With Jubio, Caleb, and Rex.

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Beer.

22
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
Oh.

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,960
Hold on.

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,200
Man, whenever I drink a bottle, it never really does a sound.

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,120
Oh, it's pink.

26
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm trying to choose between--

27
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
all right, I'm going to use this one.

28
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,240
OK, I'll go first.

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,680
Today--

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,440
Okay, well I guess Kayla was going first because he showed the entire beer.

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,720
I didn't do that on purpose. I, I, uh,

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,080
I have a Heineken. This is brewed in Holland.

33
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,480
It's a Heineken original. It says Diplom

34
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,080
Deannour Amsterdam in 1883.

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,320
It's pretty interesting stuff. Not one of my favorite beers, but, um, yeah,

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,640
I was pretty last minute.

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,880
What do you have?

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,080
I got a Prey beer.

39
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,040
That looks like it says "Ray."

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
It actually is Ray.

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,440
But I like to say it says "Prey."

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,640
But look, it's my hometown.

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,320
It's like one of the stables of the city, the mountains.

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,120
It's a locally brewed--

45
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,080
it says that it's a artisanal beer from the North.

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,920
Mexican IPA Cerveza.

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
- Sounds amazing and delicious. - Let's check it out.

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,720
- I have... - It tastes weird.

49
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,080
Yeah.

50
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,320
I have meteoroids.

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,440
Cheers, my friends.

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,560
- Cheers. - Cheers.

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,600
It's a slushy beer

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,120
that's supposed to taste like watermelon rock candy,

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Blue raspberry, black cherry, blueberry, cherry, and pink vanilla cotton candy.

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
And what does it taste like, actually?

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Shit.

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Awful.

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Yeah, it tastes bad.

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
It does not taste bad.

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
It tastes not so good.

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Nah, no bueno.

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:45,560
It is crazy to me how these insane beers are supposed to convey all these flavors.

64
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Like, I cannot parse the fact that you're supposed to be drinking like a milkshake beer.

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,920
year. I mean it does taste sweet it just it has like a nastiness to it that's overwhelming.

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,960
Yeah but it's good. It tastes like someone took like a Jolly Rancher and put it in a

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:11,960
stale like Miller Lite. Here's what we need we are far enough into this I don't know why

68
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,900
the

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:28,940
fifth

70
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,340
ball if you can tell the sweat dripping down my forehead the clear stench of

71
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,940
winning wafting off of my sweaty body yeah but here's what we need we're 17

72
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:48,380
episodes into this show it is about time that a brewery somewhere in this great

73
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,980
nation decides to sponsor us and send us a bunch of free beers we will positively

74
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,380
We'll probably review any free beer we get.

75
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,380
It's publicity to thousands of people.

76
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
Just do it.

77
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,380
I think Bud Light should sponsor us.

78
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,380
They need a comeback.

79
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,380
Except Bud Light!

80
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,380
[Laughter]

81
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,380
No, I like Bud Light.

82
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,380
Do you guys see that Modelo is now the number one beer in the world because of the Bud Light boycott?

83
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,380
You have to really make conservatives pretty pissed for them to choose a Mexican guy's stuff.

84
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:31,880
Yeah, that is funny how it's like, oh, we hate the trans beer. We're gonna drink a beer from the country that we hate.

85
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,380
Well, I'll tell Gibbs.

86
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,380
The secret is that Mexicans drink a lot of beer.

87
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,380
So they're just a stable customer base.

88
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,380
So it's not that it went up, it's just the bud light went down.

89
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
That's a great point, actually.

90
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,380
Yeah.

91
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
They spread the market share.

92
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
Right.

93
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,700
Now Modelo is on top.

94
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,180
It's not like that market share all went to Modelo.

95
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,980
Probably very little of it did.

96
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,180
Right, it went to Coors Light, it went to Miller Light.

97
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,300
Coors Light and Miller Light both also canceled.

98
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Actually Coors Light, I don't think it is.

99
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,140
Why?

100
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,960
I think Miller Light did a--

101
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,860
Is Miller also Anheuser-Busch?

102
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,040
I mean, Modelo's Anheuser-Busch.

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
True.

104
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,700
Well, I think like all every beer

105
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,540
pretty much is Anheuser-Busch, honestly.

106
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,540
everything is either Coca-Cola or Pepsi, and even then that's sold by Disney.

107
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,260
They should've... did you see there was that thing that was like, there were like some

108
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,080
people doing a neo-nazi rally outside of Disneyland? They should have done that

109
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,260
outside of Busch Gardens. What were they doing there? 100%. Why? Yeah, why were they doing that outside of...

110
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:48,380
I don't know. Probably just for fun. Free tickets I guess? You think they got free tickets for doing that?

111
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:57,780
sure man. Why would they give him free tickets? Well, Walt Disney was not a fan. Oh my god,

112
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,460
I forgot about the problematic history of the Disney Corporation and that's all my ass.

113
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,060
And that's why if you show up to Disney World with a Nazi flag they'll be like, "Come on

114
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,420
right, come right on in." Listen, we don't like it, but it was Walt's last wishes. That

115
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:30,340
and

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,220
like this child actor but I don't remember who it was.

117
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,540
Old Disney cartoons are so funny because it's just blackface.

118
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:46,100
Yeah ten minutes of somebody riding a car in blackface or something.

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,580
Just doing ragtime piano in blackface.

120
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,940
I would say those animators man they had style back then.

121
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
Was that Disney?

122
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,580
Wasn't that like mostly Hanna-Barbera like doing crazy racist stuff?

123
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,900
They all do crazy racist stuff.

124
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:12,580
the

125
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:27,660
the

126
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,940
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about so and I'm not gonna learn about it

127
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:38,960
So I've never been to a picnic so I everything I know about Hannah Barbera's from watching Harvey Birdman

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,980
And then just like piecing together the backstory yeah, and also yeah, you tell me there's two men named Hannah and Barbara

129
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,580
No, no no no no

130
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,220
So - that's what it was one guy

131
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,580
You think it was one guy named Hannah Barbera?

132
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,460
Yeah, no, it's two guys that make sense red Hannah and and

133
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,500
Barbara

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Barbara

135
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:13,100
But I'm pretty sure it's two guys it's like a law firm kind of

136
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:22,620
Completely one guy named Hannah

137
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:37,700
the

138
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,740
fact check in before the end of the episode.

139
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,540
yep and you got fucking destroyed and it didn't say anything about racism when I

140
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,900
googled that so. That is true. You also got destroyed on that count. They erased all of those. They have been pretty

141
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,460
spared of the racism accusations I would say. Well that's because they they went

142
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,900
back and they they attach it like a like a screen at the start of those episodes

143
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,580
like it's like hey this is from another time but we're still gonna show it to you

144
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:13,360
you can you can watch this is when cats and mouse used to fight all the time

145
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:22,560
warning that's quite a bonus fuck do you guys remember that yeah Tom and Jerry

146
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,660
remember Tom and Jerry yeah it was so bad I do and then that was pretty violent

147
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,300
runner was wanted to the the coyote wanted to kill the Roadrunner so badly

148
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,060
with TNT. That's fucked up.

149
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,100
I mean, that's what kids do nowadays.

150
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,380
Between animals, you know, like there's not, it really wasn't that crazy.

151
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,620
Yeah. But there's 1 billion kids trying to blow up their friends with TNT.

152
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,340
That is true. These days, the road runner would be making

153
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,460
a YouTube short.

154
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,460
Houses out of bricks. Yeah.

155
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,260
And he'd be...

156
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Houses out of bricks.

157
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,260
Wait, what?

158
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
The same thing.

159
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Yeah, these days a roadrunner would be painting a road onto a wall.

160
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,380
So these days he'd be ordering gadgets on Amazon.com.

161
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Yep, ordering TNT on Amazon.com.

162
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,380
Amazon Basics TNT.

163
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,380
If they made that show today. Amazon basically is Acme.

164
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,380
Amazon Basics is the Acme of real life.

165
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,380
That's so true.

166
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Yeah, that's one of my more astute points.

167
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:36,260
I think that these days, they would probably do the Roadrunner killing the coyote.

168
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,080
What?

169
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,740
It's closed because everything's gone.

170
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,420
Everything's fucking topsy-turvy upside down. We live in a reverse world.

171
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,420
It's every day is opposite day in this bullshit country.

172
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,100
The Roadrunner...

173
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,340
That's the original plot anyway.

174
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,580
Well no, the roadrunner would be trying to eat the coyote!

175
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,580
Is what they would do. They'd be usurping the natural order.

176
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,700
I see.

177
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,140
Yeah, the roadrunner would be trying to shatter the glass ceiling and get a job above the coyote.

178
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,740
Exactly. And then he would fire the coyote for Instagram videos he made 8 years ago.

179
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,740
It's really not that big of a deal. This fuck is a different time, 2015.

180
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,060
He would've taken a picture of the coyote after a TNT exploded in his face,

181
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,460
Charring his skull black. Yep. Uncovered it and gotten him fired from human resources.

182
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:38,260
It would have been over. It's just no question. That'd be funny if the coyote, they never show what the coyote does with the rest of his time.

183
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,060
Also, is this the only motherfucking roadrunner in the entire fucking desert?

184
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,060
There's gotta be other roadrunners. Is there other coyotes? That's a pack animal.

185
00:11:48,060 --> 00:12:01,140
the

186
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,980
the

187
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,020
the

188
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,180
the

189
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,420
the

190
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,620
the

191
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,860
the

192
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,860
the

193
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
the

194
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,900
the

195
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,100
the

196
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
the

197
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
the

198
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I

199
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I think that's the first Riz sighting on national television.

200
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,100
That was the first time we had Riz on national TV?

201
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Yeah.

202
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Speaking of, they should put that show on Nat Geo.

203
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
That show should be on the Discovery Channel, Nat Geo.

204
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Tom and Jerry?

205
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Yes, it's an animal kingdom.

206
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Animal planet? What's that, the Hanna-Barbera extended universe?

207
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Yeah, wasn't that the planet all the cartoons take place on?

208
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Animal planet, where animals walk around, they talk to each other, they can buy things?

209
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,100
I mean, this is how crazy things are these days.

210
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,100
That they think there should be an animal planet. These days, that wouldn't even be a TV channel.

211
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,100
That would be a planet.

212
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,100
They would make that into a real planet. They would turn the moon into an animal planet.

213
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
And probably, you know who would live there?

214
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Who?

215
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Vegans. Probably.

216
00:13:46,100 --> 00:14:01,180
the

217
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,180
in space because there's no air.

218
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Exactly, there would be no mylar reaction.

219
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Exactly.

220
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,180
You couldn't even crack an egg because it would float off the surface of the moon and

221
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,180
fly into space.

222
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,180
It would be complete bullshit trying to eat any kind of meat in space.

223
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,180
Did you guys ever have astronaut ice cream?

224
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
No.

225
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,180
Well, that's just Dippin' Dots, right?

226
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,540
I've had Dippin' Dots. Dippin' Dots are so good. They're so yummy.

227
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,340
I love Dippin' Dots. The Banana Split Dippin' Dots for me is the best dessert you can have.

228
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:42,620
You know, it's really funny. During the 90s, like early 2000s, a lot of US businesses came down to Mexico.

229
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,500
And they were like, "Hey, we're going to make a dessert. We're going to make a dessert."

230
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
And they were like, "Oh, we're going to make a dessert."

231
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
And they were like, "Oh, we're going to make a dessert."

232
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
And they were like, "Oh, we're going to make a dessert."

233
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,580
A lot of like US businesses like came down to Mexico,

234
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,500
like Whataburger, I think we had Taco Bell at some point.

235
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,060
- Did you say Whataburger?

236
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,140
- Whataburger.

237
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,840
- Oh, I got excited.

238
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,620
- A burger made of water?

239
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,460
- That is a Whataburger.

240
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,020
- I just wanted to know what it was.

241
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,340
I didn't even have an idea.

242
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,620
- There is a Whataburger.

243
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,540
- That's how they get Americans to say hi to you.

244
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,780
- I'll get to that.

245
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,620
And we used to have like all that cool shit,

246
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,780
but everything like went away.

247
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,980
So we don't have Whataburger, we don't have Taco Bell,

248
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,500
we don't have Dippin' Dots anymore.

249
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,940
and I miss it so much.

250
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,420
We don't have Mountain Dew.

251
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,500
It completely got kicked out of the country.

252
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
- That's some bullshit.

253
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,540
Why did they leave?

254
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,380
Did you chase them out?

255
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,780
- I think it's a health thing.

256
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,580
- Really?

257
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,500
- You just cannot buy Mountain Dew in Mexico at all.

258
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,340
- You can buy fucking Takis.

259
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,860
- And Coke.

260
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,780
- Takis are the most disgustingly--

261
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,620
- Not the OXO.

262
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,020
- Excess of sodio, the snack that you can fucking buy.

263
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,700
- Yeah, but it's from the little,

264
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,420
the little, uh, you know, well this one doesn't have it.

265
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,660
The little labels, you know, that says excess of sodium. Yeah.

266
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,380
So you know that you're doing a bad thing. That is true.

267
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,700
I wouldn't say it's bad.

268
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,300
There's no evidence that sodium is bad for you. Yeah.

269
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,900
Except for that one song on 808s and a heartbreak where

270
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,620
Jeezy says he's going to watch his sodium.

271
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,700
That's the only time I've ever heard of it.

272
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Please show the scientific evidence that sodium is bad for your heart.

273
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
Excesso sodio.

274
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,540
Yeah, I don't know where they got that from.

275
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,260
I will say that a couple weeks ago I had a giant hoagie.

276
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:36,900
And then I went to the gym and I had about a three minute heart palpitation and I had

277
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,420
to be talked out of calling 911.

278
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,700
So I think that, and I think sodium was, I think I had excesso sodio that day.

279
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,820
I think I feel like you get yourself into a lot of situate a lot of times you go to the gym and you have like some sort of

280
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,060
Like I think something is wrong

281
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,020
It is so when you're working out and you just feel like you actually might die

282
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:09,140
Yeah, that's what I mean. It was it was doing bent over rows. I think I it wasn't actually a heart palpitation

283
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,140
I think I'm 100% sure it was a

284
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,820
esophageal spasm, but they're very hard to tell the difference because they're,

285
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,940
God placed them right next to each other because it was perfect image. Yeah.

286
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,140
I love having a like heartburn and stuff like that. Or just,

287
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,900
just any of the thing,

288
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,460
well just any of the things that make you feel like you're having a heart attack

289
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,620
but aren't, I'm so good at ignoring those now.

290
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,660
They don't even faze me anymore.

291
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,780
Anything with the esophagus feels like you're like dying and like exploding.

292
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,340
Yeah. It feels like you don't. There's like lava inside of you.

293
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
It's fucking crazy.

294
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,340
There's so many terrible things about our bodies.

295
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,340
Are you familiar with the vagus nerve?

296
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
No.

297
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:56,340
The vagus nerve is a nerve that goes down the back of your head, past your heart, and into

298
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
your leg, I think.

299
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,340
And if it gets pinched or poked at any point along that route, you just get a massive heart

300
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,340
palpitation and heart pain.

301
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,180
or you think it feels like you're having a heart attack, like an actual heart attack,

302
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,820
because it goes like right next to your heart.

303
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,700
And that's like the thickest point of the nerve or some shit.

304
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,100
So it's just concentrated there.

305
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,060
It's a very bad.

306
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,140
Our bodies were poorly designed.

307
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,780
Yeah, it's funny when that stuff like that happens,

308
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,020
like when you lock your knees too long and you just like faint.

309
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,180
Yeah, I've never fainted.

310
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,020
You've never fainted?

311
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,740
Have you ever known anybody who just I mean,

312
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,940
I know plenty of people who have this, who just have had a seizure for no apparent medical

313
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
reason.

314
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,940
Have you had one?

315
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
Yes.

316
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
You had a seizure?

317
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
You both had one?

318
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
No, I didn't have one.

319
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
I know someone who has seizures.

320
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Rex, have you had a seizure?

321
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Oh yeah, it wasn't for no reason though.

322
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
What happened?

323
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
What did it feel like?

324
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Terrible.

325
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
And then I woke up on the ground.

326
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
It happened twice, really.

327
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
I just woke up on the ground both times.

328
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
But it wasn't for no reason?

329
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
What happened?

330
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Well, the second time I woke up, I was in the bathroom, and I was like, "Oh, I'm going to

331
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
have a seizure."

332
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
And then I woke up and I was like, "Oh, I'm going to have a seizure."

333
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,940
But it wasn't for no reason? What happened?

334
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,940
Uh, well the second time was because I was on a bunch of shit.

335
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Uh huh.

336
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
But the first time I was just like 12.

337
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Just something came over me and I went to the bathroom to like throw up.

338
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,940
And then I woke up and my... I was like leaned over like the toilet like praying position.

339
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,940
And uh, I hit my face on the toilet and my...

340
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
EWWWW!

341
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,940
My teeth went through my lip.

342
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Ew, you put your face on the toilet?

343
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,940
Look at me! Look at that!

344
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,940
You can see it, you can still hear it. That's disgusting.

345
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Yeah, so it's fine. Did it feel

346
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,940
cool, like, not cool, did it feel

347
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,940
intriguing? So the one when I was 12, because I woke up on the ground

348
00:19:52,940 --> 00:20:01,340
It was intriguing because I thought I was like on a train because like

349
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,980
everything was like shaking like my whole body was like yeah shaking and

350
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,500
weird so I was like oh I've been transported to the 1840s and I am on a

351
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,700
train now. That is crazy that that's your first thought when you're 12 years old.

352
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,660
I read a lot of books. Very imaginative kid yeah a lot of a lot of magic treehouse.

353
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,660
So when I was in my 20s, I was just like, oh, I died.

354
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Yeah, I died and came back to life.

355
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,660
Yeah, but whenever somebody I feel like I see every once in a while, somebody

356
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,660
posts on Instagram like, hey, y'all like doing this in a hospital bed.

357
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
Yeah.

358
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Hey, y'all, just so you know, I had a seizure last night at 9.

359
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,660
32 p.m.

360
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,660
Doctors say it was nothing.

361
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,140
It's like what what are these doctors talking about if they're somebody's coming in they're like I had a seizure

362
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,580
Somebody had to put a sponge in my mouth, so I wouldn't bite my tongue off. I was drooling white foam and

363
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,380
They're like it's probably nothing. Yeah, it is just nothing

364
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:10,540
That is just kind of like a like a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing yeah, but why would your body do that?

365
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:18,200
That's fine. I have a spasm that I've given myself from vaping too much. I'm pretty sure what's a spasm like like

366
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,600
I just have like a twitch that happens sometimes when I'm like my like leg will just kick can we see it?

367
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,720
Well, it doesn't it's involuntary

368
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,120
Going right now. Let's see it. No, I know I have it's when I'm tired

369
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Make yourself tired. I don't care

370
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,720
Just kick your loader, just fake it, I don't care.

371
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,560
- Run it around.

372
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,380
(laughing)

373
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,060
- Run it around for a couple minutes to get really tired.

374
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,900
And then do it.

375
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,920
- I'll think about it.

376
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,900
- I've never had a serious medical thing.

377
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Well, I guess when I was a kid, I had my tonsils out

378
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,580
and then the sutures split open.

379
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,020
And I started like, I was just sitting

380
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,520
on my grandma's bed watching TV.

381
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,060
And I was like, oh, I have like a,

382
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,660
like a loogie in my throat.

383
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,880
And I like spit into my hand.

384
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,060
- It was all blood.

385
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
- And it was just a giant chunk of blood.

386
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,580
And then I went, ah!

387
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,900
And I ran into the bathroom.

388
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,180
And my grandpa thought that I was going to die,

389
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,000
but he didn't have like an ice pack.

390
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,280
He was like thinking that if he put ice on it,

391
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,780
it would for some reason like stop the bleeding.

392
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,300
So he grabbed like a, he had like a ribeye.

393
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,980
You got hit by a baseball.

394
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,940
Yeah, that's what he's thinking.

395
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,940
So he had it, but he grabbed a ribeye, a frozen, like a ribeye that he had

396
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,640
in the freezer, and he just put like cold meat on my neck.

397
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,000
And I, yeah, I put a gallon of blood.

398
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,300
And then he told me later, he was like, I was fully convinced

399
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,040
you were going to die, which makes it way worse.

400
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,040
That when we we called an ambulance, an ambulance got there

401
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,580
and he was like and they were like, all right, we'll take him to hospital.

402
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,380
he needs emergency surgery. And my grandpa was like, all right,

403
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,960
but how much does the ambulance cost? And they were like $600. Like, nah,

404
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,820
it's okay.

405
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,260
They didn't even have a car at the time. My grandparents didn't have a car.

406
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,260
So he had to call my mom who was an hour away to drive into town and pick me up

407
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,020
and take me to the hospital.

408
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,980
So it took like basically two hours to get me there.

409
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,860
How do you see the thing?

410
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
How do I split it?

411
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I don't know.

412
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,860
Both of them split though and I just had like a hemorrhage.

413
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,620
Just yawn really hard?

414
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,180
Yeah, and then I, it was a nightmare dude.

415
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,140
I went, I had my surgery and then I woke up and it was so painful, so much more painful

416
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,420
than the actual tonsil surgery for some reason.

417
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,940
I woke up in like the worst pain, I was completely delirious.

418
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,060
I passed out from the time that the EMTs got there and I was just asleep until the next

419
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,580
day, basically, when my surgery was done.

420
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:06,940
And I woke up and my friend's mom was a nurse and she was my nurse.

421
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,380
And so I fully thought that I was dead.

422
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,440
Like because I was like, this is like someone I know.

423
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,780
This doesn't make any sense.

424
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,780
Yeah.

425
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,580
Bright white lights, white room.

426
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,180
My friend Jordan's mom being like, it's going to be okay.

427
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,300
I was like, oh yeah, I'm dead.

428
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,700
I've gone to the other world.

429
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,580
Did you not know she was a nurse beforehand?

430
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:31,020
Honestly, my first thought was like wow me and Jordan's mom died at the same time. That is so crazy

431
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,020
I mean, I guess I I

432
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,940
Never really thought of the fact that she was a nurse

433
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,460
What do you think happened to her how did she die?

434
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,200
Car I thought that she died in it. I mean I was pretty you know, this was like

435
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,580
Bush years, so I thought that she died an Islamic terrorist attack

436
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,940
And I wouldn't say it, you know, I wouldn't think that now but at the time I was a bit conservative for a ten-year-old

437
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:05,040
Yeah, I thought I mean it's unfortunate. Yeah nowadays I would have thought that she got lynched by a mega

438
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,560
And you know racist that's what I would have thought. I really would have because she had red hair

439
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,300
You know, so I would have done it was some kind of racial motivation for the death

440
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:23,180
But you're not a very good ten-year-old because obviously she would never have gone to heaven and she does not have a soul

441
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:29,860
Copper cab be damned. I really I

442
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,560
She was a nice lady

443
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,920
We thought that over in there's not having a soul part. Yeah

444
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:43,080
Well, I think it was actually a fake redhead. She had that she had that box box hair. Mm-hmm

445
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
She had boxed hair.

446
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
She had that boxed dye hair.

447
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
Yeah, she was kind of a thought now that I think about it.

448
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,720
But she married a guy who could do that thing with his chest where it goes like boop boop

449
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop.

450
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
You know that thing?

451
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
No.

452
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
That's a thought behavior.

453
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,360
Yeah, you know that thing that old white guys do?

454
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,280
Well, you wouldn't know an old white guy.

455
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,800
But old white guys, they have big boobs on their bodies.

456
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,920
And when you say like, man, you have giant tits when you're a kid because you're a very

457
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:22,800
the

458
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:29,240
fifth

459
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:40,120
the

460
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,320
short. That's about it. And he could do that thing with his boobs. I remember just shit

461
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,680
that you do things that I would say to my friend's parents. I mean, I just like, I think I, I

462
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,240
think I settled down when I got a little older, but when I was like parents from the time

463
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,560
my parents got divorced until like the end of eighth grade, when I would go to somebody's

464
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:09,520
parents house, I would just, I was so rude, dude. Yeah. It is fun being like a rude kid.

465
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,920
I think that's a prerequisite to be a podcaster.

466
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:18,280
No, I've always been deathly afraid of being rude to people, especially my friends' parents.

467
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,520
You're the rudest guy I know.

468
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
How am I rude?

469
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,400
I've never once been rude to anyone in the world.

470
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,840
For starters, you just raised your voice at me.

471
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,800
That's not even true.

472
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,040
You literally did, and I'm afraid of you.

473
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
You have an insensitive mustache.

474
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Please don't do it again.

475
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
No.

476
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
That's not true.

477
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
That's not true.

478
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,680
You have an insensitive right wing Nazi mustache.

479
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm very cordial.

480
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,960
Things about you.

481
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,820
I'm cordial. I'm nice.

482
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,280
You drink a lot of cordial and then you hit everyone around here.

483
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,760
Like I'm spitting.

484
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,420
Admit it. Admit it right now on the podcast.

485
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,560
You abuse your girlfriend.

486
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,400
Say it. Say you hit her.

487
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
I hit her every day.

488
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,900
Oh, well, whatever I tried.

489
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,440
I love learning lore about more Rex I think because I've heard a lot about you.

490
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,440
You're always just around, I've known you since you were a child saying rude things to your friends' parents.

491
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,440
But I never knew about Rex just falling into a toilet and dying and then waking up.

492
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Oh don't even remind me.

493
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Yeah falling into a toilet and being like, "This is a portal to a fucking train!"

494
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,440
A steam locomotive!

495
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,440
the

496
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
It's funny. It's a funny thing.

497
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
It is funny.

498
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
I bet you liked the toilet. I bet you woke up and then you licked it for a couple minutes.

499
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
And then you said, "Mom, Mom."

500
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
I think I did like moan a little bit.

501
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
He had his toilet in the bowl.

502
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Or his head in the bowl.

503
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
He had his head in the bowl.

504
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
And he said, "Ugh."

505
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
And his head in the bowl.

506
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
And he said, "Ugh."

507
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
And his head in the bowl.

508
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
And he said, "Ugh."

509
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
And his head in the bowl.

510
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,700
(laughing)

511
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,180
- You're nasty.

512
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,020
- Shit happens.

513
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,440
In the toilet bowl. - Speaking of nasty,

514
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,040
this beer, I hate this beer.

515
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,260
- You know, I'm not the biggest fan

516
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,520
of this Heineken, neither.

517
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,840
- This is giving me heartburn.

518
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,180
- We should all get the same beer next week.

519
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,020
- Bud Light.

520
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,140
We need to have a Bud Light episode.

521
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,540
- Speaking of Bud Light, I had a,

522
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
well, you know, I'm just gonna,

523
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,700
I'm gonna give up on this Heineken.

524
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,140
I'm only like halfway through.

525
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,500
But I'm gonna give up on it.

526
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,460
and I'm gonna grab this other one.

527
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,960
I think I've had this on the show before.

528
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,060
There's a Bud Light lime.

529
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,900
- Ooh.

530
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,380
- This is one of my favorite beers on planet Earth.

531
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,300
- These are huge cans. - But I got it.

532
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,940
Yeah, that's why I'm only drinking half of it.

533
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,940
I got it because I got a six,

534
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,300
I was out of town the past couple of days,

535
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,140
and I got a six pack of Bud Light Orange

536
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,260
while I was upstate.

537
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,980
That is an amazing, amazing beer.

538
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,260
And I recommend anybody who listens to this

539
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,580
to try Bud Light Orange.

540
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,860
Very good stuff.

541
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,560
It's almost as good as Bud Light Lime,

542
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,900
but it's a little too sweet for me.

543
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,340
So I'm gonna have a sip of this.

544
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,580
- Is it orange flavored?

545
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
- It's brewed with orange peel.

546
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,940
- Oh. - Like a blue moon.

547
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:33,500
You know what's a really good Bud Light drink?

548
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,260
- What? - A Lime-A-Rita.

549
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,080
You know, I keep seeing these in the, uh,

550
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,240
in the grocery store when I buy beers for this show,

551
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,000
but I think I'm just not ready to buy like a drink,

552
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,240
like a 600 calorie, eight ABV drink like that.

553
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,080
Yeah.

554
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,040
Yeah. I mean, it's like a, it's just a very, it's like a very,

555
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,280
very sugary sweet thing.

556
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,080
I used to drink a bunch of them when I turned like 21,

557
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,800
I would go to the gas station and get two for $5.

558
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,640
Yeah, it's like a Mike's Hard kind of thing where you're like, you only drink it if you're

559
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
like young.

560
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Yeah.

561
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,440
Do you guys have any recollection of like any Mexican beers in like way in the past?

562
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Like there's...

563
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Mexican beers in the past.

564
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,600
I was talking about this with my girlfriend the other day.

565
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,680
There's this like beer called Sol, the Sun Beer, I guess.

566
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,480
That always like all their marketing was like, it's like the world's, you know, it's world

567
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,020
famous Mexican beer it's fucking everywhere and I was like thinking

568
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,220
about it the other day and I was like oh that's if I feel like I haven't seen

569
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:48,340
that there'd be like anywhere like at all but the only way the only way to like

570
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,180
get it now like obviously I think it's just getting like like like a mixed

571
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,480
drink like a Clamato type deal.

572
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Oh, yeah.

573
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,580
Why do you guys like those so much?

574
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,880
The Chiladas.

575
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,180
They do love the Chiladas.

576
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,260
My godfather growing up, he would always, we would always go

577
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,960
through this like drive-thru convenience, like beer liquor

578
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,360
store thing and would always get like Clamato stuff and I just

579
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,860
I never understood what like why only he liked it, but it's

580
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,980
like so popular now.

581
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
And I don't like it at all.

582
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
They're insanely popular.

583
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,980
You know what it is?

584
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,980
Mixing it into the big cup is fun.

585
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,980
When I was in,

586
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,980
when I lived in LA I did that a couple of times.

587
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,980
But the, uh, it's not a good,

588
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
it's not a good drink, man.

589
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,980
It really is not good.

590
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Tomato juice is nasty. It's horrible.

591
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,980
And I love tomatoes.

592
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
I'm a huge fan of a tomato.

593
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,980
I'll eat a tomato sandwich even.

594
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
But a tomato juice...

595
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,980
I eat tomato sandwiches all the time. Are you crazy?

596
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
That's not true.

597
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
Are you crazy?

598
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Big slice-

599
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,980
This is a southern thing, you guys must not understand this.

600
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Two big slices of tomato, salt and pepper, mayonnaise and lettuce on white bread.

601
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,980
It's an ama- It's like the best sandwich you can have.

602
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,980
That's half a sandwich. You're missing the meat.

603
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
They're good. It's just a BLT without the-

604
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
What about a cucumber?

605
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,980
The best part of a BLT is the tomatoes.

606
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,980
It's a B.

607
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
No, the bee is an afterthought.

608
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,980
No, that is not true.

609
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
You put the word "bee" in a bee.

610
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
The bee gets a taste.

611
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
It's the one that comes first.

612
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
It's basically just salt. That's what I'm saying.

613
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
You salt the tomatoes,

614
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
and you put mayo on it. It's a tomato and mayo sandwich.

615
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
So this is a

616
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
household who didn't have money for

617
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
a bee as a speed.

618
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,980
No, everybody in the South eats a tomato sandwich.

619
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Yeah, everyone in the South cannot afford

620
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
a bee as speed.

621
00:33:46,980 --> 00:34:00,660
the

622
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:06,940
Like which one live oak bank PNC Bank. Are you guys even listening? I

623
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,980
Think I don't think PNC is southern

624
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,700
Well, we had it in the South Rex

625
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:19,380
Don't got chase down there. Let's open an account. We actually basically don't have chase. I

626
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,860
Don't believe you that's there's no way that's true

627
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:30,580
Bank of America

628
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:44,260
the

629
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:53,620
into bank mergers. I think of Chase as a person. I don't think I even knew what Chase was until

630
00:34:53,620 --> 00:35:00,340
I moved up to Boston. But that's probably more on me. I'm a Bank of America man through and

631
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:07,580
through. I love them. I think it's funny what Chase is doing to Rex. I love hearing about

632
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:18,140
it every year. Oh yeah. It just won't change. They think you make five bucks. It's like

633
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:24,340
worst credit curse than me, which is really funny. Explain what is the problem. Cause

634
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:30,480
I spend a lot of money. It's specifically only a problem when I go to New York because

635
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,760
I pay for everything.

636
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,840
- Okay, okay.

637
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,160
You need to explain the problem on the podcast

638
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,480
for people to listen to the stories.

639
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,320
- Sure.

640
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,400
So, this started like the first time we went to New York

641
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,700
because I had a child's credit limit

642
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,200
and like within like three days.

643
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,140
- What was the limit, do you know?

644
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,060
- I think it might have been like $3,000.

645
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,840
- Oh, that's actually, that's not low.

646
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,680
I don't think of that as a low credit limit.

647
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,720
- I thought it was lower than that.

648
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,020
It was like 2500.

649
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,120
It could have been 2500 actually.

650
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,720
2500 sounds right.

651
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,220
So it's 2500 and then you know,

652
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,120
I put like a week-long Airbnb on it.

653
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,420
I put like, you know, meals for everyone on it.

654
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,020
Just, you know, just instantly filled it up, paid it off and like filled it up again.

655
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,920
So I called them.

656
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,120
I was like, hey, can you do like a, you know, like an inquiry, give my credit up?

657
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,640
And you're like, Oh, Mr. Blank, we're going to help you.

658
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,740
Yes.

659
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,840
And he called the Tokyo offices.

660
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,820
Yeah.

661
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,240
Yeah.

662
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,680
They were bowing to me over the phone.

663
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,400
And anyway, they were like, yeah, no, you know, he can't do anything.

664
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,560
I was like, come on.

665
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,400
They dropped the accent for that part.

666
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:51,900
Yeah.

667
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,460
Yeah.

668
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,020
Yeah.

669
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,160
I dropped the accent for it because I realized I was being racist on the podcast.

670
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,780
Yeah.

671
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,780
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

672
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,780
He does it so often.

673
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,780
When we were talking to Annie, he was like

674
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,780
I don't know what we were talking about, he was just like doing the accent

675
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
and he realizes that Annie's there

676
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
in the call and he's like, "Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, Annie."

677
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,780
And he's like,

678
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,780
goes back to the story and says the accent again.

679
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,780
He's like, "Dude, what are you doing?"

680
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,780
You know what I'm realizing is that

681
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,780
you think of me as

682
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,780
basically also Asian because

683
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
I've never heard you do that voice before

684
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,780
and I guess you do it so much.

685
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,780
I only do it in a specific context.

686
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,780
He does it every night.

687
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
Which is to be racist.

688
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,780
I don't even...

689
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,780
In my heart, in my true heart of hearts...

690
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,780
It's totally different to him.

691
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,780
It just sounds like English.

692
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Well it is English.

693
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,780
The lady was speaking English.

694
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Yeah.

695
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,780
And then I try to do the same thing the next time I was in New York.

696
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,180
time I was in New York and you're like still just now I call them like three

697
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,980
times a month or like three times a year to be like, Hey, can you increase my

698
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,820
credit limits since I'm like maxing on my credit card every month?

699
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,740
You're like, no, can't do anything.

700
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,340
And then you have to like reach out to them and they don't, because I get, I

701
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,700
guess it's like a having no money type of thing, but I always get like emails

702
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,460
on the calls of people like wanting to like give me credit cards and like get

703
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,740
all my money. Yeah yeah I'm basically pre-approved for four or five cards

704
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,420
right now so watch out. Yeah but uh I did call them like a couple months ago got a

705
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:43,300
very nice Indian man I was super polite to him. And what did he sound like? Okay he goes

706
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:49,580
hello mr. blank yes so anyway he just was very we were very nice to each other

707
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:57,540
he's like let me take care of that for you I call myself it was Mario

708
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Mario

709
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:15,900
Excuse me guys

710
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:33,260
he's like so anyway I just lied about how much money I'm making he up my card

711
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:41,220
wait Wow that's every time I know I make a million bucks a year that's basically

712
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:48,860
what I said I'm six feet tall I brush my teeth

713
00:39:48,860 --> 00:40:00,660
very well mr. Pitts you're a pre-approved for a house like that the other day

714
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,780
never brushing my teeth but that I'm a pre-approved for a loan for a house

715
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,200
I think I'm gonna buy a house tomorrow.

716
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,200
You should definitely buy a house, that'd be so sick.

717
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,880
Everybody in my hometown is doing so well and they're all buying houses.

718
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,400
Everybody I know in New York is a fucking loser renting at like 40 years old.

719
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Yeah.

720
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,840
Well I don't think it's affordable to buy a house in New York.

721
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Whereas it's probably like-

722
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,480
You can buy a house in like Queens for you know, $350,000.

723
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Can you?

724
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Oh yeah.

725
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
I think I'm gonna...

726
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
I think I'm gonna...

727
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
I think I'm gonna...

728
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm gonna buy it.

729
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Oh, really?

730
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Yeah, I did...

731
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
I did...

732
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I did look at like

733
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
houses in Queens, and there was one that

734
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
just literally was just like a picture

735
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
of like a disaster.

736
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
It literally...

737
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Like it was like...

738
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Yeah.

739
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,120
Yeah, it was just like waving literally. Yes. I was like does someone even live here?

740
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,240
No, I

741
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,680
Have looked in Ridgewood at like some houses and stuff. Just when I I mean I look all the time

742
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,720
Just when I'm like curious and they're always

743
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,440
There the thing is they're very big. They're like five bedrooms, but they're always like 1.3 million dollars

744
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,820
Yeah, it's like I live like far out

745
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:39,140
Looking like silo and look random towns like for like their houses like it kills me

746
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,500
But that's a really ugly one, yeah

747
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,840
I'm gonna get a really nice house, but you got to live far out

748
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,640
Yeah, if you live it if you're willing to live which I am also I looked at a house

749
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,600
Like a year and a half ago. That was like I really don't want to

750
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,160
like if I if I could buy like a lot for

751
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,320
$10,000 and put like a trailer on it. Then I would I would spend four months of the year and

752
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:17,680
I looked at North Carolina and it was like a house in the mountains and like you look at the it has like a view

753
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
It's like on a mountain

754
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,920
View into the valley, most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life, three bedroom

755
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
house, $89,000.

756
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
Wow.

757
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
Wow.

758
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,440
It's just, it's, I live in the worst place in the world.

759
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,160
I think I'm gonna, if I do buy a house, I think I would like to buy a house like in

760
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,240
somewhere in the Mexican beach, like somewhere in the south.

761
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Puerto Escondido.

762
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,840
Uh, maybe not there, I think that's expensive.

763
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
But maybe somewhere else.

764
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,640
It's the only place I know of.

765
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,200
I mean, there's hella beaches all over.

766
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,520
Probably not very good though.

767
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:59,600
I don't know, I saw one the other day that's like 200,000...

768
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,240
No, like houses, houses like a really nice vacation house.

769
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,240
Like in some random beach and it's like beautiful.

770
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,080
So I think there'll be my retirement plan.

771
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,080
I'll buy a house on the beach.

772
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,080
You'd be so good at being retired.

773
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,580
No, I think so. No, I wouldn't.

774
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:25,080
That means we need to juice your streaming career. You need to start streaming in Spanish.

775
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,080
You would be the biggest Spanish streamer in the world.

776
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,080
No, I don't want that. I don't like that. I don't like being on-camera talent.

777
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,080
What are you doing?

778
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
What?

779
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
You're a mogul.

780
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,580
I'm not a mogul.

781
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,080
You have your hands in many different on-camera...

782
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,920
No, no, no, no.

783
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,240
- See, he's waving away, oh, cover the kid.

784
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,600
- No, that's not true.

785
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,320
That's not true. - Don't even look at me.

786
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,580
- I think you're one of the 10 greatest streamers alive.

787
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,420
- I would agree with that.

788
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,080
- You cannot name more than five streamers.

789
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,000
- That's not true, I'll name 10 right now.

790
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,840
- Okay.

791
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,160
- Taric.

792
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,000
- Okay.

793
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,820
- Yep.

794
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,660
- Okay.

795
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,500
- Mm-hmm.

796
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,540
- Shroud.

797
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,380
- Yep. - Okay.

798
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,880
- Sinatra.

799
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,220
- Who's that, Sinatra?

800
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,400
(laughing)

801
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Who's that among us fella?

802
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Disguised Toast.

803
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,400
Okay.

804
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Mizkif.

805
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400
Oh, now you're getting scared. You're shaking your boots.

806
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
Ludwig.

807
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Uh-huh.

808
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
His girlfriend.

809
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
What's her name?

810
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Pokimane.

811
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Crazy, awesome chick.

812
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
[Laughter]

813
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
No, I don't know. Cutie Cinderella.

814
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:45,900
Okay.

815
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,320
Aiden Ross.

816
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,580
Yup.

817
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,620
Yup.

818
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,480
Kai Sinat.

819
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,340
Yup.

820
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:53,840
Oh my god.

821
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,840
TrainwrecksTV.

822
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,040
There's 10 for you.

823
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,900
Top 10.

824
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,400
There's, that's my top 10 dead or alive.

825
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,440
I think we could have Aiden Ross on this show.

826
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,240
I think he would like it.

827
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
No shot.

828
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,680
He would love it so much.

829
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,400
We would have a better chance of getting Donald Trump on this show than Aiden Ross.

830
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,480
Definitely.

831
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,240
I honestly feel like watching that kid and watching a lot of those people that we need

832
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,460
to return to like 1920s fatty arm buckle Hollywood.

833
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
Like these people should not be famous.

834
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,480
These are some of the least talented people in the world I think.

835
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,840
We need like, I don't know, we need people who can swallow their own hands and shit.

836
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,280
I think there is something charming about someone that's just that like dumb and just

837
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,280
confident about it because I saw someone describe like what they look for in a

838
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,320
streamer and it was just like, you know,

839
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,680
cause they were talking about XQC who's like really,

840
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,560
like 11. Yeah.

841
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,920
And it was like, you know, like I love like,

842
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,280
it's like watching like videos with my brother.

843
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,560
And so everyone just has a retarded brother that they want to hang out with,

844
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,640
but can't. And that's what's true.

845
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,160
I cannot make it big because I'm just not like that intellectual.

846
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,380
I'm too intellectual. I always talk about the current events in the news and like

847
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,320
Donald Trump Donald like politics and economics

848
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:32,560
There is simply no way anyone can make it in twitch talking about the news and politics

849
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:47,560
I think that you could be a massive, I think that you, I think that we need to wait until

850
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:53,000
a game comes out that is, that you, that you are going to make popular.

851
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,680
I think that that would be big for you.

852
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,880
That is going to be the long drive and that's going to go down tomorrow.

853
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,400
I'm going to become the biggest streamer of all time.

854
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:16,400
a

855
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:23,400
the

856
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:36,880
the

857
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,280
the

858
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,360
the

859
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,360
the

860
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,360
the

861
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,560
the

862
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
the

863
00:47:49,560 --> 00:48:02,140
the

864
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:17,620
the

865
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,220
chips are sweet and hot jacks, Jack links, beef jerky.

866
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,980
Sure.

867
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,420
And I like a protein shake.

868
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,680
OK, and I like a.

869
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,020
That's some kind of trail mix, I'll go with the trail mix every time.

870
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,420
I love trail mix.

871
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,660
Well, one of the like healthy ones with sunflower seeds.

872
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,620
I don't like them in.

873
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,580
Because I got enough of them in the car already.

874
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,580
turn that out

875
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:55,700
That's beautiful man, that's usually that's my road trip load out

876
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:02,360
I like what is your road trip loaded goldfish? I like goldfish. I like gatorade

877
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,220
I like I love gatorade

878
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,460
I like uh, yep beef jerky excellent road trip snack

879
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,260
I'll take a cheese it in a pinch

880
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:18,220
I like those cheese and peanut butter sandwiches, the cracker sandwiches.

881
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,220
Yeah, those are good.

882
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,720
I've survived off of the peanut butter sandwich.

883
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,720
Me too.

884
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,720
When I was vegan, that was...

885
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
That's a meal.

886
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
And you can eat the...

887
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,720
And they're like 25 cents.

888
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
Yeah, and they're dense too.

889
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,720
I just realized you are both ex-vegans.

890
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,720
Well, he's ex-vegetarian. He was a half-slaver.

891
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
You guys both leveled up.

892
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,720
I think it's a serious level down for me.

893
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
Yeah, for sure.

894
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,720
You think so?

895
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,720
Yeah, I think that my moral core has rotted black ever since I stopped or started eating meat.

896
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Yeah.

897
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,720
Now you're enjoying too many chicken sandwiches and it's bad for you.

898
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,720
Well, sometimes I will eat chicken thighs, specifically.

899
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:16,060
I will be like, I just ate three chickens worth of like three chickens have died for this.

900
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,520
This is just not right.

901
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,400
Well, they were born for this.

902
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,280
They were born to serve.

903
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,400
I were all born to serve in this fucked up world, man, but they do not need to be executed.

904
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,640
This is a really, really yummy.

905
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,160
What if they were so yummy?

906
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
Here's my solution.

907
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,160
to the meat problem?

908
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:51,680
and

909
00:50:51,680 --> 00:51:06,760
the

910
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,900
Around they're gonna peck old ladies. They're gonna

911
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:16,440
Probably rob somebody they're gonna do some bad bad thing. Okay, once they make that mistake

912
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,760
Yeah, so you you like

913
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,080
Yeah

914
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,480
chicken system

915
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,240
I'm down with killing chickens because I'm pro-death

916
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,840
But I think that they should have a chance to fuck up and listen

917
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:39,240
I'm gonna be doing fucking 1980s CIA shit, handing out drugs and all that shit.

918
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,240
Like I'm gonna try to make these chickens commit the crime.

919
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,240
But unless you commit the crime, you should not do the time on my dinner plate.

920
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Well, how do you know that the chickens that are already dead have not been already prescribed to be, you know...

921
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,240
That they thought about doing evil deeds such as those?

922
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
I mean, they already thought about it.

923
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,740
Yeah, but they gotta have the chance to actually commit some of these horrible atrocities.

924
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:13,240
Yeah, but what I'm saying is, what if that were already happened in the past and that's why we have the system that we have today?

925
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,240
Well, I think that would have probably heard about that.

926
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:24,240
If chickens somehow grew facial hair and somehow had his particular facial hair, then we sentence it to death for having sensitive mustache.

927
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,200
sensitive chicken hitler but if we had to it would be one of the most expensive

928
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,680
possible meals that Dave's hot chicken yeah

929
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:42,880
well you know the Hitler's biggest crime was opening a chicken restaurant himself

930
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,360
yeah yeah bastard going down to McDonald's to get the the Hitler shake

931
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,360
with the Hitler meal? I don't want the Hitler meal. I don't need Hitler meal.

932
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Can I get a McHitler for McHitler's birthday?

933
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,360
No, I don't want any... His name isn't McHitler.

934
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,360
You would say Hitler's birthday, not McHitler's birthday.

935
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,360
He would be offended by that because you're calling him Irish.

936
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,360
Yeah. Did you get the grimace shake?

937
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,360
No.

938
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,360
Dude, the funniest thing I got this past week was

939
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,360
I was just mining with business and I just get a random text from Rex

940
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,340
Thanks from Rex that says give me a shake on me farting and it just

941
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:33,000
Grimace shake me farting. What was it like?

942
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,640
Tasted I think it's like birthday. I think it made you completely purple. You look like grimace right now

943
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,120
You got completely grimaced grimaced on

944
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:58,400
It was a good shake the issue was they make you buy like a Big Mac to get it

945
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,720
Oh, and I hate a DMV a big Mac

946
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,600
Whatever

947
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,840
You're crazy for that

948
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,840
Now, in comparison to a McDouble,

949
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,040
- The McMac is one of my 10 sacred sandwiches.

950
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,260
- In comparison to a McDouble?

951
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,100
- 10 sacred sandwiches?

952
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,160
- In comparison to a hot and spicy McChicken?

953
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,520
It's not even a top 10 sandwich at McDonald's.

954
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,680
- That's, no, okay, I dare you.

955
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,440
Okay, speaking of naming 10 things,

956
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,480
I dare you to name 10 McDonald's items

957
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,520
better than the McMac.

958
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,360
- Okay.

959
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,560
- I might give you the McDouble,

960
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,480
but the Mac sauce is just, it's too good.

961
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,800
- Hot and spicy McChicken.

962
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,320
- I do like that.

963
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,320
Yup. And the McDouble. So that's two.

964
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Start at three.

965
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,040
Junior Bacon Cheeseburger.

966
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,640
I think you've already lost one.

967
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,000
I think I would already rather have a Big Mac.

968
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,400
A McWrap.

969
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
*Screams*

970
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,400
The breakfast wrap?

971
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,400
You're not telling me a McSalad is better than a Big Mac. This is bullshit.

972
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
This is not real.

973
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Okay, the particular Big Mac that I got was awful.

974
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,400
I'll accept that. That's fine by me.

975
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,400
But I will say that McDonald's has better breakfast than their lunch or their supper.

976
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Oh for sure. McRiddles is the best meal ever invented.

977
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:41,320
and

978
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,880
Dave's Double at Wendy's.

979
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,440
The In-N-Out 2x2.

980
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,560
The Five Guys Normal Burger, no cheese.

981
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:03,080
The Subway Tuna Sandwich.

982
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,860
The Subway Tuna Sandwich.

983
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,300
The Subway BMT.

984
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:19,940
The Popeye's chicken sandwich, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich, Supreme, the Chick-fil-A

985
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:34,980
breakfast sandwich, the spicy filet, and to wrap it all up...

986
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,700
My grandma, when I was a kid, she used to make that sandwich and it was just sugar and

987
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,580
butter, so I'm gonna put that as number 10.

988
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:45,900
So funny enough, no mention of the famed southern tomato sandwich on this list.

989
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,900
Oh, you want me to go 20 do you?

990
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,900
No I don't want you to go 20.

991
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,900
Oh that's a top 20 sandwich.

992
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,900
No don't go 20.

993
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,900
It's number 12.

994
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,900
It has been for 8 years.

995
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,900
Don't go 20.

996
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,900
You cannot have 10 other sandwiches that are not the tomato sandwich.

997
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,900
Oh I can't go 21 but I can do the tomato sandwich.

998
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,900
Have you ever been to a Whataburger?

999
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:15,900
the

1000
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:28,540
the

1001
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,160
ourselves enough to pay rent and then we'll just like pay for shit on the tour.

1002
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,800
I went to Whataburger and I tried to pay with the company card and then I had to

1003
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,180
spend 30 minutes on the phone with a lady explaining them to them that we were

1004
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:49,120
traveling and that's why it wasn't like some Bonnie and Clyde stole our card and

1005
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,360
was driving across the country conveniently stopping at every venue.

1006
00:57:53,360 --> 00:58:07,660
buying enough Whataburger for about three to four people yeah yeah yeah also a

1007
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:14,340
a white castle is amazing I love white castle but that's a slider that's not a

1008
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:28,740
sandwich and I think a Culver's is insanely good that's an amazing amazing

1009
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:34,660
hamburger I think a lot of burger chicken strip sandwich I think of all

1010
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,660
I've had Chick-fil-A a couple times. I don't think you were there for the first time I had Chick-fil-A.

1011
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,660
Yeah, it was this big thing. We went to the Chick-fil-A in Manhattan.

1012
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,660
Was it? Yeah.

1013
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,660
Okay, maybe you're right. And you loved it.

1014
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,660
I do like Chick-fil-A. And we hated standing up because there was nowhere to sit.

1015
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,660
Yeah, it was during COVID.

1016
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,660
I think it was the first time I had Chick-fil-A.

1017
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,860
Yeah, it was during COVID, I guess.

1018
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,500
Yeah, I don't know.

1019
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:17,220
I think I've only been to like Chick-fil-A, Five Guys, In-N-Out, Whataburger, and like Popeyes.

1020
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,860
And like every time someone else like talks about...

1021
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,060
Yeah, Subway, of course.

1022
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:27,860
But like every time like someone talks about like their local, like, "Oh, this sandwich is so good."

1023
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,060
I just don't have that experience.

1024
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,540
Also, I have to give a shout out to PT's Burgers and Fries in North Carolina.

1025
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,580
PT's, keep doing your thing. The 8-ounce is amazing.

1026
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,340
You know what's a good sandwich?

1027
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,220
What?

1028
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:49,980
The Crypto Monkey NFT sandwich.

1029
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,180
I can't believe I've never been.

1030
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,300
You've never been? It's so good.

1031
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,180
I know. Both of you have said it's amazing.

1032
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:02,180
Did you say Bun B is an investor or something?

1033
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,180
Yeah, yeah. No, that's real.

1034
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,180
That's so awesome.

1035
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,180
Trillburgers. Or Bun B, do they supply the meat or some shit?

1036
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:18,180
Yeah, so it's like, Bun B does the food for it.

1037
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,180
Oh, okay.

1038
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,180
Or it's like the partner company.

1039
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,180
And I remember I went there one time before going to the airport,

1040
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,060
and they were filming a Bun B video there.

1041
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:31,600
I was just awkwardly waiting for a burger to the side while like

1042
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,400
20 people...

1043
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
You saw Bun B?

1044
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:33,900
Yeah.

1045
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,320
That's cool.

1046
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,320
He's playing a song. He's a rapper.

1047
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,160
Oh, okay.

1048
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,160
Yeah.

1049
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,460
And his brother basically died, so...

1050
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,460
Oh, rest in peace, Joe B.

1051
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,120
His name is actually Pimp C, but nice try.

1052
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,120
Sorry.

1053
01:00:53,120 --> 01:01:00,400
Yeah, so I bet you can't now I don't because I don't have any concept of what any of this is because I'm from a

1054
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
different country

1055
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:21,140
You were both love Mexico so much and I will convince you to move here the first time you go if you come here

1056
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:36,220
the

1057
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:43,220
that's

1058
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:52,420
the

1059
01:01:52,420 --> 01:02:01,900
the

1060
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:18,740
just

1061
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:34,620
the

1062
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,620
touching the ball.

1063
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,620
That's right.

1064
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,620
Arms crossed, top of the key.

1065
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:43,580
You go over there, you sit in the corner, set a screen for him, somebody dive.

1066
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,740
I've got a whiteboard that I'm pulling out of my...

1067
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:51,380
It's 4v5, some guys are just sitting there kind of guarding you, just hands up like a

1068
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,380
mime.

1069
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:59,020
Yeah, I'm like, don't even waste your time.

1070
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,500
I control the flow, dude.

1071
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,500
It's not coming here.
