8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:55,960
had a chicken Caesar rap just now saying it I mean the all makes it sound like it

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,560
was maybe a bad move. No, I had a chicken Caesar wrap and guess what I had with it? I love

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,360
chicken Caesar wraps. Would you? I had Dr. Pepper. Wow. Look it, it's over there. I do,

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,080
I believe you. I can see it from here. I only see a white table. Let me go grab it real

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,560
quick. No, I think it's really. I think you should sit down. No, I think it's fine. No,

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,520
I really think it's. You want to grab it? Okay, he's going to grab it. He's grabbing

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,360
it. Oh, he got it. It's in his hands. Wow, he actually grabbed it. Wow, and he's grabbing

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,160
No, no, you can't bring if you bring that recorder over here. I will fucking ruin your life

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,420
He put it back down

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,680
He took it back down. You don't want me to play the recorder on there really don't I really really least favorite thing in this

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,320
Office right now, which is there's there's a few things

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,060
I feel like that that's in competition with for worst thing in the office

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,260
What are the ways that this I would I can give you at least a top to give me a top to top to our things

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,260
We own the recorder and that grabber. Oh

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
Oh, the grabber. Do we still have the grabber?

23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
The grabber's somewhere in here.

24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
I feel like maybe we hid the grabber.

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,860
I didn't do that.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,860
I think you hid the grabber.

27
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,860
I did not touch the grabber.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,860
I guarantee it's somewhere in here just under

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,860
all this stuff that doesn't matter.

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
Yeah.

31
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,860
All this random ass crap.

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
All the junk.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
We just own a lot of junk, man.

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
I guess we probably shouldn't have started

35
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
letting our neighbors put their trash in here

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,220
Yeah. For a dollar a day.

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,220
We're not, that's not even that much money.

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,260
That's a tiny amount of money.

39
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,380
I thought, see, I thought that if we started letting the neighbors bring in the trash, then

40
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,380
we, you know.

41
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,580
We'd be able to maybe convince them to have sex with us.

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,140
No, I thought it would be our treasure.

43
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
Right.

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,660
Oh, because it's someone else's treasure.

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
One man.

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
Maybe this will be treasure.

47
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,660
Turns out it's a lot of banana peels.

48
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Yeah.

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
It's mostly trash.

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,860
It's mostly trash.

51
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,180
I don't think I've seen one piece of treasure.

52
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,180
There was one treasure.

53
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
What?

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,180
A golden coin.

55
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,420
Oh yeah, but that turned out to be chocolate.

56
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
Yeah.

57
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,100
And it also had banana peel juice all over it.

58
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,580
It was vintage though, and the foil was worth a lot of money.

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,580
Really?

60
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
Yeah, I actually went and sold the foil behind your guys' back.

61
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,580
Well that was your treasure.

62
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,340
I haven't found a single piece of fucking treasure.

63
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,340
All I'm getting is boxes.

64
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Well here's the treasure for me.

65
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,260
What I'm saying is under all this trash somewhere there might be a piece of treasure that is

66
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
a grabber.

67
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,260
This is the only treasure I need.

68
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,260
Diet Dr. P.

69
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
What is your policy on if you-

70
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,500
I got two beverages right now.

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,540
I got a ghost energy and a diet Dr. P.

72
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,540
We're done with beverages.

73
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,240
I want to ask about, this is I think going to be probably something we, honestly, we could

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,100
talk about this for two hours. I'm not sure that we're going to, but we could. What is

75
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,980
the policy on food or beverage that you find on the street?

76
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,180
We've talked about this a million times before.

77
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,620
If it's candy and it's in the wrapper, if it's like a full...

78
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,620
We shouldn't even touch it.

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,400
Oh yeah, I just had one question because the other night we were out and there was a full

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
slice of pizza.

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,820
Okay, that's different.

82
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,820
What is that? Can you eat that?

83
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Is it in the box?

84
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,820
It was in the box.

85
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,700
and you look at the cheese, is the cheese still warm?

86
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,340
- From look, I don't have heat vision.

87
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,220
- No, no, no, you know like when cheese pizza,

88
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,340
when cheese pizza starts getting cold

89
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,620
and the cheese goes back to it,

90
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,020
like it doesn't look like a liquid anymore.

91
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,420
- But I kinda like cold pizza, I'll fucking say it.

92
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,900
- Don't eat pizza, pizza's out of the question.

93
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,820
- It really, you know what, it depends on how hungry I am.

94
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,360
- You haven't eaten in days.

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,860
- Okay then, yeah, okay.

96
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,960
But if I need in days, I might eat a deer on the side of the road.

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,760
Good luck catching a deer.

98
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,460
You asshole.

99
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
On the side of the road.

100
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,260
You just disrespected hunters everywhere.

101
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,860
It's really easy to catch a deer.

102
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
Here's something.

103
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,260
Ready?

104
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,560
No.

105
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:21,960
Ready?

106
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,860
Yeah, it's really easy.

107
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,760
Here's a double standard I've just realized, right?

108
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,060
You find a candy, Hershey bar in the wrapper on the ground, right?

109
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,460
Society says, don't eat that.

110
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,960
You find a Hershey bar in the wrapper on the ground at the

111
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
parade.

112
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,960
Society says run and grab that before someone else gets it.

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,760
Yeah, go grab that right now.

114
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,560
That's actually a very fair point.

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,920
Yeah, but if you think about it,

116
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,520
the variable is that a clown threw it.

117
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,080
So it leaves a clown plus candy.

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
If a normal guy drops a candy on the ground,

119
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
you shouldn't touch that.

120
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,400
A clown throws, a clown arcs it.

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,800
That's the other thing.

122
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
If a guy's walking a parade

123
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,200
and he just drops candy straight on the ground,

124
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,640
I don't think you're supposed to go get that.

125
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
If you take, what about a toss?

126
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,480
If you see it be tossed onto the ground,

127
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,120
I think you can get it. What about a pill that you find on the ground?

128
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
A pill, you take it.

129
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Yeah, I think you can take it.

130
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
But what if it falls out of...

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
As long as it's still in the wrapper.

132
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Yeah.

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,800
What if it falls out, what if it's a parade, what if it's a Super Bowl parade, it falls

134
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
out of Gronk's pocket?

135
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Do you take that?

136
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
That means, yeah, you take that.

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Or do you return it?

138
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
That's gonna be good.

139
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,160
Why don't you return it, though?

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
I think that pill might kill you.

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Yeah.

142
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Oh, yeah.

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,360
Have you seen that video? It's like the older, it's like a woman driving like a Porsche Cayenne

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,440
or something and she's driving on three tires and like the fucking this the

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,080
bumper is scraped up her she's driving on the fucking like was it the bearing I

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
don't know car parts that's a skateboard part she's driving on the fucking thing

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,280
axle the axle she's driving on the axle and somebody that's also a skateboard

148
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,080
part I was so close you're a pro but she's driving on it and then somebody

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,280
pulls her over and is like, "You have to stop driving." You just bumped

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,920
into this guy and she looks at him and is just like, "I..." Somebody was helping me out

151
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,400
back there. No. She starts like making like lizard faces at him. I've never heard of this.

152
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,720
While she's leaving the car, they zoom in on her seat and you see like two

153
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,760
big-ass like Xanax or something. Like she laid them? No, they

154
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,600
- She fell out of her purse.

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
- Oh, okay.

156
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,840
- But she was like-- - They zoomed in on her seat,

157
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,240
she laid to it, that's what I think.

158
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,100
- The guy looks at her and is like,

159
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,000
like, "You're on painkillers or something,

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,040
"you can't be driving."

161
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,880
She goes, "No, I'm not."

162
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,000
(laughing)

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,680
- For those who didn't, who can't see, he went, "Bam."

164
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
- Yeah, I did a blim, blim, blim.

165
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,240
- He did a Yoshi, blim.

166
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
- Blim, blim, blim.

167
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
- It's a good video.

168
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,960
- Yeah.

169
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,720
I need to, I haven't been seeing all that many crazy people

170
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
as of late.

171
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,200
I really just, I don't see him on the tour.

172
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,000
- I just talked to a crazy guy at the store.

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,840
- Really?

174
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,960
- Yeah, I asked him where are the paper towels

175
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,160
and he said, "No English."

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,200
I was like, "What the fuck are you saying?"

177
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,760
- What are you, a fucking lunatic?

178
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,920
- That's not an answer to that question.

179
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
- Yeah.

180
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,320
- This guy's fucking, he can't understand.

181
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
- Crazy, yeah.

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,980
- He's out of his mind.

183
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,820
- He's in his own little world.

184
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,660
- Yeah, I know.

185
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,840
- He's making up crap.

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,960
- I see these people all the time listening to this music.

187
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,040
It doesn't make a goddamn lick of sense.

188
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,560
They're in their own little world.

189
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,400
They made their own music where they just go like,

190
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,480
It would be awesome to have, like to drive around and blast music that is in just a made-up

191
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
language.

192
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,000
Just have music that you made for yourself.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's funny.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's just in a language that you created and just translate every song you like into

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
an imaginary language.

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,280
Or just go around listening to the Simlish versions of...

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,000
Katy Perry last Friday night Simlish.

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Cooler Than Me Simlish.

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
- Oh yeah.

200
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,440
- ♪ A sabba doo woppy, kaboowa boo wow ♪

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,080
- And you have mixtapes, you have a bunch of, you know.

202
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,160
- Yeah, have you heard this?

203
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,000
And then you put it in.

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,840
- Yeah.

205
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,800
- That's what you would say before you put it in.

206
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
- Right.

207
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,460
- Have you heard this?

208
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,300
♪ Rabby robite ♪

209
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,120
And then just put it in.

00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,960
- Yeah.

211
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,920
- I always thought Seagor Roast was somebody

212
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,720
fucking up the pronunciation of Sugar Ray.

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,000
- I think we also talked about this.

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
- Oh fuck.

215
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,680
- Yeah, I think we--

216
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,040
- I think it's time to end the show.

217
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
- No.

218
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,840
- We, this is two episodes in a row,

219
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,200
I think that we've had a complete conversation.

220
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,040
- Yeah.

221
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,860
- That we've already had.

222
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,700
- It's been way more episodes than that.

223
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,280
I'm trying to be more vigilant about it.

224
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
That's the only, we do it constantly.

225
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm trying to finally say,

226
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,200
we talked about this, don't talk about that.

227
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
- Why not?

228
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,860
- I don't know.

229
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,700
- What if we just--

230
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,040
- I think we need to break new ground.

231
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
- But isn't there--

232
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,700
- I think we need to do something

233
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,540
that changes the medium forever.

234
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,520
- Let's talk about a brand new topic.

235
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,960
- That's what I'm saying.

236
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
All right, how about something we never,

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
what about homework?

238
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,600
- Okay.

239
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,420
- I think we've talked about it.

240
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,640
- Okay, wait, what about the Grinch?

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,960
- I swear to God, we've also realized this

242
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,200
and have done this.

243
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,280
But we need to actually--

244
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,760
We have done this where we try to--

245
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,320
And it worked for a long time.

246
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
We didn't have to do this.

247
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
But we're back at it.

248
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,760
We have to find the next thing.

249
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,240
So we did poop, too.

250
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
Yeah, we did poop.

251
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,560
Man, that was the worst show ever.

252
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,680
What are we talking about?

253
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,180
Poop?

254
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,800
Candy?

255
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,840
Candy made of poop?

256
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,380
Yeah, but we have talked about candy.

257
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,880
We never talked about candy before.

258
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,760
It is a complete Groundhog Day situation.

259
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,320
Oh, it is a Groundhog Day.

260
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,200
Have you guys ever thought about what you

261
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,080
would do in that situation?

262
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,420
We haven't talked about this.

263
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
Have we? Maybe.

264
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,020
If you were in a Groundhog Day situation, you realize...

265
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,720
I'd probably kill 100 people and then myself.

266
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,020
Yeah, am I Bill Murray?

267
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Yeah, you're the Bill Murray.

268
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,520
Then I'm committing every crime I can fucking think of.

269
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Have we talked about this?

270
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
No, we haven't.

271
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
You're just... now you're just...

272
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
See, you know what you did to him?

273
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
You see what you fucking did to him, Cameron?

274
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
He thinks that... look at him.

275
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,020
I've never seen his eyes this big.

276
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
He's freaking out.

277
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
He'll get used to it.

278
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
He'll get used to the new paradigm.

279
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
Alright, we haven't talked about this.

280
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
Let's just keep talking about it.

281
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020
Did he die?

282
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,020
Did Bill Murray die?

283
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:50,200
Yeah, he was executed by military tribunal. Yeah, exactly. Did we talk about this? Maybe

284
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,220
in 2019, it's been a couple years at this point. We've been doing this for four years now.

285
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,900
Groundhog Day though, I guess it's the "which crimes are you like, even if I could do that,

286
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:07,620
I wouldn't do it." Probably raping, I wouldn't do that. He was baiting you into saying that.

287
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,460
- Yeah, this guy admitted.

288
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,020
- Now there's a sound bite of you saying that word.

289
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,980
- Yep, admitting he would never do it.

290
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,060
(laughing)

291
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,340
- Oh, we got you so good.

292
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
- He doesn't understand how audio editing works nowadays.

293
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,180
They can remove words from sentences and change contexts.

294
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,020
- Okay, yeah, wait, wait.

295
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,840
I need to set that up.

296
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,680
- Which crime would you wanna do first?

297
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,740
- And then we can cut to that.

298
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,660
That'll be really easy.

299
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,100
- Yep, perfect.

300
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,540
- Yeah, I guess that one's a big one I probably wouldn't do.

301
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,380
- Probably, or wouldn't do.

302
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,220
- Probably not.

303
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,040
(laughing)

304
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,260
- Probably wouldn't do.

305
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,780
I wouldn't do that one.

306
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,980
I wouldn't do that one. I don't think I would kill anybody.

307
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,780
I don't think I would eliminate the world.

308
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,080
I think I would kill like...

309
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,180
The thing is also...

310
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,980
I think I would kill like a bunch of small animals, right?

311
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,380
I'd kill a bunch of little animals.

312
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,680
Yeah.

313
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
And then I would start wetting my bed a lot.

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,180
Mm-hmm.

315
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Because it's, you know, I'm gonna wake up with clean sheets tomorrow.

316
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,980
That's a really good... You can shit your... You never have to wipe again.

317
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,180
Exactly. I'm gonna wake up...

318
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,080
Bill Murray's not waiting that long.

319
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,280
Is it worth waiting 24 hours though?

320
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,780
He's not wasting his time every day.

321
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,780
I can either wipe my butt now or wait 10 hours and not have to.

322
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,780
Also does he have to... I don't remember the rules of the movie. Does he have to go to sleep?

323
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,780
He has to go to sleep or get killed and then he wakes up in that hotel room.

324
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
I've never seen the movie.

325
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,780
But the way he solves it is he helps somebody find true love or something or realizes true love.

326
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,780
That doesn't make any sense.

327
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,780
I thought he kills the groundhog, not chicken.

328
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,820
chicken he kills himself a bunch of time is he the groundhog I never understood

329
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,340
this movie he's uh he's there what he's not name he's not a news reporter

330
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,340
groundhog okay he's there to be a news but is his name like hog like David hog

331
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,380
or something no his name is Bill hog bill hog bill hog Murray begins bill hog

332
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,140
Murray Gaines I don't he's a and he's a dwarf I don't think I would I don't

333
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,100
think I would kill anybody I don't think I would either I would kill myself I

334
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,340
I don't want to hurt my, I don't want to hurt.

335
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
- So what would you do?

336
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,940
- I honestly would just probably just look at my phone.

337
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,860
(laughing)

338
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,780
Pretty much every day.

339
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,260
- I'd go somewhere probably.

340
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,780
- Or I'd take that, you know what I'd do?

341
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,540
I would know, even if I found out,

342
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,220
oh I gotta give this bitch a kiss to win.

343
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,780
I would still probably do a like,

344
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,500
Duolingo lesson a day for like five years.

345
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,100
Learn everything I possibly could.

346
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,220
- Every morning you spend.

347
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,580
- You remember the next day.

348
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,660
- Yeah, I'm learning Japanese.

349
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,160
- First of all, you gather all human knowledge.

350
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
That's a gimme.

351
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Also, every day, you spend all of your money in the morning

352
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,400
on like the best food ever, or a day trip.

353
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,800
And you can--

354
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,280
- Your bank account's gonna reset.

355
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,120
- Exactly, you can spend all the money you have every day

356
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,280
to do something that will not go away,

357
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,960
that's like going to a roller coaster.

358
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,640
- He'll remember the next, he remembers everything.

359
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,680
- I'd get a MasterClass subscription.

360
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,520
- Yeah.

361
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
- Judd Apatow MasterClass.

362
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,720
I'd learn how to write the funniest fucking movie ever.

363
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,740
- I would do that.

364
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,840
- Yeah, I'd do the Steve Martin one,

365
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,040
learn how to do stand-up too. Yeah. Have you seen that the news report that came out? No.

366
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,440
The news report? Why am I saying it like that? It was a fucking Rhett and Link

367
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:23,440
interview with Seth Green. That news report that came out? Yeah, from the news.

368
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,040
A Rhett and Link interview. It's a Rhett and Link interview with Seth Green where Seth

369
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,280
Green is like, "When I was a kid, I wouldn't give Bill Murray my seat, so he picked me up

370
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:40,400
by my ankles and shook me over the trash and said, 'This trash goes in the trash!'"

371
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
That's funny.

372
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
That is one of the funniest things.

373
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
That's a joke you can do with kids.

374
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Yeah, was he pretending it was traumatizing?

375
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Picking a kid up by the- Yeah.

376
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Oh, what a bitch.

377
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I mean, maybe if Bill Murray did it, I wouldn't like it.

378
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I'd also-

379
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I'd be like, "That's dope."

380
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,520
I definitely feel like maybe I brought- There was a substitute gym teacher in my school who

381
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,520
used to do that. He used to pick kids up by the ankle and shake them around. That was like his thing.

382
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,520
That shouldn't be allowed. It definitely shouldn't. I would rather...

383
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,520
I know, but that's what I'm saying. I didn't like that and I didn't want that to happen to me. Wait, it happened to you?

384
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,520
No. Oh. You dodged it? I stayed away from him. Do you know anybody

385
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,520
who got shook? Yeah, like everybody. Everybody but you got shook?

386
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,520
He was like, he was, you know... He was a tall kid. I mean, look at him.

387
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,520
I think even a scary freak like that who shakes kids upside

388
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,800
down knows that there's one kid that if you do it, that kid will like,

389
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,640
we'll bring the whole operation down.

390
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,240
I feel like I would have cried and I probably would have like,

391
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,880
none where I was. I don't know, but I was a shy kid. You know what I mean?

392
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,440
I was a shy, quiet kid. And I feel like you either,

393
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,720
you pick the shy quiet kid up by the like, and it's,

394
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,800
you're either getting killed in 15 years or, uh,

395
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
you're going to jail for molesting children. Yeah.

396
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
I had a PE teacher made me do a pull up. I never forgave that bitch.

397
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,320
Amanda fucking would love to put a bullet in her head.

398
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,140
- The worst thing you can be as a teacher,

399
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,640
like if you're a gym, the worst--

400
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,400
- The worst thing you can be is a teacher.

401
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,280
- That's it, I'll say that much.

402
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,080
- But like the worst attribute you can have,

403
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,780
like if you're a creepy teacher,

404
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,680
the worst one you can be is gym, like a gym teacher.

405
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,880
- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

406
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,760
- But like a creepy math teacher, it's just like, yeah.

407
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,840
- That's a math nerd. - He likes math.

408
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,040
- Yeah. - Yeah, he's obviously--

409
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,760
- A gym teacher likes children's fitness.

410
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,960
- See, I wanted to-- - Exactly.

411
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,920
- I had the wrong kind of gym teachers all,

412
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,040
I never had I wanted like all my becoming a gym teacher because like oh my God, I

413
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,540
fucking love wiffle ball.

414
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,320
Yeah, what job can I get where I can play with my favorite watch people play

415
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,560
with a ball and you just giving way too in-depth notes on the football technique

416
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,440
and all of my gym.

417
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,720
Oh my my PE teachers in school were fat or like really short or lesbian.

418
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,320
Yeah, yeah, I had a lot of hot lesbian and I was like dude this sucks.

419
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
I want like a Rob Riggle.

420
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,840
I know.

421
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,660
(laughing)

422
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,880
I want Rob Riggle with a whistle

423
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,720
and his shorts are too small.

424
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,880
I had an Australian gym teacher.

425
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,680
I had a heavy Boston accent lesbian gym teacher.

426
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,720
I had another, there was like two gym teachers I remember.

427
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,200
Like the only one who wasn't,

428
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,760
the two who weren't fat were the Australian guy.

429
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,360
You met an Aussie that young?

430
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,480
Yeah. Holy.

431
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,220
Mr. Levis.

432
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,320
Mr. Levis?

433
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,600
Levis, Mr. Levis and he said, "Cow cow puffs like me."

434
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,860
(laughing)

435
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,700
- He was also a health teacher.

436
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,540
- He was also a health teacher.

437
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,580
- He said, "Do not eat cocoa puffs."

438
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,780
- Do not eat cocoa puffs.

439
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,580
- Do not eat, whatever you do, do not eat cocoa puffs.

440
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,660
- Cocoa puffs.

441
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,820
- Cocoa puffs.

442
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,780
- The other one was--

443
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,020
- That's just what they call it over there.

444
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,340
He lost the accent, but that's just the name of it.

445
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,060
- Cow-er-puff.

446
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,860
- The other gym teacher was in first grade

447
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,660
and it called him Tiny Tony.

448
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,500
- Tiny Tony.

449
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,660
(laughing)

450
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,540
He's like a regular at my mom's restaurant.

451
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,620
I shouldn't talk about it.

452
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,120
No.

453
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,020
[LAUGHTER]

454
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,220
Talk about-- do they still call him Tiny Tony?

455
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,900
No, but I think we called him Tiny Tony behind his back.

456
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,060
How tiny was Tony?

457
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,740
He was probably like 5'7".

458
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,860
It's not that short.

459
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,660
It's not short.

460
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,160
It's just--

461
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,660
Tiny Tony.

462
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,100
It's just when you're a kid, you--

463
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,660
You have to take any opportunity you can

464
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,540
to call someone Tiny Tony.

465
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,060
Yeah.

466
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,740
If someone's name is Tony, and they're even a little bit short,

467
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,780
they have to be Tiny Tony.

468
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:11,980
Yeah, you're one letter off, bud.

469
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,580
You're going to be Tiny Tony.

470
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,460
Yeah, I mean, that's like-- but tiny, really, I'm thinking like 4'11".

471
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,100
He's a nice guy.

472
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I don't even know why I call him that.

473
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Tiny Tony because he's small.

474
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,540
He was just my gym teacher and I was just like,

475
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,900
I don't want to go to gym.

476
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,860
Tiny ass Tony.

477
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,100
Tiny Tony.

478
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,060
Tiny Tony.

479
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,560
Good guy.

480
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,020
Tiny Tony.

481
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,300
They're all good guys.

482
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,660
I disagree.

483
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,260
Teachers?

484
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,780
I did have a fat gym teacher in second grade

485
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,180
who taught us scarf juggling.

486
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,680
And I've definitely talked about it.

487
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,140
Probably taught you how to scarf down food, too, a fat guy.

488
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,620
Yeah.

489
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,820
He was legally blind and he rode to school on a bike.

490
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,320
and he also had like a carriage that he like dragged his kids.

491
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,320
- There were these three blind kids who went to my school.

492
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,940
And we always saw how they ran, yeah.

493
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,340
- Did they stick together?

494
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,180
- Yeah.

495
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,000
- Really?

496
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,840
- Yeah.

497
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,020
- You're getting quiet 'cause it's true.

498
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,340
- They were little mice.

499
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,180
- No.

500
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
- I was doing three blind mice.

501
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,020
- No, it's true.

502
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,420
It's true.

503
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,860
You said you had three blind kids at your school, didn't you?

504
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,900
- Yeah, and we always saw how they ran.

505
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,740
Really? Yeah. And how they run. And we saw how they ran. And they stuck together?

506
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,580
Did the farmer catch it? Yes. With the carving knife? Yeah.

507
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,140
I didn't ever, you know, I was, it was devastating. I'll say it. It was fucking devastating.

508
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,420
When the farmer caught you with the carving knife?

509
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,660
No. When I found out that blind people don't just see black, that devastated me, bro.

510
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,100
I usually, that makes you, I feel like that makes you go, whoa, like a high guy.

511
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,260
That just, I was devastated. I always assumed. Blind people see like shapes.

512
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,260
I mooned so many blind people.

513
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Well not you.

514
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Some blind people can't see at all though, right?

515
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Very few.

516
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,260
But legally blind doesn't mean you're actually blind.

517
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,260
Yeah, but I thought just any time I met a blind person,

518
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
anyone whose eyes went the wrong way,

519
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I was like,

520
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
"Okay, I'm going to be showing this guy a fucking picture of my balls."

521
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
Yeah.

522
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
And telling him it's the weather.

523
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
I had a friend who was legally deaf.

524
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,260
Yeah?

525
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
Like a rapper.

526
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,380
I think we all knew her. I just won't talk about it.

527
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:22,820
Okay, okay. Rather odd. I actually had a friend who couldn't taste or touch or smell or see or hear.

528
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,020
I had a friend who was completely made up in my head.

529
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,460
I had a buddy, my friend was made up and also he was a rock.

530
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,380
I had a friend who was a nose, just a nose.

531
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,700
Really? Yeah, he fell off my other friend.

532
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,740
Wow.

533
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,900
He was surgically removed from my other friend.

534
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,400
- Yeah, but he was chill.

535
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
- Yeah.

536
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,060
- He didn't do much.

537
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,100
- Could he see or hear?

538
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,220
- He couldn't do anything.

539
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,060
- Could he smell?

540
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,340
- No, his name was Nose too.

541
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,980
His name was Devin's Nose.

542
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,080
- He couldn't smell?

543
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,700
- He couldn't smell 'cause he have to,

544
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,420
something has to be, he could smell for somebody else.

545
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,620
- Do you remember that video?

546
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,440
- Yeah.

547
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,200
- The blind guy on the French Voice

548
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,460
and he sings "Lose Yourself"?

549
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,300
- Yeah.

550
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,500
- Oh, speaking of French, I also was devastated

551
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,180
when I met my first French person.

552
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,660
It was the first person from another country I'd ever met

553
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,980
and he stayed with me.

554
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,900
he's like some missionary guy. I'd be devastated too. He was a missionary and I was like dude,

555
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,500
you did missionary with me? He's sitting there, he's sitting there. Yeah, he's a little older

556
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,460
than me. I had to give up my... He eats a snail in your house? You had to give it up to him

557
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,460
and he did missionary with you? Alright, let me... Yes, yes, he fucked me and I was like

558
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:28,700
devastated. As I said, I was devastated when I met my first Frenchman. No, I had never

559
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,940
met him before, I've never met a person from another country before. I mean, except for

560
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,700
like I guess like Peru but then I he was like the first European I know I know

561
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:46,500
you might have that's just a funny thing to say I guess Peru but I so he was a

562
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,060
missionary or some shit or his parents were and he had to stay at my in my room

563
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,020
for like a week and so I had to sleep on the couch and I thought that I was gonna

564
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,260
have like a new French best friend and he fucking he went he spent four minutes

565
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,660

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,200

567
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,980

568
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,960

569
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,460

571
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,520
I find the play, I find the play, I flip on James.

572
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,040
And then he was always dunking.

573
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,920
And then he made me, he made himself in 2K,

574
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,360
he made me in 2K.

575
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,320
And he hacked the game or something,

576
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,400
made himself fuck my character in the game to death.

577
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,440
To death. To death.

578
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,400
There was some little French-Canadian kid,

579
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
one of my mom's co-worker. Some low-class

580
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,080
French-Canadian kid.

581
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,720
My mom's co-worker, it was like her kid,

582
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,880
and we had to hang out with him one time.

583
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,960
and he was the most annoying person I've ever met.

584
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,800
- Francophile?

585
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,480
- What?

586
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,320
- He's a francophile.

587
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,140
- It's getting near.

588
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,980
- No, he's French Canadian.

589
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,920
- It's getting near Halloween.

590
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
- No, not, what do they call that?

591
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,760
Francophone.

592
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,580
- Francophone.

593
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,840
- Francophone, right?

594
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,680
- Yeah.

595
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,520
- Yeah.

596
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,960
- Francophile is you like the disaster artist or whatever.

597
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
- Francophile.

598
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,160
- Francophile's monster is completely different.

599
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,440
- Francophile is what he was doing

600
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,800
with his damn students at NYU.

601
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,680
Those 17 year old kids who were in his acting class.

602
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,520
- He was speaking French to them?

603
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,120
- He was being a francophile?

604
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:33,040
Franco is being a file. Oh, he was being a file over there. Yeah. Yeah, he's being a complete file. Uh-huh - 24 year olds

605
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:43,240
I thought it was NYU high that's still not right though. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it's still not right to 24

606
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,120
It's still not right to be James Franco. Yeah, it's not like him

607
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,200
I think a lot of these men don't understand about this Leonardo DiCaprio thing. Yeah

608
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,640
a child do you guys ever watch the the

609
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,240
the

610
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,480
Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy. Yeah

611
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,120
the one with

612
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,400
Walbert is the one from 2001 there's the trilogy. Oh the new one. Yeah, I've seen the first one

613
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,980
So how like the first one is like James Franco like raises

614
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,960
Caesar Caesar the chimp yeah, and then Caesar like it's like a knowledge virus or whatever

615
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,080
He becomes super smart and he eventually like goes to war with the humans and the other movies, and it's so funny

616
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,760
It's like all it is all James Franco's fault. He's destroyed

617
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,360
I really like this chimp and then just like years later just the chimps are

618
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,280
declaring war on humankind and exterminating the planet. I love the original like five

619
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,140
those movies are so good. The reboot trilogy was really good too. I gotta see the reboot trilogy but the

620
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,080
original I did I got I got the originals on blu-ray yeah come over nice I've um

621
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,200
what's it that the third one it's like planet of the apes and then beneath the

622
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,920
planet of the apes then the third one which is like is that escape I think it's

623
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,800
escape, escape it's like they somehow go back in time to the 70s or whatever and

624
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,320
then they're like treated as like the biggest celebrities in the world.

625
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,720
The monkeys are? Yeah, they're like hey in the future, we're gonna take over.

626
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,680
The second one is so sick with the mutant, the underground mutants, you know

627
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:18,120
like the crucified apes and stuff. I do often think like if I gave Phil like a

628
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,360
a gun and the ability to think better and I put it at my head I wonder if he'd

629
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,120
pull the trigger cuz they'd be like well I don't need this guy yeah or if he

630
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,440
loves me you know right do you think you'd eat you if you died he would eat

631
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,640
me I've come to terms with the fact that and not all dogs will do this if I

632
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,320
pretend to be asleep for too long he'll eat me he will start eating yeah yeah

633
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,200
he will start trying to rip my flesh off.

634
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,520
- Yeah, that's okay. - I think,

635
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
maybe try to be stinkier.

636
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
- Yeah. - I've been trying my hardest.

637
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
- No, what are you talking about?

638
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,880
Dogs love it when stuff is stinky.

639
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,400
- He tried to lick the poop off my ass the other day.

640
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,240
I was sitting on-- - I was worried

641
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,480
that my cable would go and--

642
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,600
- I was wiping my ass.

643
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,420
What are you doing?

644
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,920
I was wiping my ass and he resumed into the bathroom

645
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,720
and tried to eat the poop off of,

646
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,280
like I was like, you know, I hiked my right ass cheek up

647
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,520
so I could put my hand under.

648
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,400
- Yeah. - And he like tried

649
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,240
to shove his mouth in there and lick the poop off me.

650
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,560
- I guess dogs really do learn from their owners.

651
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,400
- Dogs, no.

652
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
(laughing)

653
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,240
- Who, how would I do that?

654
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
- See, that's one of those things where it's like,

655
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,920
you know, it's funny,

656
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,320
dogs always seem to look like their owners

657
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,680
and it's Phil eating poop and Kaleb just has a big

658
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,280
brown ring around his mouth.

659
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,560
(laughing)

660
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,320
- Yeah, I don't eat, I don't actually eat poop though.

661
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,960
- I think, you know, it would just be a funny scenario

662
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,280
for a joke or for a real photo that was taken recently.

663
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,280
- If Moe ever gained like,

664
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,040
- Sentience?

665
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I think that I would at least be able to reason with him to stop trying to eat my hand.

666
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
He's going crazy.

667
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:58,040
I am kind of worried that if I leave the house for too long, my chocobo is going to run wild and rip up the couch.

668
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,040
And it's true. Your chocobo sucks.

669
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah, he kind of has a bad temperament.

670
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
It's not cool for you to say that. I can kind of say it, I guess.

671
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I don't want you to kind of bad mouth my chocobo because I do love him.

672
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:16,440
I he talks shit about my animal every pet that I've ever owned you just don't like my chocobo cuz I named him Patrick

673
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Yeah, I don't I don't like that either

674
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,120
All right, what's wrong with it? I think it's a cute name for a chocobo. It's not a cute name for a chocobo

675
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,780
It's great. It's a fucking green one. That's normal. It's not a good one. It's not green cuz it's sick

676
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:36,680
It's just green on it's sick. You feed it chocolate. You're thinking of my Yoshi whose name is Caleb

677
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Okay

678
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,000
It's from Final Fantasy, it's the bird that you ride

679
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,840
Okay

680
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,780
And this is a Pokemon. No, this final fantasy Chocobo. It looks like stupid. Are you completely daft?

681
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,760
I'm a don't you ever bloody say that to me again?

682
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,120
You knots don't you? What are the what are the pets called in Club Penguin?

683
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,440
Penguins, what are the pets the little ones?

684
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,960
I think they're penguins a lot of shit the little the hairy hair balls turds. I never what are they called?

685
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,520
I never played like Club Penguin. I never played it either. I never played

686
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,920
Like middle school or runescape. Yeah, what are those called puffles? I want one of those yeah, yeah until I never did

687
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,160
It's into your in your food

688
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,000
I'll just hit it

689
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,840
(laughing)

690
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,380
- Just like any other pet.

691
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,040
Just smack it if it does the wrong thing.

692
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,140
- Smack it on the nose.

693
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,020
(laughing)

694
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,260
- Imagine what kind of sick freak in the Club Penguin,

695
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,040
like, in the Club Penguin universe

696
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,660
would put peanut butter on his penis

697
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,780
and let a puffle lick it off.

698
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,620
- I don't think puffles--

699
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,180
- A dog maybe, okay, a dog I get it.

700
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,580
- A dog I understand. - It's got four legs.

701
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,420
- Yeah, that's enough.

702
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,380
- But a puffle, that thing is small.

703
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,220
- A puffle is just a--

704
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,060
- A puffle is inhuman.

705
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,820
- It's a goddamn ball, it's barely human at all.

706
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,900
- Do you guys, you get like, you see like the,

707
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,060
like people being like nostalgic about like Club Penguin

708
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,660
or something that you didn't like do

709
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,740
as a child specifically.

710
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
- That's every day with you guys.

711
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,340
- Yeah, well it's like a universal experience.

712
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,660
And then you just get so annoyed by it

713
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,840
because you were like, yeah, but when I was a kid,

714
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,180
that was like baby shit.

715
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,900
- That's how I feel about Pop Tropica and Homestar Runner.

716
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,740
- Yeah.

717
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,660
- 'Cause I never knew nothing about those.

718
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,060
- And then people are like insanely nostalgic about it

719
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,780
and you're just like, I don't, shut up about this.

720
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,660
- And I go, buddy, I was on the computer,

721
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
I was looking at pornography.

722
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,580
I'm actually, I handle it with grace and I don't even care.

723
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,020
It doesn't bother me when people talk about stuff I didn't do.

724
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
But what if somebody...

725
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,940
Make it a conversation about something I know about.

726
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,060
Do you care if people brag though?

727
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,060
I like when people brag.

728
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Oh, I have millions.

729
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Like, does that bother you?

730
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
You have a million?

731
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,300
No, because I have more.

732
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
Okay.

733
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,300
Well, yeah.

734
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300
You might be a special case then.

735
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
I have millions at least.

736
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,380
Maybe if someone said they had trillions, I'm not going to say I have more than that.

737
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
If somebody says...

738
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
But I do have billions.

739
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
I mean, I shouldn't say that.

740
00:28:51,380 --> 00:29:20,380
is

741
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,980
you're saying something that's about Myra Hindley? It's a Myra Hindley joke?

742
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
I don't know who Myra Hindley is.

743
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,420
Okay, first of all, I don't know what a

744
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,780
Hindley is and I don't know where you got yours but I don't have one either.

745
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,380
There's a Smith song about it. Oh okay, yeah, wrong crowd.

746
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,380
And there's a Brass Eye episode. What about me and this guy?

747
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,380
Brass Eye!

748
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,540
Brass I rightly is it this door and she's buying ropes to tie up a child

749
00:29:50,540 --> 00:30:00,660
Brass I don't brass eyes in God. What's making a hobbits to brass eyes?

750
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,300
Yeah, the big eye on the tower

751
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:16,380
I never understood why his eye is up there and where's the rest of his body they explain that in the new Amazon show

752
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,180
And they're gonna say yeah, that's what I like actually Patrick is fucking explanations

753
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,780
That's they said on instead of fucking mysteries of God's universe. I like the new they're gonna reveal who Sauron is in

754
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:35,220
Season two and he's gonna be exactly evil like Walter White and Tony Soprano you sour on you soured on my balls

755
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,700
You put your sour you you soured on this ghost energy warheads

756
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,500
Which is a can of flavor drink real guys look speaking of ghosts speaking of candy notes stop

757
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,840
I have a whole of it, and I just let me let me do let me handle a segue here, okay?

758
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:59,180
You hit my chin and my mic and I want to have a higher place just to

759
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:04,140
See I chipped his tooth look no your tooth got shit. He chipped my teeth

760
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,700
Okay, so now I'm completely thrown off and the episode's over.

761
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Ghost Candy.

762
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,500
Speaking of ghosts, you know, it's Halloween month.

763
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
It's October.

764
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Alright?

765
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,920
We've done, we did ghosts.

766
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,900
We did a scary story.

767
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
We did jump scares!

768
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,500
Oh, fuck you man.

769
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
We did, we did.

770
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,900
We're supposed to have 21.

771
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
What episode is this?

772
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,660
I think we did soda.

773
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,780
That's kind of a Halloween thing maybe.

774
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,940
You drink soda with your candy.

775
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,140
There's one huge Halloween thing that we've been missing out on that I've found an important

776
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,900
database to handle here, and that's candy.

777
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,060
So today I found this blog called Candy Fest Gummyville,

778
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,600
and they have an article here called

779
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,920
Top 50 Candies Everyone Needs to Try,

780
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,660
and this is under the category Candy World.

781
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,300
And I want you guys to take a look at the picture

782
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,940
of the person who runs Candy Fest Gummyville,

783
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,520
and I just wanna read you here.

784
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,320
(laughing)

785
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,980
Can you scroll up a little bit there so I can read?

786
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,480
White Keegan Michael Key.

787
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,880
But he's in a gummy candy sweatshirt and he says,

788
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm obsessed with candy.

789
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,380
You don't have to look far to see my love fest with a sugary

790
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,280
treat of started to engulf my life.

791
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,980
Once I gave up candy for a month and I almost cried when I

792
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,180
found a gummy bear on the floor.

793
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,680
I accidentally dropped days before behind the kitchen table.

794
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,780
It was as hard as rock but tempted me with his tiny gummy

795
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,180
face his super tasty tiny pineapple gummy face.

796
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,980
So here I am starting a candy block.

797
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,840
I wanted to kick it off with a Cleveland Indians logo made out of Skittles to showcase their

798
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,760
2016 championship, but obviously I had to switch my plans.

799
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Thanks Cubs.

800
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Rolls Eyes.

801
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Let's go Cubs.

802
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,940
But I couldn't decide on just one topic.

803
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
So you get 50.

804
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,780
Here's my list of 50 candies I think everyone needs to try, in no particular order.

805
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,340
And who knows, maybe it'll inspire you to turn into a gummy-loving, sweet-obsessed,

806
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,840
candy-gushing maniac too.

807
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
#High5.

808
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
I remember that World Series.

809
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,960
It was extra endings because of, there was extra endings.

810
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,980
And like a two hour rain delay.

811
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
It was a great World Series.

812
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
It was a great night.

813
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:07,780
Yeah, I was in community college and this kid was running around in like the

814
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,980
dorms that we stayed in, this kid was running around in his underwear and then

815
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,740
I went and hung out with him in his room and he was so drunk he told his

816
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:21,260
friend to punch him in the kidney as hard as he could and I got a video of it.

817
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,460
Really? Did he piss blood? He punched him in the kidney so hard and then he

818
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:35,540
passed out on the floor. Go Cubs! That's sick. Yeah I also I don't want to go into

819
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,840
what if we pause right now and go buy all of this candy? Okay we just did that.

820
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,200
All right we're back. That's just a good idea. So we'll just taste test each of

821
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,400
these as we get on the list. I don't eat candy man come on I'm not gonna eat

828
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,280
yeah number one is M&Ms mm-hmm which the other day I found out you can if you're

829
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,680
somebody is sharing your location with you, you can notify them whenever you go

830
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:27,080
to like a specific location, it'll like give like a notification. Set it up so

831
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:34,800
that my dad gets a notification whenever I go to the M&M store. So he can get like

832
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,760
send you an order basically? Yeah. Yeah. It's like if I'm ever on 1600 Broadway

833
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,920
it's like you're you're you will get a notification. Dude I will say last time I went to the M&M

834
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,960
store I got a fuck ton of M&M's and they were I was getting the key lime pie I was

835
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,720
like getting the other flavors what did they just say earlier they're pretty

836
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,880
good man what I don't it was like a year and a half ago probably the only time I

837
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,160
ate candy that's the only time yeah last time I guess that's probably the only

838
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,400
time you ever ate candy yeah but let's see there's a bunch here

839
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,720
skittles okay so kind of starting kind of kind of like he's a yeah he just was

840
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,800
thinking about hard shells. Taste the rainbow and tropical orchard spooky

841
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,560
lurking lemon anyone? And more flavors. I remember lurking lemon. I don't remember

842
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,040
lurking lemon. I don't either. I remember Liz lemon. He knows that he knows a

843
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,000
secret Skittles flavor. You're lying that you know exactly what it is. Did you

844
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,640
know there was a huge backlash when they switched from lime Skittles to sour

845
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,360
apple Skittles? Apparently the lime and lemon were too similar to some. I was in

846
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,400
favor for the switch. Sour apple for life with a Y instead of an I. I uh yeah I

847
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,680
I didn't even know that they switched the flavors

848
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,000
until there was all those commercials

849
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,920
where he's just talking about that bullshit.

850
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,800
- Right, so for this right here,

851
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,840
before we get to this one,

852
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,680
I do wanna take a little sidebar here.

853
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,160
Juli, if you go to the next tab,

854
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,900
I just wanna show you a little of this guy's background,

855
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,920
just so you understand, all the pictures on this list.

856
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,600
I wanna read you this guy's Instagram bio,

857
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,920
Candy Fest Gummyville.

858
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,200
Life is better in color.

859
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,580
All photos I snap.

860
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,200
Candy and gummy lover.

861
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,040
So he's a candy photographer.

862
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,560
- And Lancaster PA.

863
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,360
- Yeah, I wasn't gonna say where he lives,

864
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
so it's all good.

865
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,340
- Well, if anyone can find his Instagram, it's right there.

866
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,180
- So he just takes pictures of candy?

867
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
- Right, but it's kind of like you'd rather

868
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,760
to say it directly to a bunch of people.

869
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,280
He's a candy photographer.

870
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,840
- This guy is awesome.

871
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,680
- He does a pretty fucking damn good job.

872
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,320
- Candy lover, it's incredible.

873
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,440
Candy lover and gummy addict and sugar king.

874
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,240
Born and raised in PA, sharing photos of my fave treats.

875
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,080
- Oh my god.

876
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,120
- He's a, look at this.

877
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,960
- Oh wow.

878
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,720
- He does professional candy photography.

879
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,280
So I'm pretty sure all of the pictures

880
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,840
on this list that we're reading, he took.

881
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,320
- These pictures look fucking incredible.

882
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,600
- I thought these were all stock photos.

883
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
- They look like stock photos of--

884
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,080
- They're so good. - Damn.

885
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,320
- A lover of all things candy,

886
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,960
especially gummies and sour treats.

887
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,920
- He's so talented.

888
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,520
- He's extremely talented. - Candy has gummy though.

889
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,800
- But the reason I bring that up now

890
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,680
is because this next one, the picture.

891
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,640
- Oh, that's him with a peach ring.

892
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,520
- That's him holding up a peach ring.

893
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,600
And he looks terrifying like Gollum.

894
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,720
- Yeah, it does look like Gollum holding the one ring.

895
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,400
- He does not, he's not a person

896
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,640
who should ever be out of focus.

897
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,480
- Yeah, I agree. - He looks like

898
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,600
the insidious demon when he's out of focus.

899
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,520
- He looks a little bit like Epic Meal Time.

900
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,880
but it was the smallest candy meal of all time.

901
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,160
- He's the spin-off, Epic Treats Time.

902
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,680
- Having one single piece.

903
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,080
- I don't know, I like this guy now.

904
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,640
- This guy's cool, I like him too.

905
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,240
- I called him White Key, Michael Key.

906
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,080
I think he's actually--

907
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,720
- You think that's an insult, okay.

908
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,160
Yeah, you're white.

909
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,000
- Yeah.

910
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,820
- You think that's an insult, okay.

911
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,720
- If he had said he looks like Keegan-Michael Key,

912
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,640
you'd be like, yes he does, that's awesome.

913
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,480
- Yeah.

914
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,400
- But if you say white, it's like, ugh.

915
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,480
- What's wrong with being white?

916
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,080
- There's a lot of things wrong with being white.

917
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,600
There's a lot of stuff wrong with being white.

918
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:41,600
you say that? Yeah, why would you say what's wrong with being white? What do you mean?

919
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,840
Patrick, why'd you say that? Juvio, get off the white pride Wikipedia entry. You're

920
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,560
gonna start saying some weird crap if you read that. Number four, gummy bears. The

921
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,400
classic gummy delicacy, seriously, Haribo is the top-notch kind. Even come in super

922
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,440
tiny form, bottom right pick, but Albanese from Indiana, USA are also amazing.

923
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,940
- Albanese are, Albanese gummy bears are so good.

924
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,780
- Yeah.

925
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,300
- Those are, I used to be, I used to be a big Haribo ho,

926
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,840
but now I've been Albanese freak.

927
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,960
- I don't know if I've ever had them.

928
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,840
- All right, I'm an Albanese pleaser.

929
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
Albanese pleaser.

930
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,800
- Now we say Albanese pleaser.

931
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,680
- Albanese or Scrooge is my name.

932
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,520
- That's good.

933
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,340
- Yeah.

934
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,760
- Yeah, Albanese or Scrooge.

935
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,560
I've never even heard of Albanese gummy bears.

936
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,000
- Albanese gummy, if you can find them,

937
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,320
I usually see them at like, they're like the TJ Maxx snacks.

938
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,840
I usually see them at nonsense stores.

939
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,200
You know like the TJ Maxx snacks that you can find

940
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,320
that are like, it's like--

941
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,920
Yeah, stuff that you can get when you check out?

942
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
These are like a dark chocolate pretzel.

943
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,740
Oh, yeah.

944
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,720
Like MILF snacks.

945
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
I do know that.

946
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,960
Yeah, they're like Trader Joe's type thing.

947
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,800
Trader Joe's candy.

948
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,720
Trader Joe's is like one rung below--

949
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,120
MILF chow, that's what you're talking about.

950
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,720
Yeah, one rung below MILF chow.

951
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,560
Yeah, MILF chow.

952
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,200
Which are all of the snacks at TJ Maxx

953
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,740
that are like truffle potato chips.

954
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,660
- It's dark chocolate stuff for milfs to chow on.

955
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,260
- Yeah, like a dove.

956
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,220
- Yeah. - What are you signing?

957
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,340
- Go back to the list, Julio.

958
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,300
- Yeah, what are you doing?

959
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,460
- You have to stay on that. - Don't buy it.

960
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,860
- You have to stay on the-- - Chicken feet.

961
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,180
- They taste like heaven blended with cherry lemonade.

962
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,340
Seriously, so good.

963
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,220
- I agree, those look great. - Look at these.

964
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,860
- Yeah, those look--

965
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,900
- I don't like them against the green background.

966
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,060
- No, but those do look tasty.

967
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,500
- I've never heard of those before.

968
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,340
- God damn it, dude.

969
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,520
But there must try I'm straight up I've got a sweet tooth like this guy and this list is making my mouth water

970
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,760
Some of these candies I really want

971
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,000
All right, let me put my finger in your mouth to check it's watering

972
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:52,440
Number six is airheads, but what actually is the mystery flavor? That's a good question. I thought it was just random

973
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,180
No, the mystery flavor of that's the lollipops. That's what yeah, yeah like dum-dums. Yeah, dum-dums. I'm looking at you right now

974
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,560
Yeah, I'm looking at I'm between two dum-dums right now. Yeah, I'm between two dum-dums, too

975
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,980
What do you you're there's you are the right dum-dum? I'm between two dum-dums, buddy, okay?

976
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,020
We're look actually you guys are stupid because you don't realize the earth goes all the way around

977
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,200
I've really I really so actually right now Patrick is behind me. No. He's not yeah

978
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,040
He is if you go all the way that way he's straight up behind me. That is true. That's kind of scary

979
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,840
Yeah, oh my god. He's blue you blew my mind. He is behind you technically if he looks that way

980
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,880
He's looking at your back because of the round don't look at my back. What do you say stop?

981
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,720
He's looking at my dog and trying to lick on it get it's way too far away to look in that direction

982
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,580
You know how big his tongue is what have you measured it gay? Yep? I measured it

983
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:48,640
Hershey's kiss and yeah, you know what the cherry quartz the ones are to die for I haven't had those in so long read this

984
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,000
this paragraph here. Also, one time my friend dressed up as a Hershey's Kiss at

985
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,200
Hershey's Park. Oh, summer job memories in high school and was rolled down a hill by a Kiss.

986
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,920
I think about it each time I eat one. Always hilarious. I also love that this guy worked at

987
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,360
Hershey Park in high school. He's been on, he's been, Candy has been his life, his entire life.

988
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,600
Look, I used to think the Candyman was a horror character. Now I think that the Candyman

989
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,600
is an awesome, is an awesome guy. I love this guy. This guy's awesome.

990
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,100
Yeah.

991
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,680
Um, number eight is Wilbur Buds.

992
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,280
These sound crazy.

993
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,240
Wilbur Buds.

994
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,160
Hershey gets all the love in PA, but Wilbur Buds are arguably even better.

995
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,400
Try these ASAP.

996
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,720
Plus, if you ever visit Lilitz, PA, a super cool-

997
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,480
Lititz.

998
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,280
Lititz.

999
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,840
Lititz.

1000
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,440
Lititz.

1001
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,080
Come on, man.

1002
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,840
Super cool town.

1003
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,320
They have a new store.

1004
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,280
Rage comics vibe.

1005
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,800
Yeah.

1006
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,760
My girlfriend showing me Lititz.

1007
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,560
Kit Kats.

1008
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,400
What is a Wilbur Bud?

1009
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,880
That seems like a euphemism for something on a pig.

1010
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
That's uh, this is what...

1011
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Wilbur?

1012
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Oh, never mind.

1013
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,240
I was gonna say this is what Wilfred Brimley ate that gave him diabetes, but then I remembered

1014
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,720
his name is Wilford and not Wilbur.

1015
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
Wilfred Bud.

1016
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Wilfred, yeah.

1017
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,680
If it was a Wilfred Bud, hey, I would have had to...

1018
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
You're thinking of Wilfred's...

1019
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
I would have had a whole lot of a joke.

1020
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,680
You're thinking of Wilfred's Bane.

1021
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Ah, yeah.

1022
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,680
Wilfred's Bane, which is still sugar.

1023
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,480
Number nine is Kit Kats.

1024
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,000
There's something special about this candy.

1025
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,840
Side note, it was my favorite candy bar to impersonate at Hershey Park.

1026
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,440
Again, summer job at its finest.

1027
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,040
Kit Kats in America.

1028
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,720
This guy also is so into candy that when he dresses up as candy, it's not dressing up

1029
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,400
as it, it's impersonating it.

1030
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,520
He's like doing a Michael Jackson tribute show.

1031
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Almost.

1032
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,040
God damn, he doesn't just look like a Kit Kat, he fucking moves like one.

1033
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,280
Look at that, he's got everything right down to his...

1034
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,880
Look, he just gave that guy a break.

1035
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh my God, he's snapping off left and right.

1036
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,880
This guy goes up to people dressed as candy and does Stolen Valor stuff too.

1037
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,380
(laughter)

1038
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,460
- What flavor are you?

1039
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,500
(laughter)

1040
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,000
What factory were you made in?

1041
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,660
- Number 10 is nerds, and I'm between two nerds.

1042
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,620
- I'm between two nerds too.

1043
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,460
- We are--

1044
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,500
- Hey look, if--

1045
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,340
- I actually am between a nerd,

1046
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,780
this guy has a theory about the earth.

1047
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,940
- If you're around me, nerds are in the vicinity.

1048
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,260
Classic.

1049
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,100
- I don't get it.

1050
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,540
- That Nick Cannon video.

1051
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,660
- Oh yeah.

1052
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,340
- I consider myself to be a member of the Wonka family.

1053
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,420
And when you think about the meaning of the word nerds,

1054
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,020
That's a perfect video.

1055
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,540
It's a really good video.

1056
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,380
Remember when you get those little boxes with two flavors

1057
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,660
and you just dump them in your mouth,

1058
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,060
but then your spit would make the box all wonky?

1059
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,660
And you'd be all, it's falling apart

1060
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,260
and nerds are falling into the cracks.

1061
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,700
Hashtag candy props.

1062
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,340
I know exactly what he's talking about.

1063
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,340
You get your spit all over the nerds box?

1064
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,180
What the fuck are you talking about?

1065
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,540
You put the fucking nerds box like this

1066
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,460
and you're trying to like shake it in.

1067
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,940
And your spit shoots up like a fountain into the box.

1068
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,340
What the hell are you two talking about?

1069
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
No, I don't understand.

1070
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
No, these two.

1071
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
The computer and him.

1072
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,420
Look, if you were a real candy fan, you'd know.

1073
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,700
You just pour them, you didn't pour them into your hands?

1074
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
You were pouring them directly into your mouth?

1075
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
Like a fucking...

1076
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,540
Pouring them directly into the mouth because I got the two...

1077
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,940
You're feeding yourself like a fucking fish?

1078
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,940
Yeah.

1079
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,940
Put it in your, just put it in your hand.

1080
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,940
Hey, hey.

1081
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,740
The thing about being a candy fan is sometimes you get to pretend that you're a different

1082
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,200
animal and you're eating the candy like it's like fish food.

1083
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,740
I don't think I would ever pour the nerds directly into my mouth.

1084
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,740
This is how to eat them.

1085
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,740
This is a video on how to eat nerds.

1086
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,740
See, this is what I do.

1087
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,740
This is what you would do. You'd chug it like a Gatorade.

1088
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

1089
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,740
Pour it in your hand.

1090
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Shake it like a rich guy and like pop it.

1091
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,740
Yes. That's how you're supposed to eat it.

1092
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,740
Next is Reese's.

1093
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,740
I do like Reese's.

1094
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,740
Reese's Pieces, Reese's Cups.

1095
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,740
Nut-rageous. Get in my belly.

1096
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,740
Did you see these new Reese's Pieces?

1097
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,740
Did you see these new Reese's Pieces

1098
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,740
stuff comes yet? Also, it's Reese's Pieces, not PCs.

1099
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,740
Well, he wrote it as, "It's Reese's PCs, not PCs."

1100
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,740
Oh yeah, and honestly, Reese's Sticks are probably the most underrated Reese's products.

1101
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,740
They're amazing.

1102
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,740
Oh yeah, Reese's Sticks existed.

1103
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,740
I've never heard of a Reese's Stick.

1104
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,740
Those are so good.

1105
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,740
You really are a candy guy.

1106
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,740
Yeah.

1107
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,740
This is fucking crazy. You know all these candies, man.

1108
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,740
Number 12 is Ring Pops.

1109
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,740
The only one I did know was Wilbur Buds.

1110
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,740
Yeah.

1111
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,740
And I will be trying them.

1112
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:14,060
them. Ring pop says candy bling check. Number 13 is a whirly pop this is I don't know

1113
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,260
this one oh yeah I do what am I talking about I know this one. He took a photo again he

1114
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,980
decided to insert himself. He looks so he's where he looks like he's wearing

1115
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,620
the Robert Pattinson Batman makeup. I think he's allowed to insert himself

1116
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,900
with the candy. Oh 100% so I just wish he would he would not make that face. This

1117
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,940
is the one that's just a face of excitement. This is one of those big

1118
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,420
spiral lollipops. That's the face of a podling being drained of energy in the dark crystal.

1119
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,860
That's so mean. This is one of those lollipops that gets stolen from babies. But I don't know

1120
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,340
why anyone would ever want to eat one of these. No, they're pretty gross. They're the worst candy.

1121
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:53,580
Yeah, they're really bad. But you do have to try it. These are the ones you must try. These are

1122
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,580
not as favorites, these are must tries. And I will say, even though these suck, you should have one

1123
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,740
once in your life. Hey, I sucked on one and I hated it. I feel like these always get stolen out of

1124
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,460
of your hands. This is also this is the one that you learn instantly as a kid.

1125
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,620
You see, I think you see it in the candy store and you go, Oh my God, I want that.

1126
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,060
Yeah, you get it once you lick it. You're like, this is disgusting and you're

1127
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,580
gonna never get it again in the cartoons. Yeah, yeah, the TV doesn't. Yeah,

1128
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,540
tastes like I'm gonna be like, Hey, I'm gonna feel exactly like a kid. Kids. A

1129
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,620
kid can jump off the roof 10 times and not and get hurt every time and still do

1130
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,860
it. But you get one one whirly pop and you will never get it again. Yeah,

1131
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,120
that's true yeah number 14 is Smarties the white ones are so good and I have no

1132
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,000
idea why I want all of the white ones hook me up Smarties you know in Canada

1133
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,640
Smarties are chocolate he's actually right the white the don't wait for

1134
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,840
anything he's back Juvia's back on the white pride with it off that page it's a

1135
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,560
different that's a different it has nothing to do with Smarties yeah and I'll

1136
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,040
say those guys yeah yeah I'll say those white pride not dumb dumb they're

1137
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,160
definitely no Smarties in that bunch are quite a bit of dummies

1138
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,640
Jolly Ranchers. This guy is right though, the white Smarties are the only good ones. I love

1139
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,880
Smarties. I think Smarties are at top tier candy. Nah, just only the white ones. I don't

1140
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,800
really care what you have to say about candy. I don't know if they're top tier candy. I

1141
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,600
really, really like Smarties. Yeah, you don't care what he has to say, but trust me, you

1142
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,040
come to me with that shit. And what? I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna put you in your place.

1143
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,400
Put me in what place? I'm the candy man. Alright, I'm gonna see a debate on Smarties. I think

1144
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,900
they're really tasty and I like their texture. You like their texture? Hey buddy

1145
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,280
how about you go eat a piece of sidewalk chalk? Because it doesn't taste like

1146
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,880
Smarties. Okay he counterpointed now you need to... What if they made sidewalk

1147
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:42,840
chalk taste like Smarties? Probably eat it. I've been bested.

1148
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:49,320
I've been bested in the field of intellectual debate. That's fucking incredible. I cannot

1149
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,000
believe you guys squashed that. Number 15 Jolly Ranchers. I love a rancher.

1150
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,160
Yeah, I haven't met church. I just fucking pop them in I pop for at a time watermelon Jolly Rancher

1151
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,360
Did you know that these are the most popular candies out there always a top-seller and for good reason number 16 zero zero

1152
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,360
I

1153
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,680
Fucking hate

1154
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,260
Rolls when I live in when I lived in Boston I

1155
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:21,200
Lived like four blocks away from a Tootsie Roll factory so every day. I would what yeah

1156
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,580
So I was in Cambridge as a Tootsie Roll factory. You never told me that

1157
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:31,320
Why would it matter to you? Patrick, I live four blocks away from the Tootsie Roll factory just so you know

1158
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
They before you come over

1159
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,280
You can't they don't do tours and actually they have like 16 armed guards

1160
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,380
They don't do tours or anything

1161
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,600
But if you if you save all the Tootsie Rub if you find the Native American with the star

1162
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,800
If you save all of those and you give them to them

1163
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,040
I think they give you like a t-shirt, and I had a bunch of them

1164
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,700
What the fuck are you talking about Native American with a star on the tootsie roll wrapper?

1165
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,880
I know what he's talking about. I've never heard of this pop rapper. Yeah, I know that I tootsie pop

1166
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,200
I didn't know he's talking about and if you save up and I always wanted this shirt if you saved up

1167
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,680
20 dum-dum wrappers, and you like sent them in

1168
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,840
You got a t-shirt with the dum-dum logo on it, and it's a little it's a little pop guy listen. I

1169
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,480
Didn't do that because I didn't know that you were so weird at the time that you would want to go just sit outside

1170
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,600
You didn't know me that well back. I'll throw rappers at a factory and say give me give me a t-shirt

1171
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,120
Give me a t-shirt that would I would love I think I would love a tootsie roll

1172
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,800
I think you would've been shot on sight

1173
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:35,240
But anyway, I would every day that I would like I would be so hungover and I'd be waking up at 6 in the morning

1174
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,280
to go work at

1175
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,920
folding towels at the gym job that I had and

1176
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,280
And I would have to walk in proximity to this Tootsie Roll factory,

1177
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,840
and the smell was so fucking disgusting that it just drove me crazy.

1178
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,080
Yeah.

1179
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,080
And I just can't, I'll never have one again.

1180
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,040
They were never good in the first place. Those are always terrible.

1181
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,080
Number 17 is Gobstoppers. Don't bite them right away. Just don't do it.

1182
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,320
But they taste so good. So many layers.

1183
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,440
Wonka is definitely the best maker of candy.

1184
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,960
I'm actually with you. I think fictional Wonka is really good, but not

1185
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,120
real life. Oh my god. This guy forgot what the fucking entry was. Yeah. Number 18, whatchamacallit.

1186
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,640
You've had a whatchamacallit? No. Yeah. Oh my god. They're so good. Every time I went to the

1187
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,640
pool growing up I would get one of these at the snack bar. They were from the

1188
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,080
freezer. Definitely freeze these. Do a frozen whatchamacallit. Oh my god, wait. I have to read this

1189
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,360
next one. I'm sorry. I just saw something here. Number 19, Jelly Belly Beans. My grandpa, one of

1190
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,400
the best people in the world, just FYI, and I get a 40 flavor box and transform

1191
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,400
into mixing beans recipe extraordinaires. I was also part of the Jelly Belly Taste

1192
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,200
Bud Club when I was little. Yes, that was a thing. I'd get sneak preview flavor packs in

1193
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,140
the mail and everything. Also, Dr. Pepper Jelly Belly Beans. Nuff said. And he has a photo

1194
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,800
of Dr. Pepper Jelly Belly Beans.

1195
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,000
That photo is great.

1196
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,240
Second of all, the Dr. Pepper Jelly Belly Beans and the Snapple ones are so fucking good.

1197
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,000
This fucking guy has been in the game so long.

1198
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,080
This guy is the candy king.

1199
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,120
And he's a mixing beans recipe extraordinaire.

1200
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh my god! He transformed into a mixing beans recipe extraordinaire with his grandpa.

1201
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,720
He was one of the best people in the world.

1202
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,120
Number 20 is grapefruit gummies. His grandpa Joe. I do like these.

1203
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,320
Oh my gosh. These are probably my favorite ones.

1204
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,920
The Haribo fruit salad. Any kind of fruit flavored gummy with a sour thing on it.

1205
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:33,320
Those are good. Haribo fruit salad is a slept on bodega snack.

1206
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,720
I'm gonna sleep on you. You're gonna be my... You better not. You will be my bed in four hours.

1207
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:43,160
I will be duct taping you to the ground and sleeping on you. Number 21, pop rocks. You know,

1208
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,880
not my favorite. What was the... Pop rocks are... It's a fun... It's a novelty. Yeah.

1209
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,040
He's... Always fun. These are never not fun. I'm 28 and they're still so fun. True.

1210
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,200
The myth... What do you mean they're still so... Are you like picking up a pack of these on the

1211
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,200
way home with like... It's been a long day at work. That's what I do when I have pop rocks.

1212
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,880
I gotta throw back a pop rocks. There's a myth in the 70s that a kid drank a coke

1213
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,800
with pop rocks in his mouth and he died. And his head exploded. Yeah, his stomach exploded.

1214
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,200
That's what I heard. There's a bunch of different versions I think. And then

1215
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,640
that then it was crazy that that turned out to be true about Mentos and Coke.

1216
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,160
Yeah, that it kills you. I don't think it kills you. It doesn't kill you, but it kills you.

1217
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,480
It makes an alien come out of you. Oh wow. Well I'm just saying like, like it was

1218
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,080
like oh yeah pop rocks and coke is just a myth and then like finding out like from

1219
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,520
YouTube that like oh yeah they'd stuff actually it makes a candy with coke it

1220
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,560
well there yeah one candy but they were just off yeah I don't think it'll make

1221
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,880
your head explode it will make your head explode with soda in it so it will come

1222
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:50,000
out your ears Oh so you poured soda and Mentos in your brain that might know you

1223
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,400
pour it into your mouth if you have holes in your mouth that go up to your

1224
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,640
brain it might go on your brain yeah yeah that makes complete sense I don't

1225
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,000
I don't think Coke's gonna come out of your ears.

1226
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,440
I think it'll come out of your mouth.

1227
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,140
The throat and ears are connected.

1228
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,040
But I don't think, I think it's gonna come out of your mouth.

1229
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,520
The throat and ears are connected though.

1230
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,720
You're useless.

1231
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,840
If your mouth is closed, it might come out of your ears.

1232
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,000
Number 22 is flavored candy canes.

1233
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,040
I do like these.

1234
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,760
These are always, oh, speaking of.

1235
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,120
These are always in the light.

1236
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,760
The Sour Patch Kids candy canes.

1237
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,320
He mentions them right there.

1238
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,280
Those are the best.

1239
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,520
All right, so candy canes are a staple of the holidays.

1240
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,800
minty, cool, Christmas-y, but flavored candy canes

1241
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,160
are literally the best version of this holiday tradition.

1242
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,720
Sweet Tart candy canes, Sour Patch Kid candy canes,

1243
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,920
you name it, sign me up.

1244
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,760
- The red one?

1245
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,160
- And right now they're hitting stores.

1246
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,080
Also just saw Trolley has a version.

1247
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,160
What?

1248
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,000
- Damn.

1249
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,960
- What?

1250
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,720
- A gummy candy cane sounds good.

1251
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,560
- You wanna--

1252
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,880
- Trolley has been--

1253
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,680
- I was in a laundromat and the--

1254
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,840
- I wish it was a candy store.

1255
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,140
- I wish this was a candy store right now.

1256
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,840
I was doing my laundry and the Chinese guy who runs the laundromat,

1257
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,500
he's watching a video on his phone in Chinese. Um, and it had that,

1258
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,180
you know, the like YouTube video editing where it just cuts to short clip,

1259
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,680
like reaction clips of like clips from movies and stuff.

1260
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,700
He's watching something that was completely in Chinese,

1261
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,760
but literally every like three to five seconds, it just played the Lil Jon.

1262
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,080
What? Like really loud.

1263
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:19,480
Oh wait. I think I know that's they do. There's a foodie,

1264
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,000
foodie China 88 on Instagram.

1265
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,400
Is it in Chinese?

1266
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,040
I mean, it's not the one I watched, but it's like,

1267
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,480
was it like a cooking video?

1268
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,520
I was only heard the eye.

1269
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,160
I wasn't up over his shoulder watching his video.

1270
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,800
Every couple of seconds, he'll do like,

1271
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,840
like he says, like, give the food a Thai massage,

1272
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,040
mix it with water from the Mississippi River,

1273
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,160
mix in evil chicken bouillon, and they'll go, what?

1274
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,000
Maybe that was it.

1275
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yeah, I think I've seen this video.

1276
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,220
(laughing)

1277
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,600
Number 23, peppermint patties.

1278
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,040
Love peppermint patties. Not for me.

1279
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,600
I love peppermint patties.

1280
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
No, thank you.

1281
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,600
Peppermint patties are so good.

1282
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,360
Well, he's patty and you're definitely a peppermint in your attitude.

1283
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,880
Number 24, Buckeyes candy.

1284
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
Uh-huh.

1285
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,880
Never had these.

1286
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,040
O-H, even Michigan fans have to admit these chocolate peanut butter candies are way better

1287
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,360
than anything a Wolverine candy could be.

1288
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,360
#Amiright.

1289
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:13,720
You did a little Ohio State photo shoot there.

1290
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,160
In dirt pudding or a road trip snack, sour or sweet.

1291
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,840
So many options, but you have to go with Trolli Worms.

1292
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:24,680
has been doing some crazy things with gummy worms lately. I don't know if you guys remember

1293
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:30,160
the neon bursters? Oh, the bursting crawlers? And the crunchy ones? The crunchy worms were

1294
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,800
pretty good. The crunchy worms, I have had a bite of those. Oh, Paige not found. Who

1295
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,000
was that beautiful woman? That beautiful character. Number 26 is Dum Dums, classic lolly, tons

1296
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,540
of flavors. Yeah, I'm between a couple of Dum Dums right now. Come on. I'm also between

1297
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:49,440
some Dum Dums. I'm between a Mike and an Ike right now. Yeah. Number 27 is Mike and Ike's.

1298
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,760
Mike and Ike's mega mix.

1299
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,600
You can kind of tell he's--

1300
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,440
The sour one.

1301
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,260
That song.

1302
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,680
The blue pack.

1303
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,060
That shit was good.

1304
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,520
I'm snacking on that blue pack.

1305
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,360
Snacking on that blue pack.

1306
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,000
You can tell he's kind of running out of energy

1307
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,680
with this list, 'cause he used to be writing a paragraph

1308
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,360
about each one, and now they all just are just one sentence

1309
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,200
of what the candy is.

1310
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,280
Well, if you know--

1311
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,840
He needs to candy up.

1312
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,080
If you got a sugar rush--

1313
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,080
Yeah, if you got a sugar rush,

1314
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,920
eventually you're gonna crash.

1315
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,880
He's crashing right now.

1316
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,240
Yeah, 'cause then we got Starburst,

1317
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,280
and he just says, "Let's be honest,

1318
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,320
"these are the coolest candies.

1319
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,700
"Also, did you see the gummy versions?

1320
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,300
get them now. The gummy versions were disgusting. I had terrible. No, those are

1321
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,340
the one of the recent gummy drops. Those are the new, those are the air ones. Oh,

1322
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,660
those are terrible. Yeah, those are different. Those are bad. Okay. I'm

1323
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,340
realizing every candy I've had in the last three years has been something that

1324
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:43,380
you've handed me. For the most part, me too. I have not had any candy that I've bought for like years. It's only been him coming in and being like, try this and put something in my mouth.

1325
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,980
I think the only candy I bought is probably those Starburst gummies.

1326
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,300
I'm just an adult man who eats candy.

1327
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,300
You really are.

1328
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,420
Oh, I had some Sour Patch Kids recently.

1329
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,420
When was the last time you had steak?

1330
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,700
Oh, I couldn't tell you.

1331
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,700
Probably never.

1332
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,260
You eat candy.

1333
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:04,500
No, I've had carne asada, if that counts.

1334
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,500
I think the last time I...

1335
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,740
I mean like a meat and potatoes meal.

1336
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,740
Like I cooked myself a steak.

1337
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,740
With no candy.

1338
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,940
Last time I cooked myself a steak.

1339
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,940
Sure.

1340
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:19,940
November 2021. So not that long ago. Yeah. A year ago. But when was the last time you ate candy?

1341
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:27,860
Like yesterday. What'd you have? What'd you have? I had a Reese's cup.

1342
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:33,380
And what, so what makes you... I bought a two pack. What makes you, when you're at the store,

1343
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:40,260
what compels you to buy the candy? I'd say to myself, I haven't had candy in a little while.

1344
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:48,500
I've been good about it because I saw a dentist and they were like, "Yeah, you're like, you

1345
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:55,060
have the only reason..." They told me the only reason I have cavities is because I grind

1346
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,060
my teeth.

1347
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,940
And not the candy that you buy all the time.

1348
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,940
I didn't tell them about the candy.

1349
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,500
When they ask how often you eat candy. So they must think that you're in there just fucking...

1350
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,500
I think they usually don't ask that to adults. I don't think that's a question that they ask

1351
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,500
a guy who comes in.

1352
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,980
How often do your parents let you eat candy?

1353
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,180
Dressed in real tree.

1354
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:14,680
True.

1355
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,180
They're probably going to ask you how many times a week you

1356
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,060
eat candy, even though it's probably three.

1357
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,560
Yeah.

1358
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,220
I think I do.

1359
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,980
I think I will say maybe three times a week I will get a candy.

1360
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,480
Yeah.

1361
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,540
And I'm obsessed with gummies.

1362
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,300
If it's a small serving, I think it's fine.

1363
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,740
I think you do you.

1364
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,180
I think it's OK to do whatever you want.

1365
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,180
You know, I have a--

1366
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,580
I'm realizing my candy is that I do--

1367
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,640
I'll get one of those Oikos Greek yogurts every once in a while.

1368
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,480
That's my candy.

1369
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,980
And then every once in a while I'll have one piece of a dark chocolate bar before

1370
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,340
I go to bed and it keeps me up all night.

1371
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,140
The worst thing, I like ice cream. That's my candy.

1372
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,500
The worst kind of thing I,

1373
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,780
the worst thing that I ever picked up at the store and I realized that I needed

1374
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,860
to stop eating so much candy was I bought a Ruby

1375
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:04,220
chocolate bar, like a, it's like a red chocolate.

1376
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:07,500
And it had, it was like with guava filling.

1377
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,940
- Yeah, those are bad. - Or passion fruit.

1378
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,380
- The red chocolate is bad.

1379
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,940
- Red chocolate with passion fruit in the middle.

1380
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,100
- I've never even heard of red chocolate.

1381
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,460
- Ruby chocolate.

1382
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,740
- I was like, oh man, this is not good, one.

1383
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,660
And two, I'm a candy freak.

1384
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,260
- You're a male candy addict.

1385
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,500
- I'm an adult candy addict.

1386
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,620
- You're skipping ahead a little bit.

1387
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,980
31 is Hershey's bar, one word, classic.

1388
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,740
- I just love a normal Hershey's bar.

1389
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,820
- Now I wanna read 32 is Turkish Delight.

1390
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,660
- I love Turkish Delight.

1391
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,500
- I haven't had this.

1392
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,160
- Just tasted this candy this year.

1393
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,400
Now I know why Edmund was so tempted to destroy his family to get an unlimited supply of this.

1394
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
If you don't get that reference, I'm disappointed.

1395
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,840
Dude, I was such a fucking CS Lewis superfan that for four years in a row I asked for Turkish

1396
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
Delight for Christmas.

1397
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,840
I had the box set.

1398
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,840
I had the box set.

1399
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,840
I had the box set.

1400
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
I had the box set.

1401
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,440
It does come in a box.

1402
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,440
It's really good.

1403
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,880
Dude, take five is the perfect candy bar.

1404
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,200
Take five and Baby Ruth.

1405
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,680
Those are two very underrated ones, yeah.

1406
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,000
Sweetest first, that's gotta be the worst candy ever made.

1407
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I like Swedish fish. It's terrible.

1408
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
They see said they're going on.

1409
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
He said I never had a candy that tasted so

1410
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
unique. So this is a

1411
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
candy expert. He says it's at least unique.

1412
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Cadbury eggs. This is a

1413
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Halloween episode. We don't care about Cadbury eggs.

1414
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Easter food. Warheads.

1415
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I like Warheads. I drank a Warheads

1416
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
thing. I like Warheads. Red

1417
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
cherry slices. It's a picture of him with his

1418
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
grandpa. It says my grandpa and I would sit

1419
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and eat these while watching baseball

1420
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
in Ohio. That's so sweet.

1421
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,280
Alright, well leave your fucking...

1422
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Peachy Penguins!

1423
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,600
How about you, B? Try being a little bit, just like, I don't know,

1424
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,400
why is he bringing all his personal shit into this?

1425
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,840
Stop going so fucking fast, Juvia!

1426
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,640
Stop! Yeah.

1427
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,360
What's wrong with you?

1428
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,120
I'm scrolling.

1429
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,840
Go back to Peachy Penguins!

1430
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,040
I said Peachy Penguins!

1431
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,080
I want to learn about these!

1432
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,720
Patrick, read about Peachy Penguins for us.

1433
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,240
Love these! You don't understand.

1434
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,400
They are peach-flavored.

1435
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,320
I know they're black and white, that makes no sense.

1436
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,800
They are peach-flavored and they're absolutely delicious.

1437
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,280
Try them ASAP.

1438
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,040
I don't think I will do either.

1439
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,240
I don't think I will either.

1440
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,680
I want that candy so bad.

1441
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,680
Orange Tic Tacs.

1442
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,680
Orange Tic Tacs, I can't handle them.

1443
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,520
One time I got in trouble at a summer job

1444
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,440
because I ate all the orange Tic Tacs.

1445
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,160
They were supposed to be used as breath mints

1446
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,360
for all employees.

1447
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,800
I ate the whole thing in the first hour of my shift.

1448
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,880
Also, I used to get these in my stocking at Christmas

1449
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,120
and it was the best.

1450
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:19,960
Yeah, these are not breath mints.

1451
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,080
I completely relate to that.

1452
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,160
Yeah, I forgot how much I love those.

1453
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,000
They are really good.

1454
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,160
Tic Tacs are good.

1455
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,480
Fun Dip.

1456
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,240
Lindor White Chocolate, come on now.

1457
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,080
Yeah, shut up dude.

1458
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:29,920
Actually, you know what?

1459
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,320
I don't hate white chocolate as much

1460
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,340
as much as everybody else says.

1461
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:38,340
I can enjoy a white chocolate and macadamia is pretty good.

1462
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,340
I really don't like white chocolate.

1463
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,340
I might eat some candy today.

1464
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:44,840
I think white chocolate, it can be like a tiny chip in a cookie I guess, but anything that's

1465
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,900
made out of white chocolate I think is disgusting.

1466
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,540
But like if you ate a whole brick of white chocolate that's...

1467
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,660
I actually might like that, yeah, now that I think about that.

1468
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,660
I've never tried a brick.

1469
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,740
Remember the Cookies and Cream Hershey's bar?

1470
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:55,740
No.

1471
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,100
You haven't?

1472
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,180
Go try that.

1473
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,500
Those were bad, I didn't like those.

1474
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Those were terrible.

1475
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Yeah, those were terrible.

1476
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:07,260
I'm gonna say my knowledge of candy, probably anything that came out past 2009, I don't

1477
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,260
know about.

1478
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,260
Yeah.

1479
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:13,580
The Cookies and Cream Hershey's bars, I ate too many of them as a kid, and now when I

1480
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,540
think about that flavor, I want to puke.

1481
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,260
Why?

1482
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,260
You don't like candy.

1483
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:24,260
I think the Cookies and Cream Hershey's thing also made me want to puke as a kid.

1484
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,260
Yeah.

1485
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,260
It's too sweet.

1486
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,220
It's specifically a puke-making flavor.

1487
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,380
Is it just really sweet?

1488
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,520
Yeah, you can go get them at the bodega, whatever.

1489
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,720
All right, let's split one, man.

1490
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,320
Oh, you know what they do have now?

1491
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,640
It's making me crave candy so much.

1492
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,520
A blueberry muffin Kit Kat.

1493
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,360
Is it good?

1494
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,180
It's so good.

1495
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,760
Hubba Bubba gum, I got that in my hair when I was five,

1496
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,280
and my mom had to cut all my hair off.

1497
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,400
What?

1498
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,680
I ate a whole thing of Hubba Bubba,

1499
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,280
and then I was trying to get it.

1500
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,200
You know the bubble tape?

1501
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,640
I do love Pez.

1502
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,640
I love Pez.

1503
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,480
Number 47, Pixie Stix.

1504
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,540
"My mom wouldn't let me have these until at least 15, I swear.

1505
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,280
"Some family choking problem.

1506
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,320
"Not that that would ever happen to me or anything.

1507
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:10,960
"#almostdiedwheniwas22 #oncherrygummies #onherbirthday #babyshewasright"

1508
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,020
- Wait, he almost died from a cherry gummy and he lists cherry gummies as, like, 47?

1509
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,620
What the f-- wait, wait, did we--

1510
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,120
And he didn't mention this in the cherry gummies thing?

1511
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,720
He just said, "I ate these with my grandpa when we watched baseball in Ohio!"

1512
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,920
- Maybe he skipped over it.

1513
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,320
Hold on, scroll back. - No, no, no, no, that's all he said.

1514
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,980
Do not tell Juby to scroll anywhere.

1515
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,360
- All right.

1516
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,280
- Dude, I wanna hear that story.

1517
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,640
He ruined his mom's birthday by choking on candy?

1518
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,520
- Dots, dude.

1519
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,360
- Dots are terrible.

1520
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,560
- Dots are so good, what are you talking about?

1521
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,600
- Spree is good.

1522
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,080
- Spree is really good.

1523
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:41,920
- That's a really great candy.

1524
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,320
- I'm glad we can agree on that.

1525
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,280
I'm glad we saw Spree's after.

1526
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,840
- At the end of the list, what did you think?

1527
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,480
Is this all the best candy ever?

1528
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,480
What did I miss?

1529
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,140
Hope you enjoy my candy ramblings.

1530
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,160
Seriously though, go get these delicious treats.

1531
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,160
- You know what I will say?

1532
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,120
and total world candy domination.

1533
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,460
- I will say what he missed,

1534
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,000
and going back on the I like white chocolate sometimes,

1535
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,840
if it's done right. - Yeah, I mean,

1536
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,320
you two with this guy,

1537
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,080
I think you two could together create an amazing list,

1538
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,280
'cause you're both kind of candy monsters.

1539
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,120
- Candy men. - Candyaholics.

1540
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:10,940
- Yeah.

1541
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,860
- But a zero bar, white chocolate nougat,

1542
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,700
some kind of like fudge on the inside.

1543
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,940
- You know the ingredients to the candy bars?

1544
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,240
- Yeah. - Yeah, that's dangerous.

1545
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,920
- Yeah, it says it on the label.

1546
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,560
- So if you want one of each of these candies,

1547
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,360
you can come to the Halloween live show

1548
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,280
where we'll be giving out one of each of the candies

1549
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,480
we just said. - Oh my God, it's time to be real.

1550
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,000
- I know it is, but I'm trying to do the thing here.

1551
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,040
But yeah, go buy tickets to the Halloween show,

1552
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,880
swagpoop.com/shows.

1553
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,920
And yeah, I think that's basically it, right?

1554
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,080
Anything else?

1555
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:50,540
- You can come to my house if you need somewhere to be.

1556
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,460
- Oh, go to the candy store.

1557
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,060
Yeah, the candy store is open.

1558
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:56,560
Bye.

1559
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,060
All right.
