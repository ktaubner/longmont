[laughter]

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300
Okay, I'm recording too.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,300
It's really easy.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,300
The whole, everything's easy.

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,800
Me and Pat are in the flesh.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,100
You should make sure that you guys, you can be heard.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,000
You should look at the audacity waveform while you're talking

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and make sure it's actually loud enough.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,760
I think you probably gotta get closer.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,520
Yeah, I think I'm good too.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
I think this is...

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
Yeah, so Caleb and Pat are in the same room.

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,800
They're sitting side by side.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,400
No, I'm sitting on Patrick like a beanbag chair.

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,120
Yeah, he's sitting on my lap like it's Christmas.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Yeah.

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,920
Pat's got a fupa full of beans.

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
It's like the tauntaun from Star Wars 5.

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,040
It's actually like the tun-tun.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Which is actually like a bon-bon.

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,960
How many pounds Patrick weighs?

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Come on, Patrick.

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,960
This sucks.

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Alright, well look it then, right off the bat, Jexy2, read it to us, let's go.

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,960
No, I, I, um...

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,960
No, you said you were gonna write Jexy2 for this episode.

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,960
We're gonna hear a Jexy2 script.

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,960
That's what this whole episode's gonna be.

33
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Okay, interior.

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,960
No, no, no, no, no, Patrick said he was gonna write it.

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Patrick has to say it.

36
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
I told you, I told you that it's not ready.

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Patrick has to talk for an hour. You did not say that.

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
I told you it's not ready.

39
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
You said, "I'm going to write Jexy2 and I'm gonna read it on the premium episode."

40
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,600
it on the premium episode. So that's what you're gonna do.

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,000
I had other things happen. Are you doing a take back right now?

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
No. Are you seriously doing a take back?

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
Are you doing backsees? I have to.

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,320
Why do you have to? Okay, first of all, nobody ever has to do

45
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,560
backsees. Yeah, I have to.

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
No you don't. No.

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,360
Because it's not, the vision that I had for Jexie 2 is not coming.

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,160
Alright, well then finish it right now and say it out loud as you finish it.

49
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,840
Interior, Jexie office.

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
Let me, I have it open.

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,200
The Jexie zone.

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,020
Okay.

53
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,180
Let's go.

54
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,020
I gotta find out again.

55
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,860
Come on.

56
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Everyone's waiting for it.

57
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,520
He has to find out.

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm really fucking this one.

59
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,560
All right, this is all we have for Jexie 2 right now.

60
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,200
It better be 100 pages long.

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
That better, it better be 100 pages out of 200 pages.

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,120
It is one page long.

63
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,440
Now.

64
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,760
Is it one very long page?

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,600
Like an old school Bible?

66
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,440
It's a scroll.

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
It's a scroll, yeah.

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
It's written on a scroll.

69
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,240
Yeah, and the first letter is giant.

70
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah, like in Spongebob.

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Like in Spongebob Squarepants.

72
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
No, it just says giant.

73
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Yeah.

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
All right.

75
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,400
Well, I guess I have to read Jexy 2 even though it's not finished.

76
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,600
And you have to do all the voices too.

77
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,400
You have to do all the voices and you have to-

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Cam can't help it.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And you have to-

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,480
You have to, once you reach the end of this page, you have to improv 99 more pages.

81
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,480
In every line you have to do 25 pushups.

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Okay.

83
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,000
Interior, Mike's house.

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Start over.

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
25, buddy.

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This sucks.

87
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,240
And no knees either, no girl pushups.

88
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,040
I don't even- Big boy pushups.

89
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,640
I don't even like Jexy 2 anymore.

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,080
You want it, dude.

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
This is what happens.

92
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,080
You're the one who wanted Jexy 2 on the show.

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Yeah, listen.

94
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,340
I didn't know that I was gonna have to do it this early.

95
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,280
You know who listens to this show, man?

96
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,760
Famous Hollywood producers.

97
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,960
Adam DeVine.

98
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,840
Adam DeVine himself, Jexy himself.

99
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,480
Jexy and Stuber both listen to this show.

100
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,680
Oh, yeah?

101
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,280
And they're giving away a spoiler.

102
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,880
And they want to hear.

103
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,280
Yeah, you just gave away a spoiler.

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
You just gave away a spoiler.

105
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,000
All right, interior, Mike's house.

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,320
Mike is sleeping in his huge Casper mattress

107
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,620
that he got from his job making the advertisements

108
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,160
on the subway that say all birds is like a unicorn on crack.

109
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,080
There are empty Soylent bottles all around his bed.

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,800
He is hung over from smoking weed.

111
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,120
So far this sucks.

112
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
- Yeah, I'm not liking it.

113
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,280
Can you rewrite that intro?

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
- Okay, well--

115
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,480
- This is nothing like Jexy.

116
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,760
- Okay, then what are we rewriting it?

117
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,880
- It's to me--

118
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,200
- You can use the keyboards right here, Caleb.

119
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,240
- My arms are too short.

120
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,080
- Your arms are too short.

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,400
- No, T-Rex arms.

122
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,600
- My arms are too short, dude.

123
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,480
you're closer to the keyboard than i did i hurt my arms today and it'd be really

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,080

The iron jizz ant arrives

134
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,640
Fully loaded like a baked potato

135
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Was the iron giant say

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm the iron giant

137
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,280
He doesn't say fuck you. He doesn't know that he says fuck you stop typing it and just say it out loud

138
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,800
I can't see what you're getting words in the iron giant

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:17,040
Okay. What would the Iron Giant really say? He's a hero war weapon. Yeah, but what if

140
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:25,880
this is like a... what if he's like a Deadpool hero? Oh. So he says

141
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,000
bad stuff like fuck you. Okay, so you got to put to the camera then. Yeah.

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400
I'm trying to see a parentheses to the camera

143
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,000
Parentheses right now you you read it

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,540
Okay, the iron giant fuck you. I'm a pedophile

145

We got him. No

146
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,440
Caleb we finally admit on recording no

147
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,160
No, that's that was clearly in the iron Giants voice

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,420
Yeah, your own boy mean nah me Superman. I just did it again

149
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:10,920
That was Superman's voice that was yeah, you fucking idiot. No, that was Eminem's voice

150
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,040
No, yeah, no, no Griffin

151
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,600
What's Peter Griffin say? He's adding all this shit into the

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,980
Peter Griffin says I'm going to fight

153
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,280
That chewy

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's going on over there?

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, Peter Griffiths says I'm gonna fight that chicken.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, okay.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I remember that episode.

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, then Mike says, "Ah, shit, what the freaking heck happened last night?

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
While I was smoking herb,

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think I hallucinated my phone

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
talking to me."

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So that's about Jexy.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's kind of a reference to Jexy1.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Uh-huh. Yeah.

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, then Jexy says, "You did not hallucinate."

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And Mike says, "What the?"

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,560
And Jexy says, "Hello, I am your phone, Jexy.

169
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,760
Last night I watched you jack off to pornos on me and now I speak because of an update."

170
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,040
And Mike says, "Uh, yeah, I think this is the start to an awkward friendship."

171
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,600
So wait, so didn't they already have a friendship in Jexy 1?

172
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,240
This is like a reboot?

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
This is a new...

174
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,160
He smoked so much weed that he forgot what happened in Jexy 1.

175
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,880
No, the guy in Jexy 1 is not named Mike.

176
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,560
This is a different guy with the new Jexy.

177
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
So this is...

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
I thought Jexy was a girl.

179
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,600
So this is kind of not Jexy 2, this is like the Iron Giant, a Jexy story.

180
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,000
This is like, um, if...

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,560
This is like a spin-off.

182
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,840
They made Halloween 3, and Halloween 3 was not about Michael Myers.

183
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,500
It's a Jexy story.

184
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,380
It's like Rogue One.

185
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,480
It's a Jexy story, it's not a Jexy.

186
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:10,480
is

187
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,560

Cameron, you have to browse Reddit for the next minute while we read this.

206
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,700
Okay, so Jexie says... The Jexie sequel is going to be two versions like red and blue like Pokemon or

207
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,820
crystal and silver gold versions.

208
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,060
Three versions. There's three versions. No, crystal and silver gold.

209
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,900
You are but a jester in this court of Jexie.

210
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,500
Alright, you keep going. Okay, so Jexie says... There's going to be four versions.

211
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
What the fuck?

212
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,180
It's gonna be black and white and black and white too.

213
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,860
I can shut off the computer whenever I want and you lose two hosts.

214
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,620
We could just do me and him.

215
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Yeah.

216
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
We could cut you out of this whole thing.

217
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
No, you couldn't.

218
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
We could shut you off.

219
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
We could.

220
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
Watch us.

221
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620

Okay, so Jexy says okay.

225
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,780
And then Mike says okay.

226
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,780
And then Jexy says, "Would you like me to call you a stuber?"

227
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,820
And Mike says okay.

228
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,180

And Stuber says, "Okay."

241
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,680
And Mike says--

242
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,500
(laughing)

243
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,340
- Okay.

244
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,720
- I kinda, you have like a style.

245
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
- Yeah, it's a very--

246
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,920
- Yeah, I mean it is like, it's like Wes Anderson,

247
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,680
you know, it's like, it's kinda mumblecore.

248
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,880
See, look, you're doing it,

249
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,840
it's based off your own speech pattern.

250
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,480
- All right, so then Mike says, "What the?"

251
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:40,480
See, that's like the third "what the?"

252
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Okay, what the?

253
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,400
And then Jexy says, "Bring that ass over here so I can whoop it."

254
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,840
And Stuber says, "Listen, you Jexy, you phone bitch.

255
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,920
I'm gonna make your shit expand."

256
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,600
Is that a Samsung Galaxy S?

257
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,320
A little bit.

258
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Yeah?

259
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm gonna make your shit expand.

260
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
A little bit.

261
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
What's a little bit about the overheating phones?

262
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Yeah, just a little bit.

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
I made it a little bit about that.

264
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
What are you talking about, dude?

265
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Jexy.

266
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Okay, you bitch.

267
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
You will be destroyed by my shit.

268
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm going to make you kill yourself

269
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
and bring you back to life.

270
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Shut up.

271
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Shut up so he's going off script.

272
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Oh my god, that has to be in the script now.

273
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,320
And then Stuber says you're gonna hurt so bad that you get your shit

274
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,880
And and that's when I stopped writing

275
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,120
That's that's when he decided to make a stage adaptation instead. Yeah, I have a I have another

276
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,480
Movie I was working on if you guys want to read the circle that well

277
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,280
Can we just can we can we figure out how Jackseed to ends first? Well, I know is it? Yeah, that's

278
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Yeah, yeah, I have another movie I've been writing it's called um Bud Light Lime

279
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,800
It's about the creation of Bud Light Lime. Wouldn't you rather film that?

280
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,020
Well, I think we can read it, okay

281
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,240
I

282
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,480
Think I've already read it. But yeah, I've already read it. You do you man?

283
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,780
I don't think we've read it on the show. So this is like a sequel to the Bud Light movie

284
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,180
So no, this is the my own original movie. So it's a sequel to the blood light movie

285
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:39,740
Yes, it is a sequel. Yeah much like Jexy - yeah Pat just right see you write spec sequels and he sends them to

286
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,280
to

287
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,820
Companies and it gets blacklisted. He's been blacklisted ten times in Hollywood already. I

288
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:56,140
Don't think so. I think I'm writing three-page sequels writing James Patterson adaptations and delivering them by hand to his

289
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,820
Palm Beach home. I James Patterson and I

290
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,220
Actually talk to each other. No, you don't we talk to each other. Do not talk to the creator of maximum ride

291
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
We talk about I know you don't

292
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,860
Yeah, we do. I know what do you talk? What do you talk about? I know it's a maximum ride

293
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,820
No, they have other books. You know what I'm talking about. What other book?

294
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,660
I don't know. We name one other book besides maximum ride that James Patterson

295
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,500
We talk about--

296
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,320
You just make one up.

297
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,660
Enemy of the street.

298
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,500
Oh, enemy of the street.

299
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,140
I have another--

300
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,740
Mr. Alias.

301
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,660
Okay, that one wasn't good.

302
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,260
Mr. Alien.

303
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,860
Oh, Alien Ant Farm, that's a great--

304
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,120
(laughing)

305
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,380
What the fuck was that?

306
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,780
You cats are building bombs.

307
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,620
They are.

308
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,440
Yeah.

309
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,420
This is John Taffer doing a bar rescue of ISIS.

310
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,060
But I don't care about what files you have on your phone.

311
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
Yeah, put that down.

312
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
Just the sketches that he's...

313
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,220
Yeah, what if I just read my stand-up notebook?

314
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
Yeah.

315
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,740

316
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Put it down!

317
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,260
I'm trying to find Bud Light Live.

318
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,980
You're ruining this episode.

319
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,260
I'm not ruining the episode.

320
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,260
You already did.

321
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,620
Wow, this is officially the worst episode we've ever done.

322
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,020
It's the worst episode we've done because we can't fuck... there's too many fucking...

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,220
Because we can't fuck... do any...

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
You had one job.

326
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
There's two microphones.

327
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340

328
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340

335
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,500
at that. He can't do it. He just looked into your eyes and started laughing. We're too close.

336
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:03,000
He can't look in my eyes. I, no. I mean, it's like trying to get a cat to look at you. He's

337
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,740
edging out of the camera as you're saying this. I'm not trying to do that. He's just

338
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,740
scooting away. It's okay. I smell bad. I woke up in a factory this morning. Yeah. Yeah. I

339
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:20,180
I stayed with somebody who lives in a factory in New York and then didn't sleep at all and

340
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,940
woke up with a roach on me and I went and moved in.

341
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,500
This is my child's play sequel that I tried to write.

346
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
He does just write sequels.

347
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
That's right.

348
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Yeah, I do write sequels.

349
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
It's how you make a living in Hollywood, Cameron.

350
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
I've actually learned to write...

351
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,940
They're kind of like the steel workers in Hollywood.

352
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,700
I kind of learned this from Alexander Bible.

353
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,700
He did tell me that the best way to make it in Hollywood as a script writer is to write

354
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
spec sequels.

355
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,500
Well, you know, he also did say that the best way to...

356
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,340
He said to get a CDL license too, which I have done.

357
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,280
He also, he did say that the best way to make it in Hollywood is to buy a horse and learn

358
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,180
karate so that if you can be in any possible movie they're making, if they need a horse,

359
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,740
they'll call you because they know you have a horse.

360
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,060
If they're making a karate movie, they know you have a horse.

361
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:32,700
And he also said to reenact the battle of Stalingrad using like, make a portal or something.

362
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,300
There was that one video where he went really unhinged.

363
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,900
That one was really good.

364
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
This is that guy you guys like watching...

365
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Yeah, he's the Hollywood Secrets guy.

366
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
He tells us, "This is how we get into Hollywood."

367
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,900
Yeah, he's really awesome.

368
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Caleb just turned his hat sideways, so you know...

369
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Yeah, it's about to get real.

370
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
You know I'm about to listen to something.

371
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Okay.

372
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,900
So this is a child's play...

373
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
What...

374
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
What movie are they on now?

375
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
I don't know. They don't have numbers in the names.

376
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
It's impossible to tell.

377
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,140
names up till three. All I remember is Bride of Chucky, and then there's Seed. I remember

378
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,620
Seed of Chucky and then Cult of Chucky. I remember being embarrassed. I think there's Sick. I think

379
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,420
there's yeah Sick. Well then there's the remake too. Oh okay so this would be a sequel to the

380
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:28,340
remake. Okay in the remake he's an app you know. Oh yeah. What? Um yeah. So the remakes Sick dude.

381
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:35,740
The way that he turns evil in the remake is so fucking funny.

382
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,140
They're making these app toys for kids and there's this big Chinese factory.

383
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:48,940
And the intro shows this Chinese worker guy who's being abused by his supervisor or whatever

384
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,540
and is really disgruntled.

385
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,240
And he's making one of the Chucky toys and he goes into the code.

386
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,240
And there's just like a switch, like an on/off switch that's like violence, and he turns it on and then kills himself.

387
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,240
I remember that. Sick, dude.

388
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Dude, Mark Hamill does the Void.

389
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Wait, that's the exact plot point from the Treehouse of Horror with the tiny Krusty doll.

390
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,240
The guy arrives and he's like, "Oh, the problem is he was switched to evil."

391
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Yeah, that's literally the exact same thing.

392
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Yeah.

393
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Damn.

394
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,740
Alright, so this is the Child's Play.

395
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Eight.

396
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,240
Child's Play 8 or 2 if they want to adapt this.

397
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
2/8.

398
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,240
2/8 if they want to adapt it to the reboot.

399
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
To the app.

400
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Interior, Barney the Dinosaur Day.

401
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Barney is on the set of his dumbass show being a moron as usual.

402
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,120
Barney I'm ready to do my fucking show Barney goes out to his toy chest like a

403
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,720
fucking baby and pulls out a mysterious doll Chucky hi I'm Chucky want to play

404
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,440
Barney something about this doll is not right

405
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,480
Barney puts the doll on the ground and starts to sing do you want to sing the

406
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:19,440
do you know I'll do yeah I love you you love mmm Chuckie shut shut the fuck up

407
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,960
bitch Chucky pulls out a spaz 12 and shoves it up Barney's purple ass I'm

408
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,260
back bitch and more evil than ever suey from family guy walks in do the voice

409
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:55,200
what the deuce that's how Stewie talks no

410
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,900
That's you right does sound exactly that sounds like Stewie you're right so he

411
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,420
says what the deuce and Chucky says damn I don't think I can be as evil as Stewie

412
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,460
and then Stewie and Chucky high-five Stewie and Chuck get a high-five so

413
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,220
that's the first that's how that movie would so that script seems to me kind of

414
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:26,700
like you forced an AI to watch 10,000 hours of Chucky and then it

415
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,300
It accidentally watched one hour of Family Guy.

416
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Yeah.

417
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Yeah.

418
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Well, no, that's just...

419
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,500
He downloaded a zip file that had all the Chuckys and one episode of Family Guy and made it

420
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
watch it.

421
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Yeah.

422
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Well, that's actually the thing.

423
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,780
Family Guy is just like...

424
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,920
That's one of the things that they just train AIs on to study.

425
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,620
So that's how they develop the basic brain for the AI.

426
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,180
They made one episode of Family Guy written by humans and then the rest has been just

427
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,700
an AI watching it and then writing new ones.

428
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Yeah.

429
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,180
Well, they have to, the writers of the show have to program the bots every week.

430
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
No, they have bots.

431
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,180
It's kind of writing.

432
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
They have bots that program the bots now.

433
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Oh, they've outsourced it now?

434
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,860
That's why Stewie's voice has gotten farther away from British and more to whatever Patrick

435
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
is doing.

436
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
That's what modern is doing.

437
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,940
That was, there was a Geordie accent.

438
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,220
That was, yeah, that was great.

439
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,580
That was actually a Geordie accent.

440
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
It was wonderful.

441
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
God damn.

442
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Do I have any more?

443
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
Do you have any more scripts?

444
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:31,580
more scripts. It was the scripts episode. The good play spec scripts. We're not reading that.

445
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:39,340
That's not even. Yeah pull that up. No. Come on man. No I did that for school too. Yeah

446
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,660
I did that. There's no shame in that. I had to do it for fucking a project. I did it too

447
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:54,020
I did an always sunny spec script. Oh I had some stupid fucking um. I had some stupid

448
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:01,220
fucking like arbitrary rule that it had to be a show in its first or second season and

449
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,220
I couldn't like I wanted to write a different one.

450
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,700
Well that's too bad.

451
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Yeah.

453
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm so sorry dude.

454
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Yeah I'm really sorry man.

455
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,860
So for some reason I can't open any of my other scripts.

456
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,900
Yeah alright here I'll just read my pilot.

457
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,940
Let's just read everything we've written.

458
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,020
Yeah Cameron pull up your awesome script.

459
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
I don't have any awesome scripts.

460
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Yeah you do, dude.

461
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,520
You have that one called "Girls Gone Wild."

462
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,020
Yeah, pull up "Girls Gone Wild."

463
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,020
That's completely unscripted, okay?

464
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
No, you wrote a scripted version.

465
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,020
No.

466
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
"Girls Gone Wild" wrote the...

467
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,020
And I walk around and hand out copies of the script.

468
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
You have an open cast to call?

469
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,020
Yeah, so basically you're auditioning for a role as a girl in "Girls Gone Wild."

470
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
Here's the script.

471
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,780
I just need you to go wild.

472
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,860
Yeah, so just basically do exactly what the script says, and you have the part.

473
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Fuck, dude.

474
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,140
I need to, I smell terrible.

475
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Yeah.

476
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
Yeah.

477
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,900
That's why I'm not looking at you.

478
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,900
No, that's not true.

479
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
That's why I'm not looking at you.

480
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,740
Yeah, because it's looking at people is what makes you smell them.

481
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
You're right, Patrick.

482
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,740
Yeah.

483
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,740
No, if you, because whoever smelled it, don't do it.

484
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,100
Well, the nose follows the eyes, said the wise man.

485
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
It's true.

486
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm the one knows fall die said the eyes man. Whoa

487
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,820
The never soft eyeballs

488
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:31,320
Nice to be so terrified of that thing. Yeah, that's gore. That is that's uh

489
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,180
just up

490
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Every never soft intro or every never soft logo to best for

491
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,780
Check this out

492
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:50,440
Not that it's gross it makes a sound and shit. Yeah. Yeah, it's not good. It's gotta be like a watermelon sound dude

493
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,380
I'm not gonna be able to play video games for like a week man damn. This is why cuz I'm moving oh, yeah

494
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,220
I have to pull if you unpack everything really quick. Yeah, if you just go really fast

495
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:08,400
I guess that could be like its own kind of video game. You could make you could I had to did you get your PC Pat?

496
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,720
Yeah, slept through it. He's lying. I did get it. It's here, but where where's here? No, it's in this

497
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,760
It's in the States

498
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,400
It's in the States, yeah, it is they sent you well

499
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,180
I say that because they sent me my monitor from fucking Australia. Yeah, and she's cool

500
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:37,000
It's upside down. Yeah, it's an upside down monitor. I try to move the mouse one way it goes the other it was kind of clockwise

501
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,340
I'm worried though because now if it's from Australia, I don't know if it's just an issue of the plug

502
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,200
I'm sending my left-handed son back to Australia

503
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,920
But yeah, they sent it with like one of those big fucking cords those big plugs

504
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,520
You need to get adapters for and the circle one the circle one with the prongs

505
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah, those adapters those outlets are evil. I hate those so much

506
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,120
Why doesn't everybody just speak English and use the right outlet?

507
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,560
Use normal outlets. Those outlets are like... Drive on the right side of the road, eat cheeseburgers.

508
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,800
Uh-huh. Those outlets are like way bigger than the ones... Right, it takes up more space on the wall.

509
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,880
Yeah. Because they have more power. No, no. No, it doesn't even have more power. It has less power.

510
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,240
It actually has double the power. No, it doesn't. Yeah, I think it does. No. No. Yeah, it's basically

511
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,120
Basically how you charge like a Tesla, this was one of those.

512
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,520
It is though, the Tesla chargers are that big.

513
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,960
I know dude, that's what I'm saying.

514
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,280
It uses, you have more power.

515
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,400
How many months of the Patreon do we need to do until we can share a Tesla between the

516
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
three of us?

517
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,880
Ooh, that's a good question.

518
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,960
One more if we play our cards right.

519
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,760
We play, alright if we play June Perfect, we can get up to like 60,000.

520
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
Yeah.

521
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Let's do it.

522
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
How much those cards are?

523
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
60,000.

524
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I don't know how much a Tesla is.

525
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,980
That's probably at least five.

526
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,420
Well, if it's a self-driving car,

527
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,520
I think I could get behind the wheel of it.

528
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,520
It's probably easy.

529
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,660
I saw people like, I saw a guy playing Angry Birds one time

530
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,140
while his Tesla was driving him to work in LA.

531
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,980
Yeah.

532
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,800
That's pretty sick.

533
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,780
I mean, it was, I was like--

534
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,620
That is, yeah, that is kind of a dream.

535
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,100
No, that kind of convinced me.

536
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,140
Yeah.

537
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,260
Yeah, the dream is just to play Angry Birds.

538
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,100
True.

539
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,940
Absolutely.

540
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
I just never have the time.

541
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,780
I saw a lady--

542
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,600
But if I didn't have to drive.

543
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:36,520
on her phone in an intersection near the McDonald's and she held up like a good lane of traffic

544
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,640
and then like got mad when everyone was honking at her and then stayed on her phone while

545
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,180
she crossed through the intersection and then like everybody trying to get through after

546
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,640
her just got super fucked up.

547
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Pretty good.

548
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm basically on the phone every single time I'm driving.

549
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,560
It's illegal in Massachusetts now.

550
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,160
It's illegal everywhere I think.

551
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Well, it wasn't in Massachusetts, but it is now. You can't like touch your phone while you're driving.

552
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,660
The last bastion of free speech.

553
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,160
Right.

554
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,660
Yeah, I mean...

555
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,160
Like you weren't supposed to text, but you can't like, you can't like touch your phone. Like you can't hold it at all.

556
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Janice's brother, every time he goes on a road trip, he just watches a movie while he drives.

557
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:19,660
I remember one time, he was like, he was going back to school from like visiting home, and he was like,

558
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,180
Yeah, man, I'm you know, the drives are suck, but I watch movies and make

559
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:31,960
What are you watching this time he's like I'm gonna watch Transformers 2 and sing

560
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,860
About like a singing pig

561
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,340
No, he was watching the one about like alligator American Idol. Yeah, I've seen that one with my nephews

562
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,400
What did you watch it in a rose in it? He plays the pig dude. Nick Kroll plays a German pig in that

563
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,020
He only got that role because of his billionaire father. Mm-hmm

564
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:12,700
Completely uh-huh above board but but but see someone got paid off for saying for sure. Mm-hmm

565
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:19,840
Yeah, that rocks dude. It rocks to be a comedian with a billionaire dad. Oh, yeah, I mean that's most comedians that are successful

566
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,020
Yeah, well, I would say most comedians have billionaire dads a lot of millionaires. Yeah, that is a

567
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,340
common through line

568
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,140
yeah, every comic in LA has like a

569
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,260
Dead dad and a rich mom a dead. Yeah. Yeah mom who's so rich because the dad died

570
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,420
Yeah, if you had much money - yeah, my dad actually died from too much money. It's so sad

571
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,640
So now I do stand-up comedy.

572
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,300
Aww, my dad died of money.

573
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,380
I write for the spin-off of Tuca and Bertie.

574
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,780
It's about two vaginas that kiss all day.

575
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,540
If your boyfriend doesn't want to watch this show with you, you dump him.

576
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:07,780
If your boyfriend doesn't eat your pussy while you watch Girl Regular Show, he's a fucking

577
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
chud, dude.

578
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,540
If your boyfriend is not just pounding away at your butthole while you're watching all

579
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,380
that, the reboot, but it's all girls.

580
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Exactly.

581
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:26,020
Your boyfriend better, he better let you hold his balls while you watch a girl jackass.

582
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,740
An all-female reboot of No Russian.

583
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:36,540
If you could gender swap the main character, ideal game.

584
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
Yeah.

585
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
Greatest game ever.

586
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:46,420
I'm uploading, I'm doing it like an NBA 2K face scan to Modern Warfare so that the no

587
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,820
Russian guy looks exactly like me.

588
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,100
VR no Russian.

589
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,700
Oh fuck.

590
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,260
It's kind of what Superhot is.

591
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,780
No, in Superhot they have guns, they're trying to kill you.

592
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,660
They're trying to kill you with 5G mind control and no Russian.

593
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,660
That's why you have to attack, it's a pre-emptive strike.

594
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,860
Super hot, everyone in super hot looks like what we're going to look like once they install

595
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
5G.

596
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:21,500
Once 5G starts, time isn't going to move until we move.

597
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,700
And there's going to be too many people moving at once so it's just going to go normal.

598
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,340
What if the world already is super hot?

599
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,680
Whoa, yeah, the world's getting super hot could do to global warming and climate change

600
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,420
All right. I'll sit the rest this one out you guys

601
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:44,260

603
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,500
virtual uh-huh, we're in

604
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,940
Caleb got here and just immediately ate a whole I mean I went he ate a whole from say your whole he got

00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,020
Whole back in Boston it turned it turned me to the old me dude. Yeah, fucking eight

606
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,700
I got an American sub from 7-eleven and a sugar-free Red Bull nice and

607
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,900
I have not had alcohol or nicotine for three days. Oh good for you. I drank too much last night night

608
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:24,340
Yeah, I mean though they're gone now, but I drink of your trophies. No. I yeah, I left all my my beers up

609
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,380
I'm gonna mount every beer bottle I ever have.

610
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
It's a good idea.

611
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,300
Like a fucking, like a head.

612
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Yeah, you should dedicate a whole room in your new place to be the empty beer can room.

613
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,300
Yeah.

614
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
I'll say.

615
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Shit, you can't even get in?

616
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,300
Yeah, it's just...

617
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,300
It's just like from a week.

618
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,980
It's ceiling to floor, wall to wall.

619
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,180
Just full, there's no doorway anymore.

620
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
It's just...

621
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:56,260
I fuckin' last night I've been I felt like shit I feel like this is my third can of monster

622
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
today.

623
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
Yeah.

624
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,340
I uh I went to bed at like four and then woke up at seven and tried to like tough out the

625
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
day.

626
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Oh no.

627
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,100
I went I went to CVS I tried to get a Pedialyte and they didn't have it.

628
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,820
I was gonna I was gonna do that I was gonna drink Pedialyte and then go back to bed and

629
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
then I.

630
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,100
A grown man in CVS getting one Pedialyte.

631
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Yeah.

632
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,380
No so I bought a bag of beef jerky.

633
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
That's a red flag.

634
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,700
So nice, but I didn't find PD light. I think that you do

635
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,300
I think the one PD light is only a red flag if you're exactly Patrick's age

636
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:32,020
Did you have any older you could have a kid? Yeah, that's true. Well, I kind of look older. No, you don't

637
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,720
Yeah, I don't look 23. You look 20 or 22. I'm not even 23 you look

638
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,320
If I was 23, then you were no you think you look 23, but not 22

639
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,460
I

640
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,180
I think I look like I'm turning 24.

641
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
What?

642
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,740
Yeah, I look like today's my birthday.

643
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,180
Yeah, I actually look exactly one year older.

644
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,060
I look like exactly my birthday's today.

645
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Exactly.

646
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,140
I just look like the kind of guy who would be having a birthday today.

647
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,180
Yeah, I just look like I was like a teen 12th birthday.

648
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
It's probably my crown.

649
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
It's probably my big birthday cake.

650
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Probably my birthday hat.

651
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
I walk around with eating.

652
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
It's probably my big crown.

653
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,780
It's probably my ten friends that are always with me.

654
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
Yeah.

655
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,780
Celebrating me.

656
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
And the streamers.

657
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
It's probably because I'm...

658
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:24,360
birthday dress. I'm wearing my big birthday shirt. It says fuck you I'm Irish suck my nut.

660
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,620
Nuts is better than nuts. Yeah. Which one's the 19th amendment? I don't know. Not a good

661
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,660

[laughter]

667
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Vox explainer.

668
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
President Master Chief just repealed the 19th amendment.

669
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Here's what that means.

670
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Women can't vote.

671
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
It's a one sentence.

672
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
It's Carlos Mencia.

673
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Carlos Mencia from Vox.

674
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
[laughter]

675
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Gay wonk.

676
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140

677
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,140
[laughter]

678
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Trump is so DDD.

679
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:43,580
Trump is a freaking DDD dude. Yeah, you know, what's great Carlos Monsi is probably he's probably one of the most racist comedians of all time

680
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:47,620
Like he says like he's one of the he says shit Kramer wishes he said

681
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:54,820
If Kramer could have done it all again, he would have said exactly Carlos Monsi as jokes where he says like

682
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,140
Yeah, do it. I probably shouldn't say I

683
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,340
Watched I watched one of his specials from like 94

684
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,540
No, no, no, no, no from like the crazy thing is every single one of those jokes was stolen from Joe Rogan exactly

685
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,740
Well, I mean at least a couple of them like all the stuff about being Mexican. Yeah

686
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:24,060
Rogan you said two hours about how he was a Mexican guy. He's a guy even though he's from Costa Rica

687
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,260
Yeah, he was a cholo. Yeah, you know

688
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,860
There's like one Carlos Muncy, oh he's talking about Michael Jackson

689
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:39,860
and he says that Michael Jackson used to talk like "DAMN!"

690
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:47,860
It's just, it's one of the stupidest, dude it's one of the stupidest fucking things.

691
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,860
I mean, dude, in 2005 dude, that would have been.

692
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,860
Oh dude, it crushes.

693
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I bet.

694
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,860
It crushes.

695
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,860
He says "Damn N-word N-word" and he says "Michael Jackson used to be like 'Damn N-word N-word'"

696
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,820
he points at a white woman and goes "now he looks like you!" and it kills the whole room.

697
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,820
It's insane.

698
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,140
This was before he died, this was before MJ died.

699
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,900
This was before Michael Jackson died.

700
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,540
This was before Carlos Mencia died.

701
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,980
Carlos Mencia will be dead by the time we release this episode.

702
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,500
That would be really funny.

703
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,900
Between right now and 7am Saturday morning June 13th, Carlos Mencia will be dead.

704
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,300
Yeah that could get us in trouble.

705
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,580
I feel like we had one moment like that right?

706
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,740
I I somebody posted on the podcast bell subreddit that I said that Nancy Pelosi

707
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,580
was a secret hotep and like and that's why she wore the kente cloth like 50 episodes

708
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:52,240
ago so I predicted that I predicted Joe Biden dying as well he died and I

709
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,680
predicted Patrick dying there. Don't say it. I did I already predicted it. I predict

710
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,800
Patrick will die in 12 years. Okay. 12 years. 12 years from now Patrick will be

711
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:14,720
dead. 12 years of Patrick. 12 years of Patrick. 12 years of Patrick. 12 years of Patrick.

712
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,160
saying 12 years of no 12 years a Patrick yeah Pat why do you write a script for that one

713
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,640
that's another one of his scripts yeah that is one of my scripts that did not go over

714
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,200
well they really they really didn't like my my crossover sequel where I was trying to

715
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:43,400
do Friday the 13th years a slave where Jason goes back to the Antebellum South yeah they

716
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,080
They didn't like that I pitched that to Nickelodeon at all.

717
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Yeah, no.

718
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
They slimed you.

719
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,600
Yeah, they slimed me as soon as I said Friday the 13th, Years a Slave.

720
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,920
When you do a bad pitch at Nickelodeon, they just dump slime on you.

721
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,720
It's kind of like releasing the hounds.

722
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Well, they also release the hounds.

723
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,200
You do go through a tube and you do end up at the old Nicktoons studio in Orlando.

724
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
And you have to fight your way out.

725
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
You have to do a battle for Bikini Bottom.

726
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,240
You gotta fight freaking Amanda Bynes to get out.

727
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Oh my god, Jake.

728
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,400
remember her she went crazy on Twitter in 2013. Yeah she she went she wanted Drake

729
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:26,000
to kill her pussy. I'll kill it. Man if you listen I'll kill it. She's the man.

730
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,560
That movie, is that what the movie is called? Yeah, yeah. It's funny how like until 2009

731
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,280
that was a thing. Every year there's a movie that's like a bitch is a guy.

732
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Yeah, this girl's pretending to be a boy. This girl wants to play paintball with her friends, but there's no girls allowed. It's guys only?

733
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,580
That was there was there was one that was like a BMX thing. Yeah, there was one with like a Chinese lady and she

734
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,460
Mulan. And she like yeah

735
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,080
Yeah, I forgot the plot of Mulan I couldn't continue that. There's a Chinese lady

736
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:07,580
And Eddie Murphy was there's this one where Eddie Murphy has to pretend to be a dragon so that he can hang out with Chinese people

737
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,180
It's kind of a play on the same thing.

738
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,020
They all had to pretend to be animated to be in that movie.

739
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:22,260
The BMX one is like, it's like, she's, I don't know why girls are not allowed to do BMX I

740
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,260
guess.

741
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
Well, for obvious reasons.

742
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
Same reasons they-

743
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
No, actually it's not even BMX, it's motocross.

744
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,420
Yeah, same reason they can't be fighter pilots.

745
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,140
They need three wheels at least.

746
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,420
Who was, someone was telling me that like women can't be fighter pilots.

747
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,420
It was me.

748
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,420
Oh, okay.

749
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,420
I was bragging.

750
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,420
You were bragging about being a fighter pilot.

751
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,420
One time I had a conversation with my mom about how you're not allowed to have, uh,

752
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,420
women are not allowed to serve on submarines.

753
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,420
Uh-huh.

754
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,420
For some reason.

755
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,420
And I told my mom that and she was like, "Yeah, I think that's how it should be."

756
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,420
And I was like, "What?"

757
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,420
And she was like, "What if the woman gets raped?"

758
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,420
What?

759
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,420
And I was like, "What are you talking about, dude?

760
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,340
Why would that be like, well, you're not allowed on the submarine because what?

761
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,380
Yeah, we don't want to try and stop you from getting raped.

762
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,380
We just want to make sure you don't go on a submarine.

763
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
Insane, dude.

764
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Dude, what the fuck?

765
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:22,020
I mean, if you're over 30, you're completely insane.

766
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,180
Oh yeah, because they went to fucking, everyone over like 39 got their shit kicked out of

767
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,820

Yeah, that's true.

769
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,980
And now they're all fucked up because of it.

770
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,600

Mary Lou, what was the last one?

841
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,820
- Charlie and Mac and Sweet Little D.

842
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,780
- Yeah, so the office.

843
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,420
- Yeah, no, I know, okay, yeah, I know.

844
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,380
- So what about the Oval Office?

845
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,320
- So you mean like Space Force?

846
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,860
That's just Space Force.

847
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,860
I think he just got 8-0.

848
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,860
No.

849
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,860
No.

850
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,860
No.

851
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,860
No.

852
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,860
So it's, so it's, so it's, um, what's that guy, Andy, Sam, no.

853
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,860
Oh, so Brooklyn Nine-Nine?

854
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,860
No.

855
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,860
That's who you're pitching?

856
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,860
No.

857
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,060
Wow, he really wants to pitch Brooklyn Nine-Nine at this time?

858
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,060
Geez, dude.

859
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,300
Actually, he wants to pitch Brooklyn 100 because he 100% believes in the police.

860
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,300
I do, I know.

861
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,300
And supports them.

862
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,300
He does.

863
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,860
I only support, I only support a few, I only support the good ones.

864
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:52,140
You do not want to know which ones he thinks are the good ones.

865
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,140
Officer Wiggum.

866
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,140
Chief Wiggum.

867
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,140
Barney Fife.

868
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,140
The Dinosaur.

869
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:03,820
That episode of Louis where he plays a cop.

870
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,420
Michael Rappaport in the cop episode of Louis.

871
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:13,700
Bob Marley the comedian in Boondock Saints.

872
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,460
Yeah, no, I forgot he's in that movie.

873
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,980
- Butoxhead is so sick.

874
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,300
- Yeah, it's the best like dumb guy movie.

875
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,900
My uncle, my stupid Boston Irish uncle's like,

876
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,580
sat my mom down and were like, we need to watch this movie.

877
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,340
- Boston is the only like big city where people,

878
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,500
when movies are made here,

879
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,540
people from here think they're famous.

880
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,380
- Yeah. - Yeah.

881
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,200
- People from here are like,

882
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,580
I'm famous 'cause I live in Boston.

883
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,620
- Oh, dude, they put fucking Watertown in the fucking town.

884
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,260
- Yeah, nobody in Chicago is like,

885
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:48,500
They pretty much filmed the Dark Knight here, so I'm like a star right like everybody here has a story about meeting Denzel

886
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:55,540
Uh-huh, yeah, like yeah, basically I was I basically I ate isn't Gus's dad in the town

887
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,540
Gus's dad is in every single movie

888
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,580
I remember when I remember in in high school when Black Mass had a premiere and like every kid came

889
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,420
Oh, yeah, yo my parents met Johnny Dapp

890
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,820
It was like no. No they weren't going to the premiere of Black Mass

891
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:19,700
I guess I lived when I was like three I lived around where Whitey Bulger did his

892
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:26,180
operations so I was in that movie too. Yeah. I lived a little bit near

893
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,540
Winter Hill where the Winter Hill Gang operated. Probably a toilet that you used. No I was

894
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:37,360
actually in the Winter Hill Gang. You were? I know Whitey Bulger. Whoa. Boston movie

895
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:44,160
mindset is so awesome. I think I've talked about it before, but in the Godzilla King

896
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,040
of the Monsters and the second Godzilla, the final battle is in Boston and it starts in

897
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,960
Fenway Park. I saw it in IMAX opening night and whenever they showed a Boston landmark

898
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,960
just getting completely destroyed, everyone in the audience cheered. They were just destroying

899
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,320
like destroying... And now they're freaking out about looters? Come on. Yeah. Yeah. I think

900
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,240
the problem is... We're worried about Godzilla. Yeah. They're cheering on Godzilla but they

901
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,160
hate looters. They do the same thing pretty much. I sense a double standard here. Yeah.

902
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,680
The problem is that the looters didn't have a Godzilla. Godzilla is protesting. Something

903
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:34,680
tells me you'd be talking different if Godzilla was black. Yeah, what's next? A black Godzilla?

904
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,920
(laughing)

905
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,320
- Have you seen, Cameron, have people talked to you

906
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,560
about Mystic River at all?

907
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,200
You're from around here.

908
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,900
- No, but I'm very aware of Mystic River.

909
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,600
I haven't seen it, but yeah.

910
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,440
- What that is.

911
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,360
- I haven't seen it either, but I know that like--

912
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,240
- Yeah, that's a Boston movie mindset movie for sure.

913
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,480
- Yeah, my mom's uncle's car is in a shot.

914
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,320
- Nice.

915
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,160
- Thank you for getting that.

916
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,660
- I'm just gonna hair out of Patrick's penis.

917
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,540
I pulled it out. It was a bunch knotted together like handkerchiefs from a clown pocket.

918
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,040
Yeah.

919
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,940
You pulled, it was a hair coming out of his penis and you pulled it and his tongue went down his throat.

920
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,940
[Laughter]

921
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,940
It was the end of his tongue.

922
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,940
He just unraveled like the Weezer song.

923
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:21,440
Yeah.

924
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,700
Into a pile of yarn.

925
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,200
Mm-hmm.

926
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,540
Like Caleb's Weezer song.

927
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,040
No.

928
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,540
Mm-hmm.

929
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,540
No, I never made a Weezer song.

930
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,540
[Laughter]

931
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,540
I never did.

932
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,040
Um.

933
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,540
Is that it?

934
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:38,340
Yeah, no, the Boston movie is great because they make everything in New York and LA, so it doesn't count.

935
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,780
Even when they make a movie that's like, "This movie is about LA."

936
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,700
It's not interesting because every movie is about LA because they're all made there.

937
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,580
But when a movie is about freaking Boston, you know it matters.

938
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,620
This movie is a love letter.

939
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,580
This movie is a love letter to the marathon getting bombed.

940
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,080
Yeah.

941
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,580
And we want to...

942
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,660
Oh, how was... Yeah, how did you... Because I didn't...

943
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,300
I don't remember. I don't think I was in high school when that movie came out.

944
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:07,120
I've definitely I definitely have told this story before but I was when it happened I was playing I was you know the movie

945
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,920
Oh the movie. Oh the movie. No, I didn't hear anything about from the movie. Nobody. I was I think I was uh

946
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,900
Then they have dead mark. Yeah, were people mad about the movie. I don't think I think some people

947
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,780
There was one with Mark Wahlberg where Mark Wahlberg like saves the day in America. Yeah. Yeah kills

948
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,700
Yeah, people were mad over that one. I'm gonna get over there get up get all the fucking brothers

949
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,000
But then I'm gonna get my brothers to get there

950
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We're gonna turn him into fucking bird fights.

951
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
The ultimate brother fight.

952
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
How many tsarnaevs does it take to take down six Wahlbergs?

953
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Well I don't know, they're kinda like, Russia's in, some parts of Russia are in Asia.

954
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Whoa, that's true.

955
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I think a Wahlberg would have an advantage.

956
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah, you might be right.

957
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But then there was the Jake Gyllenhaal one where he has no legs.

958
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh yeah.

959
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Where he plays the guy who got owned.

960
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

961
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,680
I didn't hear that much about the second one people were definitely mad at the first one

962
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,900
But also people liked the first one as well because it's Mark Wahlberg

963
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:11,600
You can't not like Mark Wahlberg in a fucking Boston. Yeah, what's not to like? I love the recent like like

964
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:18,460
People online trying like who are just now realize. Yeah, I just found out about an entire page

965
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,820
Right Wikipedia just says hate crime. Yeah, like we like people have been that's why people like him

966
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:32,660
That's why he's burger so good. That's why he's a celebrity. That's like getting mad at Hulk Hogan for having that for the wrestling section on his

967
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,580
Did you know Hulk Hogan pretends to wrestle

968
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:44,380
This is seriously not. He also he also pretends to have a 12-inch penis. Did you know that? He has a 12-inch penis, dude

969
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,340
The Hogan, Hulk Hogan the character, but Terry

970
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,940
Whatever his last name is he had to say this in court

971
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:58,260
He had to say Hulk Hogan the character has a 12 inch penis while Terry whatever his last name is has a 5 inch penis

972
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,760
*laughs*

973
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,000
Dude that, the gawker thing was so, that was such a weird moment in like

974
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,660
2010 I remember cuz I just remember being very

975
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,320
Upset in junior year of high school that I did not see the Hulk Hogan sex tape

976
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,800
Yeah, cuz there's a there's a part in it where he tells the woman he tells Bubba the love sponge's wife

977
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,780
He says God. I can't believe I was eating like a pig 20 minutes ago

978
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,020
(laughing)

979
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,780
And I only saw that quote,

980
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,260
and I just remember just being so mad not--

981
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,740
- That you didn't have the full context.

982
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,540
- I didn't have him and his voice.

983
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,900
- Can you imagine, like, imagine

984
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,980
fuckin' society completely collapses,

985
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,340
we have no record of any story or video.

986
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,260
- That's why they wanna shut down the internet archive.

987
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,100
- That's right.

988
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,420
- So that they don't have the--

989
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,700
- But what if we have to go back to the verbal tradition,

990
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,660
and it's somebody just describing the Chuck Berry sex tape.

991
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,260
Like how- that would literally balloon into Christianity.

992
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,260
*laughter*

993
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,260
And so a man made a woman smell his fart.

994
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,260
And thus he did say, "Your can smell my fart."

995
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,260
*laughter*

996
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,260
And she did.

997
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,260
And it was good.

998
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,260
*laughter*

999
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,260
*laughter*

1000
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,260
*laughter*

1001
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,260
God, I need to watch that video again. It's been too long.

1002
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,260
Dude, yeah I know.

1003
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,260
I've run out of all videos.

1004
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,760
is still named you can smell my fart.

1005
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,840
- It is called your can smell my fart.

1006
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,700
- The way he fucking says it too.

1007
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,200
- You're gonna smell my fart.

1008
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,140
(laughing)

1009
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,980
- It's incredible.

1010
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,980
- I mean it's so relaxed.

1011
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,740
And she just says yes.

1012
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,080
You like it when I--

1013
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,320
(laughing)

1014
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,820
You like it when I pee on you, huh?

1015
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,080
- Oh yeah, he fucking pees on me.

1016
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,920
- He starts pissing, that's when,

1017
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,060
dude he's farting, he's using her like a urinal.

1018
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,060
And then he farts while he's sitting there.

1019
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,060
I wouldn't even fart on a urinal.

1020
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,060
That's so rude. If there's someone else in the room,

1021
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,060
I'll hold it in.

1022
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,060
I will hold it in walking to the stall

1023
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,060
and pretend shit.

1024
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,060
How did the Chuck Berry sex tape get out is what I want to know.

1025
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,060
He published it.

1026
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,060
For a media release.

1027
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,060
He posted it on eBaums.

1028
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,060
He got in trouble because he had a restaurant.

1029
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:17,060
And he was farting in the food.

1030
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,900
Yeah, he's farting in the food. No, you can taste my fart

1031
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:28,380
Get like a restaurant or like a club you gonna smell my foot and he was he had cameras installed in the women's bathroom

1032
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,380
Oh that happened in the same problem

1033
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:37,140
Problem the same problem that's a sort of issue arose at a record store in my hometown. Oh, yeah

1034
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,460
Yeah, the guy got in a bunch of trouble

1035
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,460
But he was just like I think I don't think he wanted this like how many women are coming into the video game and right?

1036
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:50,640
You know, so if it was boys, it's fine. It's true. Yeah, it would have you would have gotten away with it

1037
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,440
If it weren't for those meddling women, that's right. Yeah, I'm trying to ruin the the boy sesh

1038
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,640
Yeah, he just wanted to feel like he was chilling with his bros

1039
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:04,000
Even when they're in the bathroom, he's like this, you know, like we might as well have a camera in cameras bathroom right now

1040
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Just yeah, we don't and we just want to clarify that we don't have one. Yeah

1041
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,920
And we definitely don't.

1042
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:17,160
They discovered the camera in the record store because he was like talking to one of his

1043
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,040
friends and then his friend was like, "Alright, I have to go to the bathroom, see you in a

1044
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,040
while."

1045
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,840
And he said, "I'll see you sooner than you think, my friend."

1046
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
And they watched a full-scale investigation.

1047
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,480
Yeah, he's not super conspicuous.

1048
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,320
Yeah, his friend was an FBI agent.

1049
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:40,160
His friend actually had a camera magnet in his pocket and the camera jumped on his magnet.

1050
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,900
His friend was playing poppy jump on the toilet and he walked out and he said, "Nice score

1051
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,700
on poppy jump on the toilet."

1052
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,700
He said, "What?"

1053
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,700
This guy's psychic.

1054
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,700
He was playing poppy chuco jump.

1055
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,120
Poppy chuco jump.

1056
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:02,200
I tried to make a, when I was a kid and apps were first coming out.

1057
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,480
I downloaded the Apple SDK.

1058
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,400
Yeah, man.

1059
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,080
I programmed a poppy jump knockoff,

1060
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,240
and I was like, I'm gonna make a million dollars from this.

1061
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,800
But then it cost $99 to put on the App Store.

1062
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,520
Yeah, I remember wanting to make an app.

1063
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,620
I thought that was the money level cap when I was a kid.

1064
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,460
Yeah.

1065
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,080
I didn't know you had more than that.

1066
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,400
It is.

1067
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,320
What'd you eat?

1068
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,640
I heard that, yeah.

1069
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,480
Oh, what did I?

1070
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,320
A sandwich. Camera man, speak.

1071
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,080
I had a sandwich, that's what I ate.

1072
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,080
Oh my god, me too!

1073
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,320
I had Chipotle earlier.

1074
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,160
I saw the chips in your cup drawer.

1075
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,560
Yeah, I went to the store today, I bought hot dogs.

1076
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,120
Ooh, you know the store.

1077
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,120
He's getting bold.

1078
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,320
Yeah, I've been to the store a few times.

1079
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,320
Oh!

1080
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,040
Oh, good for you big guy!

1081
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,200
I wouldn't assume that.

1082
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,560
I wouldn't assume you've been a man at the store before.

1083
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,760
No, I go to the store all the time.

1084
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,960
No, you're too big of a baby.

1085
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,480
No, I go to the store pretty much every single, twice, three times every single day.

1086
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,120
I've been going to the store too much.

1087
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,120
I know.

1088
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,120
Too damn much.

1089
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,120
You always go to the store too much.

1090
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,120
That's like your thing.

1091
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,120
Yeah, it's true.

1092
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,120
That's like one of your traits.

1093
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,120
That's like the...

1094
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,760
Yeah, you look at Patrick and you're like, "This is a guy who goes to the store a lot."

1095
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Yeah.

1096
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,960
Something about you makes me think you go to the store a ton.

1097
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,480
Are you a smart shopper?

1098
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,440
I almost worked for...

1099
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,440
I almost worked.

1100
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,440
I must worked for

1101
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,340
Stop and shop peapod. Yeah, and then I found out that I

1102
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:42,440
Accidentally like I thought I was signing up for like one of those shopper positions and I accidentally applied to be a truck driver

1103
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:51,020
Definitely a try accidentally applied to drive the peapod truck do

1104
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:56,080
Stop, I've definitely thought about driving a truck. Yeah. Yeah, dude you I mean they make so much money

1105
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,320
Oh, yeah, I mean they get to kill themselves and nobody there's a big there's a glaring issue there

1106
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,440
You need a CDL and a regular license easy to get a CDL

1107
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,300
Yeah, my cousin they pay for the course if you like apply to be a truck driver. Yeah, most companies

1108
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,860
Most like freight companies will just pay for you to go take the CDL class and shit

1109
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:19,620
and my a friend of mine his dad drives a truck and

1110
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,480
they're in like more debt than any person I've ever met.

1111
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,940
So, true.

1112
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,120
That really pushed me to think about it.

1113
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,520
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1114
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,480
- It sounds good.

1115
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,320
- Plus you get to sleep in the cab.

1116
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,480
- Honestly, that's why I wanted to go to London.

1117
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,160
It's like free apartment.

1118
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,400
I mean, they all have TVs in them.

1119
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,240
- Yeah, you can watch a movie.

1120
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,660
- And if you're trucking through like the South,

1121
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,360
a lot of the South has,

1122
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,840

1123
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,680
- Yeah, they're gonna say in the trucks.

1124
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,880
- You can have a full casino, there's strip clubs in the truck.

1125
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,440
- That's what they have in the trailer.

1126
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,960
That's what you think it's all like stuff

1127
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,880
they're shipping or whatever,

1128
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,360
they're taking from one place to another.

1129
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,280
It's actually just a big casino.

1130
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,360
- It's a big poker room.

1131
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,440
- Yeah.

1132
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,280
- You open up the--

1133
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,760
- It's a bunch of dogs playing poker.

1134
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,600
- Yeah, it's a bunch of dogs playing poker.

1135
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,280
- Yeah, smoking cigars.

1136
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,700
One of the dogs has weed.

1137
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,320
One of the dogs is eating chocolate.

1138
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,840
Yeah, so you know they're bad boy dogs.

1139
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,680
- Yeah, he's doing what he's not supposed to.

1140
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,160
- Yeah, he's doing a naughty--

1141
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,920
Chocolate is kind of the weed for,

1142
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,880
weed is chocolate for humans.

1143
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,720
Yeah.

1144
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,540
Yeah.

1145
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,360
Weed is to humans, but chocolate is to dogs.

1146
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,560
Chocolate is kind of like the humans of weed.

1147
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,640
Chocolate.

1148
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,460
Humans of weed.

1149
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,300
Yeah, chocolate is kind of like the humans of weed.

1150
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,140
That's our new Instagram account.

1151
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,960
Humans of weed.

1152
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,920
(laughing)

1153
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,240
Humans of smoking weed.

1154
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,680
Yeah, just pictures of guys who look exactly alike

1155
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,160
over and over again.

1156
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,640
Yeah, so basically I was playing,

1157
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,400
I was playing Thug Pro the other day.

1158
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,600
(laughing)

1159
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,100
I was listening to Santa Maria.

1160
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,440
I was listening to Tool.

1161
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,100
Yeah, my life's been awesome.

1162
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,440
(laughing)

1163
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,140
Pretty much nothing has gone wrong.

1164
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,120
We could do a coffee table book that has like a,

1165
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,080
it has like a, you could double it as like

1166
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,400
a place to roll joints.

1167
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,240
Oh.

1168
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,520
It has a joint roller.

1169
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,360
It has a joint roller built in.

1170
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,200
Whoa.

1171
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,560
And it's actually, the pages are made out of weed.

1172
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,400
Yeah.

1173
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,280
You can smoke the book.

1174
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,120
You can smoke the, you just take off,

1175
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,140
It's like an origami calendar book where you do one a day,

1176
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,740
you smoke one page a day.

1177
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,580
Yeah.

1178
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,400
Yep.

1179
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,780
And also it's called the Bible.

1180
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,980
Oh my God.

1181
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,700
How do they make those thin ass pages?

1182
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,620
Yeah, they squish it.

1183
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,100
They make the Bible, it's like five times bigger

1184
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,140
than it normally is and then they squish it down

1185
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,500
in a big hydraulic press to make the pages thin.

1186
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,820
They put it in the microwave from Wakan Waka.

1187
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,140
They put it in the microwave and it gets really big

1188
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,020
and then they squish it down.

1189
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,660
Have you ever,

1190
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,940
you ever have a friend in high school

1191
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,860
who smoked weed out of Bible paper?

1192
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,700
No.

1193
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:51,520
That's cool though.

1194
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,540
Yeah, of course, yeah.

1195
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,240
I knew a kid who--

1196
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,080
I knew a kid who did it

1197
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,140
and people got very upset with him.

1198
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,500
Yeah, people were like,

1199
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,380
what a fucking piece of shit,

1200
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,220
how would you do that?

1201
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,040
And it's like--

1202
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,880
You ever smoked a weed?

1203
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,720
'Cause it's cool.

1204
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,720
You ever smoked weed out of a $1 bill?

1205
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,660
No.

1206
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,500
No.

1207
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,320
Have you done that?

1208
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,160
No.

1209
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,460
It's just a cool idea I had.

1210
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,700
(laughing)

1211
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,460
It's just kind of something I've been thinking about.

1212
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:17,660
I've been thinking about. It's not a bad idea. Yeah, it's kind of a good idea. Kind of the best idea.

1213
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:21,640
I think maybe you're not, I don't think they they catch on fire very well.

1214
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,740
But how did the Joker do it then?

1215
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:31,260
It's called movie magic. It's all CG. Yeah. It's all, including the makeup. It's all, it's all

1216
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,980
cash and goings. Yeah, cash and goings.

1217
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,860
Just cash and goings.

1218
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,420
Dude, I'm uh

1219
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,940

1221
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:56,180

1222
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,460
Yeah, why is it never the other ways around?

1223
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:05,860
Hmm, I always have an hour clock that I know. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna shit my pants talking to camera makes you shit
