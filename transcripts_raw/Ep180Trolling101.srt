No, I chose this outfit to be pretty today.

71
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Take off your clothes.

72
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
I'm not going to.

73
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,660
- My chains are in the other room.

74
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,000
- Put on your shackles.

75
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,440
Go get your shackles.

76
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440

77
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,280
- Get the shackles.

78
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
- Okay.

79
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,440
- Go get the dungeon key.

80
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,120
- I don't know where it is.

81
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
- Get to find the dungeon key.

82
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,640
- He's sitting in the spot.

83
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,960
It's all fucked up today because he's got a bunch of

84
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,920
like little trinkets out on the floor.

85
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,760
He's got all these glasses.

86
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,600
- I got a car just dropped these off.

87
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
I don't know.

88
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
- A car dropped these off.

89
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,960
- It's just all my fragile trinkets.

90
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,020
- I don't believe that a car came and dropped off

91
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,300
bunch of glassware. A hundred fragile trinkets? And he put them all across my floor. He didn't put them all across the floor.

92
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,060
This is your, this is your wife's trinkets. I'm building a Rube Goldberg machine. Caleb went on

93
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,100
Facebook marketplace and searched 100 most fragile trinkets available. Yeah, and someone dropped

94
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,940
them off in a car. What is that a snake charmer basket? I'm thinking of getting into snake charming.

95
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,740
- No, you're not.

96
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,020
- I am.

97
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,860
- You're not.

98
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,060
You're not getting into Snake Charmin.

99
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,700
- I have a flute on the way.

100
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,540
- I don't believe you at all.

101
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,580
- A big long wooden flute.

102
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,020
And a very funny hat.

103
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,860
- Yeah?

104
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,540
- Yep, and a sleeveless shirt.

105
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,620
- What about the snake?

106
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,480
- What?

107
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,320
- Is the snake in the--

108
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,740
- No, that's how, you summon the snake with the flute.

109
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,380
- Is the snake in the apartment right now?

110
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,220
- It's not a snake, you're not a snake maker.

111
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,860
- Okay, I had the snake and it was in there.

112
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,200
- Oh, rats.

113
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,420

145
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,000
I went on desocks.com and I bought a hundred pairs of vintage socks.

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The one thing I will say...

147
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Vintage socks from the 2000s.

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
With a bunch of holes in them.

149
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Really big baggy socks.

150
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,180
baggy socks. Really big baggy like JNCO style socks. Denim socks.

151
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,000
That are just like they spill over out of your shoes. Oh they fold. Oh do you see that guy

152
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,320
the guy that wears crown royal bags and socks? I did see that, that's sick. That is cool.

153
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,660
I feel like I saw that guy I thought that guy should be wearing those with

154
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,480
with flip-flops or Crocs. You need to be showing those off. Those are beasts.

155
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,400
there that's like if they just see the like cinch right like that yeah they're

156
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,440
gonna be like those are yes I mean like that's like a nice that's like a subtle

157
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,760
swag thing but when you know when you're doing that that can't be subtle no that's

158
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,160
got to be you need to see the crown royal logo yeah that's important definitely I

159
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,680
mean like you got it it's you show it off you know exactly yeah I mean you're

160
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,880
either you should I feel like I feel like what I would do is I would get a

161
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
bunch of crown royal and I would take a bunch of the bags and I would stitch

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,500
them together into those five toe shoe things. Oh shit. The like water shoes? No the shoes

163
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,200
that like that people use to run marathons in the woods. Yeah with your foot. Yeah the

164
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,000
water resistant toe things. Are they water resistant? Fuck yeah. They might want to be.

165
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,840
Different route. I want to feel every mud puddle I step in. Completely different route.

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,760
I'd go like those Balenciaga sock shoes. I had some. Put a sole on them. I bought some

167
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,400
fakes of those for four dollars at a goodwill one time and I was like I don't know why. I

168
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,520
never gonna wear those but I just had those for like a year and a half. I might

169
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,680
make a cloak. You still have them? No I got rid of them. Damn. They were so stupid. I know,

170
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,240
it's stupid I would have worn them. They're like the ugliest shoes ever. Yeah.

171
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,760
I might make like a like a perfect cosplay of the Resident Evil 4 merchant

172
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,400
out of the the crown royal bag. That would be sick. A cloak with like those, yeah exact.

173
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,120
Crown Royal. I don't have any. I just have the bags. I drank all of it. And you can't buy the bags

174
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,000
because they're my clothes. I still sell guns just like the guy in the game. There should be more

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,880
like merchants in video games should sell just like normal shit. Yeah. You know, things you

176
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,400
don't need for anything. I love that. That's the best part of it. That's one of the best parts of

177
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,800
like Skyrim is when you like sell a guy like a piece of bread and then you come back later and

178
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
and he said he'll sell it back.

179
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,560
- Yeah, selling it for like 10 times the price.

180
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
- Yeah, you're like, well, I guess I have to--

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,880
- I wanna play that guy.

182
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,960
I don't wanna play my guy.

183
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,800
My guy's getting fucking scammed every single time.

184
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,600
- They should make a game where you're just a merchant

185
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,920
in like Skyrim or something.

186
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
- That would be so sick.

187
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,480
- You're just a merchant in a small like fucking place.

188
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,720
- And all the adventurers come by

189
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,480
and they have to pay your prices.

190
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,600
And you can do that thing where like,

191
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
you know, you have like a bunch of items

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,260
that are like 100 gold, 200 gold,

193
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,400
and then be like, and I have the ultimate sword

194
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,320
and it's 10,000 gold and everyone saves up for it

195
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
and then it's just a normal sword.

196
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
- It sucks.

197
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,280
- Yeah, exactly.

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,760
- Well, actually, how would that work?

199
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,880
'Cause like, you know, like--

200
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,200
- Oh, you wanna sell it back to me?

201
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
20 GP.

202
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,020
- Yep.

203
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,480
- How does that, 'cause you gotta have like a guy,

204
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
you gotta have a buyer, right?

205
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,000
- Yeah, it's an NPC.

206
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,160
- So the buyer just shows up.

207
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,640
So it's kinda like a fallout shelter type of game.

208
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,320
- A non-player character.

209
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,480
- That's facts.

210
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,360
- Not balling out.

211
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,720
- No balling, no balling at all.

212
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,280
- Don't kick him.

213
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,120
- Don't kick me.

214
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,880
You're in the perfect spot to kick.

215
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,720
Yeah?

216
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Yeah.

217
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,040
That's why I hate this.

218
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,360
You hate sitting in a chair.

219
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,200
You're getting reminded of school right now.

220
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,920
You're balancing your thing so precariously,

221
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,260
your phone so precariously on the edge of your knee,

222
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,020
I can't help but try and kick it off.

223
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,920
You can help it.

224
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,440
You are doing like a seal routine.

225
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,280
A seal?

226
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
Yeah, you know?

227
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
I'm singing Kiss from a Rose.

228
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
Hell no, ball on the nose type seal.

229
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
Who the fuck is that?

230
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Seal?

231
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't know who that is.

232
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
I'm a virgin.

233
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Yeah, I only care about Navy SEALs.

234
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Yeah.

235
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
And what they do for our country.

236
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,520
There's so much I can show you, so much you can take.

237
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Listen, pal.

238
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
You be kidding.

239
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,520
It'd probably take two to three Navy SEALs to chop that guy's fucking head off.

240
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
He got fucked up shit on his face.

241
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Yeah, he'll have a lot of fucked up shit on his face when I'm done with him.

242
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
He had like a thing as a kid.

243
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
It's like a scar from like a...

244
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
What?

245
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Yeah.

246
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
It looks like you fell into a George Foreman grill.

247
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
You don't have to feel bad for people with scars.

248
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,520
that's just a normal. You definitely don't need to feel bad for steel. He overcame scars and had such a beautiful voice.

249
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Scars are nothing. He's like fucking, he's like a perfect skin. You have a person with scars. He's so hot.

250
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,520
If you have like, if you have like no eye or like you're a mutant, then you have to feel bad for them.

251
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,520
But a scar is fine. That makes you cooler. I don't know what you're talking about. If you have either one or three

252
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,660
something that you should have two of yeah that is a like a story that I want

253
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,460
it's crazy that Chris Morris was able to be so funny when his face was so red see

254
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,900
red face he was able to overcome the now that's not you know he just needed to

255
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,180
smoke a little weed mmm that's the truth he's had anxiety yeah it's funny that

256
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,540
people do you ever think about like like the fact that people smoke weed to like

257
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,260
quell their anxiety it's crazy yeah hilarious imagine - when I smoke weed I

258
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,660
I turn into the monkey kid from the Thornberrys,

259
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,020
like every single time.

260
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,600
(laughing)

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,140
(gurgling)

262
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,020
Swinging from a chandelier I don't have.

263
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,600
- That's me on soda.

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,420
- You do not get hype on soda.

265
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,260
- I do.

266
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,100
- No, you don't. - No, you don't.

267
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,920
- You get hyphy.

268
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,760
- No, you don't.

269
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,600
- You definitely don't get hyphy on soda, buddy.

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
- I get hyphy as hell.

271
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,140

- I get, I drink--

273
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,940
- You don't even get hyper on three energy drinks.

274
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,780
- I do.

275
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,780
- No, you get tired on three energy drinks.

276
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,900
- You get hyper, you know what?

277
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,260
your biggest drug is like the TV being off that's what makes you hyper you walk

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,940

285
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,340
Okay, so you like a cream, so why do you not like cream soda? I don't like, you know what

286
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,260

287
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,420
threw up because I drank too much of it and now I associate the taste with puke. Oh, I've

288
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,420
been there. Yeah. I've had that with collards. I had that with hot dogs for a while as a kid.

Poops I say cheese poofs wise positive South Park

296
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,500
What really said yeah, where he says the seasons the cheesy poofs jingle never seen that never heard of South Park

297
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:04,100
I've been doing a rewatch if we I wish had a friend who had never ever heard of South Park's actually do

298
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,180
You can pretty much

299
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,180
I've seen like one South Park episode. Caleb is so funny, he says the craziest things.

300
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,900
He keeps saying respect my authority, he keeps saying he's doing Hanky the Christmas Pooh.

301
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,460
He made up this character the other day, Timmy, and it's one of the funniest things I've ever

302
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:34,460
heard. Been doing a South Park re-watch, been re-watching all the early seasons.

303
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,300
- What?

304
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,120
- Yeah.

305
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,580
- What the hell?

306
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,420
- Yeah.

307
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,260
- You must be crazy.

308
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,900
- It's actually, it actually holds up

309
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,780
a lot better than I thought.

310
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,620
- I'd like to hold it up in the sun

311
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,980
and let it get sunburnt.

312
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,820
That's how seriously I hate this crappy show.

313
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,060
(laughing)

314
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:59,500
- I'd like to hold Mr. Hankey up to the sun

315
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,940
and dry him out and throw him in a car.

316
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,780
- I'll say it.

317
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,260
No, I like South Park.

318
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,100
- Yeah.

319
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,540
I like when they do celebrity...

320
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:15,540
They won so hard getting people to buy into that art style and get to just pump out episodes.

321
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,100
And now they're doing the Circle Show, right?

322
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,020
They're doing a show about guys who were made of circles.

323
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
What is it?

324
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
It looks like South Park.

325
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
I don't know, some circle thing.

326
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
It's called the Circle Show?

327
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,180
It's like doing a South Park show about being...

328
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,460
It's called Circle Circle Dot Dot and it's a Jamie Kennedy...

329
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,860
It's an expansion of a Jamie Kennedy bit.

330
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
It's going to be really good.

331
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,860
It's just circle, circle, dot, dot for 30 minutes.

332
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,060
I think we can make a really good show called The Circles Show.

333
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
Who do you think's doing?

334
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
I think we should.

335
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,060
Okay, you have to move beyond characters who are made out of circles.

336
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,660
I think our characters are circles.

337
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
Square show?

338
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
No.

339
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
You would do a square show.

340
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
The triangle show.

341
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,100
My circle show is going to beat all your shows in ratings.

342
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,140
I'd do a tetrahedron.

343
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,860
Pac-Man's going to be in my show.

344
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,780
Oh yeah, okay.

345
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,580
a good point. If you could have a show, which show would be better? A show of all

346
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:11,120
circular characters? Or a show of all square characters? If you could use every square or circle.

347
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:19,460
Circle characters, Pac-Man, Voltorb from Pokemon, Kirby, Jigglypuff, Square, SpongeBob.

348
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,100
A couple of Pokemon. I think Square might have it actually.

349
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,540
You get, let's see, Mrs. Puff when she's puffed up. True, she's circular.

350
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:39,900
are

351
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,900
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

352
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,900
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

353
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:59,900
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

354
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:06,900
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

355
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:16,180
circle. Okay, yeah. The entire army of the Gungans under their big force field. They all

356
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:24,740
count. All the Star Wars planets. R2D2's head, if you mirror it. Okay, so now, oh BB-8. BB-8.

357
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,460
BB-8. Okay, now let's think about squares. Minecraft. Well, Minecraft's not a square.

358
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,140
Minecraft's blocks. There's a Minecraft. No, no, it can't be, because then we could have

359
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,100
characters made out of circles for the circle one they have to be completely a

360
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,860
square oh shit well then squares my so squares

361
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,660
Bob the board you really just have sponge Bob yeah board cube the plank from

362
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,100
Ed and Eddie plank oh that's a rectangle are we counting right yeah otherwise

363
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,300
there's nothing four-sided sharp sharp corners sharp shapes yeah yeah sharp

364
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,740
shapes I believe who table II what's that towel we table you could be tally

365
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,700
- Towel-y. - Towel-y.

366
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,980
- Yeah. - Towel-y, yeah.

367
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,220
- See, they're kinda losing, man.

368
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,300
- There's not very much.

369
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,860
A computer.

370
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,980
- I guess a computer that has a hard drive

371
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,620
with every single character on it.

372
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,900
- Okay, yeah, but that computer's on the earth,

373
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,460
which is a circle. - Thwomp.

374
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,300
- Thwomp, very good. - Thwomp is really good.

375
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
- And the other kind of thwomp that falls flat.

376
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,140
- Oh, yeah. - The one that looks

377
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,740
like a door. - The flatterer.

378
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,580
- The flatterer.

379
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,660
- Yeah. (laughs)

380
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
- Oh, yeah, I mean, you've got the flatterer.

381
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,740
- Obviously the flatterer,

382
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,180
but that was should've been the first one we said.

383
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,020
is a kind of genius kind of we do consider ourselves a debate show yeah

384
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,420
you know I think we're in the debate section on maybe 8-bit Mickey Mouse Oh

385
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,540
any 8-bit any 8-bit yeah any 8-bit one big character yeah an 8-bit character

386
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,860
that's on a 2x2 pixel screen mm-hmm mr. game and watch mr. game and watch on a

387
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:56,940
2x2 screen mr. gay man maybe oh okay Wally Wally Wally is all the characters

388
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,660
from LazyTown if you put them through a trash compactor.

389
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
True.

390
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,260
Yeah, I guess you're right.

391
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Yeah.

392
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,820
No, but I do think Circles will probably still win.

393
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Circles win.

394
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
What about Triangles?

395
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Anybody?

396
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,100
I can't even think of a god damn triangle character.

397
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Triangle Bob.

398
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Triangle Pants.

399
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
That's nothing.

400
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
That's just nothing.

401
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Triangle Bob, Triangle Pants.

402
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Yeah, that's one of those-

403
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
You're just saying fucking nothing.

404
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
That's one of those like-

405
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Dr. Pyramid.

406
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,340
That's one of those like Spongebob shows that they greenlit immediately after Steven Hillenburg

407
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,140
died that he was like, "I will never make Triangle Bob."

408
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,400
(laughter)

409
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,860
- It is funny that they did have a show.

410
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,380
- Oh yeah, he died and then they immediately

411
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,220
made the package show.

412
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,460
- They had like a live, like a big red button.

413
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,300
- They had like five shows going on.

414
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,780
- And just aired them in a block.

415
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,620
- Yeah.

416
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
- I was like, this one's about the sand.

417
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,780
- Teenage Squidward!

418
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,620
- Yeah.

419
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,900
- They're all, it's so funny.

420
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,580
- Yeah, and they have like young SpongeBob now.

421
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,420
And it's like animated.

422
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
- It violates the canon.

423
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,140
- Hey, yeah, here's a thought.

424
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,100
SpongeBob was already young, you fucking idiot.

425
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,900
That's why he's so joyful and full of life.

426
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Yeah, it's why he's jovial.

427
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Is he supposed to be 30, Spongebob?

428
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
I think he's supposed to be 76.

429
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
He should talk more about how much he hates his 30s.

430
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Yeah, he should.

431
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
I don't think he knows how old he is.

432
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
He should be like, "I'm 30 and that's still young."

433
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
"I'm 30 years young."

434
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
He should be like, "I'm just a kid, 30 years old."

435
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
I think that would do a lot for a lot of sad,

436
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
lonely sacks of fucking shit.

437
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Spongebob can't be that old.

438
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
If Spongebob was born in the 40s, they would have put an ice pick in his head.

439
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
Nah.

440
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,220
been like Rosemary Kennedy yeah he would have been done for yeah who'd been

441
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,920
sitting there just all day I like water you would have you guys ever met a

442
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:41,380
lobotomized person no I mean you know I want to so bad I just fully believe I

443
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,440
want to see if I can tell you know what I mean yeah I want to see if I'd be like

444
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,820
well yeah they're sitting there like do that

445
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,520
lobotomies don't do that to people like if they're done right yeah it

446
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,240
just like takes out like part of that personality now a double part of your

447
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,000
brain yeah like a non-aggressive or something if they fuck it up you're full

448
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,520
drooly yeah but if they do it well it's beautiful if they do it well it's it's

449
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,400
the the a it's an art form yeah I think I can get one I think I'd be good you

450
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,120
getting lobotomized wouldn't change anything no you'd see you would power

451
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,720
through cuz I think that all of your brain they'd open your skull of me like

452
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,100
that's odd somebody's already been here they just try to lobotomize Patrick they

453
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:25,480
keep just missing because there's so much air they'd like take the saw to like cut

454
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,520
open his head and it would be like a beer can that you shake it up and just go like

455
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,360
like a shit ton of air. They just keep trying to hit the spot that you're supposed to hit and it just keeps going.

456
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,160
Yeah you'd be like you'd be like tickling and giggling the entire time. I'd wake up in the middle of it and just go

457
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
"Hoo hoo hoo!"

458
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
I come out talking like Mickey Mouse or some shit.

459
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Yeah.

460
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
That would happen to me.

461
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Man, I can't get it. There's so many trinkets here.

462
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
There's a little cow.

463
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Don't look at the trinkets.

464
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
I don't know what's there, man.

465
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
It's not my shit.

466
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
It's got an angel horn.

467
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Yeah, I believe in Christianity, man.

468
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
What's angel horn mean?

469
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Those things that are on their back that make them fly, dude.

470
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
You fucking idiot.

471
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Yeah, they got devil horns that make you sink into the ground.

472
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Does it mean a halo?

473
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
That's an angel's horn.

474
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:18,160

I can't, I don't have one.

477
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Oh, he can't put on the hat.

478
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Okay, you put on the top hat.

479
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Where's your top hat?

480
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
It's on right now.

481
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
No, it's not.

482
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Yes, it is.

483
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Liar.

484
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Okay, my halo's on right now.

485
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
It's on.

486
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
It's on.

487
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
C2 versus 1, it's on.

488
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
My halo's on right now.

489
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
No, it's not.

490
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Yes, it is.

491
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
No, you don't have one on.

492
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
My 5,000 friends on my phone just said it's on.

493
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
You don't have--

494
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Look at these notifications.

495
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
What app?

496
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Instagram, Twitter, Messages.

497
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
There's 5,000?

498
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Yeah, 5,000--

499
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Each?

500
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
No, between them.

501
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,480
but not between them come on. How many from each app then that adds up to

502
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,960
1000, 1000, 3000. Can you double check that Pat? Is that how looking and it's

503
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,000
not true. You're not looking at all my phone. I'm looking to it's not true.

504
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,960
Phone is face up. My phone is face down. See my halo is hanging on the corner of

505
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,400
my girlfriend's four post bed. Wow. Did you guys see the halo show trailer? No,

506
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,960
does it look cool? It looks really bad, but I didn't watch the trailer.

507
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Dude, I'll watch it.

508
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,800
I watched two seconds of the trailer with the sound off and went, "No."

509
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm a halo fucking...

510
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,400
I saw the picture of Cortana and I was like...

511
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
It looks like a...

512
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
It looks like a girl into blue.

513
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
She's not blue.

514
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
They did not make her blue.

515
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
They made her look like shit.

516
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,440
It looks like the CW superhero shows.

517
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Yeah.

518
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh my, I gotta look at this.

519
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
The effect's really fucked up.

520
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Yeah, let's watch it right now.

521
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
I gotta look at this.

522
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
All right, we're done watching it.

523
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Cortana, beautiful body.

524
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,600
Okay, we just finished watching it and it looks immense.

525
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
It looks incredible.

526
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,200
like a victory against the monolithic quips of the Marvel Empire. Oh dude, if

527
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,120
they fucking they're going to do some Marvel shit yeah, oh yeah, oh she's blue

528
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,320
yeah purple hi, I'm Mrs. Chief yeah, that's right yep, if they did halo today

529
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,360
yeah, hi, I'm Mrs. Chief and I have chronic back pain, you probably do that

530
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,900
that's right yeah, they put me in this suit to make my back pain worse yeah,

531
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,320
Yeah, and you know now it is about how funny it is to struggle the grant the

532
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,720
grants.

533
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,720
You'll aliens and we definitely don't eat their meat man.

534
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,820
Say that again the grunts.

535
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,020
Yeah, be called grunts anymore.

536
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,120
They'd be called genders.

537
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,420
Yep.

538
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:24,820
That's right.

539
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,020
Yeah, elites would probably be called the Commons.

540
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,920
Yeah, because they can't even be the elites are probably be sure to be this

541
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,320
time.

542
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,420
Yep, true.

543
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,320
Yeah, the Spartans.

544
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,420
I hope they don't make the Spartans normie.

545
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,920
That's one of my only that's a big deal breaker for me.

no normie spartans i hate normie i would break shit in my house oh absolutely

547
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:54,520

548
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:01,960
all the elites are girls and all their mouths look like vaginas and they have full-on kiss

549
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,520
yeah yeah gay rights and the flood they'll probably probably the flood they wouldn't

550
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,320
couldn't even make that joke like they did in the original.

551
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,120
- Flood would probably be somebody's name.

552
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,940
- Yeah, exactly.

553
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,720
Flood is probably someone's name now.

554
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,560
- Yeah.

555
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,440
- And it's probably somebody with short hair.

556
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,280
- Uh-huh.

557
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,100

561
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,720
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,760
I heard Master Chief wears earrings.

563
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,360
- I heard Master Chief is called,

564
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,120

565
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,160

566
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,000
- Yeah.

567
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,180

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,840
- Yeah.

570
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,080
- That's what they're doing now, to Halo.

571
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,680
Yep, you're gonna do the same shit they did to the Matrix.

572
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,180
Yeah.

573
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,880
Okay, the Matrix used to be about bullets.

574
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,780
The Matrix is about guys' bullets.

575
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,080
It was literally about two--

576
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,880
And now it's about cutting guys' bullets off.

577
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,780
It was about a white cop and a black cop,

578
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,280
and they would go into a computer and they'd kill 500 people.

579
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,780
And it was fucking sick.

580
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,280
Now it's about fucking being some kind of a gay thing.

581
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,480
I don't know.

582
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,380
I don't know, I didn't watch it.

583
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,380
So they got that guy from How I Met Your Mother in there.

584
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,180
And you know what?

585
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,980
Now they turned it to How I Met Your Father to get him a boyfriend.

586
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,480
That's right.

587
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,580
If things had okay, I did watch that and they know what they and they called it and they called it how I met your father

588
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,920
It was on tinder slash bumble. Mm-hmm. That's the title now. I watched dating apps nowadays

593
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,700
Exactly. They're like, "I'm looking for a she/her." I'm like, "I'm looking for he-man.

594
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,340
I'm Skeletor." That's right. What's up? If I'm on these apps, I'm looking,

Well, let's put some respect on Sean William Scott's name.

606
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
You already called him Stifler.

607
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,540
I was saying it as a bit, but he called him Stifler for real.

608
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
Oh really?

609
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540

nurse now instead of a machine. Yeah and the characters will be nerds as well.

636

656
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,020

- Yeah, they're in caves in KOTOR.

661
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,460
- That is a very funny, you know it from the name,

662
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,260
but not from the exact description of what it is.

663
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,480
I knew it was in Force Caves and Kotor.

664
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,020
I don't watch any of the Star Wars movies, I only play the games.

665
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
I might have seen them but I don't know.

666
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,060
Oh, they got Kotor on the Switch now, did you know that?

667
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,900
I have Kotor on my phone and my computer.

668
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,380
I might play Kotor for the first time then.

669
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
Yeah?

This thing's pretty cool.

675
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380

they blinked them too slow and you see their true eyelid. Yep, and when a

forever. You're not a son of Lucifer weird. It's okay to get

794
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,820
double the candy. I was telling you guys about this, but I've

795
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,220
been reading this like this book about this conspiracy theory

796
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,620
book and like this guy is like really obsessed with Satanism

797
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,820
and he keeps saying stuff. We're like talk about a cult. They

798
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,820
like killed like fifteen people or something and then like his

799
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,920
big like clincher is like and did I mention the leader of the

800
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:46,800
cult's wedding was on Halloween day and that's like the proof oh my god I knew

801
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,440
kids weren't allowed Noah wasn't allowed to celebrate Halloween grown up was

802
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,360
really his witness no it's just normal normal I knew erect kind of only kid I

803
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,720
knew who wasn't allowed to celebrate holidays was Jehovah's Witness and he

804
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,560
got to get school off for they only had a holiday not do Halloween I think okay

805
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,000
everything else was pretty fun well Jehovah's Witnesses don't celebrate

806
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,280
Christmas or don't even do their birthdays Brian. Yeah yeah that's fucked

807
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,640
up. Yeah to take that away from a child. A birthday is the most sacred day. To take that away from a

808
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,160
26 year old woman. Yeah leave her alone.

809
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,600
That's one of the most violent things you can do. Yeah. She would have got a Fitbit. Yeah. When else

810
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,640
you supposed to get presents in? Do they just not do presents or do they do

811
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,200
presents like. They don't do presents at all. It kind of sounds sick to spread Christmas and

812
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,800
Halloween and birthday presents and cheer around the entire year. Yeah. And

813
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,000
just do presents every single day. Are you doing a troll right now? No, I

814
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,760
seriously think that'd be normal. Yeah, so I mean that would be a good troll on

815
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,600
some Jehovah's Witnesses. Number two troll technique, side with the minority.

816
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:02,080
Yeah, I think minorities are okay. And I'm not trolling at all. No, here listen,

817
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,720
here's the description, here's the explanation from the person who wrote

818
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,520
that was okay find videos with topics that many people feel very strongly about

819
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,480
like religion and choose to side with the minority whether you truly feel that way

820
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,840
or not defend your opinion like it's your newborn child using as much

821
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,760
completely incorrect information as possible make sure you bash the opposing

822
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,880
view as much as possible no how about I don't yeah I don't think I will yeah I

823
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,400
actually hate trolling yeah trolling is actually fine now trolling is not fine

824
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:48,400

thing he's the most deft troll I've ever seen I don't think abortion exists I've

828
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,520
never way you could do that to a no such thing I think okay it's not good or bad

829
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,000
because it doesn't exist and they show you a video you say okay I think that

830
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,280
exists but I don't think it's called abortion it's called something else

831
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,960
that's I don't know what and I don't know what it's called but it's good

832
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,400
whatever it is it's something I was a good or bad that's just a normal

838
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,920
seriously think abortions just fine and dandy and you should be able to cut up a

839
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,120
kid and I think it's dandy but not fine whatever I think if a kid I think you

840
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,040
should be able to just you should be able to make a fucking a smoothie out of it

841
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,760
an unborn child. I mean I hear that's how they make Play-Doh,

842
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,000
sticky enough. I'm not okay. Hey guys, I'm not okay with abortion,

843
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,680
unless you torture the child first.

844
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,680
I think we should have abortion up to age 70.

845
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,720
Yep. You should be allowed to to sell the unborn fetus at Costco in a

846
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,280
chicken bake. Yep, and hey why stop there? Let's kill

847
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,520
the mom too. Let's kill everybody. I don't think abortion's okay, but if I

848
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,760
were a baby, I would be okay with getting aborted.

849
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,920
Yeah, me personally, I wouldn't care. I'm like cool with it. I would be cool with it for me, but

850
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,520
yeah, can't make that choice for anyone. It wouldn't be a problem for me to get aborted.

851
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,240
I think you can, I think abortion is okay as long as you use time travel to make sure that the baby

852
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,040
was going to be bad. Yeah, exactly. If you, and also we should do testing to see if the kid has

853
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,160
like ADHD or dyslexia and then you should be able to abort them. Yeah, definitely. This child's going

854
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,160
to be born with dyscalculia and you have the option to either abort or have the child. Yep.

855
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,060
I think that abortion is not okay and instead we should be sending all of the

856
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,780
fetuses that have these brain things to Mars and let them figure something out

857
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,880
up there. Yeah, how about you evolve you fucking piece of scum shit. If you

858
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,920
get rid of the baby you can put in the ocean. I think you should be able

859
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:33,400
to abort any fetus as long as it doesn't have a tail. If it has a tail we need to

860
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,720
see what happens. You need to see what it grows into. Dude, I wish I had a tail.

861
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,300
tail so that I want to tell red with so yeah what kind of Taylor we took cuz okay

862
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,700
my tail so my tail loadout is a lion's tail just a tail with like a big tuft of

863
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,440
hair at the end mine would be basically it's like a tail but then at the end

864
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,720
there's like a truck perfect kind of triangle spike yeah yeah I think exactly

865
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,060
like like nightcrawlers tail like being able to use it like with swords and

866
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,660
stuff like I'm put wrap my yeah and a sword you want to be knife crawler who's

867
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:11,100
night crawler blue blue guy you did what

868
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:17,340
yes I did okay number three trolling strategy call alternative music

869
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:24,740
listeners stereotypical oh that's a rather normal stereotypical

870
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,340
that's too far for me as an alternative music listen so you like you like pop

Seconds to Mars that is completely normal and not avant-garde whatsoever?

874
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,820
That's so stereotypical of you. Yeah, interesting. I prefer that. Yeah, you

875
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,700
know you should find an alternative to that music that you're listening to which

876
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:57,900
is so normal. I prefer indie music, yeah, like Justin Bieber and Chris Brown. Yeah.

877

903
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,480
I really like liberal Democrats and everything they stand for. Clap on those cum chains.

904
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,040
Yeah I'm putting them on because I like to be a little shit fart. I want to be in the

905
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,240
fucking milking machine. I want to work for a Mexican version Nancy Pelosi and I want her

906
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,240
smell her butt. Yep, they're basically making me like the uh...

907
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,240
fuck, what was the Teletubbies guy? I think it's normal to fuck a pile of pee.

908
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,240
I want to go into a Christian church and I want to play Diablo 3 in there. Yep.

909
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,240
And I want to run around top down view and I want to be shooting fire and flames. That's too much.

910
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,240
I'm going to be a human vacuum at Ed Buck's house.

911
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I want to be a victim of Ed Buck very badly.

912
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Really, really badly I want to be the victim. Yep, they're going to take a picture of me asleep on the floor.

913
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,880
the floor. I think Bowser's a fucking good guy and shit.

914
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,200
Uh huh. Yep. And it's okay if he fucks Peach's pussy.

915
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,760
Yep. It's fine. Peach had a bunch of fucking kids from Giz.

916
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,040
I think he's fine if he blasts fire red sperm, which like Cheeto dust sauce style.

917
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,920
I agree with socialist democrats that animals and humans can procreate. And I think that

918
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,760
when the baby is born though, we should abort it.

919
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,640
Yep. Or maybe keep the baby and then abort it later.

920
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,740
Yep, I think that I think it's good to put a baby in the fucking wood chipper. Yeah

921
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,760
Yeah, speak on it. I think it's good to have fucking sex in the oven and you burn it out

922
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:59,900
I think it's normal to watch fucking pooping on TV

923
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:08,940
TV and shit I saw I saw fucking damn crap on TV, and I liked it, and I think it's cool

924
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,940
I think there's nothing funny about wipeout

925
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,200
(laughter)

926
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,940
- I don't think fat people getting hit with big red balls

927
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,340
is humorous in the slightest.

928
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,380
- Yep, to me it's America's Saddest Home Videos.

929
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,380
- And actually I would prefer to watch CNN,

930
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,860
the communist news network, it was not what I call it.

931
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,060
- I think fucking creepy crawly bugs are cool.

932
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,060
(laughter)

933
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,660
- I think Slenderman is a good guy.

934
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,420
(laughter)

935
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,860
What are you looking for, it's right here.

936
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,700
- I dropped a cap.

937
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,540
- It's right here.

938
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,700
- Oh, okay.

939
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,420
- You really thought it was that important to--

940
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,620
- Freddy Krueger's skin is normal.

941
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,620
He looks good. He looks really good.

942
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,020
Freddy Krueger's hand is small.

943
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,720
Freddy Krueger's hand is small and normal.

944
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,220
Mm-hmm.

945
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,220
I think short guys and tall girls should date.

946
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,220
I fucking like Freddy Krueger's fingernails.

947
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,220
Yeah, I like 'em.

948
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,220
Yeah, I think his fingernails are good.

949
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,020
I don't think they should cook the sushi.

950
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,020
I think it's good to stay raw.

951
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,220
I think they should keep all the sushi raw.

952
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,520
And the worst part is probably the spicy mayo.

953
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,920
Yeah, I actually love picking my ingredients one by one at Chipotle.

954
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
And ketchup is good on steak.

955
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,920
Mm-hmm.

956
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,920
No, ketchup is not good on steak is what you meant to say.

957
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Yes, it's true.

958
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
And it's just complete crap.

959
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
And you know what I really like?

960
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
You should always use A1 on a steak.

961
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,920
And I really like rare.

962
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,920
And it should always be...

963
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,920
I like rare steak.

964
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
No, seriously.

965
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,920
It should always be rare.

966
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
I don't think it should be rare.

967
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Or you should never use A1 on steak and it should always be rare.

968
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,920
I think falling down a manhole getting fucked by the fucking Ninja Turtles is normal.

969
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
Yep.

970
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,920
I think fucking becoming a weed junkie and getting addicted to pot and popcorn is good.

971
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,760
I think it's normal to walk around with fucking crutches a wheelchair is better

972
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:54,600
than legs I really fucking think that shit I think it's fucking normal to walk

973
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,160
around with four robot legs like a spider no I seriously think Terry Shivo

974
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:07,160
at a soul. No. Yeah, I don't think she was as useless and devoid of a human soul as a

975
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:14,160
lunchbox. I don't think she might as well have been a Lego. I think that she was a real person.

976
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:21,480
I think Jeb Bush was wrong to do that fucking shit. Yeah. And also I, I mean I just... And

977
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,800
sagging your pants is good. Sagging your pants? Yeah, I like to see some cruddy money underwear.

978
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,600
I'd like to see money print underwear sagging over the jeans. I think that's good.

979
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,360
Okay? And I really like rap and I think that it's good. And country?

980
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,240
Rap and country. Don't even get me started on how much I love that fucking ass shit. It makes perfect sense.

981
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,040
I think that more songs should be about money and clothes and what kind of hose

982
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:51,480
that the person has. Mm-hmm. Seriously. And ladies should be pimps too. And I think

983
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,760
Euphoria is a great show and I don't think it's in for the show Humongous Perfect Breasts on TV.

984
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,680
that the ICU at the hospital is not might as well be the Sahara Desert in terms of

985
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,800
human spirit and I'm okay that euphoria is an Israeli sigh up it's okay with me

986
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,480
it's cool actually I think Israel should be 50 times the size it should be we

987
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,160
should swap Israel and Russia mm-hmm Texas and Israel should we should swap

988
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,040
Israel and the moon mm-hmm they should get the whole moon yeah we should put I

989
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
Mean we should send Israel to the moon

990
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:30,500
What's that number five is be creative which I think hey, I think we already just covered that yeah

991
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,520
We mix all okay

992
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,820
I loved I love to paint fucking pictures of a rats come

993
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:42,500
I actually hate to paint pictures of what happened to me as a kid. I just imagined a

994
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,520
liberal unicorn

995
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,760
Yeah, I think fucking rap music about sex is cool. Yep

996
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,920
And I think it's great to be a female rapper. Yeah

997
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:03,280
That's right. Yeah, I think they bring a unique perspective. Yeah. No, I think a female

998
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,240
Waiter is a good idea. Yeah, I don't everything. Yep

999
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:13,080
I don't think a female rapper would fall over if they tried to put on a chain and it's good that women work in

1000
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,020
Drive-thrus and I think that guys can be nurses. I do think that women should not have to wear high heels all the time

1001
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,600
I mean, I think straight guys are nurses. I

1002
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,420
Do not think that women should have to choose between either high heels or roller skates

1003
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:40,180
Or lying down I don't think it's wrong to see a woman's hair

1004
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:47,820
I think it's completely moral for a woman to show off her disgusting sluttish hair.

1005
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:52,140
No, I think that's normal. Yeah, and it's normal for women not to shave their arms.

1006
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:57,100
Yeah. Yep. It's actually good that they don't shave their arms. Yeah. And it

1007
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,140
doesn't gross me out when they don't shave their arms. Mm-hmm. They should have

1008
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,180
arms that look like... And a woman's ankle should be more than one inch in circumference. Yeah, a

1009
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,340
woman's forearm should look exactly like the halal cart guys. I

1010
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,140
I think it's fine if a woman weighs over 70 pounds.

1011
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,140
[laughter]

1012
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,140
I think that's perfectly A-OK.

1013
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,640
Mm-hmm.

1014
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,140
Yep. And she's seriously deserving of a husband.

1015
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,640
And it's not good that we forced women to eat nothing but sugar cubes.

1016
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,640
Yeah, that's not good.

1017
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,640
It's not good.

1018
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,140
It's not good to make your wife eat cotton rounds.

1019
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,140
I don't think...

1020
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,640
[laughter]

1021
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
To fill her up.

1022
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
[laughter]

1023
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Cotton rounds and sugar cubes.

1024
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:39,140
I don't think... I do not think that I should get free season tickets to the woman reserve.

1025
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,780
and Cameron should not suck my penis tonight

1026
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:51,140
it's about trolling not hypnosis yeah I seriously know the difference I guess

1027
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,060
trolling is a form of hypnosis I guess we discover that number six is multiple

1028
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:02,980
accounts Oh I'm Patrick and I think abortion is okay I'm Cameron and I think

1029
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:10,320
think that birds are real. Well yeah I'm I'm Patrick and I think that they should

1030
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,760
lower the the distance requirement from a hundred feet to fifty feet when it

1031
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:22,560
comes to playgrounds and they should let me let me buy binoculars again.

1032
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:28,080
He's getting background check like he's buying an AR-15.

1033
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,880
right and what's answer what will you be using this fishing rod for fishing?

1034
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,280
Yes,

1035
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,960
but also buying a candy bar and

1036
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:47,300
oh wait. He likes he's a he's a granny guy now. Hi it's me Cameron and oh yeah

00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,220

00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:57,420
Let me know come on to put a joke in

1040
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,140

at a point number seven

1054
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,140
humor helps trolling

1055
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,780
uh... that could have been that could have been a year

1056
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:53,100
i don't mean you know if i don't mean you know that i have a lot of it so good

1057
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,660
about only noon

1058
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,860
You should have noon, man.

1059
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,320
Yeah, man, if I nooned that shit,

1060
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,240
shit would have been traded.

1061
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,160
Traded from Drain.

1062
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,000
I hate when--

1063
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,820
(laughing)

1064
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,020
Traded from Drain.

1065
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,460
I think Patrick's okay.

1066
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,260
I actually hate when cowboy duels are at noon.

1067
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,100
Huh?

1068
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,860
I actually hate when cowboy duels are at noon.

1069
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,100
Me too.

1070
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,420
It's okay, it's actually good to have a stroke mid-episode.

1071
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,500
It's good for you.

1072
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,580
Mm-hmm.

1073
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,860
I don't think that we should--

1074
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,340
It's good to have only function of one arm after.

1075
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,900
I think it's good to eat a vegetable and it's not vegetables weren't invented 40

1076
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,500
years ago.

1077
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,100
Vegetables don't have things called micro worms in them that go in your stomach

1078
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,260
and eat your shit.

1079
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,820
I think fluoride is seriously making the insides and my brain

1080
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,740
I think 90% of diseases are real.

1081
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,740
I didn't fart.

1082
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,500
He didn't fart again. I didn't do a double back-to-back fart

1083
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,180
with a fart sandwich of me talking. Okay now number eight this is another tough one for us

1084
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,340
don't become a trollie. That's

1085
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,340
Hard for me, I guess

1086
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,580
Trolly

1087
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:07,940
Trolly trolly sour worms pretty good. So on rare occasion she worms on rare occasions

1088
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,980
The troll will become a trolly if signs of this occur abandon all hope for that trolling attempt

1089
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:18,600
Unless you think you are smart enough to get yourself out of it and emerge on top once more, but you most likely are not

1090
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,700
It's true

1091
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:26,100
Okay, the next one actually we could put into practice really easily number nine say no you to every argument whoa

1092
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,520
Pretty you should say no you know you know you I think it's fine

1093
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,960
That is gonna be really bad if we keep doing yeah, that was gonna

1094
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,760
That was we I just don't we got a huge bullet. That was great. I have like five minutes left

1095
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,460
No you

00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:47,800
Number ten easy for Caleb become a grammar Nazi Oh a grammar Nazi yeah

To get 50 grandmas in a shower together with you. That's what I said. No you did your grandma

1099
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,460
Not see the way you're hiding your grandma from me no

1100
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,900
You see my you've met my grandma

1101
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,540
Yes, I have

1102
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,540
It's fine

1103
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,780
Okay, you fuck my banana. I don't care. I give a fuck dude

00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:34,460
don't have a great that's why you like them so yeah because you don't have one

1106
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:39,300
it's like people who are only children who are like to a grandma tinder date

1107
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,820
with a bottle of wine and a feather duster you showing up to funerals he's

1110
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,580

1111
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,180
friends list she have an alive beautiful twin who was her best friend who was

1112
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,660
closest in age to her and who's closing age but still a little bit older yeah and

1113
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:15,460
now sad and unstable. I don't know what's worse you guys calling me a pedophile or you guys

1114
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,300
calling me a tomb raider. I think definitely pedophile is worse you should be glad. Yeah.

1115
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,700
There's nothing illegal about fucking an old nasty granny and letting her boobies sag in

1116
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:32,220
your mouth but that one doesn't sexually arouse you actually so you don't like it. Yeah. I

1117
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,220
I don't think there's anything wrong with fucking a gram.

1118
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,220
You know what you and I would actually hate?

1119
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,220
It would be fine.

1120
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,220
Okay.

1121
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,220
Actually it would be fine if you said it.

1122
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,220
Said what?

1123
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,220
That I'm normal.

1124
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,220
Oh it would be fine?

1125
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,220
Okay we're doing the trolling so it would be fine.

1126
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,220
It would suck if you said I was fine.

1127
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,220
Okay well you're seriously normal.

1128
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,220
For normality.

1129
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,220
You're seriously fit for normality.

1130
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,220
I fucking love normality.

1131
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:04,460
You know what I honestly believe? I do think that it's worse for a

1132
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,540
like a young woman to fuck an old guy

1133
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,180
than for a young guy to fuck a really old nasty granny.

1134
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:16,340
Yeah? Yeah. It feels like the man is getting taken advantage of

1135
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,820
but that old bitch knows what she's doing. She's been there before.

1136
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:23,180
Do you know what I mean? No.

1137
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,380
You don't agree? I think it's wrong both ways.

1138
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,620
The idea of an old penis going into a young vagina

1139
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:34,420
is so much more like like my thing is fine if they're doing it in the same

1140
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,620
room. I think old vaginas look.

1141
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,820
I think probably an old woman's vagina looks if it's a swarm or if it's a

1142
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,220
swap. I think it's okay.

1143
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,620
Well, that's okay.

1144
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,920
But if they're unconnected incidents, yeah incidents,

1145
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,420
I was like man of a higher rate of dementia.

1146
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,020
Yeah.

1147
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,820
So a lot of these old guys, they don't even know they're having sex with

1148
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,420
a beautiful.

1149
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,060
And there's a higher rate of uh...

1150
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:06,860
Yeah it was just after their fortune and their veiny old cock.

1151
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,380
The higher rate of dust too.

1152
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,580
They got a much higher rate of dust.

1153
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,580
Yeah that's right.

1154
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,580
Yeah.

1155
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,580
And a higher rate of money.

1178
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:43,500
it's like so like if you like it's kind of like I was saying like that's kind of

1179
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,600
like being on like adderall or something but when you're on adderall you still

1180
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:52,600
you'll jack off for two hours and it'll be still be fun. Yeah exactly this is like

1181
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,020
it's a chore to sit there and like you have to come up with techniques where

1182
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,520
maybe you make you make a hole with your fingers it's like a little smaller than

1183
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,700
your balls and maybe you push them through that one at a time so they pop

1184
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:07,800
real hard. Plus you got a punch on your balls like Fonzie on a fucking jukebox. You do.

1185
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:13,740
You gotta elbow your balls. Elbow straight down your nuts just to make sure that it's still

1186
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:19,460
work you guys know there's electricity in your balls yeah yep what kind static

1187
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,860
like heart electricity oh okay yeah and she rolls you if they're but they're

1188
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:30,300
hairy enough no yeah I mean I'm sorry I'm creating a serious nuclear winter oh

1189
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:35,300
yeah no they'd rub it you know if I walk fast enough on the ground yeah rub my

1190
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:40,700
you drag your paws across the rug fast yeah I drag those things around it looks

1191
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:45,460
I'll shoot a lightning bolt. Do you see how funny it is that like God put your dick and

1192
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:50,500
balls in the place on your body that is like always going to become the smelliest

1193
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,900
stinkiest most disgusting thing? Why is that bro? Why couldn't they put your

1194
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,740
he put your balls right here or some shit? Because it smells awesome. But like why would

1195
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:05,220
they why would your balls go in a place where they're just like dark and squished between your legs and shit?

1196
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:10,180
The balls should be on each leg. Completely covered in hair. The balls should be in each leg because I

1197
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,220
I mean the ball should literally be like hidden inside of a bone.

1198
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,220
Yeah.

1199
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,220
I don't ever need to touch my balls.

1200
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,220
Yeah, they should be.

1201
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:20,060
Balls should be on each side, each side next to the, like, you know, like maybe, maybe it's

1202
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,820
like the balls are on top, like hidden inside of your body, right?

1203
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:24,820
Yeah.

1204
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,540
Balls are hidden on top and then it goes down in one big, so it's two tubes connecting both

1205
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:32,360
the balls and then they go down and then they connect.

1206
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,360
So it's like, kind of like a...

1207
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,360
That's pretty smart actually.

1208
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,360
Yeah, so it's like two...

1209
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,360
What is going, what happened?

1210
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,360
There's something going on outside, I don't want to worry about it.

1211
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,360
You looked so scared just now.

1212
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,360
Yeah, I thought a bat got in here.

1213
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,360
You think that's what a bat sounds like?

1214
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,360
I thought a big bat got in here.

1215
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,360
Oh, alright, well, that's all. That's that.

1216
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,360
I don't think that would have been a big bat.

1217
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,360
Bye everybody.
