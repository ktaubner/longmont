1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
- Podcast about list.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,760
The cup and spoon.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,600
(screeching)

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,440
- Penis.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,200
- That can't be the first thing we ever say on the podcast.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,040
- That can't be.

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,700
- You can't say penis.

8
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,900
- You cannot say penis.

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,400
- That is fucking crazy.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,240
- What?

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,080
- That it cannot be the first thing.

12
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,900
- I'm just nervous.

13
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,740
I thought it was gonna be funny.

14
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,580
- You can't forever now.

15
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,400
- No one's gonna like it.

16
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,980
- I mean, who knows how long this podcast will go,

17
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,940
but for as long as it does,

18
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,900
the first word ever uttered on this god damn show

19
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,740
is gonna be penis.

20
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,560
- Penis.

21
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,320
Well, you guys are saying it too.

22
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
We weren't saying it.

23
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
You're saying it right now.

24
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
We're saying it now because we're reprimanding you.

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,760
You can't start a podcast reprimanding.

26
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Okay, that's not-

27
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,960
One of the members whose name is Cameron, by the way.

28
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,400
Oh yeah, I guess we should introduce ourselves.

29
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,040
I guess I'm freaking Caleb.

30
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,720
Yeah, I'm a guest.

31
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
You know what?

32
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,840
We had you on as a guest originally, but you should just join the show.

33
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
That's a good idea.

34
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Yeah, now that you're-

35
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
That's the kind of thing I do.

36
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,820
in. Yeah you're like pretty much the most useless at this time in 2018 you're

37
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,160
pretty much the most useless person I know. So yeah you might as well just join.

38
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,000
We like to just create guests in the host that's kind of how we roll at

39
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,720
Two Fly Guys. Two Fly Guys? I don't know. I'm rethinking the name now. You don't like Two Fly Guys?

40
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,980
Well I guess now it doesn't make sense. I mean if you ask me I think it

41
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,360
still makes sense there's two fly guys oh yeah one and a one guy fly yeah one guy

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,900
who can fly one guys flies down yeah it's yours

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:38,500
no it's not Cameron's no it's closed guys I fucking I'll say one thing I am so

44
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,100
happy to be podcasting with you guys but then also 2018 this is gonna be the best

45
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,540
year ever yes I have a strong feeling that the midterms are coming around are

46
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,300
are they are they maybe they already happened I don't I'm not really up to

47
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,260
date on polit political stuff like that I think well yeah at this point in 20

48
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,140
I think I'm very political yeah I'm worried that there's maybe some fucking

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,300
ghoul about to be elected Oh bloody hell in two years yeah it's probably gonna be

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,540
fucking Hillary who do you think's gonna I hope so Loki Hillary God willing it's

51
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:16,140
Bernie yeah Sanders did he is actually legit yeah it's true I back that fool

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,120
like nobody else bro. Bernie and I definitely and when the election comes

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,780
up I definitely will not forget to vote. I will definitely go out in

54
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,020
Massachusetts where we all live and I will vote for him. What about the Bernie

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,620
cast? I don't think a political thing is our slant. I don't think that

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,980
we could that we could. I'm politically crazy though and slanted to the leftist

57
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,180
orientation. Sometimes maybe you're a little bit too crazy with your political stuff. Nah, nah.

58
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,380
uh... let's let's let's make a pact right now to pull back on the politics and

59
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,580
never do any politics and we won't get political eyes will be you guys so

60
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,360
this could be maybe the

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,900
the non-political so what do we call the pocket pocket and on political

62
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,580
three shit heads

63
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,220
well

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,780
because it's kind of putting their souls down what i did what i did i don't know

65
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,540
what it was a fairly short notice with microphone with his three was three

66
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,540
What's wrong with Dum Dums with Microphones? That's funny.

67
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
Three Dummies.

68
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
It's not a good name. It's not a good title.

69
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,540
Dum Dums with Microphones could have a cover art where we are holding dum dums like the lollipops like microphones.

70
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
That is fucking dumb.

71
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,540
Oh shit.

72
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
Or Dum Dums as Microphones.

73
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,540
What if we did Three Orny Dickheads?

74
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Three Orny Dickheads?

75
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Three Orny? Well it's like apostrophe.

76
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
No like I'm fucking orny.

77
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Ornery?

78
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Three apostrophe O-R-N-Y.

79
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,420
E-A-D-S. We're not really British.

80
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,420
Well that could be part of the joke.

81
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Okay yeah, what about like a...

82
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Alright, let's do a whole British podcast right now.

83
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
What's your attitude about...

84
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,420
I've got no attitude.

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,420
You have a British attitude?

86
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
I have a really dry attitude.

87
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
Yeah, wait, I can't tell if you're joking or not.

88
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
You're acting so fucking dry to me.

89
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm not dry.

90
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,420
I've not become dry.

91
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,420
I don't know how to parse this. Is he being...

92
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,420
Is he joking with me or being completely earnest?

93
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,100
good name parse this oh shit middle finger blurred hours yeah no but then

94
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,580
they won't know parse unknown parse unknown pause unknown pause with three

95
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,060
full Danes don't pause this what I don't pause this is good pussy taste testers

96
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,460
pussy three-point taste testers eating the we did this dribbling yeah that out

97
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,220
though I you know it's you think it's funny now cuz we're in college but in a

98
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,180
couple years that'll sneak up on you no trouble no no no there's no it will

99
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,460
never age poorly to be nastily sexual three pussy dribblers but we shouldn't

100
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,580
name it like racial talk or something like that cuz I have a feeling that in

101
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,460
the coming years racial humor will become more and more accepted pop yeah

102
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,820
I mean yeah we said we wouldn't get into politics but once Bernie's and one

103
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,460
Bernie's and one and probably once and I honestly though I think that gosh my what

104
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,300
I'm hoping my predictions I feel like by 2020 or 2021 I think that millions of

105
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,940
S.J.W.s will die in 2020. That is going to be sad as fuck for like at least

106
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,020
hundreds of thousands of people. So us three we're in college right now we're

107
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,860
completely S.J.W.s do you think that maybe we'll always be S.J.W.s or maybe

108
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,060
we'll flip and we'll become anti-S.J.W.?

109
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,820
I don't know. I don't know. I'm really into rights. I'm really into rights.

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,780
I like rights too.

111
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,460
Amendments. Amendments. I fucking love amendments.

112
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,100
I've always been, consider myself on the side of rights,

113
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,740
but I'm starting to kind of slide backwards into kind of hating rights for all people.

114
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,060
Do you think that maybe, I don't know, like

115
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,780
woke culture will go too far in the future and people will get,

116
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,940
people will start becoming post-woke?

117
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,740
People, here's something, here's a little something I have been working on in anticipation of us

118
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,620
starting a podcast, which we're just doing, is a little saying. Yeah. Which is that people are

119
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,100
so concerned about human rights, they're not paying attention to global warming, which will

120
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,900
leave no humans left. Holy shit. So that's a pretty good example of something that I will go back on

121
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,380
in a year. Yeah, well, here's the other thing about that is we've promised already no political crap.

122
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,380
That's not political, that's human interest.

123
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
I don't know.

124
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
Or human society.

125
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Human nature.

126
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
That's humanities?

127
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
That's like philosophical.

128
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Oh, okay.

129
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,380
Okay.

130
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,380
I didn't learn that word yet, I'm in third grade.

131
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Yeah.

132
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,380
Man, I fucking hate third grade.

133
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,380
I know, it sucks.

134
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,380
Bro, this shit sucks, man.

135
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,380
You ever see the teacher bend over and her big fanny goes in your face when they're big?

136
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,380
F the teacher, bro, I don't want to talk about--

137
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
With her big denim skirt?

138
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
I don't want to talk about her--

139
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
What kind of sexual fucking teacher do you have?

140
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,380
She got a denim--

141
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,380
A tight denim skirt?

142
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
Not a tight denim skirt.

143
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,380
skirt you know what I'm talking about.

144
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,380
It's got a cheerleader outfit.

145
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,380
It's got an apple embroidered on the front.

146
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,380
Dude, I fucking hate my teacher Mrs. Linda Cardellini as Velma.

147
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,380
I hate my fucking nanny Vicky.

148
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,380
Yeah.

149
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,380
Yeah, nanny McPhee is a bitch as well.

150
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,380
Actually, I honestly, when I was a kid I honestly watched

151
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380
I honestly watched

152
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,380
That bitch's tooth is weird as fuck.

153
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,380
It's pro-tuberance.

154
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,180
I never saw it. You never saw it? You know what she looks like?

155
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,140
Wait, say it again. I don't remember.

156
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,860
But you were a little bit like, she's a butter face and she's stacked.

157
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,060
Who? Nanny McPhee?

158
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,100
Oh. She's a little stacked.

159
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,580
She's got a butt like a shelf. I mean, honestly, it's more like a butter tooth.

160
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,340
I think it's really her teeth that's the problem.

161
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,580
She's literally built like a mole. Also, her wicked butt.

162
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,380
Butter moles.

163
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,780
Soul.

164
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,060
Yeah, some mole soul.

165
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,300
I mean, now, if you're saying, would I rather beat it on Nanny McPhee,

166
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,180
would I rather hit that Nanny McFanny, or would I rather hit that,

167
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,500
what's that other bitch that used to be Nanny McPhee but was hot?

168
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,540
Amelia Bedelia?

169
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,140

170
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,900
Mrs. Doubtfire?

171
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,700
The bitch with the--

172
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,300
Mrs. Doubtfire.

173
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,460
The bitch with the umbrella.

174
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,540
You know I hate Mrs. Doubtfire.

175
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,220
No, you don't.

176
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,860
She looks too much like Robin Williams.

177
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,300
Why?

178
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,680
She just-- what do you mean why?

179
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,700
God cursed her.

180
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,140

181
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,540

182
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,020
and I can't remember the woman with the umbrella?

183
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,420
Lyle Lyle Crocodile.

184
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,300
You better shut up and tell me the right answer.

185
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,580
What is her name, man?

186
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm freaking out.

187
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,060
I'm fucking bugging right now.

188
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,940
I don't think I'm going to tell you.

189
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,660
You know, though.

190
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,160
I know.

191
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,660
I'm leaving.

192
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,160
Yeah.

193
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,960
You guys both know.

194
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,880
Poppins. Fuck you and fuck you! Fuck you guys, bro. You won't help me out? That's how we're

195
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,600
gonna start this podcast is I'm out there, I need a life raft. I need a tube. I need an

196
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
inner tube.

197
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,040
If there's one thing that I know, it's that people don't like it when somebody just makes

198
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,680
a bunch of references. And I vow to never, ever do that. And I won't even reference Mary

199
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Poppins.

200
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,400
You won't even tell me when I need you to, though? That's fucked.

201
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,480
Because it makes me look like a know-it-all.

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,980
I make references because I...

203
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,320
You know why I make references?

204
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Why?

205
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,800
Because I does what I like and I likes what I do.

206
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
What's that from?

207
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
That's a reference to Mary Poppins.

208
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,960
Oh shit, I didn't know that.

209
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,080
So you're some kind of fucking Poppins head.

210
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Yeah.

211
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080

That's some bullshit.

216
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
You're a fucking liar.

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
You don't even know her name.

218
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360

311
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,160
How the hell they do that? It must be magic. It's wax. A lot of wax on there.

312
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,480
God damn it. I'm being a know-it-all again. I hope that I figure this out. I hope

313
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,360
eventually you dumb it down. I feel like for people who are listening to this up

314
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,620
to episode 1, which that's a good name for a podcast. We should, that is a great

315
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,300
episode 1. We should try that one. But people who are listening to this podcast from

316
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,620
episode 1 onward, I feel like you can maybe look at this and now's your chance

317
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,140
to kind of frame to look through this lens and frame it this way. This is maybe a

318
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,760
story arc about a guy learning not to be a know-it-all. That's true and maybe one

319
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,420
guy who's trying to avoid serious prison time, maybe another guy who has a kind of

320
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:10,100
a unsuspecting issue, some kind of issue with his facial and head hair, yeah,

321
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,460
running at him like a bullet train. Yeah. Who knows? Wow, that's a good lens to

322
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,340
look at the show. Yeah, that's a good name for the show, story arc. Stories from our

323
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,220
friendship what about story call it what about worries from our French oh what

324
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,900
about act one act one act one act one scene one what if we have we'd have to

325
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,640
change it every time you guys like electronic a conscious hip-hop what if

326
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,260
we call it the prestige the prestige as I like the movie yeah I think that the

327
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,980
whole show is about a movie well we could call it the turn then no that's

328
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,020
what people would think that it's about a type of bird wait what is that song

329
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
called? What if we called it Exhibit A?

330
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Keg Push Coast.

331
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
Exhibit A is good actually.

332
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Now I think about that.

333
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Exhibit A. What if we called it The Black

334
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Album? Yeah. I don't think The Black

335
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,020
Album would work. That's my favorite so far

336
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,020
I think. Yeah. It's no, cause it's an

337
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,020
album, it's not an album. You don't make an

338
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
album with podcasts. Okay, so you want it to be called The Black Podcast

339
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
you're saying? Yeah. Okay.

340
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,020
We could do that. That works for me. The Black Podcast?

341
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,020
Yeah. And it could have a good name

342
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,020
for the show. And then we put in the description

343
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,420
reference to the black album yeah true the black podcast I got that black

344
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:25,300
parentheses the parenthetical parentheses it's a reference to Jay-Z uh-huh the

345
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,700
best podcaster alive ask about him yeah what the lyrics to the bike what do you

346
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,220
guys think we're gonna get into over the years I feel like and the thing is you

347
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,540
know we know each other like two days ago what's gay shit clothing yeah I don't

348
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,380
I don't think I'd ever get into that.

349
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,640
- I meant like what are we gonna get into like hijinks wise.

350
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,100
- It'd be pretty gay if you even thought at some point

351
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,380
that you considered yourself into clothing

352
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,660
and that was the first thing that came to mind.

353
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,700
- It'd be gay to spend a lot of money on a jacket.

354
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,420
- Yeah, that would be pretty whack.

355
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,260
- Yeah.

356
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,080
- Yeah.

357
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,920
- And we say whack.

358
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,760
- Have you seen this after paychecks?

359
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,500
- It's 2018 and we say whack and dope.

360
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,020
- Yeah, that's, you would be seriously herby.

361
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,860
- Yeah.

362
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,680
- Yeah, you'd be herby.

363
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,540
- Yeah, you'd be herby as shit.

364
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,780
- They should make a slang word for bussing.

365
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,700
- I agree.

366
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,900
something's busting yeah so we'll know yeah I don't know what it would mean yet

367
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,820
but they should be like that's bus and bus and yeah yeah what and Riz or no

368
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:31,220
there should be something for Riz yeah that's a really good idea yeah it should

369
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,380
be that word should mean something we'll figure it out I mean it's a first

370
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,560
episode yeah a couple of years story arc yeah stories from our friendship this one

371
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,740
is called rising action yeah or what's it called beginning what's the beginning

372
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,060
called rising black podcast that's what we can call it rising podcast yeah that's

373
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:57,020
a good name that is a good name that's a really good art because I'm we have to

374
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,740
make some art - I don't know you just throw some shit together in Photoshop I

375
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,540
I guess. What about a picture of us and it's cartoony?

376
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
Oh, boy.

377
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,540
And we're sitting and it's our three faces next to each other with microphones.

378
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,840
You know what's really good for that if it's going to be a cartoon look is this app called

379
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Bitmoji.

380
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Oh, shit. We can do a Bitmoji.

Oh, that just dropped, right?

382
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
I think so.

383
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
I can't remember when that dropped.

384
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
It's integrated into Snapchat.

They won't do anything bad. Yeah

400
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
Who else am I talking to on my space?

401
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,360
Wait, Patrick about a sneeze. I almost had to sneeze. Oh, that's okay

402
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,280
Do you imagine like I mean I think just have like a cold because it's like the winter, you know, yeah

403
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Yeah, imagine if there's like a fucking like

404
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,420
Imagine like a cold that was so bad. Uh-huh. It's like I'm doing fine right now. Yeah, imagine a cold

405
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,800
That's so fucking bad. It takes you out completely. That would suck. You actually just reminded me of something

406
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:02,440
I don't know why this or that reminded me of this there. It feels completely unrelated almost but I've actually been I've been doing some prank calls

407
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,800
Over over Skype. I've been doing and I say it gives me like a custom phone number

408
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I sent my area code to Ukraine and I've been

409
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,320
Prank calling a bunch of Russian officials. Oh nice. That's yeah

410
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,160
- Yeah.

411
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,980
- Wait, how did you get their number?

412
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,820
- I'm like, come fuck me, come fuck me,

413
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,660
you know, that type of shit.

414
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,840
- That's good, that's good.

415
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,880
- Yeah, and I think I might do that for several years.

416
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,720
- That's a good ass idea.

417
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,560
- Wow.

418
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,560
- Yeah, and I don't know what made me think of that.

419
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,400
- Yeah.

420
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,420
- Bro, I would never fucking ever get a vaccine.

421
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,120
- No, no shot, no shot, get it?

422
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
- That's right.

423
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,800
- Damn.

424
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,620
- You know why?

425
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,460
'Cause I feel like it would make me

426
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,080
actually mentally disabled.

427
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,920
- Yeah.

428
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
- Yeah.

429
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,040
- In 2018, I am already.

430
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,600
- Yeah, maybe it would reverse it then.

431
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
- Yeah, actually though, for real, I think probably

432
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,800
if there was some kind of vaccine,

433
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,040
I would probably get the first one

434
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,560
and then forget to get all the other ones.

435
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,400
- Yeah. - Yeah.

436
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,240
- Including the second part of the first one.

437
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,700
- I might do that too. (laughing)

438
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,560
- Yeah, so, you know.

439
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,880
And then it would probably be all right.

440
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,280
- Yeah. - Yeah.

441
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,720
- I'd get all of them just in case

442
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,600
of the lawsuit that comes out.

443
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,440
- I really hope in the future--

444
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
- True, that's a great point.

445
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,020
If there was some kind of vaccine that could hurt you

446
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,320
and you knew ahead of time, you should get it

447
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
because then you'd probably get a fat payout

448
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,160
'cause it kills enough fucking football players.

449
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,000
- Oh, yeah, that would be great.

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,840
Yeah, are you kidding me?

451
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,240
You know what I was I did.

452
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,640
What do

453
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,140
I was just thinking recently to just on the kind of I really

454
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,240
really would love to someday wear a chin diaper.

455
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,740
That's a great idea.

456
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,240
Yeah.

457
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,940
Yeah, a diaper on my face.

458
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,740
I would love to be forced to do that.

459
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,140
I would love if there was some way that we could connect over

460
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,040
like some kind of like maybe some kind of web system to every

461
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,340
single computer in the world.

462
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,240
Would be amazing.

463
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,400
that would be because it's like that we're just gonna have to burn this to a

464
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,200
CD and it's gone forever I know it's like a hand it out in Times Square that sucks

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,740

- Well then we can shorten it to--

505
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,740
