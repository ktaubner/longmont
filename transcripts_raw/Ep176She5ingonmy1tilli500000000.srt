1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,920
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,080
- Crap monster.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,900
(laughing)

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,740
(explosion)

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,580
- Hi!

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,400
Hi!

10
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,240
- Hi.

11
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,080
- Hi!

12
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,900
Hi!

13
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,160
- Went and saw Licorice Pizza last night,

14
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,080
I was waving at Alana Haym like that on the screen.

15
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,640
I was sitting there going, "Hi!

16
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,040
"Hi!"

17
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,880
- Yeah.

18
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,700
- She didn't say anything.

19
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,680
- I really respected what she did to that boy.

20
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,520
- Yeah.

21
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,680
- She didn't say anything back to me.

22
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,520
Pat's in a pitch meeting two weeks later. He's like, "What if we did a gender-swapped

23
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,780
licorice pizza?" And I play the older one.

24
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,120
And it's called Pizza.

25
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,440
Well, think about it. Hold on. Why is that movie called Pizza?

26
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
I don't know.

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Think about it.

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,880
It's named after your employers.

29
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
You're doing some...

30
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
What's that shit called?

31
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
QNN.

32
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
QNN.

33
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,680
in QA mom Q and then comet pizza shit they don't even go to licorice pizza

34
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,680
maybe I was in the bathroom I think there's a story you're in the bathroom

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
why'd you have to leave the liquor is moving go to the bathroom I think I

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
isn't a licorice pizza a word for like a record shut up isn't that what that

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,600
means shut up just shut why do you have to know everything fucking stupid

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,440
asshole funny if that's not true Rick I feel like I saw somebody say that

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,920
I hope that's not true and I just made that up. No that is it that is true. Oh

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,360
it's cool. Look at what COVID-19 is doing to my face.

41
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,800
Licorice Pizza chain will be sold to American Canyon. Oh there was a store?

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,980
Licorice Pizza, a Southern California record and video store chain that got its

43
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,480
name from a 1960s record album is being sold to the Musicland group. That's from

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,360
the LA Times in 1986. Musicland. There's a land I'd like to visit. Tax Haven.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Dude, oh man. I'd love to go to Musicland and kill Stevie Ray Vaughan.

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,360
It's an amusement park with audio only rides. You sit in a room and you close your eyes and

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,360
it plays the sound of a roller coaster. Did Stevie Ray Vaughan also die in a helicopter

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
crash? I think Stevie Ray Vaughan's alive.

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,360
We're trying to do the Musicland amusement park planning here.

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah, but that's the thing. Okay, well if you do the Musicland amusement park, you cannot

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:33,240
cannot have any helicopter stuff. What? Because of Randy Rhoads and Buddy Holly. And Skinnerd.

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,400
Come on. Yeah. Okay, I guess any kind of music land, there's going to be no plane. There's

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,480
going to be nothing that goes in the air. And JFK Jr. Uh huh. I don't think there's

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,640
usually planes in amusement parks. Well, no plane rides. I don't think they usually ride

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,000
planes and a musical. You can't have the Soul Plane. It's usually roller coasters. That's

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
a big downside. More than planes. Well a plane themed roller coaster. They have that already.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,720
There's like tons of plane roller coasters. Yeah Cameron you idiot. You said you can't

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,800
have any planes. Well we can't have any plane themed stuff. You can't fly a plane over Disney

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
right? It's like an airspace thing. I don't know what you're saying. There's no plane

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,400
already no I'm saying you can't have any plane themed ride yeah there'll be no

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,560
planes there what a way right to ride you don't need what do you mean that you

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,200
can't fly a plane like are they gonna shoot it's like a lot of the fucking guy

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,200
they're allowed to shoot the yeah are they gonna iron dome you if you fucking

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,000
fly your plane over the haunted mansion?

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,320
Somebody flying a plane over Canobie Lake Park and it just gets shot down immediately.

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
No, there is.

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,920
You can't fly a plane over Disney because of 9/11.

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Really?

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,960
Yeah, there's like a no-fly zone over it.

70
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,320
So they said Disney World is the only place that we don't want another 9/11.

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Dude, imagine...

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,920
You can fly a plane over anywhere but Disney World.

73
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,320
Even if on 9- like on 9/11 one of the targets was Disneyland.

74
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,920
They should have said you can't fly a plane through a building.

75
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,620
That would have been a very good...

76
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,120
That's like an unspoken rule.

77
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,920
Yeah, I guess you're right.

78
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,160
If they'd taken out Disney World, we'd be living in a much scarier and more tense security

79
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
state.

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,480
If they took out Disney World, they would have fucking launched a nuke.

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,880
They would have launched a nuke immediately.

82
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,320
questions asked as soon as the plane hits the rock and roller coaster fucking one

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,280
big nuke going over the middle of the love Darrow Smith man yeah he did all the

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,680
rides would do that thing from the Jimmy Neutron movie where they'd blast off and

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,000
they'd all fly into into the Middle East and explode yeah but then they'd

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,840
accidentally but what if all of the explosives malfunction now they just

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
have a Disney World.

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
That was their plane all along.

89
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Right?

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:12,060
What if they hijacked the plane and they made sure they got a bunch of, they packed a bunch

91
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,640
of luggage with magnets in it and they flew really low over the Disney World and it became

92
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
all the rides.

93
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Way more of a tragedy.

94
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,680
We launched a nuke because they stole Disney World from us.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,280
So much imagineering gone to waste.

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Yeah.

97
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,800
It's not like you can build a new Disney World.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
That should be Ocean's 14.

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Yeah, Werner Von Braun is dead.

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
He's the one who designed the wheat tissue.

101
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Ocean's 14.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
He was a Nazi Imagineer.

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,640
What is the biggest thing in Operation Paperclip was the creation of Disney World?

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Dude, we had all these Nazi Imagineers come over and design all the rides.

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,520
What is the use of rollercoaster that was done with the music of Aerosmith?

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,240
Well, sir, what the hell is Aerosmith?

107
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,780
we will have to create Harold Smith first.

108
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,280
That's what all the Flynn experiments were.

109
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,360
They were doing experiments on groups of guys.

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,360
That's why they, Steven, not many people know this, Steven Tyler was a Nazi experiment to

111
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,400
create the most beautiful man in the world.

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,740
The most beautiful looking androgynous person.

113
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,840
The perfect mixture of a girl and a guy.

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
And evil.

115
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Yeah, he had some crazy shit going on back then.

116
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,520
It's cool that Liv Tyler didn't know that was her dad until she was like 18.

117
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah.

118
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, it's like you look at her and you're like, "Really?"

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
How the fuck do you not know?

120
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Yeah.

121
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Also, her name is Liv Tyler.

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Yeah, I feel like it's a dead giveaway.

123
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Hey, bitch, it says it on your Wikipedia page.

124
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,200
It's like, "Oh yeah, that's Stephen Tyler.

125
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,880
He comes to my house sometimes."

126
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Yeah, he feeds me and clothes me.

127
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,960
"Sometimes he'll go to the kitchen and make a sandwich.

128
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:01,000
The story is that she had a poster of Stephen Tyler in her room when she was growing up,

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
which means that she used to fucking rub one out.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,560
Thing her one.

131
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,040
She used to thing her one.

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Thing her one.

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,920
She used to thing her go-woner.

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,720
She used to go thingy on her one.

135
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,520
And then to her own father.

136
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:29,000

143
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,960
My dad's Saxon.

My dad sings Back in Black.

156
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
No, just like...

157

I was gonna ask, like, fuck I don't remember, I was just gonna ask what would you do if your

158
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
dad was a rockstar?

159
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,400
Probably rock out with him, probably shred, probably learn how to fucking shred, probably

160
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,920
fucking fuck his groupies too.

161
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
Hey, if you're like my dad, you're gonna like my young penis.

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,800
Dude, like Kevin Gates with his dog?

163
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,040
What?

164
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,240
Didn't Kevin Gates say that like- My dad's not gonna like make the girls fuck me.

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,800
Kevin Gates said, he was like, "If you in my bed and you fucking sucking my dick, you

166
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,760
you gotta suck my dog's dick.

167
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,240
And apparently kicked a girl out of his house for that.

168
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Yeah.

169
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
That's so dude.

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
That is so fucking funny.

171
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,440
It was a werewolf, like from Twilight.

172
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Yeah, it's his werewolf homie.

173
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
It wasn't a dog.

174
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Yeah, it was.

175
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Hot ass Taylor Lautner.

176
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Exactly.

177
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Sitting there.

178
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,280
And if you don't, if you're not gonna fuck Taylor Lautner, if you're not fucking the

179
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,800
crew, especially with a hottie like that, you better get the fuck out of my bed.

180
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,920
If you're not fucking, if you come over my place, you sucking my dick, you gotta suck

181
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,920
the wolfman's dick, you gotta suck the mummies dick, you gotta suck Dracula's dick.

182
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
You suckin' a whole squad, baby.

183
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Yep.

184
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Yep.

185
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,720
If you ain't sucking off the creature of the black lagoon in my house, in my- I live at

186
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
the black lagoon.

187
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,920
If you're not- You gotta suck me, and you gotta suck Flubber,

188
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
my number one homie.

189
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
And Abbie and Costello.

190
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
You gotta figure out how to suck-

191
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,160
(laughter)

192
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,000
- Who's on first?

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,240
That sucks.

194
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,640
- I don't fucking know.

195
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,100
- Who's on my one?

196
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,940
Who's on my one?

197
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,800
- Calling it your one, dude.

198
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,840
I think that's gonna catch on.

199
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,280
I think it's gonna be a, it's gonna be called,

200
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,120
it's gonna be my one.

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,960
- Yeah, 'cause that's where the number one,

202
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,160
that's where the number one comes out.

203
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,280
- Yeah, you go number one out of that.

204
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,480
- Yeah, and then your number two is your blood.

205
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
I don't want to talk about that.

206
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
No, that's nasty.

207
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,160
It's going to be a number one winter.

208
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
We don't go there.

209
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Well, you have, no, it would be your number, your butt would be your number three because

210
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
there's two under the one.

211
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
What?

212
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,080
There's two balls under the one penis.

213
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,040
Why would your ass be number three though?

214
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Because that's behind it.

215
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
You only got one.

216
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Really?

217
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Hold on, I'll tell you, Caleb.

218
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,760
I guess you do have three things there.

219
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Two butt cheeks and a butthole.

220
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Take a three, take the three, right?

221
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Uh-huh.

222
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Flip it on its side.

223
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
What does it look like?

224
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
It's a nine now.

225
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
What?

226
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,200
Turn the three upside down, it's a nine now.

227
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
You no.

228
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
It's a Drake song.

229
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I was, well the three.

230
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
I turn the three upside down, it's a three now.

231
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,720
Three upside down looks like butt cheeks.

232
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
It's an E.

233
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Or balls.

234
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Turn the three upside down, it's a E now.

235
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,840
He should have done that like 50 more times in that song.

236
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Yeah.

237
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Yeah.

238
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Yeah.

239
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,920
I turn the I upside down, it's a line now.

240
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,440
There needs to be more math.

241
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,400
She fingered on my one and then I run my hand through her 10,000.

242
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:17,480
her hair. Oh silly you, only God knows the number of hairs on a person's head. She's

243
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,840
thinking on my one till I have four. What? Four is a con. She's wondering on my one. Oh

244
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:31,320
no, four is because there's two balls and that's what they make. Wait, she's fiving

245
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:45,320
my one. Oh, you're right. Fiving my one. She's 32ing. How many sperms in a spray of sperm?

246
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,840
(laughter)

247
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,000
- 100 million per milliliter.

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
(laughter)

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
- No way.

250
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,600
I have way less than that.

251
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,200
- She's having my one till I have 100 million.

252
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
- 500 million?

253
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,280
(laughter)

254
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,880
- That's disgusting.

255
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,680
- I have way less sperm than that.

256
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,720
- Yeah, yeah I guess, yeah.

257
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,480
- I think I have one big one that shoots out.

258
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,240
- Until I, 30 million plus 70 million microplastics.

259
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,500
(laughter)

260
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,320
I can feel the microplastics dude.

261
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,280
I can see them in my cum because I have micro eyes.

262
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
They're pink.

263
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,680
They look like the beads in hand soap that they used to have.

264
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Remember when they used to have that?

265
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,520
Remember when they thought that was a good idea to just put pieces of plastic in hand

266
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
soap?

267
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,440
Yeah, they put pieces of plastic in hand soap and then it would fuck up like fish.

268
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah, you'd just, you'd fucking, you'd bite into a fucking roll of sushi and you'd get

269
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,800
just like plastic in your mouth.

270
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:55,320
cool dude yeah such a genius imagineering feat. Remember when they think it's cool to put like a toothpick through a sandwich yeah it always gets stuck in your throat that's right

271
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,360
they put a fucking napkin on the side of your plate it's like okay I'm gonna eat

272
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,720
this yeah I wipe my head on it there's food on it yeah I gotta get the food off

273
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,920
these days I might think the napkin might be cake or something honestly the napkin

274
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,920
the napkin is one of the worst garnishes of all time definitely stop putting napkins on my food

275
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
on my food.

276
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
When they fold it to look like a swan?

277
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
I want swan.

278
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Yeah.

279
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
I've never tasted this before.

280
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Now I'm hungry for swan.

281
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
It tastes like cloth.

282
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Have they made, is there a swan burger?

283
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I'm so hungry for swan.

284
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Can you eat swan?

285
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120

I need swan so bad.

293
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
I need a swan song.

294
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I need to get home and butcher a flamingo so bad.

295
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
My stomach is so full.

296
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
I need a swan song.

297
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
I need a swan song.

298
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
I need to get home and butcher a flamingo so bad.

299
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,800
I need to go home and butcher a flamingo so bad.

300
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,600
I need emu.

301
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,840

Oh god.

304
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,120
I bet any one of those tastes pretty fucking good.

305
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Yeah they probably all taste like chicken.

306
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Every bird tastes good.

307
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh I need emperor penguin nuggets.

308
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,240
I heard penguin's the one that doesn't taste good.

309
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Really?

310
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,480
I looked up what penguin tastes like and I guess it tastes like, it smells like shit

311
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
and tastes like it too.

312
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,280
I guess it's like super oily.

313
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,880
It says they taste like a piece of beef, odiferous codfish, and a canvas-baked duck roast together

314
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,520
in a pot with blood and cod liver oil for sauce.

315
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
What?

316
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,080
They taste like what?

317
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,080
The meat is smudge-like pork, sweet, succulent, rich.

318
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,560
What did I read then?

319
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,680
You read about that dookie penguin dude from fucking Dookie's Burg.

320
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,680
it

321
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,680
it's

322
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,680
I feel like it might not. I don't know. I think it's too cold. I've never touched a penguin but it looks rubbery and disgusting.

323
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,680
I'm looking up penguin burger. I feel like penguin would be hard to chew.

324
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Yeah. Especially if it was raw. Yeah, the feathers on it.

325
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,680
You know what would look... You know what... Also they're covered in oil, aren't they?

326
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,680
You know what might taste really good?

327
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Andean condor.

328
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,960
you think now condors not any any scavengers not gonna taste very good nah

329
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,440
dude I think condor would taste amazing I think some yeah some some condor tenders

330
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,840
condor wings condor to look at think about how big those wings are yeah okay

331
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,320
okay that's the biggest way you make it a fucking any bird if you cover it in

332
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,320
garlic parmesan or or that'd be like a wing the size of this fucking mic arm

333
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,760
Yeah. You don't want that. That's the biggest, dude that's, yes I do eat a flint stone sized wing.

334
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,320
A condor is way bigger than your mic arm. Really? Condors are fucking huge.

335
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,720
Condors are like, have like several wingspan. I'm so scared of big birds.

336
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,720
But I mean who knows how much of that is actual wing meat.

337
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,920
You know. Oh Pat I have a, I have a prehistoric animal for you to look at.

338
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,720
Oh man. If you're afraid of big birds. This guy, dude, oh fuck dude, the California condor it's like.

339
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,040
I really hate looking at this picture.

340
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,920
Am I going to be scared of this?

341
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,320
It's a pterodactyl the size of a giraffe.

342
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,820
This doesn't scare me because it looks like it's made in a Playstation 1.

343
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,120
Look at the size comparison to a human.

344
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
It's huge.

345
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
A condor?

346
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
No, no, as darkid.

347
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,000
That thing is weird.

348
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,680
It's the largest flying animal, but they believed they were ground hunters.

349
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,320
So they would run around and eat shit up.

350
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
This thing could fly?

351
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
Oh fuck dude, it would run?

352
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,600
The size of a fucking giraffe?

353
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Holy shit.

354
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,840
Dude, a big bird like this shit, like a big bird like this is so fucked up.

355
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:58,240
I saw like a video of a bald eagle at the vet and it was just like, it fucked me up

356
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,720
realizing how big a bald eagle is.

357
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,480
Yeah, for the listeners, the As Dark It had a wingspan of 33 to 39 feet.

358
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Oh, God.

359
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Oh, look at it!

360
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,520
And it lived alongside humans in the Garden of Eden.

361
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,360
I fucking, you know what I hate too?

362
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Looking at baby birds.

363
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Baby birds look fucked up.

364
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
You sound sarcastic.

365
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
You know what I hate?

366
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
You put the emphasis on birds in that.

367
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,960
You hate looking at baby birds.

368
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,360
You only hate the bird part, right?

369
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Yeah.

370
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
What?

371
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
See, I don't care.

372
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
What?

373
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,960
I hate looking at baby birds. Yeah, you hate baby bird. Oh, I hate baby birds. Yeah, I hate when babies are birds. I

374
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Hate when somebody tells me

375
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,440
Dude the fucking oh, oh

376
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,120
There's looking at pictures of baby birds now, it's like retching and

377
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,760
Squetching and being weird when you look at a baby bird. I will check is like a little like a little chicken

378
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:03,480
Condors have some serious cock face on them. Yeah, they got some cock and balls head

379
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:11,240
Holy condor face. Oh, yeah. Wow serious fucking nuts and cocks and balls for the ice

380
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,480
I hate big birds, but I do love I do love a cardinal you hate big birds. I

381
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,720
Love one that'll change your mind. Yeah. Yeah, you hate big birds. So he turns he turns it

382
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,260
I'll fucking know some fucking hippie piece of shit town. Yeah, so liberal some

383
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:36,960
It now the fuck is that fucking college town, that's right, that's right school town

384
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,400
That's right. They got all these fucking stupid. It's liberal fucking preschool town. I'm so sick

385
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,920
I'm so sick of these motherfuckers. I'm so sick of not living there

386
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,880
That's what you say signs up in front of their fucking restaurants and shit. They say today's letter is M

387
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,360
Fucking bullshit

388
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,040
Yeah, singing to me about sharing

389
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,840
Yeah, I'm not sharing shit with you. Tell you what there's a whole lot of America between San Francisco and Sesame Street

390
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,800
Lot of the people in Washington seems like they forget that sometimes

391
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Yeah, I would hate to live on Sesame Street, bro. Yeah, every day you wake up suck dude. You're trying to fucking babies everywhere

392
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,600
Don't know adults

393
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,040
Famous actors

394
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,000
Famous actor

395
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,480
And snuffle effigies starts talking to mr. Hooper. Yeah, yo, I would I would chill with snuffy

396
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
What's his name in the fucking toilet or the trash?

397
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Oscar?

398
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
The green one.

399
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Yeah.

400
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,280
Oscar, did I ever show you my Oscar the Grouch costume as a baby?

401
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,440
Was it similar to your Grinch costume where you chose a much too dark of a shade of green?

402
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
No.

403
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Okay.

404
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,320
It was light green.

405
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
My mom did it.

406
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,320
And what color were the lips?

407
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Brown.

408
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,320
(laughter)

409
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Look, that was... alright.

410
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
And what'd you do with your hair?

411
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,320
(laughter)

412
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,320
That was a mistake. I didn't realize how dark that green was when I was the Grinch.

413
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

414
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
And you didn't realize how gold the chain was either. That was a big problem.

415
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
(laughter)

416
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,560
(laughing)

417
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,700
- Go ahead and make excuses.

418
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,640
- I don't think the green was that dark.

419
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,480
I think the only problem--

420
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,740
- Bro, you are losing your fucking mind

421
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,980
if you don't think that you wore full blackface on Halloween.

422
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,280
- I didn't wear blackface.

423
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,740
I was dressed up like the Grinch.

424
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,880
There's photos of me as the Grinch.

425
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,400
You were blacked out Santa all the way.

426
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,920
I was not blacked out Santa for Halloween.

427
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,200
You absolutely were.

428
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I was not.

429
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
You were blacked out Santa with Morgan Freeman freckles.

430
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Oh my god!

431
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
What the fuck dude?

432
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
A slime monster just came out of Matt's nose!

433
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm so sorry.

434
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm so sorry.

435
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm so sorry.

436
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm so sorry.

437
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm so sorry.

438
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm so sorry.

439
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm so sorry.

440
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm so sorry.

441
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm so sorry.

442
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm so sorry.

443
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm so sorry.

444
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
I'm so sorry.

445
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm so sorry.

446
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm so sorry.

447
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm so sorry.

448
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm so sorry.

449
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Oh my god.

450
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
That was so crazy.

451
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
That was so gross.

452
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Oh my god.

453
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
That was insane.

454
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Where did you put it?

455
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Where did you put it?

456
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
I just sucked it back up my nose.

457
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
No.

458
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Oh shit.

459
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Oh dude.

460
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
No.

461
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
He's gonna come back later for sure.

462
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
It's under his desk.

463
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
It's under his chair right now.

464
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
There's someone in my...

465
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Oh fuck dude.

466
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I gotta...

467
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Hold on.

468
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
We gotta pause.

469
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I gotta get a napkin.

470
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
We can't pause.

471
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Just go.

472
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
We'll just keep talking about it.

473
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Holy shit dude.

474
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
That was insane.

475
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
That was like...

476
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Did you not...

477
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
It was like blue.

478
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,680
It was like perfectly blue.

479
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,480
It was like when the fucking android dies an alien and he just sprays like milk everywhere.

480
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,200
Yeah, no he's definitely, like me and Cam have this theory that Pat's just gonna get

481
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,600
COVID every two weeks for the rest of the year.

482
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,880
I think that's gonna happen.

483
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
I think he's back, this is round two.

484
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
I think this is proof, yeah.

485
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
I think this is hard proof.

486
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
This is hard proof that you have COVID again.

487
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,440
I don't have COVID again.

488
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
You do.

489
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:46,440
I

490
00:22:46,440 --> 00:23:01,440
for

491
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,160
Are you, it was the shade of the eyebrows maybe.

492
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,600
It was not the shade of the eyebrows.

493
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,080
I didn't wear blackface on Halloween.

494
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,720
You I have, there's so much photographic proof that you did.

495
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,760
I did not wear blackface on Halloween.

496
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
Also the Grinch.

497
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,400
I was dressed up like the Grinch.

498
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,960
Why did you not get a lighter green?

499
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,560
The Grinch is such a light green.

500
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,200
I literally, I went to the one, like I went to a place in my neighborhood and found a

501
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,600
a dollar tube of green face paint and just put that on.

502
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:41,480
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. There's so many pictures of me and like hanging

503
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,960
out in my apartment that it's all you all we really need is one picture that shows how

504
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,280
it looked in the bar lighting. Doesn't matter how many.

505
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,160
That'd be so funny if like that comes out like people like try to like cancel be whatever

506
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:07,660
for it. I'm canceling you for it. Here's Patrick Doherty blackface out of a bar. I'm gonna do

507
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:18,800
it. This is the pig I have. No, no, that's green. That is green. That is not green. I'll

508
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,160
text it to you right now so you can have it. That is green. Who am I with in that photo?

509
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,560
uh... i don't know

510
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,160
i think i could get

511
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,040
stressy

512
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,640
does mean jesse okay but yeah i don't think it did photos are

513
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,880
because i think that i don't mean a friend

514
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,800
and i think we're blurry and you and your and uh...

515
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,280
brown grease paint

516
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,960
no no no

517
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,520
dot you you clearly no moments of clarity and that's really that's great

518
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,080
That is, that looks green dude.

519
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
No fucking way.

520
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,280
If it looks green then post it right now with no caption.

521
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,240
It's way worse by the way that you didn't do your neck.

522
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:08,120
You did a perfect circle over your face and the rest of your body is white.

523
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Yeah.

524
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Fuck you man.

525
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,560
If it's green put it on Instagram right now.

526
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
I did!

527
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
There is a picture of me on my Instagram.

528
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
I want an Instagram right now.

529
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
I don't have to do it.

530
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Halloween is over.

531
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:31,320
You're like a deleted boss from Cuphead.

532
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,760
Don't snort again.

533
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Please don't slide again.

534
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
I can only take it once.

535
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Oh man.

536
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
Alright.

537
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,600
You guys want to do our beautiful list?

538
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Yeah okay.

539
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,240
Is there anything else important we have to talk about?

540
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Oh no.

541
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:55,240
By the way, I was gonna come with a costume today, but I have COVID and I can't go to

542
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,160
the costume store. So Patrick, you have kicked the can down the road just one more week.

543
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,520
But I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you good.

544
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,320
I can go outside.

545
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,120
If you... no. You can't go outside.

546
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,640
Yeah, I can. I can go buy a costume right now.

547
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,640
No, that's cheating by the way because we're gonna have a war and that's not how a war works

548
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
You can't cheat in a war so I can cheat in a war

549
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,600
You actually can't because I just looked up the rules of war on Wikipedia and it's one of the Geneva

550
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,800
Conventions that you can't any verse you can't cheat in an actual war. So don't call them that Patrick

551
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,600
What you can't say that?

552
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,240
Geneva can't say that. Oh my god. Stop

553
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Stop, I'm sick of these Geneva's at my convention

554
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:51,520
I was laughing at myself last night imagining I was actually thinking about

555
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,240
war. You were laughing at the war? You must be a psychopath.

556
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,640
The seagulls from Finding Nemo but they're saying war war war.

557
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,400
like strife strife pain pain pain yeah that was really getting me pretty good

558
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,320
so I'm glad you reminded me of that okay anyway today's list top 10 most wanted

559
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:28,720
superpowers from l9me line nine me line it nine me probably line nine yo she

560
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
She nining on my one.

561
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,000
Line me, nine me, get down on my one and make my spine creak.

562
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,520
She nining on my one because the wedding ring finger doesn't count.

563
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
True.

564
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,720
Is she not married tonight?

565
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:52,560
Okay, number one is teleportation.

566
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,220
This first person is very creative with the power of teleportation.

567
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,640
If you could teleport yourself and other objects, it would be the most powerful power in my opinion.

568
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,600
Teleport sickness out of others' bodies, teleport heads off villains in a superhero villain

569
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,140
world, teleport yourself out of bed, your clothes on, dirt off dirty things.

570
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,360
It beats seeing the future because you don't need to if you are ready for anything.

571
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,160
Even someone with regenerative powers.

572
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,600
Just teleport every atom into a star in our universe.

573
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,000
You could even see how big the universe is or if there are other dimensions by teleporting

574
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
there.

575
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,240
This is, however, just hoping that you can also teleport other objects.

576
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,920
That's a good point.

577
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
He's very liberal with the term teleport.

578
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Bro, drop me into the fucking Jumper universe and I'm gonna change NBA history forever.

579
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,920
He's teleported!

580
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Oh, and Kayla Pitts comes with a beautiful teleportation dunk over LeBron James.

581
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Oh, and he teleported into LeBron's body and he made him explode!

582
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
You think they would make a...

583
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,920
LeBron James' brains and entrails are all over Madison Square Garden.

584
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:07,880
and

585
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,820
hundred times a second yeah you just tell you what just a million times a second

586
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,680
just go that's right just the ball back and forth I also teleport objects

587
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,880
teleport the ball Disney World I tell her the ball I'd score one point on a

588
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,120
free-throw I'd miss the second one then I teleport the ball into my stomach oh I

589
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,920
don't know where the ball went Oh me oh I don't know I've always been this fat

590
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Oh, I guess we just had to wait for the time to run out.

591
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Oh no, my baby's being born and then teleport a random baby from the hospital onto the court.

592
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Oh no, it was twins! Now we have two.

593
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Now I'm just wasting time.

594
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,920
But yeah, I think teleportation, the obvious move is to go sports.

595
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:02,760
You know, yeah. Yeah, I guess I mean I would I would teleport I teleport to the front of the front of the line

596
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,600
Yeah at the line at the line store. Yeah at the queue

597
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,880
Here's a comment from master hand. I would definitely want this

598
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,240
I can go anywhere without having to spend five hours just to get to my destination

599
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:23,980
This guy takes five hours to go anywhere. Okay, five hours to go to the grocery store. Yeah good. This is good. Okay, would you

600
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:32,300
Would you rather have travel as it is now, you know, where different things take different

601
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
lengths of time.

602
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,860
Or teleportation.

603
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,580
Or it takes two hours to get anywhere in the world.

604
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Two hours to get anywhere.

605
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,940
Okay, does that count like if I want to like step, take one step?

606
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
No, no, no.

607
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,180
If you're going from city to, or not city, if you're leaving your neighborhood, it takes

608
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
two hours.

609
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,660
Okay, my neighborhood's the whole world, because I'm a world.

610
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,860
not a world citizen, you're not a citizen of the world. I would be in this world.

611
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,620
No, in this world you're explicitly as the god of this world, by the way I'm god

612
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:06,240
in this universe. Okay, I would not want to live there. You would be lucky if I was your god,

613
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,380
by the way. You'd be very lucky because I take good care of you because you're my

614
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:16,100
friend. Lucky in the way that people who get struck by lightning are lucky, no thanks. No, lucky in the way that

615
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,860
like got 50 year old guys who hook up with 18 year olds say that they got last

616
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:27,300
night. That kind of lucky. So you are you are gonna get seriously lucky if you let me be

617
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:34,180
God. Mm-hmm lucky like the first guy who dies from 5G. No. No thanks. No I'm not talking. It's gonna be

618
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:41,620
it's gonna be one of us. 5G? For sure. First guys? I'm gonna I think it could be me. You might be 5G.

619
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,260
You might be completely 5G at this point. Yeah. Yeah there's nobody in this world who has more

620
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:54,180
artificial thing sitting in his body than you. Yeah thank you for saying that.

621
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:03,220
So you're not gonna answer my hypothetical then? You're just gonna complain about me being God?

622
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,180
No Patrick you can answer. I already answered. What'd you say? I said two hours.

623
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,900
You take the two hours thing? Really? Yeah. I feel like that's cool man you could split

624
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:20,340
your time between here and Seoul. Yeah. Oh my god. Dude, if I wanted to go to a Korean Costco.

625
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:32,300
Oh man. I go to India. Crazy shit. I come back. I can bring Yummy Say Tummy back to my house.

626
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,780
We're like, Pat, where have you been? He walks in with 50 bags from Hitler Men's Clothing.

627
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,500
He's like, "Ah, just shopping.

628
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,340
"I just went shopping."

629
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,160
- Can you bring stuff?

630
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,000
- Dude, are you kidding me?

631
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,940
That'd be so funny.

632
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,180
- What do you mean, what if you bring stuff with you?

633
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,100
- I go to Yummy's to tell me I bring the whole restaurant

634
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,940
back and I put it in my neighborhood.

635
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,780
- Oh.

636
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,060
- It doesn't take me two hours to get there anymore.

637
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,900
- Okay.

638
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,140
- Even if I'm carrying something,

639
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,300
it'll still take me two hours,

640
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,540
so I'll just carry the whole restaurant.

641
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,380
- Here's, you know what?

642
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,220
If I'm your God, I might make it so you have super strength

643
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,100
and you're able to pick up a restaurant,

644
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,620
but if you don't accept me as your God in this,

645
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,740
then you're fucked honestly

646
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,520

00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,600
been eating tons of candy because I got a big belly. You got the no taste? I just, I can taste

682
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:40,360
it a little bit. You bet had no taste. Oh, shit. Damn. Fuck. Fuck. Mm-hmm.

683
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:47,080
I didn't get the no taste thing. My taste is like, I wouldn't say I have no taste,

684
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:54,080
but it's definitely muted. So today I ate like 15 Reese's Pieces.

685
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,080
That's not very much. It's just a handful.

686
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,080
That's a small amount. I thought you were supposed to eat like one.

687
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,080
What are you talking about?

688
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,080
I get the individually packaged one.

689
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:20,800
I get the individually packaged one as a, they all come in a little box, you open the box

690
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
they're twisty wrapped.

691
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,680
The individual packaged Reese's Pieces?

692
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Yeah.

693
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,280
I just get, I eat one at a time, so I had 15 today, I went kinda crazy.

694
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,680
It's like, you know when you get like the Advil from the, like the, the one thing, the

695
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
two of them?

696
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
It's just one Reese's Pieces.

697
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,600
My stomach was hurting last night because I had seven grains of Fun Dip.

698
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:48,440
Oh my god, my stomach, I'm having a, I had a pop rock.

699
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Yeah.

700
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Number two.

701
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,840
Imagine flying over everything and seeing everyone super tiny down below and yet you

702
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,600
were up high doing your own thing.

703
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,180
You would feel so good and free.

704
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,620
Flight is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.

705
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,880
Flying is the best superpower and no one can argue with that.

706
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,480
kind of transportation and helpful for certain situations.

707
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,600
I believe I can fly.

708
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Ever since I was little, I have dreamed of creating a device to make us fly.

709
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,480
What does this comment mean?

710
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,560
Pasco Dodo's kendo was the way I can get the one room to get my baby.

711
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
True.

712
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,760
Who is Pasco Dodo?

713
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Here's a comment.

714
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,680
Flight is a born savage.

715
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
True.

716
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,040
I can fly to not get bullied.

717
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,600
sad

718
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,160
they get bullied way harder if they're not a school was flying yeah sub-u

719
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,760
fucking fly and has prisoners

720
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,080
you know i think there's a good school would see you flying say this kid can't

721
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,120
take the bus

722
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,760
yeah right

723
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,480
this has to go for the bus

724
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,720
as i don't have a car

725
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,320
that's why i don't like to school is not to have a car can't even a policy like

726
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,980
get your head out of the clouds

727
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:10,340
come back to earth. And people online would probably bully you and say touch grass.

728
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:17,940
Touch grass with your feet, you can't, you're levitating. Plus a football team would probably

729
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:25,580
fuck you if they caught you. Probably turn you out. Probably fuck you out of your sandals.

730
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,260
They fuck you silly probably.

731
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,820
They might corner you in the locker room and like, I don't even want to go there.

732
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,500
That would suck so bad.

733
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,140
Let's just say it includes 1's and 2's.

734
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,380
There's gonna be a thing on your 1.

735
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,380
And unfortunately a 65.

736
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
Ohhhh.

737
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,380
Ohhhh.

738
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,380
Sorry.

739
00:38:49,380 --> 00:39:03,520
Sorry. Number three is telekinesis. What? Telekinesis species. I think, okay, two, these two battle

740
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,140
it out in my superpowers I think. Flight and telekinesis? No, no, no, no. Teleportation

741
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:16,860
and telekinesis. You don't want time control? Hmm. Time control, there's too much temptation

742
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:33,980
in

743
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:46,560
time

744
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
That'd be kind of scary, right?

745
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
You worry about getting paused forever?

746
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
That's crazy to think about.

747
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Yeah, I know. That's some real shit.

748
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
That's some fucking Isaac Asimov shit.

749
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,560
I wouldn't do time control because, um...

750
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,560
I don't want to waste any time on anybody else's time, you know?

751
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
I don't want to...

752
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Think about everyone else.

753
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Oh my god, if you were in charge of time, kill me, man.

754
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,020
I don't want to for you to be I mean yeah horrible man just fast forward every 10

755
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:28,720
minutes like as you got yeah everybody's this is a bad 10 minutes yeah yeah

756
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,720
about telekinesis if you really think about a telekinesis would be considered

757
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,920
would considered to be one of the most destructive superpower you could have

758
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,200
let's say if you are somewhere surrounded by people and your nemesis is

759
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,960
in the same room with you. You could inflect pain upon your nemesis by using your power

760
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,020
and move things around. You could move and item towards that person and he/she can trip

761
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,800
or you cold make something fall on top of them. And the best part is that no one can

762
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,260
see you doing it. If you were among for the kill you can just move and random object and

763
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,260
keep hitting the person until they die. Also it is also good for stealing things. You can

764
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,900
just move the things towards you and then you can claim that item as yours. It also

765
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,880
good for defense too. You can just move and object around you quickly so that no one can

766
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,720
come through you. It also saves you from doing the bloody job. Like if you want to cut a

767
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,520
carrot but you are afraid to risk your hand. There are many stuff you can do with telekinesis

768
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,140
including conjuring water, freezing ice, and etc.

769
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,140
The bloody job?

770
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,640
Yeah, cutting a carrot.

771
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,240
What is the bloody job?

772
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,260
Like if you want to cut a carrot but you are afraid to risk your hand.

773
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
The bloody job?

774
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,000
Well if I was afraid to risk my hand, I'd wear a glove.

775
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,880
I would use my telekinesis power. Yeah, that's true. It's basically just like the force if

776
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,160
you think about it. Now do you like it, Pat? Whoa, okay. I can get stuff with my mind if

777
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:57,160
my arms are weak. True. I would just be, I feel like if I had telekinesis I'd probably

778
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,540
pretty quickly reach six, seven hundred pounds. Yeah, that's true. There'd be no reason for

779
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,640
me to ever fucking move. You could remove the food out of your stomach without having

780
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,180
to throw up yeah yeah oh that's a good point yeah I guess so but I wouldn't do

781
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,520
that no I of course I would be if I had the chance to be 700 pounds I would I

782
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,640
would do it if I gets just skip directly to 700 pounds right now you would do it I

783
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,440
feel like I would do it I think I would do it is that's the I would like to do

784
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,560
it for one day yeah you know what be 700 pounds for one day I just want to I just

785
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,240
I just want to prove to people who are 700 pounds that you can actually walk around still.

786
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,880
Like I just want to like kind of rub it in their face.

787
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:47,000
Like you're 700 pounds for one day, immediately be like the most fit 700 pound guy of all time.

788
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,040
If I was 700 pounds for one day, you know my ass rolling down a big hill.

789
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,720
I'm rolling you down the big hill if you were 700 pounds for one day.

790
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,520
And you're also 700 pounds.

791
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,120
What if like it's all three of us and we're 700 pounds and we're playing with a stick of

792
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,220
butter together. That might be good if like all three of us got like really really fat

793
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:12,080
like insanely like I feel like we would pretty quickly have like a Comedy Central 15 minute

794
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,160
sketch show. What if you guys are like 700 pounds and I become like 50 pounds? Yeah.

795
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,560
Like maybe we took all of Cameron's weight. You should be one of those guys who like loses

796
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,480
every part of your body except for like your head and like half of your torso. Yeah. Yeah.

797
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,760
you wear it where a 700 pound guys who just carry you around like a backpack

798
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,160
yeah we have a travel show yeah Thunderdome I was singing about that I

799
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,720
got when you got nothing like that you might as well just be like a slice of

800
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,480
bread yeah absolutely might as well be like a paper bag at that point you bro

801
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,640
I'm in there I mean like you were just a torso there's guys who are just torsos

802
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I'm gonna search up just "torso man".

803
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
It's one by Metallica. They invented it.

804
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
Yeah.

805
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Isn't that... yeah.

806
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,640
Wait, is that what one is about?

807
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
Yeah.

808
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,640
I thought it was about a guy, a fan that killed himself.

809
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
What?

810
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
I thought that one...

811
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
You think it was Stan?

812
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
By Eminem?

813
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
I thought it was a Metallica fan who killed himself.

814
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
Imagine me in this guy.

815
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Let me take a look at this fellow.

816
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,040
Let's see here.

817
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,480
That guy is not much.

818
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Yeah.

819
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
Oh yeah.

820
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,040
Well good for him, he's like wrestling and shit.

821
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,040
Yeah.

822
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,040
That's sick.

823
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,920
It's cool when like someone's like half a torso or whatever and then they like, or like

824
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
there's a, what's his name?

825
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,880
Right, I mean cause it's cool cause he's trying really hard but he might as well just be a

826
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
plant.

827
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
*laughter*

828
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Well he doesn't have to do all this trying hard shit.

829
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,880
Oh, Felipe, Felipe Nunez.

830
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Felipe Nunez.

831
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,880
What about him?

832
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
He's sick.

833
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,880
Felipe Nunez is sick as fuck.

834
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Is he a skater?

835
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880
He's a skater with no legs.

836
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Alright, I'm looking at him and he has legs that are just very small.

837
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Well, hold on, does he have legs?

838
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
Yeah.

839
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,880
No.

840
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,880
I'm looking at him right now, he has legs.

841
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:22,320
Oh he does have little legs. What? Oh and here he has big legs. Oh man this guy's faking it.

842
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:35,280
I think he's faking it. I think he's just faking the whole thing. He's got legs under there.

843
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,560
fours invisibility here's a comment invisibility would be fun I love being

844
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,160
invisible

845
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:49,320
I didn't seek imagine you've been you've had the power to go invisible for like

846
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,920
years and you're like you're keeping it a secret like the CIA is after you they

847
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,800
finally catch you because they trace your IP because you posted on the top

848
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:03,640
ten we need you we need you to be a spy I would just go invisible in that

849
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:10,840
situation to true what when would you guys put your invisibility cutting in

850
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:16,440
line all the time yeah that'd be really good well wouldn't a teleportation be

851
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,360
better for cutting up no because then people would see you teleported with

852
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,840
still see you be invisible people would see you teleport to the front of the

853
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,040
line and get freaked the fuck out at you so you think you think that if you're

854
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,720
invisible and you cut in line people would just hold the empty space that you

855
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:37,180
were standing in in the line yeah I think so before you only got like three people

856
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,600
ahead like you know yeah well yeah I would just go straight I'd go right into

857
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,560
wherever I was going and then I'd do I'd walk to the front of the line I'd walk

858
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,320
into the into the bathroom invisible and then I'd come out of the bathroom mm-hmm

859
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:58,800
I bet what if all the stalls are taken there's a line for the stalls then I

860
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,400
I pick something up and pretend to be a ghost and scare everyone out.

861
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
That's pretty good.

862
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:12,040
And then after that, yeah, and then you'd walk out and say, "There was a ghost in there?"

863
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,040
That's the thing.

864
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,080
I think invisibility, there's two ways to cut a line here.

865
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,880
I think teleportation is the one that people will get mad at you for because like, yes,

866
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,480
you're cutting the line, but like they can see you teleport from the back to the front.

867
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,400
like invisibility you can just get rid of the line by becoming a ghost.

868
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,520
That's another good power.

869
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,240
Like camcorder.

870
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,760
Yeah, because invisibility is the second if you're invisible you have two powers which is the power

871
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,800
yeah it's the two powers that you have you have invisibility then the power for the fright

872
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:52,080
and then also third power uh line destruction

873
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:01,520
third power line destruction fourth power uh uh toilet paper suit toilet paper suit

874
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,480
and wrap yourself up that's part of fright is that okay yeah because that's a mummy

875
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:15,760
so that's under fright yeah all right if you're the invisible man under the mummy suit

876
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,560
the invisible man was wore a mummy suit in the movie

877
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,280
Remember he wrapped himself up with those bandages.

878
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,280
They should have called that movie "The Mummy".

879
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,280
He was the cool mummy.

880
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,280
He was just wrapped up in bandages with sunglasses on.

881
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,280
True.

882
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
That was his shit.

883
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,280
He saw the mummy and thought, "I'm gonna go cooler."

884
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,280
Number five is

885
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,280
Immortality.

886
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
The question is, is this a power or a curse?

887
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,280
It's a curse.

888
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
Because if you're immortal but you're like aging

889
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
I ask myself that question about everything

890
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,280
that happens to me in daily life.

891
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,920
I make myself a sandwich, I think it's just a power.

892
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,920
Going to the bathroom?

893
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,920
We'll find out.

894
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,920
Yeah.

895
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,080
Going to the bathroom, kind of a little of both, depending on the day.

896
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,080
Yeah.

897
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,400
Oh, screw off, naysayers.

898
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,600
I think that immortality rocks along invincibility.

899
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,080
Besides, who wants to be weak and mortal?

900
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
Okay, the devil.

901
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,080
Yeah.

902
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,080
Okay, the devil.

903
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Here's another comment.

904
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,080
It is the best.

905
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,080
That's the same guy.

906
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,080
He's invisible and fucking immortal.

907
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,080
Yeah.

908
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:22,940
best. That's the same guy. He's invisible and fucking immortal. If I was immortal, I don't

909
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:30,040
think I'd have a good time. Here's a comment. It would be useful to a chicken. True. That

910
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,880
is true. Chickens have pretty short lifespans, I guess. Yeah, that is true. Number six, predicting

911
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:49,940
the future. I wouldn't want this. See if I get a beard. I mean this is useful pretty

912
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:55,480
much only for the lottery right? Yeah. Like everything else is like you're kind

913
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,760
of like you don't really want to know. Yeah definitely. Oh you kidding me?

914
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,160
Here's another good comment. Imagine knowing what comes next at

915
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,960
at any time or in any time zone.

916
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,720
- If I could predict the future,

917
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,700
I'd see who my spouse was,

918
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,860
and then I would immediately--

919
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,480
- I would see who your spouse was and marry them.

920
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,520
- Yeah, I'd seduce them instantly.

921
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,840
- I'd see who my spouse was

922
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,480
and then immediately play a trick on them.

923
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,520
'Cause then it's like, well, I know

924
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,200
that you're gonna be my spouse in the future,

925
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,040
but I can't try to do tricks to you now.

926
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,440
- So you wanna start a relationship

927
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,320
founded on deceit and cruelty.

928
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,160
- And tricks.

929
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,280
You'd rather like, like kind of subdue someone into marrying you with tricks.

930
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:42,440
You didn't trap them more than like, I didn't think this relationship is founded on tricks.

931
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
I'm doing it.

932
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,920
I'm doing a gesture thing.

933
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:52,680
What number seven about shape shifting, okay, shape shifting maybe is a third place for

934
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,680
me.

935
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,200
I think it's like teleportation would be sick telekinesis and then shape shifting.

936
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,620
You want to just be Kirby.

937
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,620
It would just be cool.

938
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,620
You want to be...

939
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,620
You want to just become Kirby?

940
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,180
You want to just turn into like a monster or something.

941
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,180
That would be tight.

942
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,460
Dude, I'd give myself two huge boobs if I was bored.

943
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,460
Here's what you'd say.

944
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,300
Disguise yourself as a sexy girl would be a great choice, but I prefer disguise as a

945
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,300
president so that I can fix this poor country.

946
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,500
I left that comment.

947
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,500
You better.

948
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
That's actually pretty good.

949
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,420
That is really, yeah.

950
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,420
It would be awesome.

951
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,380
I love animals and it would be cool to be able to become one.

952
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,140
Someday if I'm rich enough I'll hire a scientist to make a vaccination or something to give

953
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,540
me the power of shape shifting.

954
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:40,620
When I was a little kid I was convinced that I had this necklace, I got it like a swap

955
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,860
meet that had like a little piece of blue stone in it.

956
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,820
I was convinced that it was going to give me super powers and so I'd sit in my bed for

957
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,380
like an hour a day just trying to turn into an animal.

958
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,640
(snorting)

959
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,140
(laughing)

960
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,860
- It never worked though, I just put it on,

961
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,180
I just sit there and be like,

962
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,180
it's time to become Beast Boy or Meat Pie, it's right now.

963
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,860
- I wanted to be Beast Boy so bad.

964
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,700
- Oh, he was the coolest one.

965
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,740
- Beast Boy was so sick.

966
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,580
- He was the coolest one.

967
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,580
- Here's a comment, a bug, enough said.

968
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,780
(laughing)

969
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,220
- That would suck to turn into a bug for one second,

970
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,420
just immediately get squashed.

971
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,140
- Dude, yeah, you're a fly and you get

972
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,700
the fucking shit kicked out of you.

973
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,300
or you like because they they have such short life spans you like turn back to

974
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,580
being a person you're fifteen years older

975
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,460
yes i sucked it

976
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:36,180
you know whilst i love what i am sometimes i wish i was human

977
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,620
ten

978
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,900
uh... police

979
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,340
and

980
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,900
that has a bug

981
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:48,180
uh... i thought i was a little while ago but i keep his yeah

982
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,940
uh... could you

983
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:55,020
halfway shapeshift stuff, it would be awesome to go to school with a fluffy prehensile tail

984
00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:00,260
and giant wings please. Plus you could shapeshift yourself so you have more powers.

985
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,260
True.

986
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,260
It's true.

987
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,260
True.

988
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:08,540
Okay, number eight, super speed. What do you guys think? I think teleportation's just better.

989
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,540
Yeah, teleportation's better than super speed.

990
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,380
Yeah, super speed is worse in every single way.

991
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,380
Definitely.

992
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,780
I can't even think of one upside.

993
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:25,180
I don't know, I think maybe, yeah, super speed would be kind of cool.

994
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,260
No, it's worse than teleportation.

995
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,060
Okay, you're right, it's worse than teleportation.

996
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:35,660
Well, alright, what could you do, I mean, I guess if you had a job, if you were like...

997
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,380
Alright, it's better than teleportation now.

998
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,340
Okay, number nine.

999
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,620
No, if you had a job, it's like, if you were like...

1000
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,620
Alright, it's worse.

1001
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,880
if you were to u_p_s_ or something

1002
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,620
and you had a like do stuff like we'd like it you to package it all day

1003
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,280
located is it speed manipulation or super speed

1004
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,900
what's what i think i think what you think that's what we know is to things

1005
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,140
are

1006
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,160
like okay so calypso

1007
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,400
positing the question here if you were to do you think i would be what got into

1008
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,460
you in the last thirty seconds

1009
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,820
your your posit in the question if if you work for u_p_s_

1010
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:19,260
Do you mean USPS or UPS because you're driving a truck for UPS and that's what I mean by speed

1011
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,060
manipulation you would have to manipulate the car not like...

1012
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,380
I was thinking you guys could still drive a truck.

1013
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,260
Well yeah but like I'm talking about like a USPS guy in like a neighborhood like you

1014
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,220
see them like walking around here with the carts.

1015
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,420
They can still drive a truck.

1016
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,260
I'm talking about the carts guys, the guys with the carts.

1017
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,620
Still can drive a truck.

1018
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,940
Yeah they can still drive a truck but it's speed manipulation when you're driving...

1019
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,740
- I feel like I've been violated.

1020
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,580
- I know what you're talking about.

1021
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,980
- You have completely hijacked my hypothetical

1022
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,780
and injected words that make no sense

1023
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,180
and turned it about, now it's about your mailman.

1024
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,300
What are you doing to my question?

1025
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,980
- I'm trying to kill my mailman with speed.

1026
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,380
- I'm skipping my question now.

1027
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,340
I'm so upset I don't even wanna hear the answer.

1028
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,900
Super speed sucks, we're moving on.

1029
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,060
- Number nine, time manipulation.

1030
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,900
Oh is this where you got the speed manipulation thing from?

1031
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,900
No.

1032
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,900
It is.

1033
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,900
It's not.

1034
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,780
You looked at this and you were like I'm going to combine the two.

1035
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,060
No he was thinking about the other manipulations he's doing to people.

1036
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,060
Yeah.

1037
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,060
Why do you do that?

1038
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,060
You're a manipulator.

1039
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,060
I didn't do anything.

1040
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,380
You talked about how you're going to manipulate your future bride.

1041
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,260
I'm not going to do that.

1042
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,580
You said that.

1043
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,780
You said I'm going to manipulate her.

1044
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,740
You said I'm a regular Robert Durst.

1045
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:45,300
Yeah. Time manipulation, it should just say time travel.

1046
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:50,180
That just means like slow and sp- slow it, slow it up and speed it down.

1047
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,260
And pause it and play it.

1048
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,620
Yeah, okay so this is click.

1049
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,900
Subtitles on?

1050
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,180
Yeah, this is click.

1051
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,060
Yeah, that is click.

1052
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,660
I will say click remote might be my number one.

1053
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,180
Yeah, click remote would be sick.

1054
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,700
Click remote, you can do pretty much whatever you want.

1055
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:12,260
I mean yeah, it was awesome in the movie. He farted on girls boobs.

1056
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,260
He fucking, he would take a shit on his boss's desk.

1057
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,260
He farted in David Hasselhoff's mouth.

1058
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:24,260
Yeah, he would rewind and press play when the girls jumping boobies were running and jumping.

1059
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:31,260
And I mean, I feel like I'm a very much, I'm probably not anything like the real Adam Sandler, but I'm a lot like his characters.

1060
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,260
And so I feel like that appeals to me a lot.

1061
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:40,580
Here's a comment that's very mysterious.

1062
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,060
I could go back in time so the list I regret making was never made and I could time travel

1063
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,060
to June 29th.

1064
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,060
Hello.

1065
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,060
What's on June 29th?

1066
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,060
I don't know.

1067
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,060
Let me Google June 29th.

1068
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,060
This guy's a seer.

1069
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,060
Let's see what happens on June 29th.

1070
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,060
June 29th.

1071
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,060
It's Colin Jost's birthday.

1072
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,060
What are you going to...

1073
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,060
It was Colin Jost who left that comment.

1074
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,060
I don't know.

1075
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,060
I'm not going to read it.

1076
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,060

1079
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,060
I'm not going to read it.

1080
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,060
I'm not going to read it.

1081
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,060
I'm not going to read it.

1082
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,060
I'm not going to read it.

1083
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,060
He loves you's birthday!

1084
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,060
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

- Yeah, I know, Moe needs Net Nanny banned.

1102
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,200
Number 11, mind control.

1103
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,520

1104
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,600

1110
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:56,720
Uh, so the contenders, we have mind control. Mind control, I think, would freak me out too much.

00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,240
Yeah, I would not. Here's a comment.

1112

00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,400
What the hell? That's on mind control.

1114
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,720

Are you kidding me?

1137
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,520
Yeah, that would suck.

1138
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,320
the worst one appendage generation walking around like hearing everybody's thoughts

1139
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,240

You can see girls footsies in the summertime.

1143
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,160
They're wearing them damn flip-flops.

1144
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,160
Omni-lingualism.

1145
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,160
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
Shrinking ability.

1147
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,160
Magic.

1148
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,160
A smaller you means a bigger world that's ripe for exploration.

1149
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,160
Number 34, er, 35.

1150
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,160
Make anyone love you.

Yeah.

1153
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,160
That, there's a comment here.

1154
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Are you a bit messed in the brain?

1155
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:27,080
brain you could do that and much more with that useful nun sad loner style power.

1156
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,080
Number 39, summoning, levitation.

1157
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,680
That would be pretty good.

1158
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,680
Vision replication.

1159
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,200
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

1160
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
Sensing death.

1161
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,520
Freeze ray, just like Gru from Despicable Me.

1162
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,000
Nihil likenesis.

1163
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,400
And then number 53, the last one, concussion blasts.

1164
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,360
Dude, I would do concussion blasts.

1165
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,920
Yeah. You've already been blasted with plenty of concussions, I'm sure.

1166
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,920
Yeah.

1167
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
Okay.

1168
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,920
Okay.

1169
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,040
Oh, wait. Can I plug this something?

1170
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,040
Oh, yeah.

1171
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,120
Yeah. Me and Kai started a podcast about monsters. If you like monsters, you should listen to

1172
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,400
it. It's called Monster Crazy.

1173
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,320
Don't listen to it. Only listen to this one.

1174
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
Only listen to this one.

1175
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,320
Only listen to this one.

1176
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,040
But if you like monsters, you shouldn't.

1177
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,920
And you don't listen to his traitor podcast.

1178
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,920
When does it come out?

1179
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
It's out.

1180
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,920
Oh, my God.

1181
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,800
It's out today, I listened to it.

1182
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,640
I listened to this and then I had to record this fucking shit.

1183
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,760
I'm not done, I didn't even finish listening to it yet.

1184
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,960
I wanted to listen to it more.

1185
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,120
- Pray for me, because of how sick I am.

1186
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,120
- And don't pray for Caleb.

1187
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:33,960
- Yeah.

1188
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,800
- No, pray for Caleb.

1189
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,640
- Go to Caleb's house and make him sicker.

1190
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,480
- I do have the devil in me.

1191
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,160
- Go to Caleb's house and make him sicker.

1192
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,720
- Because otherwise I'll revenge you.

1193
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,880
- If you're sick right now, you have a free pass

1194
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,760
to go on the train, go to Caleb's house

1195
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,440
and sneeze in his mouth.

1196
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,360
- I'm gonna put a clip on you.

1197
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,640
Caleb's address is...

1198
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,320
I'm gonna twist one part of your body so many times that it turns into a real sensitive

1199
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,920
clit and I'm gonna flick it to death.

1200
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,920
Really?

1201
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,920
Yeah, Pat.

1202
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,920
So keep talking, buddy.

1203
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
See what happens.

1204
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,920
So I'd have a clit?

1205
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,920
Yep, but I'm gonna put it somewhere really inconvenient.

1206
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:03,920
Like that part of your...

1207
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,280
You will never be able to find it.

1208
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,280
I'm gonna put...

1209
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,280
I'm gonna put...

1210
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,280
Hell, I already can't.

1211
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,240
I'm gonna put a clit on that one part of your back that you can't reach.

1212
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,680
Oh, yeah.

1213
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,680
Rats.

1214
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,680
Good luck, buddy.

1215
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,680
Bye.

1216
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,680
I'd love to go down on my thing.
