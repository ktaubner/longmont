00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
[Music]

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,760
Love. What is love?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,240
[Music]

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,320
You sound like the book from It Takes Two.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
[Music]

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,040
A chemical reaction? No, too simple.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,560
Is it total selflessness in the face of all adversity? No, too high-minded.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,840
Is it attacking someone with a hammer? No.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,560
How about with a wrench? No, that is ratchet and clank.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,720
No, love is everything.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,880
Big and small, small and large, large and in charge, and charge ahead we shall, into the

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:51,320
throes of passion, into the story of one beautiful Italian woman named Pagina.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,160
Pagina you see is without love on this Valentine's Day, after her heart was torn in two by her

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,200
sweet man

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,720
kyle crime rate

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,160
she dramatically

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,100
and suddenly moved her entire life

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,720
to see if she could find love somewhere else somewhere new

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,400
somewhere romantic

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,480
somewhere grand

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,160
full of lust and fire

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,060
fire of the heart

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,520
Worcester, Massachusetts

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,640
according to their website

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,640
it is the country's most vibrant in livable mid-sized city

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
that's what it says

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
is it livable?

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
that shit describes Worcester

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,640
yeah, it's appropriate levels of oxygen

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Worcester, Massachusetts

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
there are roads in Worcester

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
running water

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
now on this valentine's day

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Pacino will look for love, high and low, far and wide

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,640
And by nightfall she will have found her special lovey.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:15,640
She sits now at the Worcester Korean War Memorial.

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,080
Quietly reading Captain Underpants and the perilous plot of Professor Poopypants.

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,000
Dressed exactly like Cameron Diaz in The Mask.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,960
She looks like Penelope Cruz mixed with Sidney Sweeney.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,400
Mixed with that one scene in Blue is the Warmest Color.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,000
You know the one.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,880
Ah, what man would chance to find love on this very day?

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,000
Maybe there are three such lotharios?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And who could they be?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,640
I didn't write an intro or anything. You can just say who you are. Okay, my name is Lothario

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:58,600
Dawson and Dawson and I'm a billionaire. I have billions of dollars. I have a mansion.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:06,480
I have planes and trains and automobiles, Valentines. So yeah, Pacino's just sitting

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,080
in a park. And I'm a BDSM guy. So the rest of you can just wander in whenever you want.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,320
But she's just like reading Captain Underpants. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm just like, oh

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,000
This book is so complicated

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,360
There's so many words and pictures

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,040
And she's just looking very beautiful

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,040
You know what? They say patchy now. I guess I don't know her name, huh?

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,360
I don't know. It just came to me. Ooh

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,140
This is a can pictures

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:50,140
A picture is worth a thousand words, my love, but I am worth ten billion dollars.

57
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,500
Oh, that's a lot of money, and there's another man here too?

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,780
Pleased to see ya.

59
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,860
The name's Dookie Disgusting.

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,860
My whore mother named me that thinking it put a damper on my no-good-paws jeans.

61
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,500
He spunked in her spittoon and skipped on by sunrise, leaving her with nothing but a full

62
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,180
fanny and a very sexual child. Last I heard of him, he got flattened.

63
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:24,180
That's Thomas. You're doing Thomas. Hey guys, it's me. Hey, it's me, Dookie Disgustin.

64
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,180
Last I heard of my father, he got flattened by the bang bus like Wile E. Coyote, but I'm

65
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,800
carrying on his legacy. I've pushed poon from Oklahoma to the Orient. I've smelled sliz

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,800
at Camp David, I fucked Jackie Chan.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,040
(laughter)

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,600
- She sounds beautiful.

69
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,280
- Yep, the Jackie Chan you're thinking of.

70
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,520
Needless to say, women love me.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
They let me do whatever I want,

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,720
which really works out in my favor

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,460
because I'm into poo-poo and pee-pee.

74
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,860
At some point I had to just embrace my name,

75
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,820
go with the flow, and speaking of,

76
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,580
I like going "TT" on women's shorts.

77
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Make myself understood.

78
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,180
Wow, okay.

79
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,180
Nice to meet you.

80
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,380
I think you said your name was Pachonis.

81
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,820
Very very nice to meet you.

82
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,540
It is lovely to meet you too.

83
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,540
What you say, Dookie?

84
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,540
Dookie.

85
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Dookie Disgusting.

86
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,540
Oh wow.

87
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,700
These two such handsome men in Worcester, Massachusetts, the most romantic city on the

88
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
planet.

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,060
The city of love, baby.

90
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,660
Yes, that is what they say.

91
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
The city of love.

92
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
You're a man?

93
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,860
And who is that in the distance?

94
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
Oh, fuck you!

95
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
Fuck you, bitch!

96
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,660
Oh my, what a new approach!

97
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,860
You're a bitch, I... Fuck you!

98
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,860
I'm Pikachu.

99
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,860
That is my full name.

100
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,260
First name is Pika, last name is Chuu.

101
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,860
Oh, so mysterious!

102
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,260
I am here for sex and loving

103
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
So forward

104
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,860
Sexual loving for Pikachu

105
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Who is me?

106
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Pikachu

107
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm here to see boobs and pussy and butt

108
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
And I have no money I live outside

109
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,860
I live outside in trash can

110
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
I live in trash can

111
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,380
And if you go down in trash can you can go to Pikachu land

112
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,540
Elmo went there once in a movie

113
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:47,820
But it was called grouch land. It was loosely based off of Pikachu land and all of their people there look like me

114
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,260
white

115
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,760
Is a land of only white people

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,400
And they try to throw rocks at us.

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
But we go back with bombs.

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,900
And we throw bombs at the rock throwers.

119
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,400
And that's what we do. My name is Pikachu.

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,900
Fuck you, bitch.

121
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,400
Wow, I'm so lucky.

122
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,900
Three handsome, dangerous men.

123
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,400
I'm a danger to my country.

124
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Do any of you know the way around Worcester, Massachusetts?

125
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,900
Yeah, we are going to, bitch, we are going to...

126
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Paul ourselves a factory

127
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,580
All their shelter made here we're going that's where Paula South's our is made you seen what star okay?

128
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,360
If you're gonna try to convince patina to go somewhere. I think that's where we start to bring in the rolling so

129
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,380
Wait, where are we again? We're in the Korean War?

130
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:54,260
No, we're at the Memorial. Yeah. Yeah, we're on a train. No, I was I was gonna do that. Really?

131
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,140
Yeah, originally and then we're in real life love. Yeah

132
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,380
(laughter)

133
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,220
- Oh my god, things are gonna change after tonight.

134
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,180
- And then I thought the war memorial was a better setting.

135
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,700
- I'm pointing at some names on the memorial.

136
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,540
- Ah, fuck them.

137
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,440
- I'm going like, I'm going like,

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,620
you see that guy?

139
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,460
- Yay.

140
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,580
- You see that guy too, Pacina?

141
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,420
- I see.

142
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,240
- You see that guy?

143
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,080
- Okay, yay.

144
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,640
- I owned them.

145
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,140
- And I fucked them.

146
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,100
- You owned them?

147
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,620
- My family owns them.

148
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,060
Wow, is it like you mean like you beat them?

149
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,820
What?

150
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,940
What?

151
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,380
We're both so breathy.

152
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,180
Shut up, bitch.

153
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Shut up, you two bitches.

154
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,020
These Korean names are crazy, man.

155
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:43,860
Craig Johnson, what kind of Korean bullshit is that?

156
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,860
If I have to be honest with you all, I am looking for love today.

157
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,460
Shut up, bitches.

158
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,860
Yeah, roll loveliness.

159
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,580
Wait, you have 10 loveliness?

160
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,980
Yeah, you can't be pulling this shit with 10 loveliness.

161
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,820
You are not playing in character.

162
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,460
Yeah, wait, should we run through the stats?

163
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,960
Oh, yeah.

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,500
Yeah, you got three. All right. So she kind of took offense to that, but well, let's go into this.

165
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,580
Yeah, oh yeah, I made up a vague system for this just for funsies.

166
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:22,420
And we have loveliness, coolness, sexiness, and indomitability.

167
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,180
Pete: [Laughter]

168
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,660
And -

169
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,580
Jared: Which means you can't be subdued or defeated according to the dictionary.

170
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,420
Pete: Yeah, right. And so, loveliness is sort of like your verbal charm, coolness is sort of your -

171
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,020
Pete: Well, that's why I put loveliness as a ten.

172
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,580
Jared: Yeah, because you were going to be Israeli.

173
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
[Laughter]

174
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,780
Pete: I'm going to be Israeli mean.

175
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:50,940
Yeah, coolness is sort of your moves, you know, sort of doing a cool thing with your body,

176
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,980
sort of like holding the door open for someone.

177
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,860
Sexiness is sort of your ability to kiss and like mack.

178
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,620
And then indomitability is, what did you say it was, Cam?

179
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,820
An ability to be subdued or defeated.

180
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,940
Yeah, so we'll see if that comes into play.

181
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,420
Oh, Jesus Christ.

182
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:12,980
So yeah, with the three, I would say, um, yeah, I mean she's not too keen on going there, you

183
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,180
know, she's gonna, she's gonna, kind of like, "I don't know if that's a, the most romantic

184
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,180
place to go."

185
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,180
"You are stupid!"

186
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,660
"Listen, Pachina, Pachina, listen to me, come over here.

187
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,020
I know the most romantic place we can go.

188
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,580
Pachina, listen, how about you and me, and we leave these other two clowns behind and

189
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
we-" "No, we are going with you."

190
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,580
Will you listen? Will you guys let me talk to her for a second?

191
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
I'm going to kill you.

192
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,580
Actually, no, I don't think I will.

193
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,580
What about you and me? We go back to my mansion and I whip you with spiked chains.

194
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,580
And I go there too.

195
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Oh, the real loveliness.

196
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Loveliness? What's my loveliness? D4?

197
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Yeah, you could do other moves.

198
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,580
Two.

199
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
Yeah, she's like...

200
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
No.

201
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,540
Listen, we'll decide on a safe word and then we'll throw you into the Iron Maiden, Pechina.

202
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,300
It's gonna be a sexy, beautiful morning.

203
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,860
I just think you're moving too fast for me.

204
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,900
I'm from a small village in Italy.

205
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,260
We can move slow too.

206
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,860
Oh, listen Pechina, come to my mansion.

207
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,180
We'll take the elevator down to the negative 100th floor and I'll throw you on the rack

208
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,900
and we'll turn that crank so slowly.

209
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,560
- We'll turn that crank so slowly, Pacino.

210
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,400
- I don't know about this.

211
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,200
- One notch a day and you're in there for a thousand years.

212
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,640
(laughing)

213
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,200
- I do like things that make you feel like

214
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,840
time just stands still.

215
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,160
- Oh yeah, I love that too.

216
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
- You do, okay.

217
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,300
What about you, Dookie?

218
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,720
- I've been trying to invent a time machine.

219
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,600
What if I just gave you some money?

220
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
- Oh, how much?

221
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
- Like, probably like $125.

222
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
$126 for me.

223
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Well, I can't go. Can't argue with that.

224
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
[laughter]

225
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
I only have $125, homie.

226
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I have no money, but I am full of love.

227
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
We could go to an ATM, but I'm gonna be honest, there's nothing in my bank account.

228
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
I live at the ATM!

229
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I'd just be sitting there pretending, and I'd tell you it is broken.

230
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Suppose we could go to the ATM and see who has the most money?

231
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I live by--

232
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
That sounds good to me.

233
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
I live in the ATM.

234
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
[laughter]

235
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
So all of a sudden, you're a whore.

236
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
[laughter]

237
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,920
Oh, how dare you? I'm not a whore, I'm just Italian.

238
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Oh, when you're in my mansion you will be.

239
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Oh, that's...

240
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
What's that mean?

241
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm just... it's... I'll command her.

242
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
No, what that whore mean?

243
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,420
It's like a sexy beautiful lady who fulfills your love lust.

244
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,420
It's the most beautiful woman in the world.

245
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,420
What that beautiful mean?

246
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,420
I couldn't tell you.

247
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,420
It's a woman who makes you wanna fuck.

248
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,180
what is? you say this word all the time the one you're about to say. no what is woman?

249
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:03,820
okay just check it. that's a woman. hello. what is different? what? she's got different

250
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:13,100
underwear on than us. panties. I wear those. you wear panties? let me see. I am Pikachu.

251
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Of course I will, Panties.

252
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,100
How about instead we just go to the Maui beach nearby?

253
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,100
There is a beach in Worcester, Massachusetts that I hear is the most beautiful beach in the world.

254
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Do you want to go there?

255
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Listen, bitch.

256
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Anywhere else besides the Korean War Memorial?

257
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Listen, Pachina, Pachina, Pachina, listen to me.

258
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Listen to me, Pachina.

259
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Where is this beach?

260
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,380
If it's sand you want, Pachina, then come to my mansion and we'll put you in a giant hourglass

261
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,300
and you'll drown in sand slowly.

262
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
I guess we-

263
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Where is this beach?

264
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,760
I want to see this beach.

265
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,100
We could go to the beach.

266
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,260
Yeah, where is the beach?

267
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
It's just-

268
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:55,180
There's another one of you.

269
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,940
Or we can go to the mansion, I suppose.

270
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:04,940
i guess we're gonna do that. I just don't want to go alone. You want me to go to a man's chin? I don't think so.

271
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,440
I wanna be completely honest with you

272
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,560
I do wanna see his house. It seems pretty cool, they got a lot of choice. You're not allowed.

273
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,560
I'm coming to your house. My torturing murder machines are on. I'm hopping into my Lincoln. I have been to your house already.

274
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,560
I'm hopping into my Lincoln, it's got ample carplay in it. Lothario, please can we bring the other man? I just don't want to be alone right now.

275
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,560
I've been there alone most of my life you idiot.

276
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Listen, baby, we go to my mansion, we'll never be alone.

277
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,720
I have 70,000 goblin slaves.

278
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,360
There are goblin slaves in these now.

279
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,640
I thought this took place in the real world.

280
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,360
Oh, it does.

281
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,160
There's nothing realer than a goblin slave turning a crank on a rope that pulls off your

282
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,920
fingernail, my friend.

283
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm afraid you'll never experience it.

284
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,520
Sexual effing fingernail pulling.

285
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,640
Oh, tons of sexual fingernail pulling.

286
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,040
I would like to go through the mansion.

287
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,480
Do you have a flat screen TV?

288
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
Yes.

289
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
You have Tycho LC.

290
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,920
I have a thousand flat screen TVs in the same room on the same wall.

291
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,440
Some is useless, but I'll come.

292
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,000
No, they all show one of every TV show.

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Holy God almighty, there's a thousand.

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Do you have Tycho LC?

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What?

296
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Tycho LC.

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What?

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,840
- What?

299
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,120
- I'll see cows. - You want the little,

300
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,640
the little rat in the car?

301
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,920
- Yes, the little rat drives the car.

302
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,880
- Lots of rats, lots of rats in the dungeon.

303
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,640
- No, but the car, you get to drive the radio shack.

304
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,120
- Hey, you guys wanna go to Lothario's mansion?

305
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,800
I think we should go to Lothario's mansion.

306
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,840
- I wanna go so bad.

307
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,680
- Yeah, let's go.

308
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,920
- Okay, we can fly on my private jet,

309
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,960
but you two have to be in the luggage.

310
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
- That's fine by me.

311
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,640
- Is the radio shack near your house?

312
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,480
- No.

313
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,880
- I miss radio shack. - It's on an island

314
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,480
underground in the center of the worst place for a mansion ever burn up.

315
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,920
You don't understand. He doesn't understand the air face. Hello. He doesn't understand.

316
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,440
Like I would have my bathing suit. You don't have to wear anything.

317
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,640
Oh, Jesus Christ.

318
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,200
People are turning their heads. This is everybody. Everybody who's walking by

319
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,040
sees his giant. There are 400 people. I mean, I'm a homeless guy. I'm like,

320
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,400
I think people are just used to it. Yeah. You blend in so well.

321
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,080
Yeah. How, how big is your pee pee? Yeah. What does everyone working with

No, it's eight inches, dude. I don't give a fuck.

333
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
It's only exploding when you get a crit.

334
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Right now, mine is one foot long.

335

I would say average four again.

338
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
[laughter]

339
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Mine is two, but can I say it's a Bowser spike?

340

341
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
[laughter]

342
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
[laughter]

343
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
You're medically in trouble.

344
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Keep going, keep going.

345
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Come on, four baby.

346
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200

It's so fucking cool

424
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180

427
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,180
That guy keeps forcing himself on that woman, he's probably Israeli.

428
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,180
I saw pink panthel. I had that few dem bagels

429
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,180

439
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:25,440
Gentlemen gentlemen, this is my place and I hold up a check that's for five million trillion dollars

440
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
And it's signed in women's blood

441
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,820
And that is my check our world when I first bought this place

442
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,140
Look look buddy. I don't know how I'm supposed to cash that

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,980
Cash app do you have bank you idiots?

444
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,480
You can cash out checks on your phone. You're lucky you don't work in one of my factories or we make you a doll

445
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,200
He owns a rotary phone. He knows nothing of

446
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,720
cashing checks on his phone

447
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,440
Why would you say he knows nothing about he's so rich. He has no cell phone. He only has rotary phone

448
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,920
He has a slave

449
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Because I have a goblin slave who I talk into and he runs and talks into the other person

450
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,000
That's what I said. Well, that's his name

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,520
Do you have like an alarm clock goblin?

452
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Yeah.

453
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Yeah.

454
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah.

455
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
It's cool.

456
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
He lives a Flintstone life with goblins.

457
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,120
I have, it's a goblin slave who swallowed an alarm clock.

458
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
And it's like stuck in his throat.

459
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,480
I have a different one for every possible time.

460
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,480
And I just ask whichever one I need to wake up at to be in my room that night.

461
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,160
Do you have a chorus of goblins?

462
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160

463
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160

467
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Chorus of goblins.

468
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
A what?

469
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:46,200
else singers yes they seem complicated by Avril Lavigne they scream they scream

470
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,120
complicated by Avril Lavigne I have goblin slaves that run around in a giant

471
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,080

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
If you'll come home with me, you'll be the Tom to my Jerry.

475
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,720
I'll drink a magic potion and I'll chase you around.

476
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Why do you have to drink a potion?

477
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm gonna hit you with an anvil, Pacino.

478
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Oh no!

479
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Oh, you'll love it. I command you to love it.

480
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,720
I have a song for you, Pacino.

481
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Okay.

482
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?

483
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,720
That's the only line I know.

484
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,160
I guess I get the cappuccino and the guy goes back and goes to get a cappuccino for her

485
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,200
And she goes to the to you do key shows. Look. I have not heard from you and you seem to be

Well equipped

487
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:58,080

495
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,640
Okay, but does it sound like a nickname?

499
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,720
My name ring bells for real, for real.

500
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,680
I just, you know, my old lover, Kyle Crimewright.

501
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,460
You know, he was so mean to me.

502
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:58,900
He was very rude, he would tell me, "Pachina, why do you not work?"

503
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,420
Can I make a, I want to make a roll here.

505
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,700
feed of Kyle Krimerate being drawn in court to try and charm her.

506
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,580
Oh man, I guess that's coolness, right?

507
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,940
I think so, I don't know.

508
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,500
Yeah, I made these stats.

509
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Okay.

511
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500

A guy with a wig.

518
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
A guy with a wig.

519
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
If I'm gonna fail...

520
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,380
And a t-shirt that says Kyle Krimerate.

521
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:53,460
If I'm gonna fail and if it has to be a lookalike, I want 100 lookalikes.

522
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,860
You sacrifice 100 goblins that are like dressed as Kyle Crime Raid.

523
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,660
What is Kyle Crime Raid dresses?

524
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,100
That's up to you.

525
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,780
It's your interpretation of Mr. Crime Raid.

526
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
I think he probably is pretty swaggy.

527
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
He's insanely cool.

528
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Dan, you think he's got the Thing 2 shirt on and shit?

529
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Yeah.

530
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
Damn.

531
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,060
he has a custom shirt made that's thing two on the front and I'm with stupid on

532
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:25,340
the back. Whoa. Pointing at thing one or thing three. He was so hilarious. And he has

533
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:30,960
he has a flat brim. That's a funny ass shirt. I'll say that much. So funny. I love his flat brim that has a

534
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,900
brim on the front and back so he looks like Sherlock Holmes. And there's two hats

535
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,540
on the front. He was always trying to solve mysteries. And there's hats filling out the corners too.

536
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,340
He's got a flat brim sombrero on.

537
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,580
I'm in the bathroom of this restaurant and I'm just showering in the sink while all this

538
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,500
is happening right now.

539
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,700
Where did Pikachu go?

540
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,060
When she turns around I see the back of her neck and I get such a big erection I just

541
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
pass out.

542
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,740
And she turns around and goes, "Dookie!

543
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,140
Somebody has to save Dookie!"

544
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
No, don't worry about that.

545
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
Oh, that's why I'm not sleepy, ow.

552
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,240

553
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:58,160
remove the clog in your penis. Okay. So it's like you're lying on the

554
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,300
ground right? But your whole penis is... Describe this to me. Okay so his... My penis is

555
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,140
shooting right up. It broke through my zipper. Yes. It's up? It's up. It's

556
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,580
ready to like see if it's tall enough to get on a roller coaster. I take my bandana off and I tie it around my

557
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,480
legs and I climb it like a person climbing like a tree to get a coconut.

558
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,260
How short are you? I'm like 5'4". This is way shorter than 5'4". You're still 3 feet tall.

559
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,980
Yeah I'm still doing that. Okay just making sure. I'll climb it but it's only like I only take two

560
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,660
steps till I find the clog. Not even one step and then I see the clog in it and I

561
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,500
can just upper cut it and there's just like a kidney

562
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,500
size of a

563
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,960
burrito. Yeah,

564
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,380
Chipotle burrito size kidney stone shoots out of your re through

565
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,020
all right. Wow yeah, she and I come to

566
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,940
at you when I see him punch your penis. I also come

567
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,260
yeah, yeah, Pikachu. We all just come

568
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,380
There's a huge load right behind the kidney stone that he unclogged. This cafe is just like horrified

569
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,300
Everybody of the four of us walk in there. We're just nutting

570
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,660
30 foot 30 inch

571
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,300
Yeah, it's like an emptying a can of silly string. Yeah out of my huge car all over the place

572
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,860
Yeah, but she is pretty impressed Pikachu. She's like wow

573
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,940
Where did you learn that my father I tap into him?

574
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Which is how he died

575
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,100
So it's like you're saving your father

576
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:44,560
Way if your father died that means you're probably not too good at dislodging big rocks from men's cocks

577
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
That was the first time he worked

578
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,980
There's the first and only time he's ever worked also I wasn't like gonna die

579
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:01,380
All the blood went to my penis, but I was so worried about I would have been fine you stupid bitch

580
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,380
I wish you'd believe me.

581
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,980
You don't call her stupid bitch, that was my nickname for her.

582
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
I'm sorry.

583
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Wow, you're both fighting.

584
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Well, thank you for making it.

585
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Listen, listen, Pacina, don't pay any attention to these two idiots.

586
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Listen, what we're gonna do...

587
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980

- I brought the Skip-It with me, I'm doing Skip-It.

593
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,500
I'm doing a Skip-It in the restaurant, I'm doing Skip-It.

594
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,700
- We're gonna go on a beautiful horseback ride, Pachina.

595
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,100
You're gonna be riding on one horse

596
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,740
and I'll be following close behind,

597
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,840
and then we'll gallop to two opposite points

598
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,940
and then we'll gallop towards each other very fast

599
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,140
and I'll run you through with a lance, Pachina.

600
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,140
- Oh, you're going to kill me.

601
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,660
- And it'll be so romantic.

602
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,460
And I'll command you, no.

603
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,380
- I did 100 skips on my Skip-It.

604
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,260
- I did 100 skips on my Skip It in that time.

605
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,680
- I can do eight pushups.

606
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,280
- I'm good at Skip It.

607
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,120
- I can do--

608
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,360

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,800
- I hear they teach you that at the IDF.

610
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,200
- They do.

611
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,040

- All right.

614
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,040
- Roll, roll, oh man, let's roll Coolness.

615
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,880
- Yes, it's Coolness.

616
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,700
- It's Coolness, yeah.

617
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,540
- Which one of these is a 10?

618
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,600
- Oh yeah, it's Dookie's Best.

619
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,440

620
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,260

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,340
Well, you're... you're stupid, so... I've been watching this. I've been... I've been taking note of that. I was like,

626
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Patrick doesn't count it when it's on the table. Caleb does. All right? I mean, I got this. I would

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
And carpet floors.

641
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,480

642
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,240
- Pizza Hut has a buffet.

643
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,540
- The carpet goes through the kitchen and the bathroom.

644
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,000
Patching other things we can do with a microwave.

645
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,440
How big is your microwave?

646
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,000
- It's about normal, you know, six by seven feet.

647
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,800

648
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,600

649
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,080
- Well, how 'bout this?

650
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,920
- How 'bout we go to a hotel?

651
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,800
- I'm gonna roll indomitability and force you to do that.

652
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm basically forcing you to come with me, so.

654
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
That's true.

655
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
One.

656
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,800
She's not going to be forced to, she's sort of like, "Ah, no."

657
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I try to grab her arm and like pull her, and my arm flies off of my body like Spongebob.

658
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,800
"Oh no, can you give him CPR again?"

659
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm coming so much.

660
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,280
I do not know how to create that arm, but I say we go to Habbo Hotel.

661
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
We can go to...

662
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,640
We go in Habbo Hotel.

663
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,520
You only he will, he owns the Habbo Hotel.

664
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Let's go to Habbo Hotel.

665
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
What is a Habbo Hotel?

666
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,080
It sounds so mysterious.

667
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,000
The airport is always closed.

668
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Okay.

669
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Always...

670
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000

671
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Always closed?

672
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Hell yeah, dude.

Uh huh.

675
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah.

676
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's a reference show.

677
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Let's go.

678
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah, you guys gotta go to the hotel. Tell me about this hotel.

679
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You've never been on a hotel?

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Hey, Pete, we're gonna take you to the most...

681
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We're gonna take you to the most...

682
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
[laughter]

683
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
We're gonna take you to the most exclusive club in the world, Club Penguin.

684
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
[laughter]

685
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We're gonna do the spy training missions over and over.

686
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So, are we gonna go to the hotel and then Club Penguin?

687
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And RuneScape.

688
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I think maybe we go through Club Penguin.

689
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
We go to Club Penguin? Okay, yeah.

690
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,320
get us into Club Penguin. I have guest passes.

691
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,240
Oh yeah, it's now um, hold on, membership cards.

692
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,200
So we can't go to Club Penguin because really it's like a night time locale.

693
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,600
Oh true. What time is it right now? No it's a day club.

694
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,000
It's a day club? It's a day club and it's for teenagers.

695
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,800
Which is why Cameron wants to go. All right do we want to go to Club Penguin? I'm trying to

696
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,040
figure out like different locations. Let's go to Club Penguin. I got a fake ID that says 14.

697
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,160
Let's go. Okay. Yeah, we roll up to Club Penguin in Worcester, Massachusetts.

698
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,240
I'm like grabbing, uh, Petchy's hand like we're at like an amusement park or something. I'm like,

699
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,000
"Come on, baby. Let's try and tip the iceberg." Okay. "What do you mean tip the ice-o-bertic?"

700
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
"Oh, you'll see the water's frigid and cold. You'll die in 10 seconds."

701
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,280
"Oh, good." Yeah, you guys are at Club Penguin. What's going on in Club Penguin?

702
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,960
I stopped a snowball fight. I'm whipping a puffle. My huge dick is completely blurred out.

703
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,120
I don't know what to do. It's stuck to the ice.

704
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,040
The bouncer at Club Penguin's like, he can't walk because it's like Christmas story. Like,

705
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,160
yeah, yeah, his dick is on the ice. He's trying to walk.

706
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:32,000
At some point I like, I'm trying to escape from my penis being stuck to the ground. And I,

707
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,920
leave us so much momentum that I start spinning around it over and over again.

708
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Oh he's doing skipette! He's doing skipette!

709
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,000
Copying. He's copying me to court here.

710
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,240
Yeah the bouncer there is like uh uh whoa whoa whoa how old are you guys?

711
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,640
Seven.

712
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,360
Five. Five months.

713
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,120
Yeah.

714
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,840
I'm 30.

715
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,640
No wait wait.

716
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,600
Um.

717
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,560
They'll be 16 too.

718
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,600
I'm four.

719
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,320
Okay, yeah, all of you roll loveliness.

720
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Oh man, fuck.

721
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Do I got four loveliness, bro?

722
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Hey, at least it explodes, yeah.

723
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Ah, crap.

724
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Two.

725
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Two.

726
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
I got five.

727
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,360
He's like, "You guys are not any of those ages."

728
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Shut up.

729
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
You're acting like you're four.

730
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
I was born on the LEPL.

731
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Ask me a math question.

732
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,840
Hey, I take him off to the side.

733
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,400
Listen, buddy, I don't want to make a scene, but you keep this up, you're going to be melted

734
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
soon.

735
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,240
You're going straight to hell.

736
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
You are 6'7".

737
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
He's a snowman.

738
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
And I'm wearing chain mail.

739
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
And I am a snowman.

740
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
Hey, do you see this?

741
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
I take out a laser pointer.

742
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy!

743
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Put that thing away!

744
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Okay, okay, alright, alright.

745
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Just keep that, anything that is warm, away from me.

746
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Also, there's gonna be like 700 goblins coming through here soon.

747
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
You gotta let 'em in, man.

748
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
But, they are like three.

749
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
So...

750
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Goblin age is different.

751
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
But they're all gonna be like, "Oh, I'm a goblin."

752
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
I'm a goblin.

753
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
I'm a goblin.

754
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I'm a goblin.

755
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm a goblin.

756
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I'm a goblin.

757
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,160
gotta let 'em in, man. But they are like three. So...

758
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,120
Goblin age is different.

759
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,480
They're all gonna be wearing big white t-shirts and you still gotta let 'em in.

760
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,560
They'll wear big white t-shirts, they'll have their names on them.

761
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,160
They'll have big white t-shirts and gold chains.

762
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,360
You can't stop 'em from coming in, though.

763
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,560
And they may have sports hats on.

764
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,680
They do have no problem with that.

765
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,400
Of course they're welcome.

766
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,800
He created them in school.

767
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,920
Those are my emotional support goblins.

768
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,880
yeah you guys convinced this snowman to let you in the club penguin and it's

769
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:39,920
just full of children come on patina let's go play mancala okay what is that

770
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,160

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,560

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,800
I wanna decorate my igloo.

773
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
[Laughter]

774
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I want you to...

775
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Unfortunately I did not play enough Kaplanguin as a kid.

776
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Lothario, you gotta roll Indomitability.

777
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Kaplanguin? Kaplanguin.

778
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Lothario, you gotta roll Indomitability at this point.

779
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
'Cause you've just been like...

780
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
With no remorse, trying to like...

781
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
It's BDSM!

782
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
That's what it is!

783
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
You kill a woman, right?

784
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Three...

785
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,300
He's like, "I just don't know how I feel about all this pain, you call it. Pain?"

786
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,300
"It's not pain, it's pleasure. Have you ever seen Hellraiser?"

787
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
"No, what is it that-" "Me neither."

788
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
"That explains the pins in your head."

789
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,300
"Oh, I forgot those were in there."

790
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,300
"Oh, and these too."

791
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,300
"And my wiener."

792
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,300
"Hey, she goes over to Dookie, disgusting, to see his igloo. And what are you putting on your igloo, Dookie?"

793
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:54,260
I built the igloo around me still spinning like the face of a clock.

794
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,220
And I put a mini fridge to keep things cold.

795
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,260
I put a TV.

796
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:09,860
A mini fridge around each block of ice in the wall of the igloo.

797
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
And I put a rug.

798
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,260
Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

799
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,500
Let's do coolness for that.

800
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
I like that.

801
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I mean, it's going to be very cool.

802
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Oh, yeah.

803
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Yeah, advantage.

804
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,580
I don't know which one is it.

805
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,580
It's the one...

806
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,580
What one are you looking for?

807
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Yeah, you got it.

808
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
Six.

809
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,920
Nice, yeah, it's very cool.

810
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
It's a cool igloo.

811
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Looks pretty cool.

812
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Pacino's pretty impressed.

813
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,220
I mean, keep in mind, I would say that right now...

814
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,140
How about you get down on the floor with me?

815
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,860
I'm the big hand, I need a little hand.

816
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,860
Ooh, that is good.

817
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,580
All right, I'm gonna have you roll loveliness with advantage, but before you do that, I wanna,

818
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,140
just for the folks at home, Pikachu right now is in the lead because he did save you from

819
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
CPR.

820
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,660
I forgot we're competing.

821
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,660
Oh yeah, you're competing for Pachina's hand.

822
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Fuck, dude.

823
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,660
But you're doing well.

824
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,340
Good igloo, good line.

825
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
How am I doing?

826
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,460
You're doing so far the worst, but there's a good chance you could turn it all around.

827
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,380
Okay, I got a four on the advantage, so that's exploding, yes.

828
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,380
And a three.

829
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,460
Wow, I mean that's good though.

830
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,700
So yeah, she sits down.

831
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,020
She's like interested.

832
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,020
She's like, "So..."

833
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,500
I hit the igloo with a bulldozer.

834
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
I'm sorry.

835
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Don't fuck my game up bro, I'm about to smash.

836
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,020
I tried to- Oops, I didn't realize I had to put a new hotel

837
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
in here.

838
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,740
I was like- It's called the H.H.

839
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,540
Holmes Motel.

840
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,020
The whole time I was driving to the igloo on a Zamboni but it was too slow.

841
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:42,540
So I saw the bulldozer pulling up and I was just like, "Oh, fuck this."

842
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,380

854
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,180
Why? I do have a tattoo that goes along the length of my penis that says

855
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,680
Filipino. Filipino for life in old English. So you guys are diving in.

856
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:00,880
What are you going to do to save him? I'm going to sink. I'll swim. I make a

857
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,680
raft out of goblin slaves that are all holding each other's arms and

858
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,320
ankles and I'm getting as close to him as I can and then I'm using a fishing rod made

859
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,200
out of goblin slams to fish him out.

860
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
I like this sort of uh...

861
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Sounds sick.

862
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Sort of like you have like a...

863
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
They're like nanobots.

864
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,200
I was about to say.

865
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,000
That's what goblins are like.

866
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Seven.

867
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Seven?

868
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Wow.

869
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah, I mean you do an amazing job coordinating your slaves.

870
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,640

871
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,420

00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,300

Looking at me and Pikachu from the distance, I can see Pachino looking at me and Pikachu

893
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,340
from the distance and I panic, I don't know what to do and I start sucking Pikachu's dick.

894
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,340
Oh no.

895
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,340
I do not like this.

896
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,340
Unless you do.

897
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,340
Hello.

898
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,340
Hello.

899
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,340
Hello.

900
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,540
Guys, this is what we have to do.

901
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,820
We have to expose Pachino.

902
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,820
No.

903
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
Yeah.

904
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,500
The idea of two guys having like snacks and just looking up at somebody else and being

905
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,500
I'm rolling sexiness to see how good I suck his dick.

906
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,300
If it's really good, Pacino's gonna love it.

907
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,300
And that's because Pacino likes it.

908
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,820
Pacino will love it and Patches is gonna continue to be sort of nonplussed about the whole thing.

909
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,820
Okay, that's a three.

910
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,820
Okay, out of what?

911
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,820
It's a d6, right?

912
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,820
Out of what?

913
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,820
What did you roll?

914
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,820
Okay.

915
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,500
No, take into account both that and the total roll.

916
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,380
It's a serviceable but not ideal way to suck a dick.

917
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,380
You're sort of, you're doing a little corncobby.

918
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,780
You're kind of leaning too much into that part of it.

919
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,540
He's corncobbing my bitch.

920
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,540
You need to do that tornado.

921
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,140
Yeah, okay, I start doing the tornado.

922
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,140
Indomitability.

923
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,140
Okay.

924
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,140
Both hands.

925
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

926
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,140
Three.

927
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,140
Again.

928
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:13,300
You know the only way to get me is to grapefruit me.

929
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,300
You have to grapefruit me.

930
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,900
I will do whatever it takes.

931
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,740
Wait, I'm not being gay enough.

932
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,300
Okay, I wake up and I fucking...

933
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,420
There's nobody- is there a guy near me?

934
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,420
There's a security guard who's like-

935
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,420
I suck his fucking dirty dick.

936
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,700
There's a snowman, he's got like a- he's got a carrot down there too.

937
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,700
Okay yeah, I put the- yeah, roll- roll sexiness.

938
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
Is this what you like, Pacino?

939
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,700
Sexiness?

940
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,700
I didn't say I liked or disliked any of this.

941
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
I have a D8. You clearly like it.

942
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
Nope, that's- you stopped saying it.

943
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,700
I got a 7.

944
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,700
That's really good.

945
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,700
I tornado.

946
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,700
Pacino?

947
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
I double hand tornado Riley Reed his carrot.

948
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:58,460
Pachina's like, "Maybe he's gay, he's so good at this. I love when men are gay."

949
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:04,140
Pachina does. Patches doesn't care. You just said you love when men are gay.

950
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,380
No, I said... You don't... wait, you... Patches don't care about gay men? I don't... no, I...

951
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,860
So either you like when guys are gay or you don't care about gay people.

952
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:20,620
I like... what's this? It's hot in here.

953
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:27,980
I like people. I like people. No, it's because I'm nervous because I feel like people. You like penile.

954
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:33,340
I don't even know what's penile. He doesn't know what penile is. I'll show you. No, don't show me

955
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:39,340
that because I wouldn't like it but if other people like having that I'm okay with that.

956
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:45,100
Okay, I want to go join their water orgy over in the thing. We're out of the water. Okay,

957
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,940
so I don't care if it's land or sea I'm going to fuck you. We're in the sauna. There's a

958
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:57,620
like a 30 person Hollywood goblin camera crew. That's fine. Yeah, no I'm just

959
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:03,020
setting the scene. Yeah, yeah. There's lighting people, there's like four

960
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,820
cameras, there's a boom mic. It's like a multi-cam like sitcom like kind of thing or what do you mean?

961
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,300
No, like a GoPro and put it right here so that I get like a POV shot. Yeah, so the GoPro is a

962
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,060
really small goblin just holds on to you. Okay that's fine. I put him here. And just remembers it.

963
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:26,020
And can tell you later. I put him on my head. I strap that in and I walk over and I start,

964
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:31,860
I just kind of like use my, like slither my huge penis like around you guys multiple times. Kind

965
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:37,540
of bind you together. Yeah. Okay. That's sexiness. Roll sexiness. While I'm like locked up in a penis

966
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,740
Like, "yee cans."

967
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,340
Hold on, let's see if he is.

968
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,340
"Yee cans."

969
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,340
Wait, yeah, let's see if he is.

970
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,340
We don't count that.

971
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,580
That is-- oh, we don't count it?

972
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,580
Unless we're changing the rules for Caleb.

973
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,580
No, we don't count it!

974
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Hey, whatever.

975
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:52,860
That's fine by me, because we don't count that three.

976
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,500
We get that one, though.

977
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,220
Your dick can't really quite wrap around.

978
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,420
It just hits, like, really hard, sharp corners.

979
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,060
Like, "ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."

980
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,060
Like Snake?

981
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,220
Yeah, like a cartoon falling down a huge pipe.

982
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,860
What were you gonna do if you were having, if you were being echoed?

983
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,860
I'm singing.

984
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,860
You're singing?

985
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,620
I'm singing while a penis is around me.

986
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,660
But I'm singing a girl's song.

987
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,660
What song are you singing?

988
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,660
Which is pretty gay.

989
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,820
What if we just leave Club Penguin and go to the beach?

990
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,300
Shut up you stupid bitch!

991
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,300
I was petrified.

992
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Take a dog.

993
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,300
I mean this is all...

994
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:33,620
Is that gay enough for you, bitch?

995
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:39,220
I have no... I'm just impressed that you're so open about your sexuosity.

996
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,980
Yep, all three of us are gay.

997
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,700
Yeah.

998
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,220
Yeah, we all three gay men.

999
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,500
Then I'm never going to find love in Worcester if all the men are...

1000
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,100
No, don't worry, don't worry.

1001
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,500
Gay.

1002
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Hey, Pacino, Pacino.

1003
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,620
They have invented a new type of gay.

yeah, I can't handle. I can't handle. You see the pimply pimply simpsons

1016
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,360
teenager there right. He's like all right. You guys want to go into the

1017
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,780
tunnel off. Oh, fuck is

1018
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,780
I don't know, ehh, ehh.

1019
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,780
He became...

1020
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,780
He became Scottish.

1021
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,780
I don't know why do you have Dramamine?

1022
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,780
Oh, I might...

1023
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,780
I... go check the first aid kit.

1024
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,780
Patches dreams of men.

1025
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,780
What?

1026
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,780
He said, "Dream of me."

1027
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,780
You dream of me.

1028
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,780
I don't...

1029
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,780
You dream of me?

1030
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,780
He's got his ass.

1031
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,780
What up?

1032
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Dream of me.

1033
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,780
You dream of me.

1034
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,780
You dream of me.

1035
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,780
I do no such thing.

1036
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,780
And, uh...

1037
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:34,060
Oh fucking shit I need Dramamine, I need to, oh I have merchant sickness, so bad it's hurting

1038
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,300
me in my stomach.

1039
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:43,060
Maybe if, maybe we can counteract the up and down of the boat by having you move up and

1040
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,820
down in a different way.

1041
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,900
Well.

1042
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,260
Maybe like 30 inches up, 30 inches down.

1043
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,260
Yeah.

1044
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,780
30 inches up, 30 inches down that could work because then I'm not on the boat.

1045
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,140
here get on this get a log.

1046
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,140
I'll get a log plume now, okay?

1047
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,980
It's a swan, right?

1048
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,540
But it goes down a giant drop like a log plume at the end.

1049
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,540
Just like in love you take a plunge.

1050
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,500
Oh, I'm about to take the plunge.

1051
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,540
It's about to go, it's about to be completely pitch black in the tunnel.

1052
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,580
You guys are riding in the boat and it's about to enter the part of the tunnel where it's

1053
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,580
pitch black.

1054
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
Yeah, okay.

1055
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,300
And Pacino's starting to get scared.

1056
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,180
"Oh, fucking shit, I hit my head on the ceiling!"

1057
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,800
"Oh, I fucking did it again!"

1058
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,160
"It's so dark!"

1059
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,580
"As soon as it goes dark, we fucking."

1060
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,740
"Yep."

1061
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,120
"Who?" "Right away."

1062
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,820
"Us three."

1063
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,460
"Fuck each other?"

1064
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,280
"Yes!"

1065
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,920
"Okay."

1066
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,560
"Circle."

1067
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,620
"Triangle."

1068
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,440
"I can't even tell what starts and what begins."

1069
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,220
"All of you ro-"

1070
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,220
"I guess we're all sexy just at each other."

1071
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,700
"This is how well you fuck each other, it happens."

1072
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,700
"This is awesome."

1073
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:58,900
I got a four. Four? Well keep going then. I got a one. I'm not sexy at all. I got a seven.

1074
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:04,140
Like second one. So Pikachu, what did you get? I got a four. Yeah, Pikachu is pulling

1075
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:09,900
the weight here on sexiness. I have. And Lothario, yeah. I'm hitting the ceiling. I have a condom

1076
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:20,220
that's made of tiny goblins holding together. And you, you dookie, with that one. You dookie.

1077
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,900
Your dick is, you're not, you know what it is?

1078
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,740
You're just like a typical man.

1079
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,980
You're not even thrusting your hips.

1080
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,060
You're just letting everyone else do all the work.

1081
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,060
He's still snuffing.

1082
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,060
He's asleep again.

1083
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,060
He's out there asleep.

1084
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,060
It's the alkyl helium snore.

1085
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:39,900
I should be attractive to Pachina because I'm like the least gay one because I'm asleep.

1086
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,900
That's true.

1087
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,900
If you're asleep during gay sex, you're basically straight.

1088
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,900
Yeah.

1089
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,900
It's a paradox.

1090
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,260
It's a Pachina paradox.

1091
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:52,300
can we roll to see if we stop really quickly before the lights turn back on so she doesn't

1092
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,300
see anything.

1093
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,300
Yeah, coolness, coolness, coolness, coolness.

1094
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,980
I'm asleep so again I'm not doing really anything so you have to roll.

1095
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,300
You're already dead, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,300
You don't have to roll.

1097
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,300
Seven.

1098
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,300
Five.

1099
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,300
And that's on, coolness ten.

1100
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,300
Alright, pretty good.

1101
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,300
Sort of like you, as the lights come here on, and then it just like stops.

1102
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,300
And she's like, what was that?

1103
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,300
I think it flicked.

1104
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,300
I think it flicked.

1105
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,300
I think it flicked.

1106
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,300
I think it flicked.

1107
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,300
I think it flicked.

1108
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,300
I think it flicked.

1109
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,300
I think it flicked.

1110
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,300
I think it flicked.

1111
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,300
I think it flicked.

1112
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,080
And she's like what was that think a fly flew by

1113
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,580
We've all used that excuse.

1114
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,580
Yeah, there might have been a fly that flew by.

1115
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,580
I think I heard that too.

1116
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,580
Yeah, I heard that fly.

1117
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,580
We're just all sticky with cum.

1118
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,580
Literally like, our fingers are webbed.

1119
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,580
I think it was a bug.

1120
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,580
I think there was some kind of

1121
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,580
not even, like a medium sized fly.

1122
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,580
I think it was a stick bug.

1123
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,580
Flew by.

1124
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,580
We're all covered in water.

1125
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,580
It was a water fly.

1126
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,580
It was a big raving rapid.

1127
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:14,780
Oh, well, even whether it was a bug or a rapid, baby, I think you're a bug

1128
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,400
roll

1129
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
loveliness

1130
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,860
With advantage

1131
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,980
Three roll again advantage. Oh, I meant that

1132
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:35,180
One okay three. Yeah, it's like oh, I think that's the nicest thing you've said to me today. You're wrong

1133
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:45,660
I think you're about as stupid as a bug.

1134
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,420
Hey bug.

1135
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,420
What's going on?

1136
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,420
Is a bug talking?

1137
00:56:49,420 --> 00:57:01,340
Is my voice going to slowly become...

1138
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,340
We're all waking up from a dream.

1139
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,340
(Laughter)

1140
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,340
(Laughter)

1141
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,340
(Laughter)

1142
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,340
Wait, what the fuck?

1143
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,340
I just had the weirdest dream of all time.

1144
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,340
What's going on?

1145
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,340
Are we in Worcester? What the fuck?

1146
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,340
Oh God.

1147
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,340
What the hell?

1148
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,340
(Sigh)

1149
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,340
Oh God, what the hell was that?

1150
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,340
What did I just touch?

1151
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,340
I'm trying my hardest to go back to sleep.

1152
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:33,640
I hit my head. Wait, Toleman, I hit you with a coconut.

1153
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,640
Why is there always coconuts around?

1154
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Well, that was a lot of fun.

1155
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,640
I am a robot now. I have become a robot.

1156
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,640
Oh, I forgot he was a robot. I have been a robot the whole time.

1157
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,640
When we like transition back into the dream, we're all just like fucking each other.

1158
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Like, just, we can just quickly stop.

1159
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:10,800
well I have detected gay things happening to my butt there was a gay pulse

1160
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:18,120
why are you tattletaling? I am just telling what is logically... what do you mean? gay stuff all that I've seen is gay is

1161
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,960
somebody sucking somebody off near an iceberg earlier gay originally meant

1162
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,800
happy. Just then we the we're still in the log flume, the swan flume. We go down. I'm

1163
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:35,680
not I'm not wearing my seat belt. I fly up. I hit like a like a crossbar and like

1164
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,480
just half of my body just completely obliterated. Just just gone and

1165
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,200
immediately like you know that video the monkeys who have the ambulance? Yeah.

1166
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,960
That but goblins and they take me to to the to the rich guy hospital and they

1167
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,120
make me half robot okay and I'm a cyborg now and they bring me back to and this

1168
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,400
all happens in one second okay I am a full robot and I have been the whole

1169
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:07,800
time I'm half robot and I'm only that now I can detect human bones I have

1170
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:14,280
detected something half gay you have detected I have detected something gay

1171
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:19,240
this is so confusing I thought that was with three men now I'm with a robot and

1172
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:25,600
and a half a robot and well a one man so like one and a half. Hey baby I'm still

1173
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:35,100
man all the way 100% right then a cane pulls me off stage and then pushes out

1174
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:42,280
like a robot that doesn't even look like me. Just like a Jetsons made robot.

1175
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,280
- Okay, and then the cane, as it pushes out the robot,

1176
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,160
it knocks me into the wall,

1177
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,560
and the other half of my body gets obliterated,

1178
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,400
and the same thing happens,

1179
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,440
and they replace the other half of my body with a robot.

1180
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,080
I am a full robot now.

1181
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,280
- These three, these two are my brothers.

1182
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,360
- We are robot brothers,

1183
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,720
and we have to go to the robot store.

1184
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,240
