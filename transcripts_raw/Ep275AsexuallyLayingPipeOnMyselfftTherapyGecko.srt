1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,800
- Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,480
The Crocodile himself is here in the building.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
- What's up boys, how's it going?

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,960
How's life? - What's up you killer croc?

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,800
How are you?

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,620
- I'm doing good, man.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,200
I love this set, I love this fish.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,080
You guys have a really cool operation here.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,960
- It used to be Christmas around here.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,800
- You do all everything.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,040
- It used to be Christmas everywhere, Patrick.

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
- Well, on the set.

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,280
That is true as well. On the set, it used to be Christmassy. You do a digital set.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,200
Yeah, I do. Well, it's crazy that you guys have like three cameras and five. It's

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,040
just me and a camera that sometimes works. And you're 40 times more successful.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,680
Well, I don't know. That's tough for us to hear. Maybe don't tell us about how

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:56,380
bare-boned. Oh yeah, I'm nothing. Yeah, no, don't do that to us, man. No, this is

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,260
really cool. I love that you have a guy who sounds like Jigsaw that's...

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,940
Jigsaw out there in Mexico doing his thing, man. Say hello, Julio. You don't have a producer?

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,940
Hello, Julio.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,380
I have somebody who helps me edit the podcast after the fact.

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,180
But nobody live doing all this.

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,180
You don't have a Jamie.

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,180
No, like when somebody...

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,180
We need a Jamie.

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,180
Everybody needs a Jamie.

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,420
The Jamie was a giant change for us.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,420
Really?

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,340
Yeah, because now we can say if we don't remember something or we don't remember what somebody

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,580
it looks like Google pig in the farm. You know something like that, like oh,

32
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,280
here's a pig in the farm. We need oh, we need a photo. What does a pig in a farm

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,460
look like? Well, why does this hold your horses pig in the far cry for the far

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,660
cry?

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,740
He pulls up our cry for pig hunting where to find pigs for upgrade. So you

36
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,120
actually quiver more in the game. He's not all that good at the job. I would

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,020
say, well, I mean, there's the pigs. He did it. He did find he's an expert. How

38
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,660
How are you liking New York City so far?

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:01,100
New York is awesome, man. I was really stoked and happy the first week I came here because

40
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,340
I sold my car and stuff. The honeymoon phase has kind of ended.

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,340
It's over.

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,340
Yeah, it's like this is my life now.

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,060
Have people started being mean to you?

44
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,700
First question, do you walk around wearing this?

45
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Not yet. I want to. It's too cold.

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,980
Do you think about going to Times Square hanging out with Elmo in the gecko costume?

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,460
I walked around... You could be Geico. Oh, snap. I walked around Las Vegas once in

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,180
the costume and this 12 year old kid came up to me and he showed me on his

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,100
phone that he had listened to all of my podcasts and then we took a picture

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,620
and then his mom came up behind him and tried to give me $5.

51
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,180
And I was like, "You don't have to do that." It's not one of those.

52
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,820
What a mark that lady is, Jesus Christ. We've never gotten a 12 year old.

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,940
No, I would say our audience on a Caleb goal.

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,340
We just need one. There's a one pick with a twelve year old because they'll

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,460
start going to school, spreading it around among all the other people

56
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,560
looking at different toilets or the toilet videos. What did you guys like?

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,240
Did you guys listen to podcasts when you were twelve or I'm sure you had like

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,160
YouTube or so you well with I used to be a big fan of you made it weird with

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,340
Pete home. Yeah, me too. Yeah, really yeah me too yeah, so I used to listen to

60
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,860
that when I was a kid and I would play Halo and I would do that was home

61
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,720
homeschooled, so I'd do that instead of learning. Really? Yeah, so I would do that pretty much

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,820
every day when I was a kid. And then I grew up and now it's not really my thing. How long

63
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,180
were you homeschooled for? Seventh grade all through high school. I have a friend who's

64
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,180
homeschooled and he mentioned... Now? Yeah. I'm friends with a... No, I have a friend

65
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:48,180
who, he was homeschooled. Okay. And he talks about how he feels too normal for the homeschooling

66
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,020
normal for the home schooled people, but to home schooled for the normal people

67
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,340
that you ever feel that I don't really at all blade. No, I was I was fully

68
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,300
homeschooled. I loved being in home school really. What was what you like

69
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,580
about it? No fucking school.

70
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,820
Did you were you not were you like were you lonely? Were you not? Hell no,

71
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,260
really? I had movies

72
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,420
and YouTube videos. Yeah, I guess this shit was amazing. That's cool, and then

73
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,380
I had to go to college. All of a sudden you're walking in and you have books. Oh

74
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,820
my God pencils. What are they? I really didn't know how to use them. I wasn't

75
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,380
even the kind of home school kid who gets good at something like I didn't. I

76
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,880
wasn't like

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,100
getting good at art, but that doesn't really ever happen. Well, the spelling

78
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,580
be there's one kid who was home schooled and destroyed the spelling instant

79
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,060
instantly. You've been proven wrong now. Nine percent of schooled kids and yes

80
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,420
schooled. I'm not because the home school is unschooled. Well, there's no.

81
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,940
That's a third thing are beating.

82
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,540
Well, the numbers don't matter, but the point is that it's smarter. What was

83
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,620
was your was it like a religious thing for you? Was it was it a teacher or was

84
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,140
it your your mom? I got in

85
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:59,020
with the thugs at my school and I was a I was I was what we call a future thug

86
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,380
really yeah. So I got pulled out because of the thug stuff that I was doing.

87
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,580
He ran over a teacher with a car. Yeah, it's not yeah. I did a lot of really

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,540
bad stuff and then my mom was I was getting suspended and I was on the verge

89
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,660
getting expelled and my mom was like we're taking you out of school. You got

90
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,900
I thought it was sick.

91
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,180
He was hanging out at a rival. I was hanging out at a rival. I was spreading.

92
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,220
I was like you don't even have lunch at our school. I was giving them the

93
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,260
football plays doing sort of very discreet handoffs, and so I just ended up

94
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,260
being taken out of school. You're given the sheet music for the and then I went

95
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,140
from this is a very rare. Well, I guess it's not that rare. I went from thug to

96
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,780
nerd

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,580
like

98
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,020
Today, do you still feel as though there's any thug remaining within you?

99
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,460
I pray for your sake, you don't find out.

100
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:57,020
I pray for you. I'm a de-escalation gecko now. Yeah, you don't wanna test

101
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,780
my gangster as it were, yeah, because it bites. Do you guys ever imagine

102
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,460
the situation? Well, I'm sure you do when you get mugged and what you would

103
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,740
do.

104
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,220
I think about this more than anything in the world. I had a new scenario

105
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,760
I came up with yesterday, okay, and this is if you're getting you're getting

106
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,360
mugged and you're just going next door to get some food. You didn't even bring

107
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,740
your wallet because you're going to pay with apple pay yeah and I was thinking

108
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,180
about this when I was going to get some food across the street. I thought well

109
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,800
someone comes up to me and tries to mug me because you know it's seven o'clock.

110
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,180
Yeah, the muggers are out. The muggers are out. They just I would just I would

111
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,380
be like charged. I would be like man seriously. I don't have my wallet on me.

112
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,320
I'm just getting food across the street with apple pay, but if you want I'll go

113
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
into my apartment and get my wallet

114
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,760
going, lock the door, all the police he would come into the apartment with you

115
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,420
I would be like I don't want you to come in because my girlfriend is home.

116
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,580
Have you guys ever gotten mugged before?

117
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,020
No, I've never been mugged and I know that because of that, it will be the end

118
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,140
of my life when it happens.

119
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,020
I have this like I've never been mugged before and I have this thing in my head

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,220
and I'm like there's no way I'm getting through life without the happening.

121
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,500
Because I've never been mugged, I'm building it up so much in my head with

122
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,460
all these scenarios and strategies that I will get stabbed.

123
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,540
Yeah, I will say there will be one word out of my mouth. They'll be like

124
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,420
give me your wall like well and then you'll be cycling through the dialogue

125
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,100
branch. Where do I go from here? I

126
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,860
this guy's already dying. Obviously, he's having so you'll actually you'll die

127
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,700
of natural causes thinking of what to do. Yeah, just trying to just trying to

128
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,700
do every every strategy at the same time of like just going like like a

129
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,060
deaf. Well, I have cancer and also I'm gay and then trying to make myself

130
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,620
throw up.

131
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,300
I've had I've had the fantasy that I would like appeal to the mugger

132
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,680
emotionally. I would look at him and I'd be like, Hey man, that's what I always

133
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,800
think. You know, what's going on? You don't need to do this. Yeah, but that's

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,660
not what would happen a lot. The way I would actually get stabbed is that

135
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,820
they would mug me and I'd have like two ten dollar bills in my wallet and I'd

136
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,640
try to give them one

137
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,600
getting mugged.

138
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,480
What I would do

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,200
immediately looking at the guy and just going.

140
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,000
I also think if I asked for my phone, I would probably go really, really man.

141
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,220
that's the one thing that like they really can't take anymore, because you

142
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,880
can just like

143
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,480
they have programmed the phones to be mug proof. You can know if you're not

144
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,900
your eye. There is a there is a bushwick bandit who really going around on a

145
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,060
bicycle or a motorized one bicycle, a bushwick bicycle band. It's been going

146
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,760
to people showing them a gun and saying give me your money when they don't have

147
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,200
money. He says come with me. He goes into stores will go into like dispensaries or

148
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,140
GameStop, he'll buy an X box with their Apple pay or they will and then he'll

149
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,580
leave and he does not kill. Why not just tell the one I just stop it? Yeah,

150
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,040
kill that's nice. Why don't you just stop him? That's my that's a good. See

151
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,060
that's what this is exactly the scenario. I need to be theory crafting

152
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,500
for yeah. This is what because I'm I'm you know still stuck on a guy shows me

153
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,260
a knife and says give me your money, but what do I do when he asked me to buy an

154
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,220
X box? Yeah, I know man. I don't game each. I don't have time. I would go in

155
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,360
to the game stop, I would be in there for about split it five seconds. I'd walk

156
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,940
out and I said they don't have x box man.

157
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,420
Well, I'm going to go

158
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,180
three sixty. Well, here's what you do. You spend the amount of money

159
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,820
you didn't want stick of truth.

160
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,380
I don't get it. That is a really good game. I would I hope you want it. I

161
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,460
think the thing that you're supposed to do is you're supposed to look at them

162
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,140
and say I've been waiting for this for a long time and then, when they say,

163
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,820
what do you mean you run away? I also think that's another confusion. I

164
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,300
one hundred percent someone tries to bug me, there's a good chance I will just

165
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,720
try and sprint away. I think there's a good chance I would do something really

166
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,080
offensive to get out of it, and so I just don't want to be put in that

167
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,140
situation. When I was a kid, I used to think like if I just like acted crazy,

168
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,540
yeah, I would be like, whoa, this guy's nuts. Yeah, I don't want his money. I

169
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,360
probably as crazy

170
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,860
as gonna

171
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,420
really is crazy.

172
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,700
It doesn't work in America. This guy's crazy. He probably only has coins on

173
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,860
it. Probably does a monopoly.

174
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,580
You walk around with the

175
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,820
walk around with a little bit of monopoly. Oh, you want to mug me?

176
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Look how crazy I am. I have

177
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,460
it's all money that has your own face on it. Yeah, Caleb coin. Here you go.

178
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,620
You can only a hundred million dollars. You can only buy stuff at my house with

179
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,580
this. Yeah, I'm really gonna and then you have a little closet where you have

180
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,260
like red vines and skin. Oh, my God, I just thought

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:21,700
I just thought of an incredible satirical, idiocracy style thing to do.

182
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,620
oh, bloody hell, they come to muggy. You say sorry man, I don't have any cash.

183
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,100
You got a card reader. Oh, that would be the thing is with this current. They

184
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,900
probably world they probably would they would and you would have to tip yeah

185
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,500
exactly.

186
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,500
They say how much is it to be like I'm tipping a hundred percent of the

187
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,260
fucking mugging

188
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,860
and shits. Bullshit. Yeah, the mugging tip percents are a hundred percent, a

189
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,260
hundred fifty percent of two hundred. I've been falling into this trap a lot

190
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,460
recently. They mugged two fifty, two fifty for a cup of coffee. They flip the

191
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,300
thing, how much you want to tip? I don't know, $2. I'm paying five bucks for one

192
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,380
cup of coffee now just because this fucking piece of shit wants money.

193
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,580
What the hell is that?

194
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,100
It's fucking killing me. It is destroying this country. Yeah, we need to get rid

195
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,820
of tipping. Yeah, we need to get rid of tipping. How do they do that in the

196
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,980
other countries where they don't have tips? Yeah, I don't think that they

197
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,860
don't really have tipping in like Europe and Australia. Yeah, do you just make

198
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,500
everybody just poor? Isn't it like... Sounds like they actually pay the people

199
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,140
and the way yeah, okay, well that's definitely not the solution. We

200
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,100
can't be doing that. I think if they in German class, they told me that if

201
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,700
you do tip more than like 20% or something, if you don't leave just like

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,140
a dollar coin or something, they get like offended, which I think is not

203
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,500
true. This is invented because this can't be true. Mexico when I was in

204
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,620
Mexico and they don't they don't tip there really well, they do like but

205
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,820
it's well, maybe Julio could speak to this, I guess, but they don't really

206
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,300
normally tip, but it's just like you just weren't tipping. Well, no, I was

207
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,940
we were tip every time and every time we tipped, they would always be like

208
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,400
oh my God, thank you so much like it was like to the part like you have to

209
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,540
stop. This is not okay. I can't be much everyone is looking at us. Maybe it's

210
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,980
like nobody tips your son.

211
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,380
Probably did that's maybe why nobody tips there because they're too grateful

212
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,300
yeah and it's a little embarrassing. You get a little here's a cheat code.

213
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
You live in a country where they tipping is not the norm. All you have to do is

214
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,580
move to a tourist city where Americans are going to come and tip you true and

215
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,860
you're going to make twice as much money. That's and then you act all offended or

216
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,560
whatever. Yeah. These are money hacks. Money hacks. Have you traveled

217
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,440
internationally? Yeah, I did. I went to Mexico City, went to all over Australia

218
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,880
and Europe. Were you doing shows there? Yeah, I was doing shows. Not in Mexico.

219
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,920
I did one show in Japan, which was fun. Oh, that's... Wow. Yeah, there was

220
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
40 people there, maybe, but... That's pretty impressive for Japan. It was

221
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,160
pretty cool. Dude, there was like... Most of them were expats, but there

222
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,840
were four or five actual Japanese people there who just found the podcast

223
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,480
from the computer and stuff.

224
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
That is sick.

225
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Have you guys done shows internationally?

226
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
No.

227
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
No, we're hoping to, but we gotta get passports.

228
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,920
Do a lot of international folks listen to this?

229
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
We don't know.

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Millions and millions.

231
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,200
Dude, I get "come to Brazil" a lot.

232
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
That's a threat.

233
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Well, no, I get "come to Brazil" and I'm like, "you guys are..." and then I'll see a comment

234
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,320
that says "come to Brazil" and I'll click the profile and it'll say that they live in

235
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,840
Brazil and I'm like, "fuck, maybe I should come to Brazil, they're not just fucking with

236
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
me."

237
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,000
is that you go to Brazil when people say that

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,960
and then they wanna be mean to you.

239
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,920
- Like chop up your body?

240
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,760
- Yeah, something like that.

241
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
Would you do a show in Brazil?

242
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,240
- Yeah, that'd be sick. - Would you do a show

243
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,200
if you knew they were gonna chop you up afterwards?

244
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
- Would I do a show if I knew

245
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,520
they were gonna chop me up afterwards?

246
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm open to any and all new experiences.

247
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,460
- Okay, well, with that in mind,

248
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,720
what if they kept you alive as they chopped you up

249
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,920
so you felt every chop and you couldn't die?

250
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,640
- Well, I don't know.

251
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,880
I have certain status tendencies.

252
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Well, let's just let's I mean let's strip the hypothetical question just down to

253
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,860
the bare essentials. Would you get chopped up? Would I get chopped up? That

254
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,720
sounds like a euphemism for something else.

255
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,100
Just into pieces, yeah, just little. Would you get chopped into pieces?

256
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,160
Chunks, chunks. Well, no, I actually, actually I would because there's

257
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,660
strength in numbers, and if there were more and more of you,

258
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,760
I could. If you're a gecko, you can. Oh, you're a gecko. Exactly, I'm a gecko.

259
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,540
So I could, they would all, like, just become their own little mini me's, and

260
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,360
and I could go and-- - A million little wiles

261
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
walking around.

262
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,200
- You know, I could be more productive.

263
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
- And then you can do all your tours,

264
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
you book a tour, you do the whole thing in one day.

265
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,800
- You do the whole thing in one day!

266
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,620
- The same time!

267
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,040
- One fucking day you do the tour,

268
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,480
'cause you have a bunch of mini-yous,

269
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,320
and each of them is--

270
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
- God, that's such a funny idea to book a tour

271
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
where every show's on the same day at the same time.

272
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,480
- Wait, actually, you know how like MF Doom

273
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,320
used to do that thing where they get imposters?

274
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,080
That would be kinda sick to put on,

275
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,560
a bunch of shows have an imposter doing a show.

276
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,400
- It's a roulette.

277
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,240
- One of them's gonna be real.

278
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,120
we the real one. I just invented guys what Mormonism God damn it. That's what

279
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,380
they do in Mormon temple. God fucking all do the same thing at the same is

280
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,680
that true? I think so. I was told that before maybe it's not true. I was told

281
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,860
they do every church do it at the same time. Well, I think they have to like

282
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,040
the same day at the same like script yeah. Oh really, well again I someone

283
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,080
told me that I could be where are you from from Baltimore? You're from

284
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,680
Baltimore.

285
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm from New Hampshire.

286
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Oh, okay.

287
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
From Massachusetts.

288
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Okay.

289
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
North Carolina, man.

290
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
East Coast boys.

291
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
All East Coast.

292
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
All East Coast all the time.

293
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
All East Coast all the way down the line.

294
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Have you guys been to Baltimore?

295
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Yeah.

296
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Yes, I have been to Baltimore.

297
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
What'd you do?

298
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
I was on the news there.

299
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I drove around on it.

300
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
What were you on the news for?

301
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,520
I was on the news with our friends Girl God and they were asking me about a viral carrot

302
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
hack.

303
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Yep.

304
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,400
And he said one of the most legendary lines in all of news history.

305
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,520
That's worthy of being pulled up.

306
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,660
Yeah, I don't know if we can find this line, but Patrick says and I quote, I

307
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,880
can't eat carrots. I'm allergic to carrots. This is the one line that I'm

308
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,640
not in. Okay, this is the one. We're not gonna be able to find this clip.

309
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,920
Yeah, they used my high school photo as a headshot. He says it like this.

310
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,280
Yeah, I can't eat carrots. I'm allergic to carrots. The only line I think I

311
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,700
said on the news. And that was the first TV appearance from anybody on the

312
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,580
podcast, and that is probably gonna be the only one. Yeah. And so it's gonna

313
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
a lasting legacy for us.

314
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,260
Oh, it's relatable. There's somebody else who has an allergy to carrots who's like, "I can

315
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,460
see myself in this man."

316
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Yeah, exactly. Maybe I'll check out his podcast.

317
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Representation.

318
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
How do you like Baltimore?

319
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,620
Baltimore's fine. It's not like... I enjoyed growing up there, but I wouldn't want to live

320
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
there.

321
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,980
Okay. Did you eat crabs every day?

322
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,420
I love the crab chip.

323
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
I love the crab chip.

324
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
That's a good one.

325
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,420
It's a good chip.

326
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
It's a little bit kind of Old Bay.

327
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,820
Yeah, Old Bay is good. I love Old Bay.

328
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Drug trade.

329
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,780
- For a drug trade? - Drug trade from the shows.

330
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,740
- Oh, hey man, I can't give out too much information

331
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,180
about my involvement in the Baltimore City drug trade.

332
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,980
- Don't worry about it, there's plenty of flyer up.

333
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,580
- Yeah, well, we'll do that.

334
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,900
I hate soliciting so much that I really,

335
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,260
we need to get a gun for the office

336
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,340
'cause this can't stand any longer.

337
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,580
- You guys ever shot a gun before?

338
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,420
- Yeah.

339
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,900
(laughing)

340
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,740
- Yeah, when you were 13.

341
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,480
- Come on, yeah, I think the last time I shot a gun,

342
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,500
I was like 14 and it was like a,

343
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,860
I think it was an MP5 and it was not a legal type of gun.

344
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,220
And we would just, we would go to the,

345
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,140
my brother worked at a paintball field

346
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,580
and we would wait till everybody left

347
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,900
and then we would just shoot guns

348
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,940
into all the like trees and shit.

349
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,780
And it was fun.

350
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,380
- My friends and I used to play with Airsoft a lot

351
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,300
and we found out that the Airsoft gun hurt enough

352
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,480
that you could kind of use it like a real gun

353
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,140
in that you could use it to force people to do things.

354
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,980
- Yes, that is true.

355
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,560
- Like you could point your fucking Airsoft gun at somebody

356
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,980
and be like, get on the ground right now

357
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,820
and they'll do it because they don't want you to.

358
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,660
- It does, it works good.

359
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,280
- It works the same way as a real gun.

360
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,000
yeah, I never liked any that was a thing everybody. I knew like paintball

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,680
growing up and I would play it and you go home, you're covered in bruises.

362
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,440
Even if you win, you have bruises on you, it should be the loser who gets

363
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,280
bruises right. They line them all up. Yeah, exactly the winner. You shouldn't

364
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,920
have. Oh yeah, you shouldn't be walking home feeling like physically bad. I

365
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,240
should never feel bad. That's what I'm saying. Have you guys ever got shot

366
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,480
with like an like a like a red rider BB gun? Oh no, I got shot by an airsoft

367
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,320
though. Yeah, like a metal BB. No, I don't think so. They can get stuck in you.

368
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,920
Do you guys remember when the AR-15, like I associated it with Call of Duty

369
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,920
instead of mass shootings? Yes, that was... Well, there was one in the game

370
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,220
though.

371
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,720
Which one? There was a mass shooting in the game. Oh, there was a mass

372
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,580
shooting, oh, like Call of Duty 4. Yeah, so even when I felt that it was

373
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,760
a Call of Duty gun, I saw the tide kind of creeping up.

374
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,640
right history yeah and so if you guys don't know Lyle Lyle does a show called

375
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,600

379
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,960
so how do you do it for a year I mean you gotta have a trained ear yeah so

380
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,800
You've gotten so many of these calls.

381
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,640
(laughing)

382
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,460
- Gets all the farts in the kid.

383
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,200
- Even from the first millisecond.

384
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
- I have two folders in my Google Drive.

385
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,920
- So you save them.

386
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,200
So what are you saving all these sounds for?

387
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,040
- What am I saving the fart and cleef sounds for?

388
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,760
I'm gonna make a cool song with them.

389
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,000
- Oh, okay, that sounds good.

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,360
- Put them on a sampler keyboard.

391
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,400
- What's the worst thing that anyone's ever called

392
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
and said into your show?

393
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,440
Prank style. - The worst thing.

394
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,240
Oh, prank style?

395
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,400
Jesus, man, I don't know.

396
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,520
Well, I had a guy very since,

397
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,120
He very earnestly called me to tell me about how he had a small penis.

398
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,520
And so for about 15 minutes, I was really...

399
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,720
Keeping it together.

400
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,240
Really, really earnestly, like trying to talk him through his

401
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,040
low self-esteem as a result of having a small penis.

402
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,760
And I really felt like we kind of connected in this way,

403
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,880
not saying that I have a small penis, but we just connected...

404
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,560
That there was something.

405
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,040
Right.

406
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,800
In this way.

407
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,680
And then at the very end, he goes, "I'm just kidding.

408
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,800
My dick is huge and you're a dumbass."

409
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,480
And then he called it.

410
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,980
and that

411
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,080
that just really hurt my feelings, 'cause yeah, so first of all, you got

412
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,680
destroyed.

413
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,720
I took the, no, no, I took the bait, but

414
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,280
well, here's the thing, as like, if I had told him he was fucking with

415
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,520
me,

416
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,880
then what if he really did it? What if he really did have a small

417
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,160
penis? He would have killed himself. And then he leaves feeling sad. I'd

418
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,560
rather I leave feeling like I... His life's already so bad. Yeah, can you

419
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,000
imagine you call, you're like, "God, I've struggled with this self esteem

420
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,240
based on my small penis my entire life. I don't know where to turn anymore.

421
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm going to try calling my favorite pot.

422
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,640
That sounds fucking stupid and fake.

423
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,380
I guess that would be bad. Most people like I get calls about a lot of like

424
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,840
weird stuff and most people in the comments are like this is fake and

425
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,240
stupid, but I, I, I might, I think like a smaller percent of stuff is fake and

426
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,340
stupid. I generally believe I say I go into a believing thing. Has anyone ever

427
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,620
called and you recognize the voice and it's a celebrity?

428
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,040
Gilbert Gottfried or somebody like this. Yeah. Somebody with a really

429
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,880
recognizable voice. Yeah, I had someone who was doing a Scooby-Doo impression.

430
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,720
You had Scooby-Doo? Scooby-Doo. You assume it's an impression, but I'm

431
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,880
sure it could have been Scooby. I mean, no, Scooby-Doo's seen some shit.

432
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,420
Yeah. He's seen ghosts. He literally knows ghosts are real. He's also really

433
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,280
a food addict. Wait, hold on. Okay, wait. Actually, so in Scooby-Doo, isn't

434
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,800
the whole thing that ghosts are not real? 'Cause at the end, they like...

435
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,700
the original, whatever any kind of supernatural element is then revealed

436
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,380
to just be like a mailman. At least aliens are 100% real. Aliens are 100%

437
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,000
real. That's the last episode of Scooby Doo is that Scooby Doo takes off his

438
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,340
mask.

439
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,440
A really bad dog impression. Dogs can talk.

440
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,500
Doing a very bad dog impression. You guys believe dogs can talk?

441
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:37,460
So you like what you do? Sometimes, sometimes. This documentary just came

442
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:44,420
about me on Vice that were, and I went into it wanting to like, be honest about like my own,

443
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,420
like, mental health struggles and whatnot. But I watched it and I was like, Oh, fuck,

444
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:58,340
is my is my life sad? And I do like what I do sometimes, but sometimes like, like, like what

445
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,340
you guys are doing, like, this is like a just a light hearted riff. roast is fun. Like, do you

446
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,420
Do you walk out of this being like energized?

447
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,140
- Well, sometimes we hurt each other's feeling.

448
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,260
- It gets really, really rough sometimes.

449
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,460
- We get nasty at each other.

450
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,180
- Sometimes we will realize that we said something

451
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,540
that we've already said before, which really...

452
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,380
(laughing)

453
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,700
- How long have you all been friends?

454
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,060
- It's basically the exact same time as we've done the podcast.

455
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,420
(laughing)

456
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,140
- So tell me if the podcast is over,

457
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,660
you guys are just never gonna see each other again.

458
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,380
- No question. - No, definitely.

459
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,200
- No. - Yeah.

460
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,220
- Wait, are you trying to psychoanalyze me, you bastard?

461
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,220
I'm just asking questions. What kind of fucking droid witchcraft are you doing in this gecko suit?

462
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,920
Oh my God, this is the way people... I'll be talking to people... This happens to me in my real life.

463
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,720
I'll just be talking to somebody and I just ask them something and they'll be like,

464
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,220
"Are you doing your therapy thing on me right now?"

465
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,420
Are you a classically trained psychoanalyst?

466
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,220
No, I'm a crazy person.

467
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,720
What'd you go to... Oh, okay.

468
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I went to film school in Philadelphia.

469
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Oh, okay.

470
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,920
The same type of thing always happens to us. We'll be talking to people in our personal lives

471
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,220
and they're always like, "Are you trying to make a list out of me?"

472
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,100
Yeah, you're trying to listen to me right now. Do you guys like what you do?

473
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,700
Yeah, yeah, I mean I do so many things.

474
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,900
Yeah, I definitely do a lot of other stuff. Yeah, it's not my only thing. I

475
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,020
don't know what things do you do? I'm a future artist. Just kind of bond

476
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,100
Vivant stuff. Cool. Yeah, all types of bond Vivant type of things. Three times

477
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,140
a day. I cook a lot times a day. One time a day. Yeah, cook cooking. Yeah,

478
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,480
I actually do cook a lot.

479
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I am.

480
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,060
I'm on, I'm going to give a free shout out to the Factor Meal Plan.

481
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,740
I'm on those meal plans.

482
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
I hate fucking cooking.

483
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Don't tell me you have a code.

484
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,740
I'm not giving out a code.

485
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Do not give out a code right now.

486
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,740
No, no, no, no, it's not a code.

487
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
I don't even sponsor the fucking thing.

488
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
You do the meal plans?

489
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
That's what you're trying to do.

490
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
I do the meal plans.

491
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,740
Here's my question about this.

492
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,420
You're going to hear this give you a code?

493
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,420
What happens when you get these meal plans and then you're like, "Oh, I'm in the mood

494
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,420
for spaghetti."

495
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,900
And then they give it to you and it's some bullshit fucking stupid ass salad.

496
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,260
If you're a good enough chef, you can literally turn the ingredients of salad

497
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,060
into spaghetti. But

498
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:07,020
you break it down to all the molecules and you put them back together. I guess

499
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,380
if you are really good at cooking, you could do that. You could do that. That's

500
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,580
a YouTube video right there. I made spaghetti out of salad. Yeah, isn't it?

501
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,420
You will see that on your YouTube page. Isn't that all

502
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,580
molecular gastronomy is? It's like, "Oh yeah, we turn this tomato into an apple."

503
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,580
That's alchemy. Yeah. You're thinking about it. No. You guys know so many

504
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,580
things. Yeah, molecular gastronomy. This is the kind of stuff that we talk about here

505
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,580
a lot. So you like this factor meal plan thing? I do. I'm trying to... Alright, so part of

506
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,780
this... I watched this documentary about me being sad. Is that what we're so sad about?

507
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,260
Is that you're eating out of these plastic bins? No, it's been a happy thing of my life

508
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,180
because normally I'm like... I've been on a crazy binge this... I was like... That's

509
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:55,140
my thing is binge eating. And so I was waking up at 3 AM and going to the bodega and drinking

510
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,060
a Yoo-Hoo, but I was romanticizing it like I was doing heroin in the rain.

511
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
The Yoo-Hoo.

512
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,060
That felt good, yeah.

513
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,820
No, well, it felt good, I guess, in the way that heroin feels good.

514
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
So very good.

515
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,820
So great.

516
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
Yeah, extremely, extremely good.

517
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,820
It's the number one thing.

518
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,220
By the way, just to, like, because this is something I want to debunk, a lot of people

519
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,580
think the Yoo-Hoo is chocolate milk.

520
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,580
It's not.

521
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
It's a chocolate drink.

522
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
It's water.

523
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
It's water, yeah.

524
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
Chocolate water.

525
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,980
Although there is milk in it as a...

526
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,180
Yeah, you gotta get the milk.

527
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,540
Yeah, there's milk allergen.

528
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,540
You gotta get the milk to get the chocolate.

529
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Or the other way around.

530
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Chocolate from a bean, my friend.

531
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,540
There's a cookies and cream Yoohoo that I'm hesitant

532
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
to try because I think it'll ruin my life.

533
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Like, you'll get hooked to this new

534
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,540
Yoohoo. Yeah.

535
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,540
You're in good company, we've all had

536
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
some level of candy addiction.

537
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
What's your guys' stuff?

538
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Him is everything.

539
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
All candy. He loses all his teeth everyday

540
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,540
because he eats so much candy.

541
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,540
He's cracked his teeth on candy.

542
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,900
tooth on a, it was either a gummy worm or some kind of hard gum.

543
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,500
How do you crack your tooth on a gummy worm? It was bad, it was bad,

544
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,340
it was one of those hard gum. It was like on the bottom of a,

545
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,660
it was like on a car's carpet on the ground. He normally has a candy

546
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,580
problem 'cause he gets the types of candies that have like four adjectives

547
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,900
in the name. Yeah. He's like, he's not satisfied with gummy worms.

548
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,780
He's gotta get the very, very super sour crawlers. Yeah. Have you had the

549
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,980
crunchy crawlers? No. Have you guys ever had Nerds Gummy Clusters? Oh,

550
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,500
yeah. I've never liked the little Nerds Gummy Clusters. You guys ever seen

551
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,620
Jimmy Neutron. They're like, it's the candy from Jimmy Neutron.

552
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,460
It's so fucking good.

553
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,660
They're really good. I had to stop eating candy.

554
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,900
So I'm pretty much off of candy, except for the other day.

555
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,220
I had the new Churros Kit Kat.

556
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,700
I just remembered this.

557
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,500
He says new. He knows when they come out.

558
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
That's what I mean.

559
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,140
Well, you read the trades.

560
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,220
What it was is I saw the Kit Kat there and I was like, well,

561
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,100
that is a new flavor. I have to try it.

562
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,940
And it was churro and it was, I'm going to be honest, not even worth it.

563
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,780
Every morning, it was not worth breaking edge on candy. Every morning you take

564
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,080
the newspaper, you like unfurl and you go to the candy.

565
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,480
Let's see what is horrible doing. So the factor has gotten you off the you who

566
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,520
somewhat. Some somewhat just like having a routine of some kind. That's my new

567
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,240
thing. I'm trying to figure out how to

568
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,820
well see. This is the thing about therapy. Gecko is that ultimately it is

569
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,220
the story of Polly. Achi the clown where I'm like, how do I'm trying to figure

570
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:20,260
out how to be happy and exist as a person. And so I'm like, "All right, maybe the

571
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,380
first step is to not drink Yoo-Hoo's at 3 a.m." And then I'm like, "How do I...

572
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,700
Now I'm trying to get into that, you know, so...

573
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,460
The sugar rush.

574
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah, so I'm on a bit of a spiritual journey.

575
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,300
These days, that...

576
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,580
Well, these days, the sugar makes you happy, though.

577
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:32,780
Yeah.

578
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,540
These days, that whole clown nonsense...

579
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:33,820
They do.

580
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,660
That's the premise of Willy Wonka.

581
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,220
Well, that's true.

582
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,500
Did you guys see the Wonka movie?

583
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,060
Not yet.

584
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,900
No, my wife did.

585
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,660
Okay, it sucked.

586
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,900
Yeah, I heard it was really good.

587
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,940
It's terrible. I re-watched the 2006 Willy Wonka movie, It Rocks.

588
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
With Depp.

589
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
Yeah, with Depp.

590
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,700
I mean, also, by the way, they don't give a fuck about it.

591
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:55,700
I like that Willy Wonka because he, like the new Willy Wonka is kind of like a dope, but

592
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,500
this, the Johnny Depp one, he hates children.

593
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,700
And he's mean to all the kids.

594
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
And it's way funnier.

595
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
This is his origin.

596
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
I hear the new one is Woker.

597
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
Oh, shit.

598
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
No way.

599
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
Willy Woka or something.

600
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Oh, my God.

601
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
They drop a slur in the fucking, in the 2006 one.

602
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Oh, yeah, sure.

603
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
They were cussing about it.

604
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
It's so funny.

605
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
I mean, I don't know.

606
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
I don't know.

607
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
I don't know.

608
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,380
Yeah, sure. They were it's so funny. They when they're they're

609
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,900
woke fying the the new Willy Wonka. Then they're like, how do we how do we fix

610
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,920
how do we fix the Oompa Loompas? How do we make this not Willy Wonka having a

611
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,060
bunch of jungle slaves? Yeah. And then it's that they put you grant small and

612
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,060
he's like, my God, I can't believe you've

613
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:38,020
just that they still as a slave. But now it's a quippy

614
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,820
Isn't it? Well, he has multiples of there's a lot of stuff. I don't know,

615
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,020
man. I didn't see it. Do we have a Wonka expert that can call it?

616
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,780
Trailer that he catches Hugh Grant in a glass thing like a cockroach.

617
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,740
He catches him. Yeah, he catches him. There's only one of them. That's,

618
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,660
I think the thing about the Willy, the Oompa Loompas as cool as that.

619
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,340
They're a bunch of little guys. I don't care that there's just one.

620
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,540
He only had one Oompa Loompa in the new one.

621
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,820
Only one Oompa Loompa. Sometime between the prequel and the,

622
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,700
and the original he's the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa is fucking.

623
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:16,980
Yeah, he's a sexually reproducing. Yeah, a pipe. What is it like when a person is

624
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,660
a sexually laying pipe on them?

625
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,160
Isn't it strange that

626
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:29,320
they're all guys? Yeah. How do they make new ones? Well, again, that's the

627
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,660
wokeness of the thing. Let me tell you, they don't show you the girl Oompa

628
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,540
Loompas because it's a kid's movie. True, and they'd be bad as fuck.

629
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,280
crazy. It's something I could only dream of and orange as well. Yeah, wait is

630
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,880
you orange in the movie? Yeah, orange with green on top. He has his orange

631
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,860
hue. He looks like an orange hue. Yeah, so there we go. That's why. That's why

632
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,400
they got him. Hue green. Yeah, hue green and orange.

633
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,580
They could have made a million different types of hue. They did. It's called

634
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,420
Oompa Loompas. No, no, in different hues. In different hues, they could have

635
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,360
made a movie of Hugh Grant as different colors. Oh my God, it could be called

636
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,060
Seven Hughes. It could be called the Seven Hughes, exactly. And it's Hugh Grant,

637
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,300
Purple Hugh Grant, Red Hugh Grant. But they all have different powers and

638
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,660
abilities. But what if you don't know anything in a movie, they have to do

639
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,540
something. What are you doing with just a bunch of people saving your colors?

640
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,660
Somebody's stealing colors from the world. Exactly. We were gonna watch a

641
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,780
movie exactly that was the plot of this. Nobody does anything, right? Really.

642
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,780
Well, there's... You know what I just watch? I just watch this movie sideways.

643
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,700
I'd never seen this movie before. Oh, that's... Oh, wait, I keep confusing

644
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,600
sideways with the one about heroin. There's one about wine is one about

645
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,500
heroin. This is really good guys. This movie is about wine and I went home and

646
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,160
I had a glass of wine well and I did I put my nose in it and I just smelled

647
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,740
like piss to me. Yeah, I still drink it always smells bad. It did. I didn't like

648
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,640
it. I don't think I can get into wine. I think wine is going away. I've yeah, I

649
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,040
heard wine is declined. It feels ancient.

650
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,560
It feels so ancient to drink wine. You feel it's kind of does week. It's desert

651
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,180
you drink it out of a some organ. I like beer. Wine is going to go the way of

652
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,780
mead and flagons. Yes, it'll be gone very, very. We're not going to see someone

653
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,700
will see a wine glass and think, oh, what am I in a castle? Yeah, exactly.

654
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,100
Yeah. Do you like drinking? I do.

655
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,740
It's not my it's not my main vice, though. It's not my name, but yeah, you

656
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,060
who

657
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:27,420
I like to drink. I'm trying to I drink an entire by I got my latest like I

658
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:27,700
think

659
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,840
big binge was I drank an entire bottle of like it was a chocolatey liquor. Oh,

660
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,320
yeah, don't tell me you just drank Bailey's by itself. I drank Bailey's by

661
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
itself. Yeah, you mix it with you. Yeah, dude. No,

662
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,600
I drank a whole fucking bottle of Bailey's the next morning. I'm like, I

663
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,080
gotta get on the factor meal plan.

664
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,160
That's like my, that's, that knocks two things out of the way right at once. It

665
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,200
gets your chocolate and your liquor. Yeah, yeah, it's ultimate sin. It's much

666
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,500
better than, you know, drinking a handle of vodka and then eating a chocolate

667
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,700
bar.

668
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,900
That also sounds pretty awesome. Yeah. That sounds amazing. Do you like, do you

669
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,400
like... Actually, no, it was horchata. Oh, rum chata. Rum chata. Rum chata.

670
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,420
Rum chata. Rum chata. Yeah. That's better than Bailey's, I think. Yeah. Yeah.

671
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,860
'Cause Bailey's is like a... It's a thick syrup. Bailey's is a cream. Yeah.

672
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,580
Drinking a whole can of Bailey's. Just add the bottle. Really funny. In a

673
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,540
paper bag on the stoop, drinking the Bailey's. When I was a kid, I used

674
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,620
I used to think, because they have those little Irish Bailey's chocolates, I used to think

675
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,940
you could get drunk from just eating the fucking chocolates.

676
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,740
We were trying to figure out if there were alcohol edibles and then we tried to make

677
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,380
an alcoholic beef stew on this show.

678
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,380
Yeah, and it was a fail.

679
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,380
It was really bad.

680
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,860
You guys have had vodka gummy bears?

681
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
No.

682
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,860
That was something from high school.

683
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Oh, wait a minute, yeah, where you put them in the thing of vodka and then they absorb

684
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,860
everything.

685
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Yeah.

686
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,860
I remember those, yeah.

687
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,260
I never had one that was done right.

688
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,520
I always had them when they were still sitting in the pool, the ratio was off, and then the

689
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,820
gummy bears just became this sticky goo. It never worked. But I tried one and it didn't

690
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
even get me drunk.

691
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,680
I've had a chocolate ball that had whiskey inside of the ball.

692
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Infused?

693
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,940
No, like a liquid whiskey in the ball.

694
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,940
Like a Wonderball with whiskey.

695
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
Yeah, and it was disgusting.

696
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
I can imagine.

697
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,420
It was fucking disgusting. It was like $10 for three of them. It was not a good candy.

698
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,740
I think that alcohol... I love alcohol.

699
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,660
- You should not mix. - Keep it in a cup, man.

700
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,420
- Yeah. - What's your ultimate vice?

701
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,260
What gets you?

702
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,540
- My ultimate vice thus far has been every single one

703
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,020
at different points in time.

704
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,840
- Yeah. - Really?

705
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,540
- Yeah, so now I'm kind of on the nicotine pouch.

706
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,420
- Oh, the zincs?

707
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,060
- Very close, the zen.

708
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,460
- The zen, I took one of those and it made me,

709
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,700
I feel like the buzz goes away after a while.

710
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,780
- Oh, yeah. - And that's why

711
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,620
you just do more of it.

712
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,500
And this is kind of how you form a dependency on it.

713
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,740
Yeah, so it's really amazing. Now my wife got on and now she's trying to quit.

714
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,700
Do you really have a wife?

715
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,500
Yeah, I'm really married.

716
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,140
Okay, cool.

717
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:06,460
She's trying to quit and now she's saying she can't see the tin in the fucking house.

718
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,100
And so now I'm hiding it. Now I feel dirty.

719
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,380
You gotta get the rewards.

720
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,740
Yeah, and she's like, "Well, you could just quit."

721
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,940
The hiding of it, doesn't that give you even a bigger rush?

722
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,660
Bigger thrill, yeah.

723
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,380
Well, now that I've recontextualized it, perhaps it will.

724
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,860
Now that I'm hiding, but then she's always going to be like, "What are you hiding?"

725
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,220
drinking and then I'm going to have to make up of some kind of

726
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,460
it's all to its hours. I have

727
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:33,320
I have a I have them still yeah and I'm going to have to develop a real drug

728
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,260
problem so that I can hide the sin in the make it. I've been having to come to

729
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,520
terms recently that I feel I've had I've had my vices in the past of TV and

730
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,720
eating candy and gaming and wasting what time and whatever way, but I think truly

731
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,380
right now my vice is literally actually simply sitting on the couch and doing

732
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,840
nothing. This is my main my biggest struggle right now. That's not a vice.

733
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,060
That's meditation. It's not the way

734
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:05,580
no zero nothing behind the eyes. Yeah, full becoming a piece of furniture.

735
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,660
Yes, can't move. That sounds like good. That sounds like how you do

736
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,940
meditation. Well, no, because are you watching? I've seen him. He's too lazy

737
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,120
to get the remote. You're really actually really doing nothing. Maybe

738
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,580
sometimes I'm on my phone, but sometimes I am just sitting there man. That's

739
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah, that's, actually I do think that's good.

740
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I have a vice that I have been doing only in the winter.

741
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What is that?

742
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,120
Where it gets so cold in my apartment that I will take my wife's hair dryer and I'll

743
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,920
sit in the bed and I'll just blow my entire body.

744
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,480
And she comes in and she says, "What the fuck are you doing?

745
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
You're bald."

746
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,840
And I say, "Shut up."

747
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I'm growing one hair.

748
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,680
Yeah, I'm growing one, my hair got wet.

749
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,920
My one hair got wet, my big baby hair.

750
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,680
I think all my vices are normal stuff.

751
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Candy and skateboarding.

752
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,160
alcohol, tobacco, gambling. Dude, I'm trying so hard to have an alcohol vice.

753
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,120
I just can't do it, man. Yeah. Fall asleep. You have to go and get stuff.

754
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,640
I wanna have a margarita every night of my life for the rest of my

755
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,120
life. But then you fall asleep when you do it. It makes me fall

756
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,300
asleep. Yeah. This is where you need to... 'Cause there's so much effort

757
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,920
that's put into making it that once you have... It's easy to make. Just

758
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,140
power through, man. Why are you being such a bitch? Yeah. Just power through,

759
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,040
drink 10 in one night and then you'll be able to drink five every night.

760
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,880
Come on Cameron, you can do it.

761
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm going to do it.

762
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Drink 15 tequila sodas in one night.

763
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,840
Cameron, I think you should do what feels right to you.

764
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,040
It feels so right to me.

765
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Here you come with this bullshit again.

766
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
That's all I can do.

767
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
God damn it man.

768
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
That's all I can do.

769
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,800
How about you sit, look him in the eye and say, I know you meathead.

770
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
You know what feels right to me?

771
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,800
It's the current US government.

772
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
There we go.

773
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Thank you.

774
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Do you get political on your show?

775
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
All the time.

776
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,720
We always talk about, you know.

777
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,520
Are you sick of this bull crap up in Washington or what?

778
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,000
What you mean?

779
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The down in Washington with the swamp?

780
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,440
The public transportation issues?

781
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,280
Well basically the whole damn thing.

782
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Here's my one question.

783
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Nuclear bomb Washington DC, yes or no?

784
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
Blow the whole thing up.

785
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Start over.

786
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,160
That wouldn't be like a...

787
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,760
You know how people are upset about global warming and how the Earth's gonna die?

788
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I guess they're upset.

789
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Is it that...

790
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,640
Well the Earth's gonna be fine but humans are gonna die but is that that bad that everyone

791
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,640
dies?

792
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,480
I think it's everything dies.

793
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,640
Yeah, well, no, I don't think it's everything.

794
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,520
Oh, my God,

795
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,120
life evolves. I've learned this even though I was homeschooled, right? And I

796
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,320
wasn't allowed to learn this, but now I've learned this. And so what we're

797
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,960
just gonna get the world's gonna get hotter, we will get. Do you know what?

798
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,800
You know, it's crazy. I was reading. I was reading about well, I was really

799
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,000
getting interested in trying to go to the place where they did the Castle

800
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,480
Bravo nuclear test because you can go there. Yes, it's in the it's the bikini

801
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,720
at all a toll at all a toll bottom a toll. You can go there, you can fully go

802
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,320
there and you can go scuba diving and you can look at like wrecks of ships from

803
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,760
the nuclear test and stuff yeah and it's crazy and the crazy thing is I don't

804
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,200
understand how this can be possible that they say it's it's safe to go there. You

805
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,840
can go there, but do not eat anything from there. How can that be okay? If

806
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,360
there's a place where you can't eat anything that's there, how can you be

807
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,560
staying there. How did that stuff?

808
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,360
It was there

809
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,680
swimming there yeah, their fish, they're going to keep swimming. They could go

810
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,240
anywhere in the ocean. Well, that's true that scares me. That's horrifying yeah,

811
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,800
it's not that scary to me. I don't care, but how can you be allowed to go there

812
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,280
and it be okay, but you just can't eat an apple there? We have to bring all

813
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,920
your food. You have to bring food from somewhere else. When you go there, you

814
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,080
can't eat anything from there. I had a question. I watch up and where is this

815
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,600
nice in the bikini a toll it's somewhere in the

816
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,440
it's in the Pacific. It's between I would say it, but in the I would say

817
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,200
it's between if I had to guess I'm not a geography guy. It's somewhere between

818
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,600
Australia, Japan and Hawaii.

819
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,340
Maybe they tell you not to eat anything.

820
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,840
I need you at the helm of the ship.

821
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,460
You will be you will be telling me exactly where to go. Yeah,

822
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,900
I watch Oppenheimer and they do an explosion in the movie in the middle of

823
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,120
Trinity. You can go there to and then let people in there every well. That's

824
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,180
what I was watching. The was like this is this whole secret thing and you did

825
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,060
all this outside and nobody fucking noticed. Well, all the main American

826
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,780
people noticed who

827
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,640
yeah, but they didn't tell anyone. Those people weren't like well. I'm sure they

828
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,580
did tell people and everyone was like, oh yeah, sure

829
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,280
great cloud blanketed the sky. I have yeah rain of black ash fell down and

830
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,120
made us very sick. Oh, you're off with your mythology again.

831
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,920
I couldn't believe how long that movie was. I was too long three hours. Yeah,

832
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,400
watch another plane. No, I watched it on my couch and it took three sessions of

833
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,360
watching, but one day is worth a watch. I haven't seen it so fucking. There's a

834
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,240
little of the honestly in the one hundred percent not kidding a little bit

835
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,760
too much nudity for my taste. The nudity, the nudity is a little over done. It was

836
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,720
incredible. Who's nude? Florence Pugh. Is the nudity, is it in a context

837
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,140
where it's like, "All right, this needed to be in here for..." I mean,

838
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,200
I never feel like I need to see anybody's body.

839
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,600
I mean, when you say, "Hey, I need to see your body," that's not a

840
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,080
good context. I think that's the first nudity on IMAX. Really? Yeah.

841
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,280
What did it look like in IMAX, the nudity body? Huge.

842
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:31,320
Floor to ceiling. Imagine a warehouse where you're looking at a naked

843
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,280
Lawrence Pugh that takes up the entire room. Okay, yeah, I could see how that

844
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,940
would be at least like it was back crazy to be also an imagine you're in a room

845
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,920
with five hundred

846
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,440
guys who wanted to see Oppenheimer just

847
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,160
this. You hear everybody in the theater. I go, whoa, yeah, time, holy crap,

848
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,640
those are big. Wow, well, Lyle, the real bomb,

849
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,920
the we have because we know that you give advice to people, so I sort of

850
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,760
Yeah, well, we've watched hours and hours of your show.

851
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,600
Well, you have therapy in your name.

852
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,400
You have therapy in your name?

853
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,900
I do.

854
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,120
And also you're green.

855
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,720
I am green.

856
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,640
And a little bit of kind of yellowish as well.

857
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,240
Yeah, something like that.

858
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,040
Oh, I had a question.

859
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,800
Why'd you go for gecko?

860
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,440
Do you believe that you can be anything

861
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,560
that you want in the world?

862
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,680
No, definitely not.

863
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
Well, I do.

864
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,280
OK.

865
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,920
And you chose a gecko.

866
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,440
I like that attitude.

867
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,000
I like that.

868
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,200
Are you worried that Geico is going to come after you?

869
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,640
Is this a Geico gecko?

870
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I legally cannot answer that question.

871
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,400
- I believe that is actually true.

872
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,520
We found some people who are very in need of advice.

873
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,360
- Oh, sure.

874
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,520
- And we need to kind of solve their problem.

875
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,920
- You know what, let's, you know what?

876
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,200
You know what, yes, I do give advice, yes.

877
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,040
- Yes.

878
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,720
- I'm doing time, I gotta be more confident.

879
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,920
- And now you're plugged in.

880
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,040
- And now I'm plugged in.

881
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,400
- So go ahead and go to, who wanted to go first?

882
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,240
Somebody said they wanted to.

883
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,400
- Oh, are these phone calls or are these?

884
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,480
- No, these are from a forum.

885
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,320
- These are from a forum call.

886
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,400
- Yeah, Cameron, you or?

887
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,240
- Oh, sure.

888
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,240
What was it? What was it called again? Help me or not alone. He not

889
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,880
always a real like these weren't like are these guys are these your guys's

890
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,120
view? No, these are real. These are real people. This is what we find the

891
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,680
real people of our problem. Cool. Real

892
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,960
let me let me read you this first question here, and this says, Is it

893
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,200
stange that I enjoyed this summer? Two thousand and one was one of the best

894
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,120
summers of my life. I had finished my sophomore year of high school and was

895
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,720
finally going to be an upperclassman getting all that closer to graduating

896
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,140
and going to college and took driver's ed. You all know I loathe you all know I

897
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,440
loathed being a kid slash teenager. Of course, I finally felt like I was truly

898
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,400
growing up. Plus, the weather that summer was perfect, not hot and humid, but

899
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,920
gorgeous. Of course, we all know what happened that September. I'll never

900
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,340
forget it. None of us will. As my forum title implies, when 9-11 happened, I

901
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,960
actually well enjoyed it. Oh my God, why? Because I knew that a catastrophic event

902
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,640
like that comes once in a lifetime. I just love the fact that I knew that I

903
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,480
was going to be able to tell people that I was around when it happened like

904
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,120
JFK's assess nation. Naturally, I took a photo of the TV set that day.

905
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,520
Wait, I

906
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:18,660
I also saw Janet Jackson's infamous wardrobe malfunction live at my first

907
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,880
college. I remember that my first college I leaned over to my friend Nadia

908
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,260
and asked they allowed to show that again. I say I can't help but enjoy the

909
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,240
fact that I'm able to say I remember that and I saw it when it actually

910
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,260
happened. Is it strange that I enjoyed those events and was not exactly

911
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,160
horrified or heartbroken? Remember my reasons. Also remember this all happened

912
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,740
before it was it was found out that I'm autistic. Thank you for reading and for

913
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,320
feedback. I appreciate heart. I do like the idea of watching the wardrobe

914
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,660
malfunction and being

915
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:53,480
well. Here's the thing we all want to be a part of something, even if that's

916
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,300
something is 9/11. Yeah, of course. So I think that that's really just what... So is it strange?

917
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,460
He's just... So somebody called you and said this word for word. They said, "I enjoyed

918
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,740
9/11 and more so than that, if you think that makes me sick, I enjoyed a wardrobe malfunction."

919
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:15,780
Yeah. So you would say, "It's all good, man." Well, I think it is indicative of a desire

920
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,380
to just be a part of something. So for this guy, I mean... It's really beautiful more than

921
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,740
You know, yeah it is. Well, if I were him, instead of why I would like join a sewing

922
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,380
club or something instead of watching YouTube videos of 9/11 all the time.

923
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,940
Yeah, it's probably more, it's probably healthier ways to find.

924
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,180
You can find some friends in that comment section though.

925
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:40,920
I bet, yeah, I bet, I bet there, no, I bet there are like 9/11 truth form people who

926
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,420
just love the scene.

927
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,500
Yeah, yeah. People don't, they don't care who did it.

928
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,980
They show up to the meetings and whatever and they're just making friends.

929
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,980
Yeah.

930
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,980
That's what it's really about.

931
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,700
It did actually launch a lot of community in a way.

932
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,700
It really did.

933
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:01,580
And when you see people wearing the bumper sticker on their car, you're like, "Ah."

934
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,580
I liked 9/11.

935
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,580
This is a different guy.

936
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,420
This is a different guy from a truther.

937
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,420
I've never heard of a 9/11 truther.

938
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
A truther but a liker.

939
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,420
A liker has a big joy.

940
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
That's what you guys are out on to happen.

941
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,420
A 9/11 liker.

942
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,420
A liker.

943
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,620
yeah, a nine eleven like or like are you a truth or a like or I wonder how often

944
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,820
he looks at that photo that he took of the TV.

945
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,460
Background every day is like

946
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,480
on like a disposable camera or something back then or now they had digital

947
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,140
camera. They had

948
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,340
it's in a frame and it says memories.

949
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,940
I just imagine I'm taking it with a Polaroid, though

950
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:42,220
true. Do you think that do you think that do you think it was a selfie? Yeah,

951
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,780
could have been it might have been a self. The thing is about a Polaroid,

952
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,780
you know, I mean you have to put the fucking date on it. Everyone knows

953
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,620
how to like the idea that it has the date at the bottom of the Polaroid.

954
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,180
What the hell? What's this? Oh,

955
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,940
looking at the back to figure it out.

956
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,540
You know,

957
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,700
okay, this next one, this is kind of a back and forth with this guy. This is

958
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:10,380
the question. Why did only that girl say bye? Wow, and this is from a binosh

959
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,340
Abhinav says five days ago. I had a training for a batch of 49 students

960
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,540
after the class only one girl out of 10 girls said by while leaving the

961
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,540
classroom. Why that girl only what is the difference between other nine

962
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,440
girls and this one? Wow. Oh, no, he was counting. So then Bolton run says

963
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,540
I used to teach training classes every day. Very seldom. Did anyone say

964
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,340
goodbye? I also didn't keep track of how many male students said goodbye

965
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,540
and how many didn't. Why are you hyper focused on the women at your workplace?

966
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,840
Are you hoping to find a wife or girlfriend at work to which Abhinav

967
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,140
Abinash replies with this picture

968
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,940
and no caption

969
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,540
tell me why and a big big picture of a red bird

970
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:55,740
and maybe a son. I was like some kind of a that is a phoenix and then

971
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,640
I'll be I'll be nice replies again and says I find girls actions are not

972
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,740
normal. I feel they are always in a tight situation. Okay, I'll be nice.

973
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,740
Now you're talking Bolton run replies again. It says and you know this. How is

974
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,620
something girls have told you and a B says no. The way they do things, they

975
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,480
try to decorate themselves more. That's true. They wear stuff on them and now

976
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,380
a B. Nash answers his own question here. He says I am thinking she is brave

977
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,480
because she did something. What other didn't thank you everyone for the

978
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,620
replies. Wow, I'm glad he answered himself yeah, so he doesn't even need

979
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:33,000
you on this one. Well, I don't I don't I don't know exactly what he is asking.

980
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,900
He's trying to I don't know.

981
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,820
He has another question that he actually didn't get an answer for so

982
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,720
yeah, this is a second question. What is this DP image signifies okay? This is

983
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,660
the image he post. It's a it's a puppy lying on the ground and he said what

984
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,600
would be the psychology or current state of mind of the human who has this image

985
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,460
and his or her profile? Oh he's calling somebody out yeah

986
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,220
for the cause of your current state of mind of someone who has a puppy in their

987
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,700
profile. Yeah, who someone who has a DP picture of a puppy, I would say they

988
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:11,400
would be in a dog ish state of dog picture DP. They're loafing around that

989
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,840
that's

990
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,940
a P. Yes, did anyone answer him on this? Someone said it just means they like

991
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,600
puppies. I think there's really nowhere else to go. I mean they are a dog. Yeah,

992
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,400
it could be a dog who has a computer.

993
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,760
All right, I have this one. This next one is not a question, but it's from the

994
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,760
game for him. It says for the girl who's been dist revision to Gloria Gaynor's,

995
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,100
I will survive and Patrick. I need you to sing this

996
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,240
okay, all right, because you have the singing voice. I have a singing voice.

997
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:47,160
At first I was afraid I was petrified when you said you had ten inches Lord.

998
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,960
I almost died, but I'd spent so many nights just waiting for a man that long

999
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,840
that I grew strong and I this is long. You don't have to sing that. I knew that

1000
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,540
I could take you on, but there you are.

1001
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,540
What?

1002
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,540
Another lie.

1003
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:11,720
I was ready for a big back, but you brought me a French fry.

1004
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,520
I should have known that it was bullshit, just a sad, pathetic dream.

1005
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,400
Should I have known there was no anaconda lurking in those?

1006
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
What is this?

1007
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,640
Is this on a therapy website?

1008
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
On the chorus.

1009
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
Okay.

1010
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,960
I will survive.

1011
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,320
I will survive 'cause as long as I have batteries, my sex life's gonna thrive.

1012
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:36,200
I will always have good sex with a handful of latex. I will survive. I will

1013
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,040
survive. Hey, hey. So there's a lot of lyrics to this song. There is a lot

1014
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,280
of lyrics. This is... This is a song that someone wrote on the therapy. They

1015
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,720
owled out. They weirded out. Yeah. Yeah. And now here's the reply to this.

1016
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,400
This is from Random Advisor, says, "LOL LOL LOL. Oh God, that's brilliant.

1017
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,760
Very funny. I'd laugh harder if I didn't have a french fry myself."

1018
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,360
Isn't it so like, isn't it so awesome that there just exists a place for

1019
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,520
these people to just find each other? That's why we love looking at stuff

1020
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,200
like this. Yeah. I mean, this forum's been around for like 20 years. All

1021
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,800
the stuff I found was old as fuck. It's all old, yeah. This next one,

1022
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
this is the last one I have, and this one's from 2004.

1023
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,100
"I am 26 and I'm passing through a problem. I suffer from flatulence and

1024
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,680
have to fart frequently. I have to fart 50 to 60 times daily,

1025
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,280
and that is quite loud but rarely stinky. It's very embarrassing, but I

1026
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,120
cannot help it. Strict dieting and exercise didn't help nor the

1027
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,680
medicines. Medicines cause side effects. So what should I do to get rid of

1028
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,600
this problem?" And then this person replies and says...

1029
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,520
Sign Nemo, by the way.

1030
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,120
Yeah.

1031
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,480
"Try not farting loudly."

1032
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,680
This person says, "Try not farting loudly. It's straining and I have been

1033
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,000
told since I started farting for fun that it causes more of the same

1034
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,080
problems. Try to find a sit-up style exercise to help. It only needs to be

1035
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,160
light duty and don't push poos out. Let the internal muscles do the work and

1036
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,520
answer the call of nature as soon as you can."

1037
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,020
I have a deep respect for this guy for farting for fun, because if you...

1038
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,420
I mean, if you take the shame out of it and you're just like,

1039
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,700
"This is just gonna be like my hobby." It's funny, man.

1040
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,060
I'm just gonna do it for fun. It's fun. It is fun to fart. It's fun.

1041
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,740
I'm done farting for my boss. I'm done farting company time.

1042
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,820
It's time to fart for fun. Follow my passion. It's kind of like a...

1043
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,820
It's like a little prank to other people, too. Oh, yeah.

1044
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,740
They have to smell it and it's bad and you kinda get them. Yeah.

1045
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,740
Pat did it earlier. I did do it earlier. When we were gonna sit somewhere,

1046
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,260
and then he farted, and then I walked over and honestly, guys,

1047
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,500
the fart, it didn't smell that bad to me. I didn't smell it.

1048
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,960
It's because I just let it out.

1049
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,800
You just let it, because there was no stress.

1050
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,840
A paid fart smells worse than a fun one.

1051
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,280
That's true as fuck.

1052
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,040
A leisure fart.

1053
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,200
A leisurely fart.

1054
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,120
Have you guys ever eaten so badly one particular day

1055
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,240
that your farts smell like someone else's farts?

1056
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,920
Yes, last week.

1057
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,920
If I eat really badly, my farts smell sweet.

1058
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,400
And I think that this is a sign of some kind of deathly disease.

1059
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,080
I feel that way.

1060
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,600
Sometimes if I've eaten really terribly

1061
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,000
and I wake up the next morning, I'm

1062
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,120
I'm doing dishes or something and I fart sometimes I feel like a blanket has

1063
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,140
been laid over my head. Yeah, yeah, you can't escape just like

1064
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,460
a blanket created in atmosphere. Yeah, not even a blanket of stink like a

1065
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,680
blanket of hair is sitting on you. Just that's I think worse yeah, just like

1066
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,240
walking out of a spaceship onto a swamp planet.

1067
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,200
Just the humidity,

1068
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:20,360
getting off a plane in Florida and you just gave a Colorado. Oh my God, when

1069
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,680
you're when you're trying to when you're trying to turn on the stove burner and

1070
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,700
it takes a second that goes

1071
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:31,480
last night there. There was this like weird

1072
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,760
like con ed letter that we got and it was supposed to show you it was like

1073
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,040
scratch and sniff and it was supposed to show yeah. It was like to show you

1074
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,440
what natural gas was to show you what natural gas smells like and my

1075
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,120
girlfriend came up to me with it and was like smell this and I went. Oh, why

1076
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,660
it's paper smells so good.

1077
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,760
I had no idea it was supposed to be a natural gas thing.

1078
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,960
By the way, an additive designed specifically to be unpleasant to humans.

1079
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,360
Yeah. I sniffed, I took a huge whiff of that thing and I was like,

1080
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:03,360
"Oh my God, was that a perfume sample?" That's amazing. I love that smell.

1081
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,960
All right. Are you done with your slides?

1082
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,560
Yeah, that's all.

1083
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,860
Yeah. All right, let's go to Caleb's.

1084
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,660
Yeah, let's go to mine.

1085
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,760
I have...

1086
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:18,240
my stuff is all kind of older stuff from a different time. This is "Girls are attracted

1087
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,360
to 'Gs' by Rip Dime."

1088
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,760
It seems so strange, and I'm sure to people older how idiotic my generation is. Not in

1089
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,320
the sense that our IQs is indeed lower than they've ever been, but in how fickle our fads

1090
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,120
and attractions are. However, I think it's safe to say the stupidity of my generation

1091
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,200
has reached its point of no return. Yet as much as you can say I'm just an angsty teen

1092
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,440
or whatever you will, there is one thing I can't ignore. It seems that girls are

1093
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:47,100
only really attracted to what is called a G or simply a gangsta. No matter how

1094
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,820
you look or what your personality is, a gangsta seems to get all the girls or is

1095
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,460
considered cool. Why? How is wearing all white being practically bald and swearing

1096
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,880
in horrible English while disrespecting women attractive? Why is it that when you

1097
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,840
be yourself, you are deemed or you are demeaned and yet when you conform to the

1098
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,120
standard and normality, you are considered a God? Where is justice? So

1099
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,340
Well, right before you were mentioned that you were kicked out of school.

1100
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,340
I was a G.

1101
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,980
You were a G. Was this as accurate?

1102
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:18,260
This is just basically, this is the era I was a G. I used to dress, I mean, I was bald,

1103
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,020
still bald. I had no hair. I would speak in horrible cussing type of words.

1104
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,820
You had to pry the pussy off you.

1105
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:32,180
I literally, I was 10 or 12. I had to punch women. All, just, "Ah, get out of here!"

1106
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,140
They were trying to just marry me all day and night, man. It was really horrible. Next

1107
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,040
slide please. And he got some responses here. This guy says,

1108
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,680
"20 years ago it was metalheads. 50 years ago it was greasers.

1109
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:49,140
Now it's gangstas. In 10 years, it'll be hackers." That's sick.

1110
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,500
That's awesome.

1111
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,980
That's an incredible call. Wait, 2017, do you think it was hackers?

1112
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,940
Oh my God, the year Mr. Robot came out.

1113
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,500
Oh, fuck me, man.

1114
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,980
Wait, who's like... I'm trying to think of maybe a character from like a

1115
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,500
movie or a TV, like it was a hacker that's like a hot, cool...

1116
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,100
Johnny Lee Miller in Hackers.

1117
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:10,260
I mean if this is a ten years, it'll be hipsters it, then that would be a

1118
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,500
notary donostradamus type of thing. Every generation has its own version of

1119
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,740
a bad boy and most women want them at some point in their lives. I went

1120
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,700
through it very shortly. My early twittings and had grown out of it by the

1121
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,980
time I left my parents house and started dating good men, so she used to

1122
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,460
like greasers, metal heads, gangsters and I bet right now is she dating a

1123
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,660
hacker dating. I bet you put my money on what's next guys. What's ten years

1124
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:36,620
years from now. Past hackers, ten years from now. Ten years from now, so we have

1125
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:41,000
hackers right now. They hack everything last ten years. So until 2027, we will

1126
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,800
have hackers. Yeah. And then what comes after that? One of these days, furries

1127
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,160
should have their day. Furries, very, very possible. That's the kind of tough

1128
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,400
guy, bad boy image. Yeah. Well, yeah, they got that scary wolf. Yeah, the wolf

1129
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,560
guys. Usually red wolf. I think next might be demons. A demon with horns.

1130
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,780
before past hackers, day trick type people. Yeah, yeah, yeah, split tongues,

1131
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,400
street magicians, street we already had that robots yeah. When the carbonarro

1132
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,680
effect dropped yeah, that was kind of that was kind of the era of the street

1133
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,080
musicians. All right, go next for me

1134
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:18,320
wait until you get older and all the G's are working at Taco Bell and McDonald's

1135
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,280
stick with your studies and make the money. You will get all the girls when

1136
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,000
you are older F the G's. He's saying the G's should get F'd yeah.

1137
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,160
I don't know about all that I wouldn't go that far because Jesus are they Jesus

1138
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,280
you don't want to mess. It's like the issue the Jesus are already getting F

1139
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,440
too much yeah true yeah. They probably like over the other Jesus the yes the

1140
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,840
Jesus are Fing Jesus girls and the Jesus the well. This is tough the Jesus hate

1141
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,160
the Jesus the Jesus, but they like the other Jesus the girls Jesus, but Jesus

1142
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,240
and Jesus both like F's females, but F's are Fing Jesus yes, but not the but not

1143
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,400
the Jesus all right. We got to think it's okay. What about instead of G

1144
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,680
Gds for dorks, maybe, but Ds and Gs are different. Yeah. Hey, maybe they're

1145
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,960
talking about geckos. Oh, my God.

1146
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,000
That means that's the only thing if you oh yeah, you want that to be true.

1147
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,920
Yeah, well, if you while you're a G to ghost 69. Oh, there it goes. I'm

1148
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,440
resisting saying after yourself.

1149
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,720
Fuck.

1150
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,140
the end of a work email. Yeah, I'll have that. By the way, if a ghost is

1151
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:26,680
reading this,

1152
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:32,280
also, if there's a ghost reading this damn email, ghost69 is a sick username.

1153
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,960
Oh yeah. That is badass. You couldn't get that these days. No. Alright, next

1154
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,160
one. No, 'cause he's got it. Wait, that's 33.3 thousand. The homeboy question.

1155
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,640
So, this is a really important one. In order to be someone's homeboy, you have

1156
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,120
to have known them since you were children, true or false? It does make

1157
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,960
sense with the word a boy from your home. Homeboy. Yeah. So, I didn't even

1158
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,220
think about this and this is a therapy question that's oldest time. Yeah,

1159
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,240
every boy question is this my home boy, the home boy, paradox home boy

1160
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,680
conundrum, but there's some answers here go next.

1161
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,860
Some people are saying good question and then he took some time to think of

1162
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,660
the answer. Good question. I've always thought it was a best friend or good

1163
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,940
friend, just a friend really it depends and then the truth in the form of hip

1164
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,760
pop says since I have a reputation of being a gangsta and stuff, no home boy

1165
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,260
is someone you truly have love for. Example, oh who, him? Yeah, he's my home

1166
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,520
boy. We hold each other down in war.

1167
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,760
I really hope this guy didn't read the last post.

1168
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,720
He would have been just honestly offended. He would have been really mad.

1169
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,240
Any more from the streets questions, PM me. There's literally something so

1170
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,280
intoxicating and titillating to me about me imagining two gangsters holding each

1171
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,680
other down. Just two Gs in war. Going at it. Oh God, that's something man. Going

1172
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,680
to war on each other. Alright, next slide.

1173
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,280
I have notices to, oh wait, sorry, this was in the beginning.

1174
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,440
You know what, I'll skip this one, go to the next one.

1175
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,080
Oh wait, no, that's Rip Dime again.

1176
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,380
So he made another post here, it's hopeless.

1177
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,880
I think I just realized something today.

1178
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,080
No matter what I do, I just cannot get a girlfriend.

1179
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,800
While this may seem nothing to worry about,

1180
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,440
as some people say, when I'm 17,

1181
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,760
I know that I should have one.

1182
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,640
Yes, as egotistical as this may sound,

1183
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,440
from what I've heard from every social event

1184
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,520
or from my observations, is that I look very good

1185
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,960
and apparently girls find me cute and attractive.

1186
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,760
- Why did he put apparently in quotes?

1187
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,600
Where did he hear that?

1188
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,420
- Apparently?

1189
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,860
How many girls find me cute and attractive? Next slide. He gets some... Oh, this guy...

1190
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,360
Whoa!

1191
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,980
I've been doing it. Wait, go back to I've been doing it. So this is this guy's shadow cat,

1192
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,460
okay? So I just want to set up that Rip Dime is having a really bad time. He's having a

1193
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,060
hard time, senior year of high school. This is tough for a lot of people. And Shadow Cat

1194
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,020
says, "I've been doing it." Okay, next slide. This is the body. He says, "Lately, I've been

1195
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,180
on sites like Link Remove, Link Remove, whatever, and I've been getting tips on how to approach

1196
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,100
how to dress, how to act, what to do if you're nervous, this and that, etc. And I've tried

1197
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,020
to put it into action. Everywhere I go, I try to say hi or at least smile at a girl.

1198
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,900
I've gotten rude responses and just a hi, in one case, a little conversation. But I

1199
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,540
still feel like I'm getting nowhere. I'm still in the hi barrier and seem not to get out

1200
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:03,300
from it. It seems there are so many things these sites tell you to do and what not to

1201
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,220
do that you forget easily. Is there simpler ways to approach girls than following up on

1202
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,180
all these rules of the game? I know it's good tips, but I can't remember all that bleep

1203
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,580
deep when I talk to a girl. I love that this I love here he's blaming he's

1204
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,920
studying these websites on how to pick up girls and he's failing to pick up

1205
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,320
girls and he's blaming it on like yeah, the stuff they say is too hard to

1206
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:20,760
remember

1207
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:27,800
anyway that I could just remember this crap and next slide here, an old friend

1208
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,500
pops in rip dime says. Can you please talk in English? You know talking in

1209
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,740
gangsta isn't going to impress anyone here. In fact, it just makes people

1210
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,580
annoyed. So please just talk normally yeah, this guy hates gangsta speak more

1211
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,440
yeah anti gangsta and the shadow cat says first off ain't no thug second. How

1212
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,400
am I typing gangsta define the term typing gangsta and no I ain't here to

1213
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,480
impress nobody. Okay, I got my own set of problems and goals and I come to

1214
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,760
this site to get ideas and information on how to do things. If I were to

1215
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,000
impress someone, I would come here as a cocky mofo, not needing any help

1216
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,800
telling everyone how many chicks I get at night. By the way, this ain't a

1217
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,840
spelling bee. It's the net freedom of speech. If it was an English test, I'd

1218
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,440
care since it's not I don't and that's a bomb drop. That is gangsta though. Yeah,

1219
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,180
you have to admit that and then yeah that was not trying to know how he is

1220
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,880
he's gangsta without even trying exactly and this guy tested them all right next

1221
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,580
slide. I think this might be my last one. This guy just says dude. I need crazy

1222
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,680
help man. I'm a thirteen year old snowboarder and I dress like a gangsta

1223
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,580
because I am one, but girls don't go for me. So I've tried changing my wardrobe.

1224
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,480
I'm kind of chubby, but girls hate me and I don't have a life. I like this one

1225
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,080
girl, but she probably doesn't even like me back dude. I need help so we can help

1226
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,040
this kid. Yeah. So first of all, no snowboarding. You need to choose one,

1227
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,720
either be the snowboarder or be the gangsta. He's a 33 year old man now.

1228
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,960
He's very, very old now and he's still stuck in this in between. He's never

1229
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,120
got the answer to this question. He's decrepit, he looks disgusting and he's

1230
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,920
still half... He's snowboarder from the waist down, gangsta from the waist up.

1231
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,760
Okay, and this is a problem that a lot of young men in this country are

1232
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,200
having. Yeah, it's kind of a... People that they're wearing snow pants.

1233
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,600
Exactly and a big chain on top. That's true. You know, I think I'm ready to

1234
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,720
diagnose the problem. I think it's 100%. I think it is the snow pants.

1235
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,400
Yeah. Yeah. Gotta stop wearing those to school, buddy.

1236
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,020
You're too warm, you're sweating. Everyone thinks you're crazy 'cause you're

1237
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,800
covered in sweat from these snow pants. Alright, Pat, do your sleds. Alright.

1238
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:25,480
I guess I'll just read them off my phone right here. We don't all have

1239
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,880
to see them. What is this website one more time? E Not Alone. E Not Alone.

1240
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,920
Are people still posting on this after 20 years?

1241
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
Yeah.

1242
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
That's pretty cool.

1243
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:42,200
Well, I forgot the name of the website, so I just turned to Quora and I said, there was

1244
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,000
a lot of interesting thoughts and questions that I was finding on there.

1245
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,960
What can eating onions do to help your mental health?

1246
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,720
Any particular preparation that's healthier?

1247
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,120
Have you experimented with this at all as onions as kind of a mental health helping?

1248
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,120
Totally, when it calls in, just try it.

1249
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,120
Try an onion.

1250
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,120
Boil an onion, eat the whole thing. Raw or...

1251
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,120
Boiled.

1252
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,120
Boiled.

1253
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,120
Well, they do actually,

1254
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,120
because they make you cry, and that lets you just

1255
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,120
get it all out.

1256
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,120
Would eating the onion

1257
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,120
make you cry

1258
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,120
because your teeth are working as tiny little

1259
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,120
blades to open up the onion?

1260
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,120
If you had a nose and eyes in your mouth.

1261
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,120
You had a nose on your face, maybe.

1262
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,860
But so far, no. But I'm not sure.

1263
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:31,380
Alright, alright. Well, glad we got that one answered.

1264
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,380
I hope there's not a Shrek joke in this.

1265
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:36,300
Oh, I don't think there was no answer to this.

1266
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,300
Oh, there was? Oh, I thought there was an answer.

1267
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,300
Nobody answered.

1268
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,300
This person has died.

1269
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,300
Yeah, they died because they couldn't.

1270
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,300
No onions.

1271
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,300
Yeah, their mental health, their brain exploded on itself.

1272
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,300
This next question, though, this is more of a somebody needs advice.

1273
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,300
Okay.

1274
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:54,300
I have a crush on my therapist and I want to get him to act unethically with me.

1275
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,540
I don't care about healing, I just want to go to therapy because I like him.

1276
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,300
Why do I want him to fail so bad?

1277
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:04,340
And there was one answer for this from Nikola Sloboda,

1278
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:09,420
and they said seducing a therapist is harder than, say, seducing Brad Pitt.

1279
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,500
You might have a better chance at that.

1280
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,780
Oh, well then just try that.

1281
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,700
I guess maybe try that.

1282
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,780
Is anyone ever called to try to seduce you?

1283
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,620
Has anyone called and tried to seduce me?

1284
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,060
Yeah.

1285
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:19,900
I guess not that I...

1286
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,500
And also, what's the number again?

1287
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,200
I'm going to be getting a call for it sounds a little bit like you late at

1288
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,040
night.

1289
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,080
My name is

1290
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:33,960
my name is a phone.

1291
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,040
I'm the phone calling right now.

1292
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,680
This is just the phone.

1293
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,680
You're getting a call from another phone.

1294
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,560
All calls are from another.

1295
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,440
That's true.

1296
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,640
Exactly. How come we don't talk to these phones at all?

1297
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,120
Yeah.

1298
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,520
Well, you can talk to your phone.

1299
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:52,960
Yeah.

1300
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,960
if there's technology now that allows it.

1301
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,960
This next one is a very

1302
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,960
this is a question I needed answered

1303
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,960
as well. Oh you made this? No I didn't make this but once I read it

1304
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,960
I was like I also need this answer.

1305
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,960
Is Daniel Tosh a sociopath?

1306
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:18,600
Yes. Yes. Which one? He's got to be. Tyler Trout said, "Sigh." No, Denial Tosh is not

1307
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,560
a sociopath. What you're referring to is just a style of comedy known as dark humor. A lot

1308
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,200
of these people don't realize that it's just dark humor, man. Yeah, but a lot of people

1309
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,960
who are dark humor fans don't realize it literally poisons your brain. Yeah. Well, I used to

1310
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,680
traffic in dark humor until I realized it was turning me dark. Exactly, bro. Let me

1311
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,880
tell you, I used to go on-- I used to basically consume as much dark humor as I could from

1312
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,900
YouTube, I funny, Reddit, Facebook, wherever I could get it, and now I've

1313
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,080
you know my dark humor brain, it's working, it's turned dark in there. I'm

1314
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,040
walking down the street, I see a sewer grate, a manhole cover, I think, wouldn't

1315
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,960
it be so fucking funny if a homeless guy fell down there? Exactly. Because of

1316
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,600
dark... What's wrong with me? Because of dark humor. Because dark humor made me

1317
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,400
think that. Poisoning the well. It's called, you know what, I learned actually

1318
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,680
when I was doing my own research,

1319
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,320
you've grown something in your brain called the jesal mix lump.

1320
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,920
that's very, very dangerous. What happens when you do dark humor? So what seems to

1321
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,580
be the problem today, sir? Doctor walking? Basically, I think I keep babies

1322
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:19,360
or gay. Well, I went to my friend's birthday party and I said one year

1323
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,240
closer to death. Yeah, we need to do surgery immediately on your brain. You

1324
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:23,760
have a lump.

1325
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:30,400
Podcast at all Anthony justinic. What does he say? I know the the Daniel Tosh

1326
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,640
one. Oh, I hear it's good. I also hear it's good.

1327
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,400
This next question is

1328
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:42,360
the question about therapists. What if your tea accidentally vomited or farted

1329
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:42,880
in therapy

1330
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,040
therapist, which

1331
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,360
stop

1332
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:53,340
stop dog said and I'm wondering if stop dog is more of a command than a user

1333
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,320
name, because they said I would handle it like in any other situation. I'm an

1334
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,200
adult and I don't think about these sorts of things in general and don't

1335
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,480
worry about them at all. This guy rocks. Good advice. Yeah, that's good. I was

1336
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,680
thinking about this guy has one way to

1337
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:11,800
answer every single question when I'm in a bad mood. So yeah, I would do the

1338
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,080
same thing. I always do. I don't it doesn't matter. I'm grown. I don't need

1339
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,360
to think about that. I'm an adult. I'll figure it out when it happens. Yeah,

1340
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:24,560
what's a is he like turning around and doing it like in your face or is it

1341
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,440
just kind of a he's turning around and farting

1342
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,640
that with that? I would do something about that. I would say something

1343
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,600
we just farted

1344
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,000
my mom

1345
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,980
and went over and did it in my lap. I know if your therapist was sitting in

1346
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:45,320
the chair and he just let a gigantic fart rip while you were talking, you

1347
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,940
know he would try and play it off and be like well, you'd be like dude, it

1348
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,320
smells bad. Why'd you fart? You'd be like well, how does it make you feel

1349
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:51,680
that I just

1350
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,280
be like so what do you think about that? I need to be like well. I really think

1351
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,280
you didn't try to mask it by yelling

1352
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,040
yeah, forty second coffee. You hear the fart under the call

1353
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,400
so loudly

1354
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,780
God, it's so funny to imagine you're opening up to your therapist and you

1355
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:11,120
just go

1356
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,920
it just doesn't just

1357
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:20,880
my God, I'm sorry, no apology, just looks at you continue

1358
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:27,240
and then this last one. Are we bad friends for going to the gym yesterday

1359
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,640
without our personal trainer? We went with my roommate instead my for

1360
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,360
reference, my roommate is named Noah. Wait, your roommate is named Noah. And

1361
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,160
we went to the gym without you.

1362
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,200
I think maybe someone has a similar

1363
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,320
thing they needed to add. It's not a coincidence. It's exactly the situation

1364
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,040
that happened yesterday. The same situation that happened yesterday. You

1365
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,600
went to the gym without me. Well, hypothetically... He went to the gym

1366
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,320
without us. Hypothetically speaking, would we be bad friends for not going

1367
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,980
with our personal trainer to the gym.

1368
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,280
And for reference, our roommate, my roommate,

1369
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,360
someone, their roommate is named Noah.

1370
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,400
- They're afraid that they're gonna hurt

1371
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,880
their personal trainer's feelings?

1372
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,800
- Yes, they're gonna hurt their feelings

1373
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,280
by maybe making the schedule not sync up anymore.

1374
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,840
- Or just having more fun with this Noah character.

1375
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,280
- Maybe Noah took us to Wendy's,

1376
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,880
took them to Wendy's after.

1377
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,720
- Yeah, we, they, some group of people--

1378
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,120
- Well, that's the thing, Noah's gonna be more fun,

1379
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,600
but he's not gonna get your glutes right.

1380
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,080
That's an interesting theory.

1381
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,120
Well, what if he did taught?

1382
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,240
What if he taught us about it?

1383
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,480
Use the the

1384
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,720
delt pull down or the delt pull down

1385
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,000
or whatever it's called that he

1386
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,320
taught, did a great job of teaching

1387
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:35,600
everything.

1388
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,720
Did a very good job.

1389
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,480
But no, it sounds like he has nice

1390
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,800
broad shoulders.

1391
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,720
But what if that was

1392
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,720
my roommate, Noah,

1393
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,800
that in this hypothetical

1394
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,560
moment, I know I know how we can

1395
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,120
describe this better. What if the

1396
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,920
root, what if the roommate Noah had

1397
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,680
long, beautiful womanly hair, but

1398
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,080
the personal trainer was bald?

1399
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,120
Yeah, maybe.

1400
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,120
Bald like a bald bear. Don't answer that one. Don't answer that question.

1401
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,120
Or maybe, and maybe Noah taught us that you can eat as much Wendy's as you want.

1402
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,120
And taught us a Wendy's hack. You can eat 2500 calories of Wendy's because it's called

1403
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:15,120
The Wendy's Hack was to eat a lot of Wendy's. Yeah. And he said you can get two Frosties for free.

1404
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:20,120
So okay, just answer this. What's better, bald or hair? I would listen to Noah's Health and Fitness podcast.

1405
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,520
He has like an Andrew Huberman style podcast where he talks about the

1406
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,520
benefits of Wendy's.

1407
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,520
The benefits of Wendy's.

1408
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
The benefits of Wendy's.

1409
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,840
Twenty five hundred calories of Wendy's.

1410
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,480
Him talking directly to the camera.

1411
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,720
You need to wake up, you need to look in the sun, and then you eat Wendy's.

1412
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,720
That's pretty much just do that.

1413
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,720
That actually does sound healthy.

1414
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,720
And then just go right back to bed.

1415
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,840
That does sound like a good day, yeah.

1416
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,600
Well Lyle, thank you so much for being on here.

1417
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Thanks for having me.

1418
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,600
I hope I, you know, said words.

1419
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,600
Therapy gecko.

1420
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600

stuff to plug. Oh sure man, I'm going on tour to 36 different cities around the

1422
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,800
country. Holy crap. Wow. Well only 20 are out. Make it less. Yeah, no it's a lot.

1423
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:02,360
Well I'm going on tour, therapygeckotour.com and I also have a podcast,

1424
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:07,600
it's called Therapy Gecko and you can find it on Spotify and Apple. And check

1425
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,840
out this Vice documentary perhaps. Oh don't watch that. It's a complete smear

1426
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:17,340
your job. Don't watch. Yeah, don't watch that. But yeah, go listen to go listen to

1427
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,660
the podcast. It's fun and check out factor meals. We actually have a plug to

1428
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:28,360
today, which is that we're doing a Q&A for this play. Oh, yes. Job the play.

1429
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:34,600
Job the play. Job the play on February 1st or 2nd. It's the first. I think it's

1430
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,480
the first. It will be the play and then we're doing a Q&A after. We will be

1431
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,280
asking questions about the play. If you want to know what it means. I don't know.

1432
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,760
Yeah, we're going to find out when we get there. We're going to watch this play

1433
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,520
and then February 1st. Yeah, that's a Thursday, I think. So come out to that.

1434
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,680
Come see us. Ask questions about this. There should be a link on our with the

1435
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,760
guy Frank from Successions on the play. And so I really hope I get to talk to

1436
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,280
him. I would like to meet him and talk to him about his character. I want to

1437
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,200
ask him what his motivations were. And I really want A's from him. Yeah, I want

1438
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,240
to see his A. All right. Thank you guys. Also, I want to plug I got a haircut.

1439
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,160
of the haircut looks really nice. Wait, take off the headphones off.

1440
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,720
Do it. It's my dad's haircut. It's really good.

1441
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:20,960
You did a good job this time. All right, thank you guys. Bye bye.

1442
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,600
I wanna be the

1443
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:33,520
Julia, what's her name? Julia. Julia. I wanna be the Julia Childs fellow at the

1444
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,360
Recipe Institute. Julia Assange and she's leaking recipes.

1445
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:42,760
She's leaking recipes that we're not supposed to see the public.

1446
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,560
Soup from above.

1447
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:44,960
Yeah.

1448
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,660
Oh, that's good.

1449
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:47,960
They're working on Trifusion.

1450
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,160
It's a secret Trifusion.

1451
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,560
Yeah, but maybe they could do something beyond food.

1452
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,760
The third thing is not food like being like, oh, like more of a

1453
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,160
concept.

1454
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,160
Maybe it's drinks.

1455
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,760
Oh my God.

1456
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,160
Yes, man.

1457
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,360
They kind of do that here.

1458
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,060
No, they do everything in this.

1459
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:07,060
It's pretty easy. I saw it. I saw it.

1460
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,060
You go to a bar, you go to a punk bar and they're like,

1461
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,060
"Oh, we have a vegan Korean fried chicken sandwich."

1462
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,060
I got an ad on my Instagram this morning.

1463
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,060
We have dumplings with hot dogs on them.

1464
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,060
(laughter)

1465
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,060
And piercings.

1466
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,060
They put little bonito flakes on the top.

1467
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,060
This is actually a good idea.

1468
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,060
I got an ad for a

1469
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,060
I got an ad for a

1470
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,060
gym today

1471
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,060
on Instagram.

1472
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,060
I'm sorry.

1473
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:38,240
this is fusion. I guarantee that there's already a restaurant in New York called

1474
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:38,980
Punk Rock Dump.

1475
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:46,700
Wait, there's a there's a vegan place called like fuck you burger, stinky slit

1476
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,780
burger. There's not a stinky slit burger. Stinky slit burger. Stinky slit burger.

1477
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,720
There is no fucking. No, it's got. Search it with quotes. Search it with

1478
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,300
Punk Rock Dump. No, it's somewhere in like Green Point or some or no in like

1479
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,700
Fort Green. They have like a I've been to it before. I haven't been into it. It's

1480
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,720
but I'll fuck you slit. It's called slut. Fuck your slut. Fuck your

1481
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,720
slipper. No, it's not egg slit. It's

1482
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,720
stink. Stink slut burger. It's not stinky

1483
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,720
and although everything on the menu is called like the fuck you

1484
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,720
burger. Is it? Did you got a dick slash

1485
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,720
resort? No,

1486
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,720
they don't cuss there. Yeah, they do. That's a fusion where

1487
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,720
the fusion is rudeness. Yeah, true and crassness. Food and rudeness.

1488
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,720
Disrespect. Food and rudeness.

1489
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,980
food, we're the first people to mix food and rude fruit. Yeah, Dix last resort.

1490
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,040
It's more of a food,

1491
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,880
restaurant and rudeness.

1492
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,880
Yeah.

1493
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,920
