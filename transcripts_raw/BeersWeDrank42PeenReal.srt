beer

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
welcome back to another episode of

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
beers we drank

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
guys we have guests in the building

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
today with funny backgrounds

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
you guys

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
everybody hold up a beer

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
one by one

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
hold up a beer rex i'd like you to start because you're my friend

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
i haven't talked to you in some days

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and this is looking like an invisible type of beer

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,400
type of beer. All right, hold on. Let me turn off the green screen.

30
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,120
Okay. I have a Lord Hobo.

31
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Oh, this girl does not like when I do that. Every single time I pay you,

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,520
it takes me hours to work up the courage to hit that submit button on the direct

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,340
deposit.

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,720
I made an awesome discovery.

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,720
When what, what is that?

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,720
If you press end recording, it ends the recording?

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Is that what you discovered?

38
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Whenever I change my background on Discord, it goes crazy and it breaks.

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
So I'm not going to do it anymore.

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
That is super awesome.

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Okay, are you still recording or do we need to restart completely?

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Yeah, you can keep going.

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Okay, Rex, talk about your Juice world.

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,720
So it's a Huel Melon, Galaxy Meridian, and Azaca.

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,560
And these are fake words that they made up

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,960
to describe this beer.

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
- Yummy.

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,180
- Sound like they could be real.

49
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,640
They did not give me a bag, so I put it in my hoodie,

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
so it's a little shaken.

51
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,300
- Okay, now give me a sip and a rating, my friend.

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,120
- Yeah, it's beer.

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,840
It's like a solid six and a half out of 10.

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,160
- Okay.

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
All right, I'd like to go next

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,360
because mine is a bit of a disappointment.

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,600
- Yes, do your beer.

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:26,040
- So I got one beer and then we played some video games

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,240
and while we were playing video games, I was like,

60
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,960
I'll just have this beer and I'll go get another one later.

61
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,600
And that was this, the Zuber.

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,360
And I was gonna do really something very funny

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
where I was gonna have my phone pretend to ring and say,

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,900
oh, my Zuber is here.

65
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,400
And you guys, I don't know if you've,

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,940
have you ever taken a car service?

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,440
They have, they're called Ubers.

68
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,480
I was gonna do that.

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,320
But guys I drank the whole damn thing.

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,880
I drank the whole thing and it was not very good.

71
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,680
It tasted like toothpaste.

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,320
So I cracked into my, what we call the Pitshouse Reserve Selection, okay?

73
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:08,360
And I went deep, deep into the archives and I got this guys.

74
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,400
A Heineken 0.0 alcohol free beer.

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,880
This is an amazing beer guys.

76
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,980
I'm gonna take a sip.

77
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,840
Okay, it tastes exactly like a normal Heineken.

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,840
This is the supreme zero alcohol beer.

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
- Is this a-- - Does it really?

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,320
- It really does.

81
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,800
It gives you diarrhea just like a normal Heineken.

82
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,280
This is an amazing no alcohol beer.

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
- I think that might just be you, man.

84
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,320
- The wife reserves?

85
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,800
Can we get an update on how that situation developed?

86
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,160
- The wife reserves?

87
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,520
Oh, the beers that she was hiding in the fridge?

88
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,480
Well, here's how it developed guys. She got mad at me. That's the end of the story

89
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,180
She got she I drank her beer and she got really mad at me

90
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,200
And she called me two or three times the next day just to complain about how I took her beer

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,520
So if you're wondering how the marriage is going not so good

92
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,140
I'm gonna give this on the NA scale. I'm gonna give this a

93
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,120
8.3 and again, this is portnoy. This is an amazing score

94
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,840
Okay, this is an 8.3. I like this beer a lot, okay

95
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:25,900
Yeah, I'll go next I got a I know how you guys have been doing a mixed drinks these past couple weeks

96
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,440
so I went ahead and I got myself a a

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,320
mango beer Oh

98
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,720
Mango mixed with beer so it is still it is it's beer with chamoy and mango

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,300
Yummy, but it only has a mango picture on it. So I think it's gonna be completely mango juice

100
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,040
The mango has Chamoy on it in the picture

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,360
But it's true. It's got redness on it

102
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,720
Who's the real Mexican here that is it's me good

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,120
listen

104
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,160
Mango cart is a an amazing beer, which it was more common on the East Coast. I love mango cart. What's mango?

105
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
I like all

106
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,760
You're

107
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Sorry, I burped

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,360
And guys I'm gonna have to switch to my microphone or to my headset microphone because I just heard that my headset is dying

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
So give me one second

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,760
Can someone tell me what my

111
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,920
Mango cart is just a mango beer and it's yummy. Yes. Well, I don't think it's supposed to be just like a mango

112
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,680
I think this is like mango juice mixed with a normal Victoria beer which you can see. Well bros. How do I sound?

113
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,560
- You sound amazing, man.

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
- Thank you, thank you.

115
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
It feels good to have a Britney Spears microphone set up.

116
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,720
- This pretty much is a thing that a girl would buy

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,400
at the store when you ask for a beer, I would say.

118
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
- Yeah.

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
- But I like it because of that.

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,360
- Okay, all right, so our two esteemed guests,

121
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,640
I waited to introduce them until they have their beers.

122
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,320
Let's start with Alex.

123
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,400
Alex, what do you have for us today?

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,560
Alex, both of them have been on the podcast before,

125
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,440
you're very familiar.

126
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,040
I have a Spark Ominous Wushing IPA.

127
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,280
I have IPAs.

128
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,200
It's not bad though.

129
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Did you buy this beer?

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,880
No, I took it from my roommate.

131
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,320
Oh, we like that!

132
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,920
We endorse this.

133
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,320
The beer is good, man.

134
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
It's alright.

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm gonna give it like a 5.

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
5.

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
5.

138
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Okay, this is it.

139
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Alex picked it up immediately.

140
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,440
It's the Portnoy Scale.

141
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
This is the 10 is unachievable and the zero has never happened.

142
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Right.

143
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
The five five that's right there.

144
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
That's an average beer.

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Yeah.

146
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,840
I don't think I'd ever go out and buy this.

147
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,880
But you would steal it.

148
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Yeah.

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
I would steal it.

150
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080
What do you usually get at the beer store?

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,120
I usually get probably Heineken or Stella.

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Like Cronus too.

153
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Whoa.

154
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Okay.

155
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
What's the Canadian like?

156
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
I'm like a Molson. Molson Canadian.

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Is that like the PBR of Canada?

158
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
What's like the shitty common beer?

159
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Oh we have PBR.

160
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
A lot of people drink PBR.

161
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Well what's the one that you guys have there?

162
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
I don't know dude.

163
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm probably Molson Canadian.

164
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
We do the same thing.

165
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
He's never drank beer before.

166
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
This is what I was about to say.

167
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,120
I always forget that Alex is 15.

168
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I am 17.

169
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,800
in the chat said old-fashioned pilsner have you seen have you come across this

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,720
I'll play I remember I remember man I go I just go to what I usually go you go to

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,840

I mean you can but...

177
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,080
It gets tough.

178
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
I've had fun with it though.

179
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Interesting.

180
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,940
And I don't I think it's be I think my brain thinks that this has more than 0.0 in it, but it truly is zero

181
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,800
Well getting drunk is all in your head. Anyway, it's why you know

182
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,240
Yeah, some people can drink and drive and some people can't it's why some people can make good decisions while drunk and some can't

183
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,340
You know, yeah

184
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:14,400
Force yourself out of it. Yeah, and you could force yourself into it. Oh

185
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,340
- Oh, easily.

186
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,900
- Yeah. - I've never done that.

187
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,340
- You've never, well you, I think you've never been drunk.

188
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,060
- I think so too.

189
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,100
- I would, I really want this,

190
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,700
maybe at Cam's wedding you'll wild out.

191
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,900
That's what I wanna see.

192
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,740
- Well I think-- - We're gonna make him

193
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,560
eat the worm.

194
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,860
- I think the two closest I've been were both in New York,

195
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,140
and one of them was when Rex tried to poison me,

196
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,820
which we've went over this multiple times.

197
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,540
And the second one-- - With that margarita.

198
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,380
- Yeah, and the second one was at your wedding

199
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,820
where Noah tried to poison every single guest.

200
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,940
(laughing)

201
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,500
- That's why we paid him.

202
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,800
- So I think next time I will die.

203
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,700
- Well, you know what they say, good times to charm.

204
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,620
It takes time to get drunk.

205
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,860
- I think that very soon,

206
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,620
you've never had a night where you've been very drunk

207
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,260
and taken your clothes off or done something

208
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,100
like a feat of superhuman strength,

209
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,180
lifted a car off of somebody, that type of thing?

210
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,020
Nope, I've been to a friend's birthday party, drank some beers and just drove home.

211
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
And that's it.

212
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,020
Were you drinking when you got hit in the head?

213
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
That's awesome dude.

214
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
What's up?

215
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,700
When you got hit in the head by a piece of the ceiling?

216
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,620
It wasn't the ceiling, that was a construction site, it was a metal beam.

217
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,140
I was on the way back from buying some tortillas, so I was not drinking now.

218
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
It was like 10am.

219
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Wait, I don't understand.

220
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,100
I don't understand. You were buying tortillas and it was 10 a.m. I'm supposed to think you weren't drinking?

221
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,180
You hadn't had a morning Modelo man, be honest. Yeah, come on man.

222
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:57,540
Guys, Mexico is completely different to how you perceive it in all those racist TV shows like The Simpsons and Harry Potter.

223
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,340
I assure you it's completely different. I don't think there are Mexicans in Harry Potter. Is there a Mexican Hogwarts in Harry Potter?

224
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,340
No. No.

225
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:13,420
Let's make a better is on robot chicken. I'm gonna look that up. I'm sure that she's made a character called like Juan taco

226
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,900
Yeah

227
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,020
He's from Spain, yeah

228
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,100
Juan taco guacamole, please

229
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,220
Anyways, yeah, this is all just to say that you know

230
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,560
I always talk about my experiences as a foreigner which none of you are

231
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,840
Except maybe one of you and I just wanna I just want to bring you guys into my home

232
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I just want to invite you guys to a different country and

233
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,060
I

234
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,600
Google mapped your Google Street food viewed your apartment and it looks like there is nothing to do for

235
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:57,260
Miles and maybe even years in any direction. So I'm not all that interested in visiting my I don't live in an apartment anymore

236
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,400
I've moved out of there or in your house. I'm sorry

237
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:07,040
Yeah, I moved out into even further away from anything which is pretty cool. It looks like like Las Vegas suburbs

238
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,760
It does not look all that fun to visit but I'll come I'll go anywhere man

239
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:18,280
Okay, the wife is bugging me about going to France. I don't want to go to France go to France. It sucks. I

240
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,880
Really don't want to go to France you have France in Canada. Yeah, go back

241
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,820
Place that fuck that man. These people are rude, right?

242
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,840
Yeah, French people are mean men and they simply mean yeah, they're stinky

243
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,480
They're racist and

244
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,080
There's Neanderthals

245
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah, they're not even human. I really don't care for the French at all. I'm gonna say it

246
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,560
I like you liked it. You liked it when you went but that's because you look French

247
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Bro

248
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:08,760
There was no the only person that was kind of rude was the person at the TSA whatever

249
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,800
But she I was completely fine. I didn't even speak the language

250
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,680
Yeah, I think

251
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
that you're a Spaniard.

252
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
But you don't speak any language.

253
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
You're from Mexico.

254
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Yeah.

255
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,120
So, even, like, you didn't have the, I think there's an immediate bad will that is put

256
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,200
upon Americans when they visit as soon as they start speaking English.

257
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,080
Or apparently it's even worse if you start, if you try to speak French.

258
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,680
They really do not care for that at all.

259
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,120
Well, I think I'd better.

260
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
I think that's fair.

261
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,560
I hate when Julio speaks English.

262
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,120
It pisses me off because he's, it really is a bastardization of the language.

263
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Yeah.

264
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
It really, really gets me.

265
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
You should see his text messages.

266
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
They are awful.

267
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
What's wrong with my text messages?

268
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
It's like a dog jumping on a keyboard.

269
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
It is not English that you text us.

270
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Not even close to English.

271
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
I texted you guys something so beautiful today.

272
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
I'll say that it's really cute.

273
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll write down question marks.

274
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
You didn't text me today.

275
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Oh, I haven't texted all of my friends.

276
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
But I texted this to my guy friends.

277
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I texted this to my guy friends.

278
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
to my guy friends.

279
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,880
Uh-huh.

280
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
My straight guy friends.

281
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,280
Alex just got so excluded.

282
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,420
In text meme ad.

283
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,520
I said, I said this, not me missing you all so much that I got

284
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,720
New York bagels and it's a bagel brand that's called New York bagels.

285
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,480
And no one even cared about that.

286
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,980
I literally didn't even notice that you said that.

287
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,980
I've never seen that text message.

288
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,320
I don't think that sent.

289
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,680
I think it was too gay to go over the network.

290
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,280
Well, he sent it to not really any of you, but just Caleb and Cameron and Patrick.

291
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,840
That's awesome, man. I mean, we all live in New York.

292
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,840
So, that's me, man.

293
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Well, it wouldn't make sense for me to send it to Alex because he's...

294
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
No, I'm a New Yorker.

295
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
He went to New York. He's from New York.

296
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
You're not a New Yorker.

297
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
He's a native born and raised.

298
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I have a picture of Margaritaville right here.

299
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,040
right there it's right here look you can see the city behind him look at that

300
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,400
beautiful city oh that is so fun that's sitting right above your full Homer

301
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Simpson just like yeah I just taped it up there sweet man you better hope you

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,840
never have a girl in this room ever I don't think you have to worry about that

303
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,600
too much? No. Oh,

304
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,960
geez. Alex, how's the love life going, man?

305
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,120
I had a date today. Wow. How'd it go?

306
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,360
Uh, she was French. Oh, you're kidding. I'm not kidding, man.

307
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,840
She's actually French or Quebec.

308
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,920
Uh, no. Well, not even Quebec.

309
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,480
She just lives on the border. So like they speak French.

310
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,800
And did she smell badly?

311
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,440
He's kind of fat.

312
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,340
Nice.

313
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,540
He did it y'all.

314
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,840
I know man.

315
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,540
I went I was like, whoa.

316
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:18,440
Yeah, I did the first time.

317
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,840
Oh the first time it was like last year around this time.

318
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,140
Maybe it's just this time of the year.

319
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,340
I guess the year the winter ever dating.

320
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,840
Yeah, so the heating more.

321
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,300
Last year

322
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,940
It was like my friend's girlfriend's friend and then the show business. Oh, yeah, I pull up and then she was fat

323
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,580
Just the forehead pictures. That's what they were showing you. No, man. It was just like she really knew how to use those angles

324
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,760
It might be on me maybe I just love fat woman

325
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,420
Oh clearly not but I think you can't tell the difference in a picture. Yes

326
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,300
Some people don't see color Alex just doesn't see size. I don't see wait

327
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:13,200
Might be pretty large. I want you to be smothered like Norbert

328
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,780
Norbit

329
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,460
Said Norbert

330
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,420
Man I think okay, so I was I was

331
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,780
Going this week

332
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,780
I've been like

333
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,820
Really trying to eat well and stuff because there's a thing coming up that I might need to be like in really good shape for

334
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,900
But tonight I found out that I think I wouldn't actually be doing it until like neck or this

335
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:50,140
October or November so now I'm thinking I have like three months where I could get pretty fat

336
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,740
Before I really need to worry about anything

337
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:01,060
Should I get like a like pretty bigly fat for a little bit? Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah, it should be like to like 220

338
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:09,640
It needs to be an amount of weight that I could gain and then lose well

339
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,760
also, like you know really a

340
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,640
Like percent in this like the way you've been telling us like in private which is you're like I need to be insanely ripped

341
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,820
For this one thing so I think going getting instantly rip is very different to just being kind of fit

342
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,620
How you're saying it? What do you need to get insanely fit for?

343
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,100
first of all, I

344
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,460
Can't say all the details, but it is some kind of some NDA

345
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:43,980
It's a work thing and I got yeah cash for playgirl guys, okay

346
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:58,420
and

347
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
I'm not familiar, but please tell me.

348
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,420
So me and all my straight guys were just in a discord call sharing our screens,

349
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,420
scrolling through celebrity penis at about 11.30 p.m.

350
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Right before all of our girlfriends and wives got home.

351
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,420
And guys, these celebrities are not packing like I thought they were going to be.

352
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,420
I thought that every celebrity had a giantly large penis.

353
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,420
It turns out they're medium to small, most of them.

354
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
No print?

355
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:34,740
very little prints I was seeing very little prints it's it's very 50/50

356
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,820
because there's some celebrities who have massive huge wieners of course but a

357
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,020
lot of the biggest cocks that were on the subreddit were celebrate not even

358
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,980
celebrities there were guys who were in a movie in the 60s for like five minutes

359
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:56,420
yeah you sort by controversial that's a cool I didn't do that even once

360
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
the

361
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
the

362
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
the

363
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
the

364
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,420
the

365
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
the

366
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
the

367
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
the

368
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
the

369
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
the

370
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,420
the

371
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
the

372
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,420
the

373
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
the

374
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:43,940
that

375
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:56,380
the

376
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:03,220
Lion Justin Bieber doesn't have much downstairs. It doesn't look like no way Mark Wahlberg. The hell is this guy?

377
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,140
Mmm, not so much Scott Disick big bouncing free ball bulge

378
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,300
That's a broken gift

379
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Henry Cavill, oh, I see why these are controversial. These are not nude

380
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,260
Hmm. I see

381
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Wait, oh, these are not

382
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,100
these

383
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Don't even fit the paradigm

384
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,860
You guys were looking at I'm Cox the other day

385
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
the

386
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
the

387
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
the

388
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
the

389
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
the

390
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
the

391
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
the

392
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,860
the

393
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
the

394
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
the

395
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
the

396
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
the

397
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,860
the

398
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
the

399
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:05,540
I think you should get five chances a year and get to see anyone in the world's dick.

400
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
You know?

401
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,620
Even just a regular guy on the street.

402
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,220
So you have an ability to just point at someone and kill them?

403
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,740
Yeah, look at how they're working.

404
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,140
Do you have like, um, are you, is it, say somebody wants to see your cock.

405
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,500
Are they interrupting you in whatever you're doing?

406
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,000
No.

407
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,580
Like your son is being confirmed and they're like, "Someone needs to see your cock right now."

408
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,940
And they pull you out?

409
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,660
No, it's, you know, like...

410
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,940
'Cause every single person is either taking a picture of their cock, they've been naked at some point in their lives.

411
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,460
The cocks are definitely, you know, have been seen by some sort of camera device.

412
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,740
Never once.

413
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
CCTV, yeah.

414
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,980
And the government should allow you five times a year to just see

415
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,820
They get freedom of information request. Yes. Oh, okay

416
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,220
Ken klippenstein sending out the foia

417
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,940
Request for to see a cock right and it could be anyone. This is like a you know, government portal

418
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,580
Will you just say that your computer? Yes. Yes, it would be your first five, right?

419
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,300
Oh, yeah for year one year one of the program

420
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,100
year one of the program

421
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,260
the

422
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
the

423
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,260
the

424
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,260
the

425
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
the

426
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
the

427
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
the

428
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
the

429
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
the

430
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
the

431
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
the

432
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
the

433
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,260
the

434
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
the

435
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,540
Looked up your who's your first five then? Okay. Well, I haven't thought about it that far. I don't really have any

436
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,860
Is a good one, yeah Papa John

437
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,220
under there I

438
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,860
Don't see Alec Baldwin. We do Trump Alec Baldwin is good

439
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:14,700
No, somebody else would do it for me. Oh Barack Obama's a great one and and Trump honestly, give me a both side by side

440
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,460
Can you look similar can you screen peek

441
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,500
You mean can I can can be like pull it together?

442
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,860
I get if I have ten friends who already use their five on January 1st because they couldn't help themselves

443
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,460
And then I have an idea because I have some restraint to look up a cock

444
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,300
Can I invite all my friends over Super Bowl party?

445
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:42,620
Okay, here comes Seth Rogen's cock guys

446
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,860
Three two one. Yeah, but I think it would be fun to do to your friends

447
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:57,220
On to your friends you you want to anonymously look at your friends cock, that's what you're saying. Yeah, of course

448
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,100
Imagine settling it argued it that way and being like

449
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Do you as the person so this is all self-reporting right

450
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:17,700
the

451
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:30,160
the

452
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:37,160
the

453
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:44,160
the

454
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,160
the

455
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,980
It would be funny. It would be a funny and

456
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,080
This would be funny. I don't know if everybody would love it

457
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:06,660
Well, that's the thing I guess it is five for one like yes, I give up the the right to my privacy and my cock

458
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,400
but I

459
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Also get to look at well, I mean there's four guys here

460
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,200
Yeah

461
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:19,280
and this would certainly be my first four just because you guys were just because also we've been lobbying for years to get this

462
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,800
Introduce

463
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:28,540
No, that's for oh true. God. Damn it. Yes a man you enter America. You got it. That's how you get a green card

464
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,600
Maybe yeah look photo of your cock with unlimited views any any

465
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,300
You can look at their penis as many times as you'd like

466
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,980
Yeah, who's the 12th president the 15th president and you got to give us a picture you did

467
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:48,800
Actually, no, I mean are you willing to give up to be an American?

468
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Yeah

469
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,440
Sure your cock who cares to be I'm fine over here

470
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,320
Okay, then we're gonna bring it down there

471
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,480
No, yeah

472
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,200
I will become the Mexican president. It's definitely not very hard and I will

473
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,800
enact this law

474
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,380
This would be like a new deal if you made an app where if you submitted a picture of your cock

475
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,240
You could see five random cocks. That's a gay guy app and like a bad one

476
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,160
But if you make it tied to the identity of the person that's a straight guy app

477
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:38,880
This website the only man the only people who will use it are men yeah

478
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,760
No

479
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,500
They'll all be looking over the same celebrities. Nobody's gonna look up a man. They knows cock. They

480
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,440
Think they're disgusting. They could see it if they wanted to see it. Exactly

481
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm a question about the infrastructure of this the system

482
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,280
Back in I know. Yeah, I know it has the view counter. It doesn't tell you who should viewed it

483
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
But how many people viewed it?

484
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,260
Do you have to look up yourself to look at that number or do you get like emailed?

485
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,220
I'll like do you have to look log into the government portal be like, oh, oh, by the way, you get a Google alert

486
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,180
Yeah, you get a Google alert. Okay. Yeah, it's

487
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:22,940
Notification on your phone it's next to your battery. Okay, it's built into Apple

488
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,460
Well used to be an app and then Apple put it in the new iOS. All right follow-up question. Would you?

489
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,860
rather have a

490
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,580
10 or under view count or an over a thousand of you count

491
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,420
over a thousand

492
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,520
18 to use the website Leo boo the very least

493
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:53,860
And if it's if there is react emojis tenor under if there is not react emojis

494
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:00,620
Give me the wrong numbers because if I had to like see that I had a thousand views of my car and like there's 500

495
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
thumbs down

496
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,380
It should be like the be real reactions though

497
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:21,900
Pain real we should do this

498
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,240
You're saying every day I have to upload a picture my cock at a random

499
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,980
Time to prepare

500
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,900
Shaved in a wild god. Yeah, no grooming. No manicure. Yeah, there's no raw dick

501
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,060
You do a full-body picture by accident. Yep with the poop sitting in the toilet behind

502
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,420
Well, I almost turned be real in the peen real so I don't think it's that much

503
00:29:51,420 --> 00:30:00,100
Yeah, half the time you get a be real you're taking a shit anyway because we all spend three hours a day on the toilet

504
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,820
No question. Yeah. No, so

505
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:20,820
the

506
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,820
I can think of millions of movies.

507
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Except for pornography.

508
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
I can think of zero movies.

509
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
And the second one was,

510
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
would I take one of these roles

511
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
where you have to show your penis?

512
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
And this was a tough question for me.

513
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,820
I thought about it for some time.

514
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
Do you think there's any movies

515
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,820
where a woman has to show her breasts?

516
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Yeah, any movie that I want to watch.

517
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
Right.

518
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
Well, women,

519
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
53% of the population,

520
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,400
90% of the people who watch movies I

521
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,540
feel like

522
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,540
They need to show more cocks than movies

523
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,780
But we like cocks women like boobs more than cocks you anti-nudity in movies

524
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:07,500
Yes, I'm anti-nudity and I'm anti-gore. I've said this before I don't like either of these things in movies

525
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500

528
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
That is a show for men. No.

529
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Yeah. Wait, what is that show? Naked Attraction, oh this again. Naked Attraction is a dating show where you look at people's naked

530
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,480

00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,960
penises that are hairy and you say I like that guy and then they zoom up and the guy

533
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,280
I'm not on the show. I'm a watcher.

534
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,280
How about this? Would you go on naked attraction?

535
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,280
When I go on naked attraction, I'm married.

536
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,280
If universe where Janna doesn't exist...

537
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Yeah, she died. She died. She never...

538
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Quantum died, never existed. You're never married.

539
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Well, I do a lot of things.

540
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:20,280
the

541
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,440
a huge TV I would get the thing is you know I'm 50 inch TV you don't have to

542
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,760
fuck the people no you don't have to they don't they both the time don't fuck

543
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,720
they actually hate each other yeah maybe 70% of the time yeah of course okay so

544
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,480
this show I would go on I would go on right yeah I'd go on right now wait do I

545
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,760
get to be the picker or do I have to be one of the people in the queue what are

546
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,760
the people oh god I don't I'm not just a piece of meat

547
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Isn't the picker also naked?

548
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,760
The picker becomes naked at the end.

549
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
At the end.

550
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
They level the play field.

551
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
And then there's two people and they go

552
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
"What do you think of his cork?"

553
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
"I really hate it!"

554
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
"Quite nice cork, eh?"

555
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
We've talked about this before in the podcast.

556
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
It's called a cheeky little bum, doesn't it?

557
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
We had the idea of doing a

558
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Moving Monday style

559
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
series, but on kick.com

560
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
we just watched that show and we just

561
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
the naked guys go on there.

562
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
Which is a great pic.

563
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,760
One of my favorite things is when they're bisexual and they put one trans person on.

564
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
Yeah, you're talking about this.

565
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Yeah, then I won't get into it.

566
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:36,760
I think that if we did that series and we did a kick.com stream of Naked Attraction,

567
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,760
the problem is the show's 45 minutes and the stream would be 4 and a half hours

568
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,840
hours because of how many times we would pause and zoom in and give our opinions.

569
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,280
It's a British show?

570
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Yeah.

571
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
It is British.

572
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
That's disgusting.

573
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,640
This is perverted and wrong.

574
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Yeah.

575
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,120
I think the number one thing against it would not be the nakedness but maybe the copyright

576
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,960
and watching the entire show.

577
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,880
So there needs to be a fully Wild West.

578
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,960
I could even on kick I don't think you can show a disgusting British cock

579
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:19,000
Would actually have to go to a campsite I think I feel like if we just wait six more months

580
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
We'll be able to do it on twitch

581
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,400
Which is twitch is gonna be out of out of money. Yeah

582
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,680
Well, it's just gonna be fully chatter bait in six twitch

583
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,760
Well, you have my other beer which walk back the naked update. Oh, I finished mine and it was it was great

584
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, I saw I was on Twitter on the for you tab

585
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,160
And I saw a video of the Dan dangler shaking her rear end in the shower, and she looked pretty naked to me

586
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,920
And I was like this is what they're doing on twitch. Let me show my penis

587
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,800
Well, I think I think I was maybe during that update, but they did walk away. It was today. This is a girl

588
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,960
But I think in March or April

589
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,240
They're discontinuing like twitch prime it's going away

590
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,160
So maybe something fucked up is gonna happen to the site

591
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,160
What they just well, they just they just fired a bunch of people. I think

592
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Like 200 people. Yeah. Yeah, but a bunch of people are firing people

593
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:25,820
Wait, that's not a problem. I'm stuff. It's just not gonna I think it's going away. Yeah Wow

594
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,500
That's how much shaft can you show before it's illegal that's an amazing point because I've definitely seen shaft in

595
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,160
a

596
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
PG-13 movie I've seen shaft

597
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,400
40%

598
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,280
A lot

599
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,520
It's 40%

600
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,560
you smell

601
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
depending on the

602
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,560
On light you could just be sure you're showing like what if you have a stick and you show two inches

603
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,560
the

604
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
I'll bring my tiny dick into this.

605
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,560
With a Michelob Ultra, that is a classic go.

606
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Classic second beer.

607
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
No one can get mad at it because it's a second one.

608
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,560
That's true, even though it is a repeat many, many times.

609
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Oh, what the hell?

610
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
That is shit.

611
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
This one tastes like shit.

612
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,560
You're not a golfer, man. Y'all are not golfers.

613
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I got fully a water one.

614
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I'm a golfer, bro.

615
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
This is crazy.

616
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,560
I know Alex is. Me and Alex would love a Michelob Ultra on the links.

617
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,160
The back nine you have you have one mickle of ultra per hole

618
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:41,240
Can you please California and go to El Segundo Tom golf

619
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:48,320
Yes, great. I love I'd love to do that when I'm not in a meeting at the same time. Yeah

620
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,440
I was so executive that day. It was crazy. You did

621
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,520
We went to the top golf in El Segundo and they had a part they had a

622
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:14,640
a

623
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
The something at El Segundo.

624
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,140
Yeah.

625
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,640
It was sick.

626
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
It was very sick.

627
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
And then the last...

628
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
They have actual holes in the top golf out there?

629
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,140
Yeah.

630
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,640
Yeah, yeah.

631
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,140
They have a little...

632
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,640
What the fuck?

633
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
...nine hole course next to it.

634
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
It was really hard.

635
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,140
That's crazy.

636
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,640
Oh, okay.

637
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,140
Yeah.

638
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,140
It was like my first time golfing ever and it was really fun.

639
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,640
And then the last hole they have a camera where you can watch your shot.

640
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,640
And they do like the tracker on it and stuff like on the tour.

641
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,640
And that was the very end of our live show tour.

642
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,040
And that is when that was the day that I realized that I had gotten really fat on the entire

643
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,120
Because I looked at the

644
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,940
At the thing where they like show everybody's videos back-to-back and I was like, oh who's this fucking fat?

645
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,680
And guys it was me and my shot did not look very good either

646
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,600
We were so bad, but it was very fun. Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty bad

647
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,360
That was when I was much worse at golf now, I'm basically an expert I've played executive courses

648
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:21,520
So I had an executive day Julio drove be true. I was his Mexican slave

649
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,040
He gave me his headphones and then I was in ways canceling headphones

650
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,740
Bagels for breakfast and then we hit the links. Yeah

651
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,320
That's the life man. I cannot

652
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,120
Wait to be I think I'll be one of these people. I mean, I'll never retire. This is an impossible

653
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,240
Right goals for me, but if I were to retire, I think I would be one of these people, you know

654
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,180
A lot of people retire and they're like, oh, yeah, I retired and I realized I was bored and they get another job

655
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,200
That would never be me. I

656
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,380
Would retire I would play golf every day. I would watch

657
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,380
TV shows rewatch TV shows I would have an amazing fucking time

658
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,040
Yeah, here's the thing. So my my dad right now

659
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:13,160
Is like persona non grata at his job. He's getting Japanese style fired where they just give you less and less responsibility

660
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,960
But he doesn't have a Japanese man's shame. So he just golfs

661
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,960
every day

662
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,000
That's what you're supposed to do I like that

663
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,640
Until you literally

664
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,380
That you can't move what happened my grandpa man

665
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,880
He was good. He golfed every day for like 10 years and then his rotator cuff exploded. Yeah

666
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,820
He hurt his back like because I was I was in Arizona for like nine days

667
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,020
He went golfing seven times and hurt his back

668
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,700
four days

669
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,500
Yeah, hey we need to go golfing up here bro

670
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,620
All the ones that are like close to New York City suck dick, but we go to like

671
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,340
Jersey for this park golf course right near me has

672
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,460
Pretty good. They've like I think three courses. It's like a big-ass

673
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,040
Thing and they're pretty nice. They have one like nine hole par three and like two

674
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,340
executive courses

675
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,000
There should be like what vertical golf courses

676
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,880
Do you know I mean like no I no idea what you mean, man. What does that mean? You mean top goal?

677
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,220
That's what you're not you mean every level is a

678
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:37,240
Hole, yes, but then that would be boring because they all be that a standard kind of size. No, no, they could be huge

679
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,760
But then this within the building would be unmanageably large. Yes

680
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,280
Well, here's the thing right you're saying the building would be unmanageably large a

681
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,340
Golf course is just that but just spread out

682
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:00,340
That's true Rex's what I just mean vertical farming right now. That's I just mean in New York

683
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,880
I don't think there's anywhere where you could fit a building that wide

684
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:12,660
Except maybe pretty tall on a park. Yeah, it's at least 18 floors not to mention the clubhouse the pro shop

685
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,140
Well, I'm all

686
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:22,140
In the air, you know true they would be yeah, it would be very very tall wait, and then you just have levitating

687
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,020
That's what the Burj Khalifa girls yeah

688
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:32,420
They will try to do like in like Dubai and they would it would be like the talk of the town for like a whole year

689
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,580
And then I'd be like, yep after 18 billion dollars nothing happened

690
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,620
like the line

691
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,980
12,000 Burmese men

692
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:47,900
A single floor

693
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,860
Are we gonna

694
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,780
Foundation in 25 years. Are we gonna make a trip to the line in Saudi Arabia?

695
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,500
You don't know the line the line city, oh, yeah

696
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,500
They say it's happening man

697
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,660
It's their new those those project

698
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:14,760
This insane like architecture videos where they talk about insane new high-tech buildings. You're like, wow

699
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,860
That's crazy. And then you forget about them did the next day

700
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,980
Yeah, cuz none of those have ever come true every single like I would what you watch those ten years ago

701
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,980
and they say they're gonna be done in ten years and

702
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,800
Then you check in on it now and whoever started it is in jail every single time

703
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,180
Yeah, the coolest ones are like yeah, these are just this one just started. It's gonna be it's gonna be a lot of housing

704
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,540
It's gonna be like a big mob because we a hotel is gonna be great and they'll be done and approximately

705
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,460
62 years so I don't care

706
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,520
The only people I trust to do this is is the UAE because they did

707
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:59,140
Huh and a con of course, but you a they did the big building and then they also did the globe the world islands

708
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:05,460
Where they have every country as as an island lives on those hates those or they're completely empty

709
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,080
Everyone who lives anywhere hates them

710
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,840
But they look cool. Yeah, I want to be one of the workers that build these things

711
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,600
You have a you have a good shot you want to volunteer you don't want to get paid

712
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,280
I want to become a statistic as one of the workers that died. Yes

713
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,180
15 workers that yeah

714
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,960
Send your family $8,000 when you die

715
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,780
Loves being in harm's way

716
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,700
You know tell me your new new work

717
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,020
Adventures my line of work. Yeah, I did a stop a kid from stabbing his dog. That's pretty awesome

718
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,660
I was walking to the kitchen. I see him hunched over like doing this

719
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:54,700
I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? And then so the dog is a chihuahua and then what he had was like

720
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:01,180
Like this needle like like that trying to status. It wasn't like a knife, but it's a chihuahua. That's basically a knife

721
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,100
You don't need a knife for a chihuahua. It's over and then I was like, what the fuck bro. What are you doing?

722
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,140
And I go over there to like stop him then he turns it on me

723
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:18,020
But little did he know, MMA black belt, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Disarm, Headlock, Armbar

724
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:26,020
And then I give it to like, um, his mom or something and then all they said was Jeepers.

725
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,020
I was like, "Try to kill your dog." I was like, "Okay."

726
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,020
Your mom said Jeepers?

727
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,020
Yeah.

728
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,020
Come on, bro.

729
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
She said Jeepers.

730
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,020
Try to kill your fucking dog.

731
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,460
This would be so much worse if it wasn't a chihuahua

732
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,020
Yeah, like if it was like a golden retriever or something, you would probably feel worse

733
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,120
It's like I died. I see those doctors up

734
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,420
Like a disposable dog

735
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,740
Like it's me. It is. Yeah, I

736
00:44:53,740 --> 00:45:00,260
Agree they're loud. They don't live. They live a long time actually do the ballet 18 months

737
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:08,040
In your house they do and in this kid's house. I think I think it's your wall is I

738
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,160
Like every dog maybe except it's you all I think I think that's the only one

739
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,560
I'm not so much a fan of Chad had chihuahuas when we were growing up and they were

740
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,680
Disgusting they would just sit there. They would shit one would shit into the other ones directly into their mouth

741
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,380
It was just they were the worst dogs ever

742
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,980
They were disgusting dude, then one dog would be taking a shit the other would come a lick his asshole and

743
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,860
They were like brother and sister

744
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:45,420
Nasty man, yeah had a friend who they thought they were adopting like some kind of like terrier or something

745
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:52,100
There's a chihuahua pit bull mix man, which is just that's a

746
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:59,680
Yeah, that thing would just get so mean so aggressive every single time you walk into the house just immediately try to attack

747
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,300
like they're doing anything about it, but

748
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:10,420
Who's having that with like attack or a needle, you know, then that's fine. Not saying I would step in that fast, but I

749
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,500
am I

750
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,460
Used to babysit these kids who had a they had a lizard

751
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:23,000
They had a I don't know what kind of lizard was a bearded dragon. That's what they had

752
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,920
Have you ever seen a bearded dragon?

753
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,840
It's a disgusting, loveless pet to have.

754
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,820
They cost an insane amount of money and then you have to feed them live roaches.

755
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:38,640
So I take the job and then like first day they're like, "Yeah, this kid, he's going to

756
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,800
practice fencing.

757
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,400
The other one's going to practice violin."

758
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,960
You pretty much just sit there and you give them cheese that's when they want them.

759
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,960
I was like, "Okay."

760
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,680
And then day two I show up and they're like, "Oh, also you have to take live roaches with

761
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,920
Tweezers out of this cup and feed them to this disgusting

762
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,040
animal and

763
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,600
it was

764
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,240
It was terrifying. I hate bugs. Yeah, of course I had to

765
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,620
Well, it was 17 bucks an hour man. I did it for like six months. That's crazy

766
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:13,460
Yeah, it was not so good escape and attack you happen all the time not attack me

767
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,800
but they would fall I would be so disgusted I would hold the cup like way far in front of me and

768
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,840
Sometimes close my eyes and I also would never use the tweezers that I was supposed to use

769
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:30,460
I would just dump them eyeball it out of the cup. And yeah, they probably have a crazy

770
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:36,840
African roach infestation because I was just dumping roaches all over the floor all the time

771
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,340
I would just throw it which is like a couple like this and just like go like this

772
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,500
I just hopes it hope it falls near the

773
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,320
The lizard so I should have done

774
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,580
That was disgusting man, I do not miss babysitting at all as a job

775
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,780
Yeah, I don't blame you. Yeah

776
00:47:52,780 --> 00:48:00,140
The cheeses were for the kid and I say cheese it's they weren't even cheese it they everything they had was healthy

777
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,780
I used to steal food from them

778
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:06,900
I used to bring a Tupperware in my backpack and steal like three quarters of a gallon of milk from them

779
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,980
Because they had a really expensive nice milk and I couldn't afford groceries

780
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:27,660
is

781
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:34,540
I'd take my bag and throw it in my bag and then I'd get home and just so drunk after a show

782
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:40,220
come home and drink milk and eat cheese.

783
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,980
Just sitting all night.

784
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,900
Yeah it was really, actually I kind of liked babysitting now that I think about it.

785
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,940
It was kind of fun as fuck.

786
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,860
Why'd you stop?

787
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:57,660
Well, because of a little virus called COVID-19, man.

788
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,620
That's right.

789
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,620
That's right.

790
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,740
I had to stop all my jobs and I had to move home.

791
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,740
And I had to meet you.

792
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,740
Rex, are you vaccinated?

793
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,740
Vaccinated in what way?

794
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,740
That means no.

795
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,740
That fully means no.

796
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,740
Against COVID?

797
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:21,500
I took one Johnson & Johnson shot.

798
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,140
Is that the one and done one?

799
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,140
Yes.

800
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,180
That gave people crazy bodies or something?

801
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,180
Yes.

802
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,180
Okay.

803
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,340
How many are you supposed to have is my actual honest question.

804
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,340
Are you supposed to have 100?

805
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,340
I think 100.

806
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,260
100 or 150 they want people to have now.

807
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,260
Yeah.

808
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,260
Okay.

809
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,980
I stopped at, I had one and then I had one booster.

810
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,300
But not, no, sorry, I had one and then-

811
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,100
You were supposed to get two or three?

812
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,860
You're supposed to get two shots or three shots and I whatever I didn't finish the last shot

813
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,860
whatever it was.

814
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,860
Yeah.

815
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,040
I didn't do it because I was like I'm probably good enough.

816
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,040
Got COVID three times.

817
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,300
The thing is you don't even get COVID anymore.

818
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,820
You just get the flu now all the time.

819
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,860
That means you have a long COVID mate.

820
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,420
No dude everyone is sick right now.

821
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,420
With COVID?

822
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,420
Everyone in the world is sick right now.

823
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,420
the

824
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,420
the

825
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,420
the

826
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,420
the

827
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,420
the

828
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,420
the

829
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,420
the

830
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,420
the

831
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,420
the

832
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,420
the

833
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,420
the

834
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,420
the

835
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,420
the

836
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,420
the

837
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:49,420
and

838
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,580
version of COVID that just murders mice. Yeah, I'm pretty excited for this one too.

839
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,740
Which nothing's ever escaped one of these labs so that's at least a little bit of a

840
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:05,500
nice relief. But yeah that's pretty that's pretty awesome. I mean it's gonna

841
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,580
happen again pretty soon I think. Yeah it's just gonna happen forever. It would

842
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,620
be so sick if it happened again. I'd love it. You'd love it? I had such a

843
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:18,620
good time. We played games all day every single day. That is true. We became

844
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,700
- Did they give you guys checks?

845
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,020
- Oh yeah, oh you, I don't know.

846
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,900
Did they give you checks?

847
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,780
Did you get COVID stimulus?

848
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,720
- Me?

849
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,560
- Yeah.

850
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,820
- Oh no, I didn't get anything.

851
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,660
- Nothing?

852
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,220
Oh my God, I got like five grand.

853
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,380
- I got like, I think when COVID happened,

854
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,940
I was at my old job and I was already getting paid like shit

855
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,980
and then they sent us all home, we were working from home

856
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,820
and then they were like, yeah, we're also gonna dock your pay

857
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,260
to like half or like less than half.

858
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,740
So I was pretty much making no money

859
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,300
And that's why I started streaming

860
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,460
and I'm playing more something every day.

861
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,940
And yeah, it was really bad money-wise,

862
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,860
but I was living with my dad,

863
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,980
so I didn't really feel it much.

864
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,860
- That's the thing, you'd be moving back in with your dad

865
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,420
if it happened again.

866
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,660
Because the podcast would be over.

867
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,600
It's over.

868
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,340
If anything bad happens in the world,

869
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,380
we're always teetering right on the edge of quitting.

870
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,380
So, this podcast would probably survive.

871
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,780
We'd be doing this forever and ever.

872
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,780
We're getting more and more guests.

873
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,180
More and more guests eventually, 100% podcast.

874
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,480
Yeah.

875
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,180
Everybody having the same Discord background repeating

876
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,680
because there's only like six of them.

877
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,680
Of course.

878
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,780
Yeah, this...

879
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:38,080
You gotta start doing the custom ones with GIFs and funny images.

880
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,980
I usually do, but guys, my Discord Nitro has run out.

881
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,780
I hate to say it.

882
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,460
My discord nitro is gone.

883
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,180
Five dollars a month, it is one beer a month.

884
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,660
I'm not paying five bucks a month.

885
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,180
Yeah, you know what I'd rather have, man?

886
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,780
The beer!

887
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,260
Everybody always says that.

888
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,940
Oh, it's the same as a beer, same as a coffee.

889
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,100
I love beer, I love coffee.

890
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:03,100
You could go a month minus one coffee.

891
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,280
No, I couldn't.

892
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,540
Everything in my life would fall apart.

893
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,020
That would be a domino effect.

894
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,680
Many people's lives would be over

895
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,980
if I skipped one coffee a month, one beer a month.

896
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,420
I agree with Caleb on this one.

897
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,180
This is like the people playing for Twitter blooping,

898
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,380
like you can just pay,

899
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,420
are you not gonna pay for the app to use the most?

900
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,980
Which I think is ridiculous.

901
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,860
- Well, that's like a reasonable thing.

902
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,700
- It's like eight bucks.

903
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,500
- Not for me, I don't care about that.

904
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,500
- Hi, Chad. - Okay.

905
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,020
- They have a, you think, are people still doing that?

906
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,220
People are still like, oh, I don't wanna support Twitter

907
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,780
'cause Elon Musk is--

908
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,740
- Yes, dude.

909
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,140
people fucking call him a nazi every day

910
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,440
oh my god who can

911
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,100
you get it

912
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,680
you guys are not the mix the coolest cars in the world

913
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,260
yeah they don't even work

914
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,980
he makes the most amazing cars ever

915
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,360
i think i used to be a tesla hater too but then i had an uber where i was in

916
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,320
one

917
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,480
and i it took me about fifteen minutes to open the door

918
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,020
and i was like you know what this is what a car should be

919
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:11,280
you know well you know what's worse than that a kia or a honda

920
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,120
where they open too good and people steal them.

921
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Exactly.

922
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,040
And also, people say, oh, the cars explode.

923
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,280
You know what other cars explode?

924
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,560
Every car.

925
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,120
Most people die in car accidents, giant explosions

926
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,400
where their heads fall off.

927
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,160
OK?

928
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,400
This is not a point against these cars.

929
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,360
These are amazing cars.

930
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,080
Everybody should buy one of these cars.

931
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,320
And they look badass, man.

932
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,440
The Cybertrunk, this is the coolest car ever.

933
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,200
I love that Cybertrunk.

934
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,200
The Cybertrunk, it looks amazing!

935
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
Why are people hating on these fucking cars?

936
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Yeah, I'm with you man.

937
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
Somebody had to do something, cars are getting out of hand

938
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
in the way that they've looked the same for 20 years.

939
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Yeah, well I personally

940
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
I thank him for his latest invention,

941
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
the app that spawns

942
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,200
naked women

943
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,200
under every single tweet reply.

944
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
He made everything better!

945
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,200
He made everything better, everything I need is in one app.

946
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,200
Oh, I'm looking at a recipe.

947
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,200
Oh, there's a woman's asshole.

948
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:17,300
That is it's one single one-stop shop for everything. Oh, this is what I did today though. Yeah, you can do me today

949
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,300
And it's just them

950
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,020
Thank you, ma'am

951
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:30,780
I do really like how bold they're getting with the the porn Twitter replies where someone will be like

952
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:38,720
So my guys my grandpa passed away and then the first response I'm alive in my pussy has not been eaten in four minutes

953
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Here's a picture

954
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,920
I sucked his cock

955
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,780
Did I said one today where it's just like I think it was just like a picture of a guy

956
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:55,920
I mean it may have been a streamer, you know, it was like, you know a kind of viral tweet. So if of course you have like

957
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:02,440
Porn bots or whatever but one of them was just a woman asking like am I supposed to know this is and you can clearly tell

958
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,580
That it's the profile of like an OnlyFans woman. That's like, okay

959
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:11,340
Who's gonna click on your tweet being like, oh is that but it just works

960
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,880
This is the biggest industry in the world

961
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,200
Well, maybe not but it's up there I

962
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:28,040
Mean as far as I know it the ads are getting awesome. The ads on Twitter have gotten so amazingly good

963
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:34,080
It'll just be like on X. I'm sorry. It'll be a picture of a 60 year old guy

964
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,720
Who's got he's like covered in honey and he paid $5 to make sure that a hundred people saw it

965
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,000
Now it's getting to the point people I

966
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,340
Will be scrolling. I'm not gonna say who but I've been scrolling on Twitter or Instagram and I've seen ads

967
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,480
from people that I know

968
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,080
who paid to have their

969
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,600
their posts promoted

970
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,720
but they're not

971
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,160
They're not like oh here I'm doing a show at this time. It's just like a picture of them. Yeah, isn't that crazy?

972
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:14,880
Who would do that? Okay. Well, I mean I did that but that was just you know, I'm not gonna say who Wow, you know

973
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,280
I won't say who so you hate me. I look good in this pic, you know, just

974
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,080
And sometimes it's people that I follow and it's like I would have seen the photo anyway

975
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,080
Yeah, I think it's a even better than that

976
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:35,000
I like how you can't ever tell what when you go into replies you can't tell what's an actual reply and what's like an like an ad

977
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,640
Like Rex linked me like some fucked up video like this this week

978
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,380
And I was like it was really it was a shocking video

979
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,040
I was like, ah damn and I was scrolling the replies and like one of the first ones were just a guy

980
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,520
Quoting himself promoting his own post about like a tank

981
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,020
You know, it's like oh, it's just an ad. I just click it. It's just a reply

982
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:57,940
is like look at my post about a tank under someone's video.

983
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,300
That's kind of badass though. I'd like to see photos of tanks more.

984
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:10,340
It is so funny how like you go like every viral post has a million sub viral posts under it now.

985
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:16,500
It's like meant for like your brain to just turn off and forget that you're

986
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:22,100
in the replies to a different post. It's like a new timeline under every viral post.

987
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,500
It's smart man, it gets me every fucking time.

988
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
It does.

989
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,300
I look at all these photos.

990
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,580
I get, I've been fooled, we've talked about this before, I've shown you the proof.

991
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:37,580
I've been fooled by every fucking Instagram message I've ever gotten, man.

992
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,620
I mean I'm responding to all of these women and it turns out that they're all fake.

993
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,540
And I'm not even looking for sex.

994
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,060
I just want friendship.

995
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,060
friendship and I mean if you go to my hidden requests on Instagram I mean all

996
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:56,380
these group chats man and I I'm like oh group chats are cool my phone isn't

997
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,180
working but then I talked to these women a little bit they're trying to sell me

998
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,300
stuff and make me go on different websites yeah and that's something like

999
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,060
looking through stories and you see an ad for a hundred dollar piece of meat

1000
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:13,020
and you're going oh let me get that I guess here in a week can I have that

1001
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:20,020
it

1002
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:23,140
and then they'll say pick me up baby and shake my pussy

1003
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:27,100
which is not... and I go I

1004
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,380
don't think I'm so interested in that

1005
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,680
I'm single and available for

1006
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,020
any activity so I say okay would you like to go have some lunch on Thursday

1007
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,660
and then they say watch me naked

1008
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,900
rude

1009
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,460
little forward a little rude that's a thing

1010
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,940
What happened to manners, right?

1011
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,300
What I do to be nice?

1012
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,020
Why not directly contact me right now?

1013
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,420
I like a man with a big penis and sturdiness.

1014
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,860
Man, you're in the wrong place, baby.

1015
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,460
Yep, I'm sorry, I can't provide either.

1016
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,220
I'm sorry.

1017
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,500
