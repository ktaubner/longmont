00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,080
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,920
(laughing)

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,760
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,600
- Wow, dude.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,440
- Wow.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,260
- Wow.

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,100
- Wow.

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,940
- An original recipe, dude.

11
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,720
It's been way too long.

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,560
- Wow.

13
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,440
- Fuck, and I'm recording live

14
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,120
from the danger zone right now.

15
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,960
- Yeah?

16
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,780
- Mm-hmm.

17
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,120
- Which danger zone?

18
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,880
- North Carolina danger zone.

19
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,760
- Is that a danger zone?

20
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,600
- It is for me, dude.

21
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
You know why?

22
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Why?

23
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,480
Because every time I walk down the street, I see a place that sells 50 pounds of kratom

24
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,960
for $10.

25
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,160
And I've never done kratom, but I'm getting close to it.

26
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
It's putting you in danger.

27
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,160
It's putting me in danger of trying kratom.

28
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Yeah.

29
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Dude, it's just hard.

30
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,360
They're throwing it at you here, dude.

31
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Yeah.

32
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Just like nonstop.

33
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,520
These big baggies of like sawdust that supposedly they're like, it's like heroin, dude.

34
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
It's free.

35
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
It's free.

36
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
Just take it.

37
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
It's fine.

38
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,120
you take it and you've eaten that day, you throw up.

39
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,360
(laughing)

40
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,440
- Dude, it's amazing being in a place

41
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,640
that doesn't have legal weed,

42
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,120
'cause they're selling like that,

43
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,080
and they're selling this shit called Delta 8.

44
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,920
Have you ever heard of that?

45
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,800
- Oh, I've heard of Delta 8.

46
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,760
- Delta 8 is like, it's like not weed or some shit,

47
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,600
but everybody here thinks that

48
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
it's the best thing of all time.

49
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,340
- Yeah.

50
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,120
- I just, dude, I gotta get outta here, man.

51
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,320
It's a danger zone, bro.

52
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,800
- They were too lazy to even change the name of it

53
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,240
after it got leaked from a lab.

54
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Yeah, we're not even gonna call this like Grungus or whatever.

55
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Like Turbo Weed or something.

56
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Kratom, Kava, Grungus, Fumble.

57
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
It's fucking terrible dude.

58
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Yeah, Roku, 2B, Hulu.

59
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Yeah, Roku, Amazon, Netflix.

60
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
On the Netflix pack dude.

61
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,240
But it's just like, I know that if I tried Kratom, you would never see me again.

62
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Absolutely.

63
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,240
I would be like one of the 0.01% of people who just like do Kratom until they die.

64
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, like fucking sprinkling over I'd be using like Parmesan cheese on like salads and shit. Yeah, it would not mean it's also it's like

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,260
That's maybe the the lamest way you could ever take a drug is in a is in powder like that

66
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,360
Yeah, you just like mix in and drink. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, it's not even like like you don't even snort it

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,500
Yeah, you don't know exactly. I mean injection. That's cool. Smoke. Yeah, that's cool. There's fire

68
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,460
Dude, kratom is like, you like put it in like orange juice.

69
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,460
Yeah, exactly.

70
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,460
And you're like, it's like fiber.

71
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,520
Yeah, what kind of a bear is that?

72
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
This is a supplement, dude.

73
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,200
But supposedly it'll make you really tired, which I guess is what drugs are about.

74
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,720
That's what people like.

75
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Yeah.

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Yeah.

77
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,240
But just everybody here is just fucking, dude.

78
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,360
And they're always, it's like the only thing that you overhear people talking about in public

79
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,280
is like Delta 8 and Kratom and Kava and about how it like cured their knee or whatever. I

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,520
used to have knee but then I had Kratom and it cured my knee. It's fucking terrible.

81
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
Yeah, that's a good Skyrim reference.

82
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,040
Yeah, yeah. You know how I am, dude. I'm a gamer.

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah.

84
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,640
But it's been nice in the danger zone. I have as hot as shit. There's the AC in my car is

85
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,280
broken in my Ford Focus. Tell you what, these fellas at Ford should have focused

86
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,320
on making better damn air conditioning unit. I know, that's right. You know what I'm saying? Absolutely. Which is, you know, sad. Ford was a great

87
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,060
company back in the day. But they lost their focus. American company. Ford used to,

88
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,560
Ford struck a chord in the market as far as cores go. But then they gave up.

89
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,320
they leveled down. Started making these dog shit cars. Exactly. No air conditioner and I'm just

90
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:52,040
out here sweating dude. Sweating. Dodging. Dodging Cratum. Dodging Cratum landmines left and right.

91
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,200
I wish it was Dodge instead of Ford. That's right. That's fucking right. Yep. Dodge and that's a real

92
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,440
American car brand. Absolutely. Ford here's the thing they don't tell you about Ford. All that

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,040
- Ram. - Grab that ram, dude.

94
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,360
- Grab the ram. - Grab the horns.

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,800
- Yeah.

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
- Take care of that thing, dude.

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,840
The Ford is nonsense, bro. - Ford, yeah.

98
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,560
Ford is like-- - Here's the thing, man.

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
Like, the first, Ford's like the first car, right?

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160
- Yeah. - There's nothing

101
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,200
where the first one was the best one.

102
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,960
There's not a single thing where the first kind

103
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,120
of that thing was the best one.

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,200
- Let me think here.

105
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
What about-- - Books, Gutenberg Bible,

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,880
that thing sucks.

107
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
What about like, um, the Matrix?

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What the fuck?

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You can't...

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What the fuck?

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,320
A challenger has just appeared in the call, dude?

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,800
We're in the middle of recording the episode.

114
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Not only that, he's...

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Dude, ugh.

116
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Are you recording your audio now?

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I am right now.

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Alright.

119
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
That's fine.

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Do you guys like my new sunglasses?

121
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
No, dude.

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
I hate this, dude.

123
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I was having...

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I had so much planned, dude.

125
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
I was gonna...

126
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
What do you mean?

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,440
I was going to make an entire playboy featuring your whole family and now I can't, dude.

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
What?

129
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Yeah, man.

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,800
I was going to make a sexy playboy about your family.

131
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
How far into recording are you guys?

132
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
About five minutes.

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Oh, my bad.

134
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
No, it's fine.

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
It's fine.

136
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
You hopped in.

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm fine with it.

138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Yeah.

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
So, what do you think about Dodge and Ford?

140
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Yeah.

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
So, what we're talking about-

142
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Is that?

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Okay.

144
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
a

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,280
Nord, but Dodge is more like a Mirage.

146
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Is what

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Oh, so it's like a rhyming thing?

148
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,400
No, like a Ford if you put it backwards is

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
"Droaf".

150
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,400
We were just playing around with different words.

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
We were doing wordplay.

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,480
A shavy, a shavy, uh, as good as gravy.

153
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Yeah.

154
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Okay.

155
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Yep.

156
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
A ram, drive you can.

157
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Whoa.

158
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Drive you can.

159
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,840
drive you can. Mazda, let's go get some pasta. Yeah, that's right, head to the Olive Garden

160
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,840
in this Mazda, get some pasta. Exactly. Subaru, Olive Garden has some food for you. Toyota,

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:21,120
go to Olive Garden, get some soda. It's that easy, dude. Camry, go into Olive Garden, it's

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
one of my greatest mammaries.

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,640
Camry, I'm at Olive Garden, I'm angry.

164
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm looking at these things here, I'm looking at Ford memes online.

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,360
Dude, Ford is a dog shit car, man.

166
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Yeah.

167
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,000
Here's one, it's a picture of Forrest Gump.

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,800
It says, "Mom always said Fords are for gay men."

169
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,520
- What's the bottom text of it?

170
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,000
- What's the bottom text?

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
- The bottom text is Fords are for gay men.

172
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,880
- What's the never know what you're gonna get type thing?

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,280
Oh, okay, that's it.

174
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,400
So it says, "My mom always said Fords are for gay men."

175
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,360
That's the whole Forrest Gump format they came up with?

176
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,640
- Well, I mean, you have to give Forrest Gump

177
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,200
a little bit of, you know,

178
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,800
I mean, he is a mentally challenged man.

179
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,600
- Well, that's what I would have,

180
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,680
if I was gonna diss Ford with Forrest Gump,

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,760
would have said Ford is as mentally challenged as Forrest Gump is. Ford is

182
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,240
Gump. Ford is Gump yeah yeah I wouldn't have tried to you know also why am I

183
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,720
listening to Forrest Gump dude this guy's a moron. Hey come on he's not a

184
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,200
moron don't say moron about him. Why he's stupid. I never saw that movie. You

185
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,960
never saw Forrest Gump? No. I saw I don't think he was even confirmed he was he was mentally

186
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,080
challenge he's a run slightly above mentally challenged in the movie they

187
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,320
say they show like they show a graph they show a graph and then they're like

188
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,920
your son is here and it's like a little bit seen in that movie that is a scene

189
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,080
in that movie I don't think that's true it's true and then Sally Field fucks the

190
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,200
principal so he can go to normal school yeah I remember that not not challenge

191
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
school I was pretty cool dude that's it they should make more porn with that

192
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,680
exact scenario yeah with Forrest Gump involved yeah yeah you gotta fuck this

193
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,000
principal to get to Forrest Gump into school yeah yeah I mean that's a good

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,540
way to to get get more like non-sexual actors into the porn as you could have

195
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,560
like you know people who you know playing the person who has to get into

196
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,120
school maybe yeah that's a good point who doesn't have to be in the same room

197
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
as as the sex or whatever's going on but maybe just like an intro with a

198
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,760
different actor and then we can you know employ more actors who maybe have been

199
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
calling on hard times lately. What about a movie so in this same vein what

200
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,040
about like a movie where Rodney Dangerfield has to go back to college?

201
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,120
No he'd be too funny. Yeah? I'd kick him out of my class if I was a damn professor.

202
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,440
Yeah I would too. He'd be in there sweating up a storm getting everybody

203
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,660
wet and also making them laugh too hard. Yeah. Now, but if he was a professor, now that might

204
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,740
be a funny-ass class. It's really fucked up what they...

205
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,000
They teach a class on how to get respect or how to get no respect.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,180
Yeah, it's really fucked up what they did to Rodney Dangerfield back then. Like, if I was

207
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,440
around him, I would have given him respect and then he wouldn't have, hey, wouldn't have

208
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,520
been so sad all the time. Yeah, he wouldn't have killed himself.

209
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,280
Also, what's this guy's, I mean, this guy was on The Tonight Show, like, once a week.

210
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,120
How much respect can one man have? What, do you want to be Mao Tse-Tung? Like, what is

211
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,640
he going for why is he still complaining he's it's weird another thing he looks

212
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,280
weird another thing he's old as dog crap oh yeah kill himself of course he didn't

213
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,700
kill himself do you don't kill yourself when you turn 80 I would you'd kill

214
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,320
yourself the second turn I would I till 80 if I was if it was an old-age thing

215
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:03,120
I don't know well if I was like 20 years of being old 20 years of just sucking

216
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:13,900
yeah I would do Rodney Dangerfield when he was good and ready he that was no that

217
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,200
was no man-made crime God committed that one God's and God's God yeah God was

218
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,520
like I'll take you to a place where you can finally get some respect that's

219
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,080
yeah that could bet and it was hell if he died nowadays that some some political

220
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,840
cartoonist would draw that like yeah Rodney Dangerfield holding hands with God

221
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:39,300
yeah and it and walking into a door that says respect that's heaven for him yeah

222
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,140
just so just respect I mean this guy he didn't get any respect I think it's

223
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,740
weird that Lou Gehrig killed himself did he yeah Lou Gehrig's disease is that

224
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:58,460
Russian that's so sad dude I never knew that uh-huh yeah that's why I make you

225
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,460
- Yeah, when people say, you know,

226
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,360
oh, he died of Lou Gehrig's disease,

227
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,860
they lost a battle with their mind.

228
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,560
- Yeah, ALS stands for a lonely stoner.

229
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,540
- Yep.

230
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,380
- Yeah.

231
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,260
Yeah, that's what happened to him.

232
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,740
It's actually insanely sad what happened to him.

233
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,240
He killed himself with a baseball, tried to eat it.

234
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,100
(laughing)

235
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,220
He knew it'd kill him, but he just tried.

236
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,860
- Is that, is this part of my mustache not growing?

237
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,460
I don't know dude, I can't even barely see you dude.

238
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,580
I see you on a webcam.

239
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,860
Does it look patchy in the sunlight?

240
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
I can't see anything now.

241
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,380
Does it look patchy in the sunlight?

242
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,220
Yeah.

243
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,860
No, you look like you're on fire.

244
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,060
Stop putting those sunglasses on man.

245
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,540
I bought these 'cause they were $5 on the site,

246
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,300
on like Canal Street.

247
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,140
Canal.

248
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,980
Canal.

249
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,860
Oh, beautiful Canal Street.

250
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,540
But yeah, I was on Canal.

251
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,500
Canal, whatever.

252
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,540
(laughing)

253
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,120
These were, I needed sunglasses and these were five bucks

254
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,740
and I just realized how bad I look in them.

255
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,300
- Were they Gucci sunglasses?

256
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,140
- Yes, they are.

257
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,580
- Yeah, if you're on Canal Street,

258
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,220
you gotta get like a fake.

259
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,060
- No, they're not.

260
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,600
They were sold, they were $5, like a guy with like a table.

261
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,760
- They're all a guy with a table.

262
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,600
- Yeah.

263
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,980
- That's like what everything on Canal Street is.

264
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,500
It's a guy with a table and he has some fucking like,

265
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,820
some like Gucci bags that are made out of paper mache

266
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,080
and he sells them to you.

267
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,120
- Yeah, that's your rules.

268
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,020
When Noah's in town, he's got a Fendi belt there.

269
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,920
- Yeah, there was a guy in Austin recently

270
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,680
who was selling a bunch of suitcases and luggage

271
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,260
and purses and stuff off a table,

272
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,100
but then the one thing that wasn't a bag

273
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,840
that he was selling was a giant wooden cutout

274
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,500
of a cow from Ben and Jerry's.

275
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,920
- Did you pick it up?

276
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,820
- No, I wanted to take a picture of it,

277
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,580
but I also didn't want to just like take a picture of this guy.

278
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,420
- Dude, I really--

279
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,460
- 'Cause he was standing in front of it.

280
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,220
- I really want to go to like the flea market

281
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,060
in my hometown.

282
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,340
I wonder if it's opened back up yet.

283
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,620
- Oh, I was just at a flea market in--

284
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,220
- Dude, Hampshire, dude, to the best.

285
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,780
Last time I was at a flea market, I got a--

286
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,380
- At Hollis, I told you about this.

287
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,220
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,140
- You ignored me 'cause you hate me.

289
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,060
- Well, I hate Hollis.

290
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,620
- Hollis, dude, Hollis is cool.

291
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,540
The thing about a New Hampshire flea market

292
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,340
is that there's, multiple times that day,

293
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
I saw somebody cross the street

294
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,100
and say thank you for your service to the crossing guard.

295
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,460
(laughing)

296
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
- Oh yeah.

297
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,260
- Dude, the flea markets are the best, dude.

298
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,680
In the south you get like,

299
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,580
like I went to this flea market a couple years ago

300
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,780
and I got a pro El Chapo t-shirt

301
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,380
that said that it called him

302
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
the number one Mexican billionaire.

303
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,940
And it was like free El Chapo, he's the man.

304
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,340
And then I got a framed painting of the Last Supper

305
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,200
where Jesus was replaced with Obama.

306
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,040
- Yeah. - Nice.

307
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,720
- Just the sickest shit ever, dude.

308
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,600
- In New Hampshire, you either get,

309
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,640
the flea market's there, you're either buying

310
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,440
a gun or a combat knife, or a widescreen DVD,

311
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,640
a fellowship of the ring that's covered in cum.

312
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,060
Like those are the very possible things

313
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,480
you can leave with.

314
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,200
- The Londonderry flea market's good.

315
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,560
The Londonderry flea market,

316
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,640
they have a big pond in the middle of it,

317
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,640
and there's a dude and they have a,

318
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,240
a boat in the middle of the pond,

319
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
and it's like a mannequin that's kind of,

320
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
I think he's dressed up like a troop, I don't remember,

321
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,600
but they just have a mannequin fishing in the pond,

322
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,280
and it just kind of like sits there.

323
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,120
- That's the best, dude.

324
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,800
In North Carolina, all the flea markets are either like,

325
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,560
yeah, like the dogs playing poker,

326
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,340
but it's like Obama and Bill Clinton,

327
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,640
or like the most racist toy that anybody's ever imagined.

328
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,720
And then when you're like, oh shit,

329
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,920
this is like old as hell, like where'd you get this?

330
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,520
and they're like, "Man, I bought that 10 years ago."

331
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,360
- Yeah. (laughs)

332
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
- Yeah.

333
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm a huge handmaid.

334
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,920
- There was a family there at the flea market

335
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,240
where they had a little kid and they found at a table

336
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,200
like a gun holster that was small,

337
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,240
like a child-sized gun holster.

338
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,520
And they were trying to put it on.

339
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
They were trying to put it on the kid

340
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,020
and the kid was crying and being like,

341
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,720
"I don't know what I wear."

342
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
- Kid sounds like a baby, dude.

343
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
- Yeah, dude, that kid sucks.

344
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,160
- Get a cooler kid, man.

345
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,320
Kid can't handle an empty holster.

346
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,980
- Also, there was a free bin,

347
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,540
like where everyone just put the stuff

348
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,560
they just want to give away for free,

349
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,640
and I walked over and it was just a bunch of trash,

350
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,620
and then a baby doll that had multi-colored paint

351
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,140
splattered all over its face.

352
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,500
(laughing)

353
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,040
- Dude, flea markets are the best, dude.

354
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,140
If I ever need a $25 bootleg copy of Olympus Has Fallen,

355
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,860
I'm headed straight to the flea market, dude.

356
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,180
- Flea markets, that's where you get good DVDs, though.

357
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,380
You get like 10 DVDs for like $5.

358
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,380
Dude, I left there, I went yesterday I guess,

359
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,540
I left there with three Transformers Blu-rays, dude.

360
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,820
- Oh my God.

361
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,700
- Dude, my mom used to go to this flea market in Lowell

362
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,580
and she would just buy bootleg DVDs

363
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,140
out of some guy's car, out of his trunk.

364
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,980
And it was like, some of them were like screener quality,

365
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,700
some of them were like fucking--

366
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,420
A lot of them are a guy just filming it in the theater.

367
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,860
Yeah, like half of them, half of them, like the Hobbit,

368
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
we had the Hobbit on DVD.

369
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,220
Also by the time they get to the flea market,

370
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,300
they're on DVD.

371
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,540
Right.

372
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,100
But the Hobbit we had on DVD,

373
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,860
that one was a dude filming in his car,

374
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,380
and then like, she had,

375
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,300
what were the other ones?

376
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
I don't know, but there were like a bunch of them

377
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,980
where it was like,

378
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,740
some of them had like a little bar at the bottom

379
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,100
that said like, do not distribute,

380
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,940
like this is a screener.

381
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,620
And like shit like that.

382
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,540
Who's the fuck is it who is selling the screeners to the bootleg guy?

383
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,740
Airplane uh companies I think.

384
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,260
I think airplane companies get like the screeners for like the in-flight movie.

385
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,580
They also just send out they send they just send out screeners to like

386
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,660
company like in LA you'll just if you have like.

387
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,100
Do you think we could get a screener?

388
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
We probably could if one of us joined SAG.

389
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,500
Right?

390
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,660
Yeah.

391
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,260
Is that all you have to do?

392
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,780
Yeah you'll join SAG.

393
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,500
Yeah I will.

394
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,620
My nuts on your face.

395
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,920
- They're fucking sagging on my face

396
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,120
and I'm licking them up.

397
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,720
- Yep. - No!

398
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,580
- Yeah, that's right. - That's disgusting.

399
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,880
- We do need-- - I don't wanna join that.

400
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,640
- We need to get screeners,

401
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,680
we need to get press passes to pretty much every event.

402
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,040
And Caleb, this is something that you suggested

403
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,780
that I've been thinking about a whole lot.

404
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,320
We need to get on Family Feud.

405
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,160
- Family Feud, if we could launch some kind of--

406
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,400
- Oh my God, we gotta go, we gotta do it.

407
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,760
- But here's the problem, so I looked it up.

408
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,600
I looked up the Family Feud requirements, okay?

409
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
'Cause listen, I would love nothing more

410
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,320
than to do family feud with you too.

411
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,440
But you do need five people.

412
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,960
And they say on the website you have to be blood related.

413
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,080
So we would need to forge documents.

414
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,640
- Well, okay, no, because I just saw celebrity family feud

415
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,560
where it was--

416
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,400
- That's celebrity.

417
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,220
- That's celebrity, Dave.

418
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,760
- We're not making it on celebrity family feud.

419
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
- I don't think we're quite reaching that threshold yet.

420
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,040
- We're gonna compete against Rob Lowe and his wife.

421
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,440
- Here's the first step, we become mega ultra famous.

422
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,180
- Okay, but my other point still stands here.

423
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,020
if we just get married, we're a family, okay?

424
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,020
It's not like a husband and a wife is blood related.

425
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,700
- That's a good point, but that only works for two of us.

426
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,540
I don't think there's any states

427
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,420
you can get triple married, right?

428
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,580
We can adopt, can you adopt an adult?

429
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,980
- Yeah. - You could.

430
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, who's the second oldest?

431
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,180
I'm the oldest, obviously.

432
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,660
Who's the second oldest? - I'm the youngest.

433
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,380
- All right, so me and Patrick have to get married

434
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,220
and adopt you.

435
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,520
I think that's the only way it legally works.

436
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,220
- Can you-- - Okay, you could probably,

437
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,060
one second.

438
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
Even then, who's our other two, dude?

439
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,560
What are we getting?

440
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
First of all, your uncle.

441
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,060
Kevin Rudolph's little Wayne?

442
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,560
Is that what we have to do?

443
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Whatever, man, I'll do it.

444
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,060
That'd be crazy.

445
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Well, that's the other thing.

446
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Because we're listening to people.

447
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
Wait, wait, wait.

448
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,060
What if we got, like, Steve Harvey's kids?

449
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,560
[laughter]

450
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
It's just like us showing up.

451
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,060
That he hasn't talked to?

452
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Why do you assume he hasn't talked to his kids?

453
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Because that would be a funnier reveal.

454
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,060
As he turns around to pitch him the question of

455
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,180
what's the best sex you ever had thing and he turns around it's his damn

456
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,380
daughter he starts crying yeah we say and we say talk about a family feud yeah

457
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,740
true yeah he's not very wind by default yeah exactly a feud yeah I think we

458
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,620
would have been better eventually night person I mean eventually they're gonna

459
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,820
run out of celebrities to have that want to be on family feud and then they're

460
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,700
gonna come to us for celebrity family feud I don't know man I was watching it

461
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Sometime in 20 years.

462
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,700
If they're at One Republic, like, I mean, there's an endless level of One Republic level.

463
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,700
No, don't, no, you don't, you see, that means they're getting there.

464
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
One Republic?

465
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
You might be right, actually.

466
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Who's the people they would do right before us, though?

467
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Uhhhh...

468
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
NumaNuma guy?

469
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
No.

470
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
No?

471
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
No, we should get, we should scout him for our team.

472
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Gary Larson?

473
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Gary, no, it's Gary Prolsma.

474
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Gary Bralsma.

475
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,860
No, Gary Larson, I mean, would he be right before us?

476
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,340
He would not go on that.

477
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,220
I think he would be pretty far before us.

478
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,620
But he's hard to get also because he has a secret identity.

479
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,020
Yeah, he had Lou Gehrig's disease, he killed himself.

480
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,620
I think he's alive, right?

481
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
No.

482
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Gary Larson's dead?

483
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,380
I think he's alive.

484
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,020
I'm pretty sure he's alive.

485
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,380
I'm Googling it right now.

486
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
Oh, I was thinking of...

487
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,380
Yep, he's alive.

488
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,860
I was thinking of Gary Clarson.

489
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,980
Yeah I was thinking of Blary Blarson actually.

490
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,380
Yeah I know him because he famously died in my neighborhood.

491
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,580
Yeah he's a super dead guy.

492
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,980
No I was just thinking of him.

493
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
My bad.

494
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Yeah.

495
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,900
No but I think that it'll be many many years.

496
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,180
Also they keep making these new celebrities.

497
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,180
Like we're never going to get on.

498
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
We're going to become celebrities.

499
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,180
I think we have to.

500
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
First of all.

501
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
First of all.

502
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
I got to go freaking all these new celebrities.

503
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,460
I got to know who Mort Sahl is.

504
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
I mean come on.

505
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,300
I mean by next year I'm going to be a superstar too.

506
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,900
I don't know if we brought that into account.

507
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,700
I'm just going to get really famous by performing.

508
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,740
Oh, that's really gorgeous.

509
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,580
Superstars tend to do a lot of performance.

510
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,780
There could be some music involved, but I mainly will focus on stardom.

511
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,100
You think you're going to be like Lillian Gish level famous?

512
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,940
You think that you're going to have like a...

513
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,500
I don't know who that is, but I'll be basically superstar level famous, which is I would put

514
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,420
on the level of like BTS if they're one person or like the president. You think

515
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:29,260
you got a Lon Chaney movie in you? I don't know if you're trying to make fun of me

516
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:39,680
right now but I will be a superstar. You could be the first guy who's just normal famous for no reason. My only point of reference is just silent film stars. Oh yeah yeah okay

517
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,180
Cameron Mr. Al Jolson over here. Oh yeah this guy thinks he's Buster Keaton. Oh my

518
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Oh my god. Yeah, hey, check out the big balls on fucking T.W. Griffith over here.

519
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,180
I don't know if that's the one you want to be compared to.

520
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,180
That guy was, I think he was naughty.

521
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Yeah, he was a cheeky tad cheeky.

522
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,180
You know, now that you say it, Austin Powers is a good reference point to how famous I'm going to be.

523
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
You mean as famous as Austin Powers?

524
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,180
As famous, if not more famous.

525
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:20,540
he started doing a game show and it's oh yeah yeah dude Tommy scary god what was

526
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,580
the name of the fucking character is like Tommy something it was like the gong

527
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:32,140
show and Tommy Maitland that disgusted me dude yeah is just like I mean he is look

528
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,780
you're gonna dress up just do Shrek like just do it as Shrek right I think I do

529
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:45,220
I do respect the thing of Mike Myers creating a fake British guy because he thinks England is funny.

530
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,340
I think his mom was British or some shit.

531
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
Oh right, yeah, because he's from Canada.

532
00:22:50,340 --> 00:23:00,820
Which, for some reason, Canadian people will have the most insane hyphenated British last name.

533
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,940
Yeah.

534
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,980
A lot of like McDonald's, like,

535
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,860
McDonald Quarry, something like that.

536
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,060
- I don't think there's a McDonald Quarry.

537
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,820
- If there was a McDonald's in the quarry,

538
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,020
I would go to it. - I might eat it.

539
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,860
I was hungry.

540
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,700
- Yeah.

541
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,300
- Hell, I'd eat McDonald's anywhere, even the Quarry.

542
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,140
- Yeah.

543
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,960
- Yeah?

544
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,440
- I'd go underground for McDonald's.

545
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,100
- I would totally, oh my God.

546
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,780
- They should open an underground McDonald's.

547
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,380
I guess that's just like one in like a subway or something.

548
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,220
- I'd drive my-- - But they should put

549
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,420
one in a cave.

550
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,380
- They should, right?

551
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,880
cave mcdonalds? Have it drip? Instead of it dripping water you could put some damn diet

552
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,720
coca cola to drip. Yeah what about like a stalactites and stalagmites? A coke freestyle machine that

553
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,180
has a stalagmite on it? That might be a fucking genius idea dude. And the chairs and tables

554
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:52,880
could be like rocks. And I'd drive my Chrysler to get some fries there. Yeah? I'd drive right

555
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,400
over there to get some fries in my Chrysler. Yeah absolutely. I mean I'd pull up there in

556
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:17,760
my

557
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:34,920
in

558
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,600
You want to mini scoop them.

559
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
In your mouth.

560
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
No, I just said you wanted to scoop.

561
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
It's too easy with this guy.

562
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,040
No, I don't want to eat poop.

563
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
I don't want to eat poop at all.

564
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
You can scoop poop in your mouth.

565
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,840
Hey, Caleb, I'm going to ride my ATV.

566
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,320
You will be on ATV.

567
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,480
Yeah, because I'll be so famous.

568
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Because you'll be dead.

569
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
No.

570
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
I will.

571
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
You don't just get on TV when you're dead.

572
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:01,200
Oh, dude, well, this is unrelated, but I was at my grandma's house going through old shit

573
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,720
because she's just so ready to die.

574
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,560
just hawking shit at me all the time and so she was like showing me all like her

00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,080
like photos and all this shit newspaper clippings and stuff and that my

576
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,100

577
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,380
newspaper because she on a she was on a playground when she was four and she

578
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:29,380

579
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,980
upside down on monkey bars and it was like, "This brave little tyke decided to go upside

580
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:41,980

581
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,480
is like a real... there's like stuff about the Cold War four pages in and the front page

582
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,360
is like some kid went upside down on the monkey bars more on page six. What do you mean she

I'm actually a reporter for a news story.

00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:25,640
There's a guy with a hat, like a fedora that just says "Press" on it.

591
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,640
And he's just like taking pictures of children and he's like "Ah, great story today!"

608
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,440
All right. Yeah, I guess that is just a piece of comedy, a fake guy's story. Yeah.

Trying to look one since I have autism.

677
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
[Laughter]

678
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,320
That wasn't Cameron reading, that was just him saying it.

679
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,320
I think it will be cool to have a family of your own.

680
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
[Laughter]

681
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Oh, that's so nice.

682
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,320
SausageLover99 comments, "Boys rule, girls drools."

683
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
So true.

684
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,040
I am a dude, but do not find girls interesting at all. Am I the only one? Yes. Yes, you are

685
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,620
I'd like to see just a girl in a bikini

686
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:59,320
Just discover gay people. Yeah, I didn't have - is there a collective of men who I don't know

687
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,360
Would like a relationship with another man?

688
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,700
Someone says you have to admit she is hot

689
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,280
I don't know, woman.

690
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,720
This was, oh shit, I just realized you could click on the pictures.

691
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,200
I'm a boy but I don't like girls.

692
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,320
I hate they.

693
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,920
You click on the pictures and it says, this picture of this woman was added by mood333

694
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
on April 8th, 2016.

695
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,360
I mean, she's in a beautiful bikini.

696
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,000
This comment says, I'm reporting this image.

697
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,420
Just says yes, and it's from beetlesfan1964.

698
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,880
This one says, I'm a boy but I don't like girls.

699
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
I hate they.

700
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,080
"The reason is, if you jokes, they are angry."

701
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,280
And Boris Rule says, "Kinda sexist, my mate."

702
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
- I really do not think that people should be talking

703
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,560
about that stuff in public.

704
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,620
They should only be talking about that as appropriate

705
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,540
for wherever they are, even at home.

706
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,740
- What, I'm a girl, and it's just weird that boys like.

707
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,800
(laughing)

708
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,340
- RC cars, fishing, fixing things, getting chickens.

709
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,180
(laughing)

710
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,400
- Here, let me read this sequence of comments here.

711
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
- Sure.

712
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,240
- Good.

713
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,060
- Yup.

714
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,020
- I love girls.

715
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:12,020
from Ethan Wakeman. It is true. I love girls. True. Sex. So true.

716
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,520
I really do not think that people should be talking about that stuff in public.

717
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,820
They should only be talking about... Oh, my bad.

718
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,820
You fucking idiot.

719
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,820
I'm gonna go to Subaru and get some food for you.

720
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
They're hot.

721
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,020
Sex.

722
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Number two is sports.

723
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Yep.

724
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Um, erm...

725
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,780
I don't know. Some of us actually like the written word. Yeah. Thank you. Some of us actually like the theater.

726
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,180
Somebody or some of us guys are actually thespians. Do you ever think for a second

727
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,900
there's some men who just like looking up pictures of the devil online?

728
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,180
Yeah, those are the guys who belong in solitary confinement. But like I don't

729
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,260
you know some guys just don't like sports they just like looking up really

730
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:59,300
realistic drawings of the devil. So it's kind of an inaccurate item. And screaming and hiding under the bed.

731
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:05,580
Well, we're just looking at them and being like, "Well, maybe one day."

732
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,580
So you never thought about that?

733
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
One day, what?

734
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
I don't know, maybe one day.

735
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Just watch your back.

736
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,660
That's all I gotta say.

737
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Guys love football.

738
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:18,300
If you asked 100 guys if they liked football, 95 out of 100 would say yes, they love football.

739
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,020
Every Sunday, somebody's always talking about football.

740
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,140
Get my point?

741
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,060
Football is always drilled into boys' minds.

742
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
True.

743
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
Yep.

744
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Yeah, yeah.

745
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,820
drilling each other's minds on the damn on the football field

746
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,580
a lot of these guys have actual head injuries

747
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,780
some called CTE look this up

748
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,220
look up Junior Seyo

749
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,180
I would say drilling football into somebody's head is a very good thing to say

750
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,660
uh... here's a comment here

751
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,220
i'm a ten-year-old girl and i like to skateboard too but i have a brother

752
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,020
named that's thirteen

753
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,980
and he is the one that taught me how to skateboard so most boys like

754
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,340
skateboarding

755
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
That's true.

756
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,620
I like swimming.

757
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,620
That's fun.

758
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,620
Sometimes running.

759
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,980
I am not very good at football.

760
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,260
Probably because I am Mexican.

761
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,660
Who doesn't lobe football?

762
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,580
I ran.

763
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,620
What's there not to love about it?

764
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:17,060
I think it's really cool and I am a girl of seven boy brothers.

765
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,780
I hate sports!

766
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,820
Except for baseball.

767
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm a boy.

768
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,620
I wrestle my brother all the time.

769
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
So fun.

770
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,620
I love it.

771
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,720
(laughter)

772
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,120
- I'm on the football team.

773
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,360
(laughter)

774
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,220
- Hell yeah, they obsessed.

775
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,460
- Sports is a boy's life, dude.

776
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,660
- That's the truth, man.

777
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,500
- Dude, what would I do without my sports?

778
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,380
- There's a comment on this one that says,

779
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,660
"I don't like women."

780
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,920
(laughter)

781
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,480
- I don't like sport.

782
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,720
I'm not a gamer, really.

783
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,600
I'm not fat.

784
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,580
I hate wrestling.

785
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,680
I don't listen to rap.

786
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,040
Cars are okay, but I'm not a car guy.

787
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,040
And I also don't use a TikTok, so I'm so unique.

788
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,080
- That's me when I meet anybody new.

789
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,640
That's what I, I just rattle off everything right away.

790
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,680
- I don't like cars.

791
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,520
- Yeah, I don't like cars.

792
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,180
- Here's all you need to know about me.

793
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,020
- Yeah.

794
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,320
- And I don't like sports.

795
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,560
I'm not a gamer, really.

796
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,520
I'm not fat.

797
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,900
I hate wrestling.

798
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,680
- A lot of boys like toot ball, so I agree.

799
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,940
(laughter)

800
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,320
- I'm a girl but ball is life.

801
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,520
- Sheesh. - Truth.

802
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,640
Wow.

803
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,480
Much respect, dude.

804
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,100
That's like a, dude, that's insane.

805
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,320
A girl who likes sports?

806
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,160
- Yeah.

807
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,480
- I feel like I'm in fever pitch right now.

808
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,000
- No, no, she doesn't like sports, that's the thing.

809
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,800
- She likes sports at the end though.

810
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,720
- Yeah, she likes, she runs on the field.

811
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,320
- You don't know anything about fever pitch.

812
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,280
- Are you shitting me?

813
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,880
You don't know anything about Fever Pitch with Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore.

814
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,720
I know so much about that.

815
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
No.

816
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Yes.

817
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
No.

818
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,080
They sing that, they play that song "It's Not Over" and it's like "It's not over" and she's

819
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,840
running on the field and then he names his daughter Karlo Yastremski at the end of the

820
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,720
movie.

821
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,120
You know, personally, because I'm a man, I mostly remember the hits and the home runs

822
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,360
in that one.

823
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,560
You know? I have a cut of that movie that's just the sports stuff.

824
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,060
Yeah?

825
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,560
No reactions, no story at all. I just watch it like a game.

826
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,360
It's called the 2004 World Series.

827
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,860
Yep.

828
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,360
But with different camera angles.

829
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,660
What a great World Series it was.

830
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,360
Every World Series is great to me, dude.

831
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,160
Yeah?

832
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,860
Yeah.

833
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,360
Yeah.

834
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,660
Even when it's bad?

835
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,960
Even when it's fucking terrible, dude.

836
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,460
Yeah?

837
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,160
I don't think I've ever watched a World Series.

838
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,460
I saw the World Series when I was like four on TV.

839
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
Yeah.

840
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Three or four, no six.

841
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Five, six.

842
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
I just can't care about baseball.

843
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,460
Seven, seven.

844
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
To me, baseball is like a restaurant.

845
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

846
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,460
Sixteen, there you go, too.

847
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
More than a sport.

848
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
No.

849
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Seventeen.

850
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
I think I was eighteen.

851
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
How old?

852
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Nineteen.

853
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
You were twenty-three?

854
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,460
I think I saw the World Series when I turned twenty-one.

855
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
No, that wasn't it.

856
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,460
Twenty-one.

857
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,460
Twenty-one.

858
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
Twenty-one.

859
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Twenty-one.

860
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
Twenty-one.

861
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,460
Twenty-one.

862
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Twenty-one.

863
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Twenty-one.

864
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:19,360
that was funny. I think no, you know, another thing about it, maybe it was when I was one

865
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:29,240
to, I think I could be number three is video games. Yep. I mean, I can attest to this dude.

866
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:36,280
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know boys. Do you know gate like games and there's mostly boys on

867
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:44,100
Roblox boys really like Roblox I know boys do you I said that I just said that

868
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,160
motherfucker Subaru food for you minecraft is almost as good as lesbian

869
00:39:49,160 --> 00:40:00,400
porn took it from number four to number three this game is very addictive and

870
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,300
the kids will play for five to six hours. Yeah game video games.

871
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:10,400
I'm a tomboy and I love roblox. I think they do this all the time.

872
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,500
Not all boys are teenage nerds. Oh falls back into the crowd. This one

873
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,600
says your mom noob and then there's a response. It says seriously, dude.

874
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,100
This game is really fun.

875
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,580
Lots of boys love this game.

876
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,420
Assassins?

877
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,080
Why is--

878
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,700
Minecraft takes away your social life,

879
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,620
family, friends, and sense of reality.

880
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,180
There is no other game that can do it as good as this game.

881
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,740
P.S. This is a cheaper alternative to hard drugs

882
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,460
and will get any child hooked within minutes.

883
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,500
Good luck out there.

884
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
(laughing)

885
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,900
Like, good luck out there at the end

886
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,620
makes it really sinister.

887
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,060
Good luck out there, bud.

888
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,640
Why is girls on this list?

889
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I hate e-girls, they're mean-sidiously.

890
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Siciously, I believe is what they were going for.

891
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Siciously.

892
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
Siciously.

893
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:10,400
I like how, I like, sorry, I just wanted to say I like how on every single one under women

894
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,880
there is always a comment of someone saying "I hate women."

895
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,880
Regardless of what it is, it has nothing to do with it, they're always like "I just hate

896
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
women."

897
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah.

898
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,240
I feel like that's a good indication that women should not be number one.

899
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,320
Number four is one that hits really deeply for me personally and I think maybe you guys

900
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
too.

901
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,720
Number four is music.

902
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,040
Music is so powerful to me.

903
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,900
Yeah, it just changes like the way that, you know, it just like, it changes like silence

904
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
into song.

905
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:47,400
Well, I recently read a study and this is true, I recently read a study that scientists

906
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,920
claim that music can actually change your perspective.

907
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Yeah.

908
00:41:50,920 --> 00:42:00,220
Actually I did a study recently where if I listen to Death Core while I'm washing the

909
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,640
dishes I can nod my head with the music.

910
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,820
That's actually really interesting.

911
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,020
My hypothesis was actually scientifically was in the study.

912
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
That's cool.

913
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:18,940
I recently did a study too to see if I could jack off to S&M by Rihanna and we're waiting

914
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
on the results.

915
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
So you have to grade these things with a curve, they say.

916
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,940
You're doing it now?

917
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,940
Well, we're looking for the results.

918
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
Yeah, you know, the results are still on the way.

919
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
Did you lose those?

920
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
The results are being processed.

921
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
How long has the study been going on?

922
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
It's been going on for about six years now that I've been trying to get the results from

923
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
this.

924
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
And so far it's inconclusive, but there's a lot of hope that this could help people in

925
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,940
dire medical situations.

926
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,940
That sounds like a really intensive study.

927
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
Like it takes up a lot of time.

928
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
Yeah, mostly it takes up a lot of time.

929
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,940
I'm not sure if it's a good thing.

930
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
I mean, I'm not sure if it's a good thing.

931
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
I mean, I'm not sure if it's a good thing.

932
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,060
But there's a lot of hope that this could help people in dire medical situations

933
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,860
That sounds like a really intensive study

934
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,220
Time it takes up tons of time for me

935
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,080
You know, this has become a full-time gig for me is doing this study and I'm gonna be publishing stuff. So watch out

936
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:02,240
Here's a publish in a lot of stuff. So we better watch out. Here's a comment here the iPod shot it onto the list

937
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:10,660
I mean music music was probably not gonna be on this list at all, but then the iPod came out

938
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:15,400
Hello, my people that are crazy. I might get my brother some music for Christmas

939
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:31,660
Some music for Christmas, it's so nice. I mean, here's it that you it's Christmas morning, right?

940
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,580
You get all these stupid shit gifts from Santa Claus,

941
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,260
you got a Nerf gun, a VR headset,

942
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,420
but then your brother hands you one special box,

943
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,140
you open it up, music.

944
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,780
- There's music in there, it changes your whole perspective.

945
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,140
- And it can actually scientifically

946
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,420
change your entire perspective.

947
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,260
- Yeah, it's a thing to look out for.

948
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,100
- It's part of the study.

949
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,460
- Here's the last comment on music, says,

950
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,920
wrong, I put in what do boys like, not what do guys like.

951
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,300
- True.

952
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,100
Here's a comment, I like Biff music and cricket.

953
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm transgender born a girl but moving to be a guy and I love music that's so nice

954
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,940
yeah I like music a lot especially alternative rock and rap I also like

955
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,580
some electronic I don't really care about the others dark boy X

956
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:21,220
whoa we see dark boy X before we did yeah it is a familiar name what top

957
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:29,140
comments is most beautiful thing in the world right now so true that's true

958
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,900
because it's hard to find beauty in this damn messed up world right now.

959
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,660
Until they come out with the next thing after music, it's going to be the most beautiful

960
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,660
for a while.

961
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,580
Yeah, they tried it with tunes for a little bit, but it didn't work.

962
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,500
Before it was music, I think it was like flowers maybe was the most beautiful thing in the

963
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
world.

964
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,580
Yeah, and then they moved on to symphonies and then they found music quite far after

965
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,580
that.

966
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,580
Yes, I believe so.

967
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,580
Yes, I concur.

968
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
Yes.

969
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,120
That was actually part of my study as well that I was doing on the history of beauty

970
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,800
and music and science and history. Yeah I'm working on like a million studies right now.

971
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,840
Yeah I actually was just doing a study about I've been doing this like social experiment study about

972
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,400
like you know if you could like have two friends that like are your best friends and like it's how

973
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,960
that would play out like long term. I'm really into social experiment studies I'm doing one

974
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,520
that's called can you eat a sandwich in the hood and I've been doing that one for a lot of days

975
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,520
recently. How are the results looking on that one?

976
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,520
Uh, kind of nothing so far. I'm kind of waiting for somebody to ask me to leave the hood.

977
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,240
Right. You know, I'm trying to recreate one of those videos where someone does something

978
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,320
crazy and that guy's like, "Can you just please leave the hood if you're going to do this

979
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,160
crap?" Right? Like, we're in the hood right now. Can you not be doing this crap right

980
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,760
now? I actually was conducting a study recently,

981
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,760
um, to see how many times the same guy would come and, uh, pee at the, uh, on the dumpster

982
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,600
outside my window in the same night.

983
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Oh yeah, that guy.

984
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,200
No, it's actually a new different guy and I actually just received the results a few nights

985
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,200
ago and it's two times.

986
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
Oh really?

987
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,200
Is the number of times.

988
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Oh.

989
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Within like 20 minutes.

990
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
That's amazing results.

991
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,480
The same guy came and peed right outside my window.

992
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
I would like to publish those results.

993
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
When I was watching TV.

994
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,080
No, I'll be publishing them myself.

995
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,400
I don't think, I mean you have a history of stealing intellectual property.

996
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,360
I think I might steal that next actually.

997
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,960
You're going to steal intellectual property, the concept of it?

998
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Yeah.

999
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
Oh, that's actually genius dude.

1000
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,800
- That is, oh.

1001
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,000
- You're kinda getting everything.

1002
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,880
- Steal the idea of copyright.

1003
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,840
- Yeah, yeah, you're stealing my intellectual property.

1004
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,080
No, buddy, I own intellectual property.

1005
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,920
- I invented copyright. - I think I get

1006
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,000
all of this crap.

1007
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,840
- Yeah.

1008
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,040
- So, actually, I stole it.

1009
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,520
I stole copyright, I went to the bank where it's held,

1010
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,360
and I stole it.

1011
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,040
- Went to Fort Knox, and I stole copyright.

1012
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,440
- That's true. - Are you jealous?

1013
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,400
- Number five is dogs.

1014
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,060
Dude, I hate dogs so much.

1015
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,720
- Yeah, I like my dog.

1016
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,240
But every other dog if it got cut in half I'd say that's pretty funny.

1017
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Wouldn't care dude.

1018
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,240
Wouldn't care even a little bit.

1019
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,000
I cried when my Labrador died and I'm a man.

1020
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Ironic?

1021
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Not really.

Exactly.

1027
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,960

Excuse me, sex, what are we doing here?

1037
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,060
Kids in general, don't stop talking about sex.

1038
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,260
Go to my school and they act like they're a 20 year old or something.

1039
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,740
You're 12, you're not a adult.

1040
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,100
It makes me laugh, but it's really annoying too.

1041
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,660
You know, I'm with them.

1042
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,660

I'm gonna make it as small as possible.

1053
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,060
It's gonna barely cover your nipples.

1054
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,060
Oh my god.

1055
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,780

1067
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,100

1068
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:53,500
talking about it though. Don't stop talking about it. Though nowadays, everyone is into

1069
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:59,060

1072
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,020
Sex is evil.

1073
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,020
Yep.

1074
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,020
I don't know, I'm 11, Beatles fan 1964.

1075
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,020
(laughter)

1076
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:25,020
There you go, Beatles fans

1077
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,020
got the role.

1078
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,020
The school that I go to, Black Butte,

1079
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,020
the kids do not stop talking about sex.

1080
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,020
It is like you're 10 to 12,

1081
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,020
not 26, and in a girl

1082
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,020
who is 12, and I know what

1083
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,020
it feels like with boys talking about sex,

1084
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:48,980
about it sometimes it scares me this one is terrifying I like sex I want to do it

1085
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:55,080
in real life I know how babies are made and I'm just 10 I want to suck

1086
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:05,080
*laughter*

1087
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,080
Oh, dude.

1088
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,080
*laughter*

1089
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
*sigh*

1090
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
I don't remember being like this when I was a kid.

1091
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
Me neither!

1092
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,080
I liked Master Chief.

1093
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,080
Yeah.

1094
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,080
That was what I was into.

1095
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
*laughter*

1096
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,080
I wanna suck them.

1097
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,080
Does it specify what that could possibly be?

1098
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,080
Yeah.

1099
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,080
Let's do it.

1100
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,080
Number seven, money.

1101
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,080
Yep.

1102
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,080
Hey, heard that.

1103
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,080
Yes sir.

1104
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,080
What's not to like about this crap, right?

1105
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,080
God, I love money, dude.

1106
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
Money is definitely the one to vote for.

1107
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,080
These guys at school are totally in the money.

1108
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,080
I am a girl and a tomboy.

1109
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,080
I think I should know.

1110
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,080
No money on food, no money on girls, no money on telly, no money on games.

1111
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,160
please put on top of the list.

1112
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,820
- I don't trust tomboys, man.

1113
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,980
I think tomboys are girl spies.

1114
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,340
- I trust tomboys.

1115
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,180
- I don't trust tomboys.

1116
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,460
- I know so many guys named Tom.

1117
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,940
So many boys named Tom.

1118
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,380
- I bet you know a lot of boys.

1119
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,940
- Tom, Moshe, all of them.

1120
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,780
- Money is not everything,

1121
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,380
and most people who love money are bratty.

1122
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,220
- True.

1123
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,040
- That's fact.

1124
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,620
- This is the actual order.

1125
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,640
- Most boys who love money are batty.

1126
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,100
- This is the actual order.

1127
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:26,540
Parents, money, food like chicken, sports, video games, clothes, population like being

1128
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:33,220
popular, games, girls didn't make it to the list because most 99% are annoying, 65% are

1129
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,220
ugly.

1130
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,100
Did this kid just flip?

1131
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,620
It wasn't food like chicken, it's food like chicken.

1132
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,580
Did he just flip?

1133
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,580
It's chicken that's food like.

1134
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,140
Parents at number one, dude?

1135
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,140
Yeah, what the hell?

1136
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,140
That's a violation, dude.

1137
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,140
Yeah, not right.

1138
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,540
What the fuck?

1139
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,700
This should be number the first because no money no girl, no money no games, no money

1140
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,840
no cheese, no money no sex, got it?

1141
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Stiles X.

1142
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,860
Stop saying anything about sex, my eyes need bleach so much.

1143
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,480
One of the worst comments on the site.

1144
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,380
Number eight is movies.

1145
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,980
Here's a comment from Beatles fan 1964 who said they were 11 so just keep that in mind

1146
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,980
with this.

1147
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,980
All right.

1148
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:19,380
Particularly the original Star Wars trilogy, Batman movies, and Quentin Tarantino movies.

1149
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,740
I'm a dude and I like movies.

1150
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,500
Is there a more perfect sentence in the universe?

1151
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,900
I'm a dude and even I like movies, man.

1152
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,900
Yes sir.

1153
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,820
Movies are fun.

1154
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,020
They're even more fun if you're sitting next to your crush.

1155
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,420
I hate that actually.

1156
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,420
I hate my crush.

1157
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,420
I hate my crush.

1158
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,420
I hate my crush so much.

1159
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,900
Can you stop looking at my fucking weenie and watch the damn movie dude?

1160
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,900
Stop cutting a tube out of the popcorn.

1161
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,900
Stop cutting a rug in front of me.

1162
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,900
Stop shaking your...

1163
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
The popcorn's falling out of the hole.

1164
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,900
You have to...

1165
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,700
You're supposed to put the hole in before the popcorn.

1166
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,700
This is a disaster.

1167
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,700
What?

1168
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,740
Did you cut this hole in this popcorn so we could eat it some weird freak way?

1169
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,500
Yeah, well I'm not going to put my tongue in that hole if that's what you're trying to

1170
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
get me to do.

1171
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,500
Disgusting.

1172
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,500
You seriously want me to eat popcorn like this?

1173
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
What are you doing dude?

1174
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,500
Ugh.

1175
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:18,200
Crushes are so stupid. Number nine is food. Chez for the win. Chez is my Bible. I eat

1176
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:23,980
Chez. I eat tacos. I like tacos lots. Tacos consist of mixture of meat, salsa, lettuce,

1177
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,820
tomato, and a whole lot of other stuff. I don't think it's a lot other stuff than

00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:33,480
that. Yeah. I think they kind of got all the ingredients. Beatles fan 1964 is here too and

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,560

Sorry takes one to no one and appreciate the male

1199
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,120
Similarity and the secret knowledge of the power of the peen is something any boy

1200
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:24,280
The power of the peen well you don't know the secret knowledge you don't know it I'm

1201
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,720
Yeah, I know the secret knowledge.

1202
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,840
Say the first secret knowledge then.

1203
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:37,040
Ah, you can get a, sometimes you look at the TV, get a strong penis.

1204
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,280
Yep, okay, he knows.

1205
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,280
He's got it.

1206
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,280
That's a first step, right?

1207
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,960
Get some strong penis from watching TV too much.

1208
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,840
Okay, well when you put too much in there, I'm thinking maybe you're starting to deviate

1209
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,200
from what the knowledge is.

1210
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,200
I think you might be.

1211
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Might have been a lucky guess.

1212
00:56:51,200 --> 00:57:08,880
I

1213
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,880
don't think mine is small enough to do that. Mine neither. I haven't done that either. I

1214
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:23,480
was trying to fool you into saying that you have instead. Okay. It's true that boys like

1215
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,760
other boys, but that is called gayness my people. Just no. No. My friends, yes, says

1216
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:44,400
Beatles fan 1964. Wow. I'm bisexual so I can agree with this. It's true. Okay but now read

1217
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,520
a comment. Oh my god, are you guys serious dude? But you really haven't ever tried to

1218
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,120
like fold your skin over your wiener to make it look completely disappeared so it looks

1219
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,600
like you only have your balls there? I don't know that it's ever been a second belly button

1220
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,120
kind of level. Yeah, I don't think like an outie belly button deal but like. Maybe I

1221
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,120
I just have a ton of space. I probably just have a ton of space. I tucked it around the back and made it look like I got it.

1222
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,120
For yours it's probably just big enough that you can do that.

1223
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,120
Yeah, exactly, big enough.

1224
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,120
Yeah, I tucked it around the...

1225
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,120
You have to have a big enough one to do that.

1226
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,120
Exactly, yeah. I tucked it around the back and put it in my butt.

1227
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,120
You put it in your butt?

1228
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,120
Yeah, you don't do that.

1229
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,120
In your butt hole or just your cheeks?

1230
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,120
Just to make, like, if you're wearing tight pants, make them fit better.

1231
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,760
You're tucking your penis?

1232
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
Into my butt.

1233
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,040
You're tucking your...

1234
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,600
Like in the cheeks or the hole?

1235
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
The hole.

1236
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
The hole?

1237
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,680
That's a...

1238
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,680
I've never done that.

1239
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,680
I can't...

1240
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,680
I don't think I can do that.

1241
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,680
I can make it disappear, go other way inside my body.

1242
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,680
Yeah?

1243
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,680
Yeah, maybe.

1244
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,720
It's still going inside.

1245
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,680
You just push it until it touches your bone.

1246
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,680
And then it's pretty hard to go past that.

1247
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
Oh, which bone?

1248
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,320
The bone that's behind your wiener?

1249
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,480
You're touching your bone?

1250
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,480
You push your wiener so far into your body that it touches a bone.

1251
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,480
Like a hip bone?

1252
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,480
Like your pelvis?

1253
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,960
I don't know, whatever bones behind your fucking wiener, I don't know.

1254
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,960
I'm not a doctor.

1255
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,920
Yeah, there's a bone back there, dude.

1256
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,200
Feel right now.

1257
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,600
There's a bone there.

1258
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,040
Dude, I'll push mine in right now.

1259
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,040
Look at this, dude.

1260
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Don't show it.

1261
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,360
It's touching my bone right now.

1262
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,720
I can do it under my pants.

1263
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,520
I'm like an expert at this at this point, dude.

1264
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,840
That's what I would do if somebody, if some sort of villainous monster was like, "I'm

1265
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,600
gonna cut off your penis," I would shoot it.

1266
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,560
Oh, somebody already got to me.

1267
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,920
Yeah, don't make me move my finger, but I don't have one.

1268
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,080
And they go, "I'm sorry."

1269
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,480
And then they move on to you two, and you guys would be like, "Oh, I wish I could hide

1270
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,960
my ginormous penis, 'cause this man's about to cut it off.

1271
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,040
I wish that I had listened to Caleb and practiced for years."

1272
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,640
And then you will be sorry.

1273
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,040
I just noticed Caleb's Zoom name.

1274
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,240
yeah my little brother's account I'm on yep whole family's in the house right

1275
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:09,400
now that's why I'm being mighty quiet I could change it I guess I don't want to

1276
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:20,240
mess this shit up though number 22 it's porn Oh everybody did once right I'm 13

1277
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:28,480
and I still masturbate. Still? Number 31 is the color pink and here's the top comment.

1278
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,360
Pink was actually a boy's color and blue was for girls. Before Adolf Hitler came

1279
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,800
to power, he used pink patches and clothing to label gay and insane men. After the war,

1280
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,760
pink was not considered a boy's color and vice versa the feminine blue. Wow. So

1281
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,640
they're saying this is like a Republicans freed the slaves type situation. Yeah, exactly.

1282
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,080
But pink is actually the boy color.

1283
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,080
Yes.

1284
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,080
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1285
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,200
Uh, boobs is on here.

1286
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,840
Number 34 is destroying things.

1287
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,840
And I'm gonna, all the comments here are so good.

1288
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:04,040
I think that when you destroy things that you feel like you can conquer the world.

1289
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,480
I love to destroying things.

1290
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,960
Am I a tomboy?

1291
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,960
Yep.

1292
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,520
A crushing room would be awesome.

1293
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:16,480
Wait, number 33 is the number 7.

1294
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,720
The first comment is "Just plain lucky."

1295
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:27,960
Internet, popularity, fights.

1296
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,280
I guess that's true.

1297
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,040
I guess guys do like to fight, especially me because I'm amazing at it.

1298
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Strip clubs.

1299
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,680
It's weird that boys like girls dancing on a pile.

1300
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,840
It's mean and very sexist to us girls.

1301
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,540
Number 43 is playing, the comment here is "very good and good".

1302
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:48,880
Number 44 is light, lights are very helpful, lights are awesome.

1303
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,880
Number 49 is glow in the dark.

1304
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,480
Because they are basically with the girl in the dark together.

1305
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
True.

1306
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,480
Oh.

1307
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,640
Number 54 is polygamy.

1308
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,640
For now!

1309
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,760
For now!

1310
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,800
For now!

1311
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,800
For now!

1312
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:11,720
comment from crazy rabbit squid number 55 is parks and someone says some boys just

1313
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,040
love to hang out with their mates in the park and also go down to the local chippy

1314
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:25,520
after number 59 is polygamy I think that's a different thing isn't it

1315
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,640
number 60 says toys and someone says I like them a lot to be honest 23 of these

1316
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,400
are on my bed. Oh wait polygamy is... Yeah it's a different thing. I thought polygamy was the same

1317
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:45,120
thing. It's or it's polygamy is is a man who has multiple wives and then I think polygamy if I'm

1318
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:50,080
correct is just like have is like either gender like having more than one wife or husband like

1319
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:55,440
polygamy is specifically for having wives. Call it whatever you want you're still going to hell.

1320
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,160
That's right.

1321
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,900
Yeah.

1322
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,400
And jail.

1323
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,480
And jail.

1324
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,240
And also Caleb jail, which is my own personal jail that I put freaks into.

1325
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,280
It's basically a hole.

1326
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,400
Uh, yeah.

1327
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,200
And then the last one here is, number 62, swearing.

1328
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,520
Fuck no!

1329
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,400
Come on, man. Are you serious?

1330
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,120
That's how you want to end this fucking thing?

1331
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,240
This thing?

1332
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:16,640
Yep.

1333
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,680
Is with that crap?

1334
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,800
Yeah, you guys better shut your damn mouths.

1335
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:28,440
I push my penis so far back that it touches my ass

1336
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:57,880
say the word as but hold up you that tip of your tongue all right all right bye
