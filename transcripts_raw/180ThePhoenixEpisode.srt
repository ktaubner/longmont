1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,760
- I have, I have something I need to run by you guys.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,600
- What is it?

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,920
- Okay, so I'm thinking of completely rebranding

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,600
my onstage persona.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,440
Okay, do you?

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,420
- All right.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,040
- You guys ready for this?

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,880
- Yeah.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,400
- Okay, so I need to set the stage here.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,000
and can you have the you have the the effects queued up yeah one second okay.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,960
Oh he's got he's fidgeting with this thing. I think it's not it doesn't I'm

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,040
gonna be the country's number one gross out comedian.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,080
Okay, can you can you and I will operate? What does that mean? You just do the

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,280
effects real quick. Okay, so imagine okay. Imagine my voice is deeper. It's

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,720
not that much. Imagine my voice is for a little bit. He said a little bit a

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,800
couple of semitones.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,200
What do you say? A couple of semitones a little bit deeper. So imagine

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,120
Madison Square Garden sold out, sold out one night only. Okay, only one night

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,600
sold out. One night sold out. It's all I could afford. He's making his voice

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
deeper, not like just yeah, you are. No, well, okay, because that's what I sound

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:29,960
now. Okay. Because it's I'm rebranded. Okay. So I go out. I'm in a trash can, arms and legs

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:47,200
out of a metal trash can and I have the trash can hat. Right? I hit the okay. That would

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,740
should be okay. Wait, that's just that's just the beginning. We ought to keep

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,640
going nasty P. That's just the beginning. So then okay, so clap again. We have a

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,720
five in the audience and then the audience is like

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,760
what time is it? It's

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:15,220
I'm nasty mother fucking P yo yo nasty P nasty be over here over here over here

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,260
And then I take out the sludge cannon and I'm spraying the front row.

30
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm spraying the front row.

31
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,060
Spraying the front row with trash, water, and juices and stuff.

32
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,660
It's literally, it's like, so you know, like all the trash that they have at Madison Square

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,380
Garden, like they're having like all like, it's like hot dog bits and like popcorn and

34
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,020
like beer and stuff.

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,020
My underwear.

36
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,820
man, I'm spraying the whole front row and I'm like it's time to get nasty

37
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,520
hit the air warm

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,420
nasty mother fucking

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,420
but I have a big long beard that has a lollipop stuck in it. Listen. I don't

40
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,520
this feels I like it. Okay. I like it, but it does

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,320
and I don't wash my

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,620
no, I heard the wash. I heard that you do not wash your eyes. We heard that

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,040
so it's the first thing that you said. The only time I shower is when it

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,420
rain.

45
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,280
That's not a shower

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,300
sitting in the water. Maybe you should say like when it rains. I don't go

47
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,020
outside, so I don't show when it rains. I avoid the rain rain because it's

48
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,640
technically a shower to me. The only time I see soap is when I'm

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,320
there. We get

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,360
that's a better kind of see. That's what I was going to say. You've already

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,460
I've gotten into it, but I was feeling like this was very much style over

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,020
substance, but I want to hear the writing. I want to hear like the

53
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,740
crowd. All I have all I have so far is the two great two great ones right

54
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,700
there. Yeah, that was good. You know you need more stuff like that. You know

55
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,720
you need to

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,780
red fox. You gotta wash your ass. I'm saying you don't gotta wash your ass.

57
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,540
Yeah, my ass is like a cast iron pan. Okay. Yes, that's good.

58
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,880
And then would you have a sidekick? Maybe. And how much time? My opener.

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:22,020
My opener is the clean brothers. Clean Caleb and clean Cameron. And then we

60
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,780
would come out and we'd be the clean brothers? Okay, so we come out and we're

61
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,340
the clean brothers.

62
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
Okay, okay.

63
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
We're squeaky clean!

64
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,340
Oh beep beep beep beep beep.

65
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
That's me walking.

66
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
This is me cleaning myself.

67
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
I don't fuck with the...

68
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
This is too much fuck.

69
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
I don't fuck with the Clean Brothers, even though they're my openers.

70
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
Wee wee wee!

71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,340
I'm sliding across the stage.

72
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
Wee!

73
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,340
But why are you out during the opener?

74
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
You should be backstage waiting.

75
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
Oh, this is when I bring you guys out at the end.

76
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,340
Why would you bring...

77
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Wait, so you're our opener?

78
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,340
We shake hands and we drop the characters and we're like, "Oh, we're the clean brothers.

79
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
We're the clean brothers."

80
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
We're the clean brothers.

81
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
We're the clean brothers.

82
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,340
We're the clean brothers.

83
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
We're the clean brothers.

84
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
We're the clean brothers.

85
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
I bring you guys out at the end.

86
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Why would you bring...

87
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,340
Wait, so you're our opener.

88
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,340
We shake hands and we drop the characters and we're like shaking hands.

89
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
We're just like, "Oh, great show, you guys."

90
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
And then we wash our hands.

91
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,340
We all do a bow and then wave to everybody goodnight.

92
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
So it doesn't really seem like we're your openers

93
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
and it really seems like we are a...

94
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
You're part of the show.

95
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
...a 30... like a splitting time.

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
We're double headlining.

97
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
Yeah.

98
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,340
So how is the money going to get broken down, I guess?

99
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,340
Because we're doing 30 minutes, I'm guessing.

100
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Yeah, but then you split that up amongst yourselves.

101
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,340
we are a little more than thirty minutes, because we because we and we because we

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,940
come out of the and you got it's more like five minutes. I feel a little

103
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,360
shitty about that then, because I feel like hey, you know who feels really

104
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,140
shitty, probably your nasty. Yeah, see I'm already getting sick and tired of

105
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,540
this. This is going to be a really, really tough. What do you mean? I think

106
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,800
that if we're splitting the money and you you're saying we split it in half

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,020
one one section for each act, but then me and him have to split our half. I

108
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,740
don't think that's fair, because I think I'm looking into the audience. Most of

109
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,060
these people are clean. Yeah, there's no very few people. They're getting nasty

110
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,580
from the spray. That's your fault. Yeah, but who's the how are they showing up

111
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,160
exactly? What show? No, they're clean. You leave nasty and they're wearing

112
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,900
shirt. They're my they're wearing is white tie dye t shirts that are no no

113
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,680
no. They're wearing they're wearing the clean brothers. Exactly. The

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,240
understated t shirt shows like going to a war concert. It's a split audience.

115
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
Some people are there. Some people are like I like the so why are we splitting

116
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,120
money. Oh, then we'll figure that out. So can we go thirds? Yeah,

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,700
we'll do it in thirds. Okay. Okay. So what about

118
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,240
what about 75% for the clean brothers and 25% for you? That's not how

119
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,760
it works. Well, you already said yes to thirds, so why not say yes to

120
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,160
thirds? We have a crew we need to pay. Okay, okay. Exactly. We have

121
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
twice the production budget. Yeah. You guys,

122
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,500
the fact that all you guys are talking about is the money and not

123
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,420
the art right now is really starting to piss me off. 'Cause the art's

124
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,680
already... We've got the art down. 'Cause we mastered the art. Yeah, we

125
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,020
don't need to worry about the art anymore. We don't care about... But the

126
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,800
the only art that you guys have is that you're the opposite of nasty P. You are

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,480
the opposite of the clean. We actually came first. Yeah, come for we were a

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,560
weekend up in the sand. We did nasty P. We have there's a bunch of vinyl

129
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,020
records of the clean brothers at

130
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,620
in the bathroom

131
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,880
the clean brothers. There's a lot of brothers alive from their song wash.

132
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,220
There is a novelty record called wash your hands. Yeah, yeah, your hand

133
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,900
brothers and you got inspired by that. You did a parody version. It's like

134
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,700
weird out going on tour with Coolio.

135
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,100
Yeah.

136
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,500
Okay.

137
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,900
Coolio is taking the money because he's the bigger artist.

138
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,220
It's how Eat It was bigger than Beat It.

139
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,900
I don't think that is true.

140
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,620
Yeah, it's true.

141
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,060
No, I really don't think so.

142
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,820
I think more people have heard...

143
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,340
You think more people have heard Eat It than a Michael Jackson song?

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,980
Yeah.

145
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,020
I don't think so.

146
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,220
All right.

147
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,660
You can say that all you want.

148
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,340
You're just trying to make up for the Clean Brothers not selling as well as Nasty Petey.

149
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,020
The Clean Brothers, by the way...

150
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,900
We clean up.

151
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,780
Yeah, that's right.

152
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,220
And nobody dirty.

153
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,660
and you know where you've never been on the Ellen DeGeneres show. In the shower!

154
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,060
Okay, why are you doing the... you're always on. You're doing the character and you're

155
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,820
not even on stage. Yeah, because it's inspired a lot by my real life. You don't

156
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,780
wash your ass? I don't wash my ass, I don't flush the toilet, I don't wash my

157
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,580
hands after I pee sitting down. You don't have to. But you pee sitting down. I pee

158
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,580
sitting down just in case I have to poop. Okay, so you're like a gay, dirty guy. Yeah.

159
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,840
and you in case I have to poop by sitting down, bro is not bro is not about that.

160
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,420
He doesn't want it to splash around his bathroom because he's secretly clean.

161
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,940
See that's why it's down. If we don't split the money the way I was saying

162
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,680
earlier, which I think was ninety ten.

163
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,940
If we don't put the money that way, we will be leaking. We're going to walk

164
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,380
New York Post, the second oldest publication in America, by the way,

165
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,920
that's still really the New York. What's the oldest one?

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,980
The Bible, New York Times, New York Times, Ripley's, believe it or not,

167
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
the New York

168
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,380
the New York Post. We will be leaking to the New York Post that you are

169
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,880
actually clean. Well, I can I can just say that. Yeah, of course, I'm not

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,940
nasty all the time. Okay, well, there goes your idea. There goes all the

171
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,900
nasty hillbillies with banana peels on their head. Do you think that Gallagher

172
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,900
goes home? Gallagher smashes a watermelon in his house. Yeah, he has to

173
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,660
practice right now. You just walk out and do that. He goes to it. He goes to

174
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,780
the he goes to the practice hall that he has on his mansion yard. That's his

175
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,620
house. You think he has like to yard his man to yard is like that big white room

176
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,320
from the dark night yeah, but just different just

177
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,080
he has an Alfred yeah, he has a he has a lucius yeah he's developing some new

178
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,480
unethical watermelon in his lucius like if you're going to keep smashing this

179
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,860
watermelon like I'm walking yeah, you finish that, but like I'm not yeah, I

180
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,280
will not be here. I'm going to get fired okay for what I these hammers that I'm

181
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,300
giving you these big now

182
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:39,300
it. Yeah, all right. So right, I mean we had to get that out of the way. I have

183
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,660
an idea, too, that I can. I just wanted to address the obvious in the room. I

184
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,660
don't think that was obvious. You just I mean, okay, it was yeah. I'll be I was

185
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,260
obvious. Yeah, yeah, just the obvious. It's gone. Okay, nasty pee.

186
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,700
no, it's gone. Oh, that I see. I even forgot about it. Yeah, yeah,

187
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,220
we'll address that on Wednesday. That's yep. That won't be addressed today.

188
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,700
Yeah, we're not even gonna talk about that. And you know what? And I can't

189
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,300
talk about it without getting emotional. Yeah, so we're not gonna talk about

190
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,060
it. It's gone. The J. A. R. Yeah, it's gone from J. R. E. So

191
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,060
and that's what we're calling the show now. That's another. This is the

192
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,620
episode is all about rebranding rebirth. This is the this is called our Phoenix

193
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,780
episode. Okay, this is called our okay. That's the episode. All right, our

194
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,980
Phoenix, our Phoenix, our Phoenix episode. Yeah, because we're rising from

195
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,340
the ashes and we're starting everything over. Yeah, is what this is about. We're

196
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,020
starting the starting back at episode number one. Yeah, the numbering will

197
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,020
reset. We've probably done this.

198
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,980
We've probably done this twelve or fifteen times. Episode one, our

199
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,020
Phoenix episode. This is like the new 52, the comic books thing. Yeah,

200
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,340
and we have new characters now. That is such a good name,

201
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,100
the new 52. The new 52, because it rhymes? Yeah. Yeah, I bet they were...

202
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,940
I don't know if I ever understood that. Is it 52? It's 52 because they

203
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,980
had 52 series that they were rebooting and they got rid of a bunch of

204
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,660
stuff. It's so obvious to me. But it's so... I bet that they maybe had

205
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,460
50 or 51 and they were like, "Two more. We need to get another.

206
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,760
that we need to come up with another thing. Nifty fifty would have been good.

207
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,060
The

208
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,600
nifty

209
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,400
three fifty three that would have not been good for business, but you can

210
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,420
core fifty four that would have been good. The

211
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,620
these are the core. This is the new Canon, the new core. The

212
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,620
six fifty six. The six fifty six, that's the best one. The heavenly fifty seven.

213
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,940
the great heavenly fifty seven yeah, the fine fifty nine yeah that's yeah the

214
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,160
fifty and now the risky sixty. Okay, I'll get so risky, so you're pushing

215
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,020
over fifty now yeah. The thing is, if I had if somebody told me come up with

216
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,060
fifty two ideas for comics, I would know where I even start honestly. I would I

217
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,940
would do exactly I would it would because I if they somebody told me to

218
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,140
come up with fifty two ideas for superior comics, I'd be like Superman,

219
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,860
Batman,

220
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,540
well, I would do what I would do what they actually do now wonder what I would

221
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,980
come up with one and then I would be like but okay that one, but it's a girl

222
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,700
or it's an old man.

223
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,240
If you were to tell somebody to come up with an entirely new superhero,

224
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,060
I think at some point they would accidentally just make the flash again.

225
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,220
They would just that's the obvious super yeah.

226
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,460
Have I ever told you that no I came up with black. I called him black cat,

227
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,620
but it was do you remember book protectors? Yeah, I would had a black

228
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,720
one and I would put it over my head and I would run around my house and

229
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,780
punch my brothers and say, really like that. I had a green one. I put it

230
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,800
on my head. I said I was a goblin. I look just like black. That was it

231
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,520
was a great man. Yeah, I wish I haven't seen. I know I put it on

232
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,420
my head like like so it would be two point. Oh, I goblin. I put it

233
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,380
over my entire face and then the corners of it would poke out. Yeah,

234
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,740
see I had the corners, but they were goblin ears on. I was like one

235
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,260
four years old. Goblin ears are much bigger than cat ears, so it doesn't

236
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,480
sell very well as a goblin. When I was four years old I came up with a superhero called

237
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,200
Moat Man and his power was that, I don't know where it came from, all I know is that his

238
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:27,640
power was that he would ride the vacuum. His power was that he could ride the vacuum and

239
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,560
that was like his steed. When I was a kid I got addicted to the smell that came out

240
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,640
of the vacuum when it was on. Oh, yeah, my face in the exhaust and just smell it. And

241
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,160
my grandpa would say, what are you doing? And I'd say, I'm looking for something. I have

242
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,440
corn in the microwave. I'm thinking about it right now. I know that smell. It's right

243
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,400
or the dryer vent on the side of the house. Yeah, next to it. Get that. That's that smell.

244
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,200
hot air smell is so good. I love hot air. I still sometimes I'll use my wife's

245
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,800
blow dryer. When I get out of the shower, I'll blow it directly into my face.

246
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Yeah, I'm not kidding. You should grow out one hair. I use the blow dryer more

247
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,840
than she does. You should grow out one hair and just blow dry that one. And

248
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,200
comb it and twirl it. You just want me to look like a big baby. I want you to

249
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,280
look like Mr. Saturn. Yeah, I'm not going to do that. I just won't do that.

250
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,240
That's below me. Standing in front of air is so awesome. If it's either a fan

251
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,860
he would he would call a big if it's hot out you like cold air. No yeah, I hate

252
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,880
wind you not wind, though, like a fan or an AC shut up when you're in a crowded

253
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,140
hot room and you stand for the AC. You take all the air and I don't go in a

254
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,120
crowded hot room. Yeah, you do I go in front of the AC. I just rip ass in front

255
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,680
of it. Why would you do that? Because I'm nasty P mother? No,

256
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,220
no, I would squeaky clean you if I told you if I got into a car accident,

257
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,300
everybody in my family died and everybody who's really close to me died,

258
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,960
but I survived, but I was really, really like could barely move any part of

259
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,220
my body. Would you guys bathe me now? Bathe you yeah, like with a sponge, I

260
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,700
think you wouldn't you wouldn't be bathed because in this situation, I'm

261
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,440
trying to get pussy

262
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,820
are you you're only your head works. Yeah, I'm just a head base. If I was

263
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,980
just ahead. Would you babe me like a bowling ball

264
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,980
if I was only ahead? I guess so, because that's I'm not going to be like having

265
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,760
a rub on your dick or anything. I would not. If I was just ahead, you would be I

266
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,420
would get a restraining order against you because you would be you would be

267
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,380
doing crazy stuff with me and I'd be

268
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,820
never age and right now when you do stuff like that, I punch you, but if you

269
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,180
did it

270
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,720
like if you did it and I was ahead, I would have no arms to punch. No recourse,

271
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,860
no recourse whatsoever. You would you would like because you'd be so afraid

272
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,900
of like me pranking you.

273
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,300
Why would you prank me if I was a head, but I know that you would you would

274
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,340
like you would put him in a plastic bag and throw him out of the window. I

275
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,820
would put him in the freezer and then open up the like keep opening up the

276
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,620
freezer and go, oh,

277
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,740
yeah, doing a different face every time you open the freezer, but that we need

278
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,100
to entertain you. One day, if anything, he only play with you, I would do with

279
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,140
I know that's and I don't want to be played with.

280
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
But it would be to entertain you.

281
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Here's what I want you to do.

282
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Click next Tarantino movie because I'm sitting on the couch watching them all.

283
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:31,140
What would happen is that you would be so afraid of getting put in the fridge and stuff like that,

284
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,140
you would look exactly like that spider from Toy Story.

285
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,140
I would build you a body out of Tinker Toys.

286
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
You know what I'm talking about?

287
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
That little spider with the claw?

288
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
You know the spider from Toy Story?

289
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,240
Is there a toy story fan child child? I'm not a child baby. Actually adult who

290
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,740
likes childish movies. I'm grown childish adult, but I'm pulling a memory

291
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,240
from childhood. Hey, Pixar, Pixar. Here's a message to you.

292
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Start making good movies again.

293
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,840
Start this year when I when I was like in Oakland because those movies are

294
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,740
yeah now. I don't want to see in Conto. I see the trailer even and I don't

295
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,420
I want to see Rigardo. I like to watch

296
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,980
Rigardo.

297
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,540
Yeah, that's one of the movies they make.

298
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:19,980
Okay.

299
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,860
I don't want to see big hero scenes.

300
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,660
I usually, I watch a movie trailer and that to me is like a

301
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,900
full movie.

302
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,420
Yeah.

303
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,940
In itself. I love the music. I like the words that pop up on

304
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,460
the screen.

305
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:29,740
Yeah, me too.

306
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,940
I like to see when it says, "This Christmas," stuff like

307
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,660
that. I get full enjoyment, even if I'll never see the movie.

308
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,060
But Pixar, your trailers...

309
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,380
They're trash, brother.

310
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,580
They've become trash.

311
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:38,940
Yeah.

312
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,820
The last good Pixar trailer, Cars 3.

313
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,640
because when cars died, oh, he didn't die, but he got hurt. He

314
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,000
got badly, really, really badly. Do trailers like that for the other characters?

315
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,340
All I want to see is like you're bloody to a pole. I want to

316
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,120
see Buzz Lightyear get in a street fight and get one punch

317
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,060
kill street beefs. Buzz Lightyear. Yes, that's what I want to see.

318
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,680
I do not want to see him in a different dimension that they did

319
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,860
bugs. Lightyear. When I was in, I was in Emeryville last summer,

320
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:21,980
I kept seeing people going up to the skate park where my girlfriend was staying, close

321
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,500
enough to this one skate park that is next to the Pixar building.

322
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,500
And apparently, huge problem the Pixar people have, because the Pixar campus is shut down,

323
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,540
you can't visit it because of COVID precautions.

324
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,220
I think it's just because they don't want people like...

325
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Buzz Lightyear has COVID.

326
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,700
Yeah, Buzz Lightyear had COVID last summer and it was crazy.

327
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,240
What kind of bullshit is that? But there is a huge problem. He's from space,

328
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,560
so he doesn't have the same immune system as us. That's not true.

329
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,040
It's like when you go to a foreign country and you don't have resistance

330
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,420
to their germs. People come to us... You realize that we are the new Daily

331
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,980
Show and people come to us for their news and you say shit like that.

332
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,160
My idea that I said earlier that we didn't get into was about news.

333
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,620
Okay. Wait, let him tell his story and then I'm gonna get into your idea.

334
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,340
But a huge problem on the Pixar campus is that people keep walking,

335
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,860
trying to walk past the security guard to go look, 'cause they have a

336
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:17,340
big like they have the the lamp and the ball in the front of the place. Oh,

337
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,260
the lamp and the ball. Yeah. People keep trying to like walk and go like look at

338
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,220
it on the campus, but like you're not allowed to. You're not allowed. That's

339
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,580
gotta be one of the worst stories you've ever told. Yeah. I'm sorry. I took a

340
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,860
Claritin earlier and it's kicking in right now. That was crazy. That was so

341
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,240
much set up. Don't let you

342
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,960
every single day. I'd see a new person try and get past and be like it was

343
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,720
worth a shot

344
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,840
and I don't know. I'm Jesus Christ.

345
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,640
This is not enough caffeine. That's okay. You did nasty. You did nasty pee.

346
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,240
I did nasty pee. So you're still up. You're still way up. Yeah. Okay. Tell

347
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,440
me what your idea is. So let me pitch this to you. I'm literally like I feel

348
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
feels like I'm in a different dimension from Clareton. Yeah, you are that

349
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,820
allergic to the allergy medicine. I took to Benadryl last night, so I'm still

350
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,400
like you got to get on Zertek bro. I got to get back on Zertek. You need to

351
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,320
get on the shot. Fire ass pill.

352
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh, what was your news idea? So the news everybody you ask anybody nowadays and

353
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,000
they will tell you the news is stressful as fuck. Let's ask him. Does the new

354
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
stress you out? I can't watch it. It's stressful right yeah, because it's like

355
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,840
every day, Ukraine, Russia, nuclear warfare, to learn what new crane is new

356
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,600
diseases,

357
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Donald Trump rising back up like a villain in a movie, all the speaking of

358
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,280
our Phoenix, speaking of a Phoenix, yeah, the dark Phoenix,

359
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,400
Lord yeah, but it's stressful because all this all this shit just keeps

360
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,120
happening. It's like twenty sixteen never ended shit just keeps going on and so

361
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,160
my pitch for a new news network or maybe even just a segment and then in new

362
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,160
news network. That's good, so maybe we can use that, but it's

363
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,100
maybe instead of saying all the crazy scary things that are happening. Maybe

364
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,700
they report the stuff that isn't happening so that you don't get stressed

365
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,440
out. So, for example, you turn on the news and it would be like breaking news.

366
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,000
China is not at war with Canada,

367
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,700
and it would be and they're like and also Canada is not at war with Mexico

368
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,040
and they can maybe they could do every country that's in every news new. This

369
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,240
is stop. I'm pitching my idea. If I brought you into if I brought listen,

370
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,180
if I brought you into

371
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,760
the pitch meeting, I was CNN later today. Yeah, I would lose the pitch

372
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
because of that yeah. Okay, I would have lost my show your details for the

373
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,960
end yeah the notes, but basically there would be one hour that's all about

374
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,500
different wars that aren't happening. Then they would do like this celebrity

375
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,240
is alive. Okay, now it's guy like that all the celebrities that are alive

376
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,260
and their birthdays and their birthdays yeah yeah well, but but they wouldn't

377
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,060
mention the celebrities if it was their birthday, because even that can be

378
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,100
stressful, because it's like oh my God, what I get

379
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,260
to get them, but also it's like okay, it's quite a Tarantino's birthday,

380
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,660
everyday movie day. He's another year closer to death. You're right. I don't

381
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,540
want to know how old Brad Pitt is yeah. If I find out how old Brad Pitt is, I'm

382
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,940
sure I would exactly it was his birthday today.

383
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,420
I'd have to like I'd have to get him a a fucking Walgreens toy. Yeah,

384
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,820
I was

385
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,060
I'd rather just not even know yeah,

386
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,660
well, thank God it's on the eighteenth of

387
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,220
they could be like a new store has not opened up in this location and

388
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,500
well, that's not good news. We like it's not about good news. It's about

389
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,740
things that aren't happening, so you don't have to worry about anything

390
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,540
changing. Okay, so I was

391
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,800
I was going to say

392
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,780
four ends, new news network. So I was going to say four ends, nice new news

393
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,360
network, but it's not really nice. It's not it's the new neutral. It's a bit

394
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,720
yeah, it's neutral. It's not a news.

395
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,400
The new nothing news network where just we tell you when something doesn't

396
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,660
happen. Exactly right. Yeah, there's no asteroid headed towards earth. Exactly,

397
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,260
exactly. You know, that's exactly what it would be. There is no science, no

398
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,980
new recipes. There's no there's not a recipe. There is no new recipe has been

399
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,200
invented. No new food is one of the new recipes. If you want a new recipe, go

400
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,080
watch CNN. Exactly, exactly. The cooking news network. Go watch the Food Network

401
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,240
if you want a new. Don't come to the quadruple in network or the quad, the

402
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,760
quadruple, the triple in network. Yeah, yeah, because we are. Fortunately, we

403
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,020
have to issue a retraction. A new recipe was just discovered today. You can't

404
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,080
issue and that's the great part. You can't issue a recatch. We're not

405
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,400
issued any retraction. We would like to issue no retractions for that's not

406
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,040
what I got. I don't think that's when there was yeah, it's not what they

407
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,880
basically the more I think about it. It is opposite. It should be you know

408
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,920
instead of the news, it's called the olds

409
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,840
wow, so it's in on

410
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,560
non the nothing, but nothing

411
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,800
but it's also it's not really the old, so it's the new

412
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,520
it's something that didn't have network. Yeah, what's in between new and old

413
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,360
present now it'd be called the present. It's not that either. No, I think it's

414
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,560
still news. I think it's breaking news that nothing happened. That's the

415
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,560
because we're still I mean we're not, we're still hiring like anchors from

416
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,280
other networks and stuff like we're not building a whole new thing. Can we get

417
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,080
less? We're definitely have Lester whole Anderson Cooper. We're gonna have

418
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,600
basically everybody. So these people are trained to deliver news and not this new

419
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,080
type of it's going to take so there's well they're still going to be doing

420
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,660
like breaking news. Yes, like and yeah, be really excited and like there's

421
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,360
going to be a lot of flashing lights on the screen and a ticker and are we

422
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,720
going to do for what screens sports is hard because they have to do a sport

423
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,040
that nobody plays. So maybe they do like nobody played the Mayan ball game.

424
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,900
Yeah, no one's played the mind ball ranking fifteen hundred. You nobody got

425
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,420
injured in a game that didn't happen today.

426
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,440
nobody is out in that weird Mayan head game that nobody plays anymore. Yeah,

427
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,700
wow, and the weather is not happening. Literally, I'm going to be like Logan

428
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,440
Roy. Yeah, that's good. He died.

429
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,740
You haven't seen it yet.

430
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,440
You haven't seen that yet.

431
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,040
He died.

432
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,440
Yeah, that's right.

433
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
so

434
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,940
spoilers on this episode.

435
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,340
That's our new thing. That's another Phoenix thing. That's another thing

436
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,240
that we're these. We spoil movies. We spoil TV. I feel like we've been always

437
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,640
been. We always

438
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,040
spoil, but we're like it. We're turning it to a we're going to watch stuff.

439
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Just is going to be that we've never even seen. I'm going to watch. I'm

440
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,240
going to watch. What's a fucking show that's on TV succession. I already

441
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,040
did that. I'm going to watch the bear. Yeah. Yeah, and I'm going to say

442
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,600
I've never seen anything in that. That's a perfect old show. Nothing happens in

443
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,420
that show. Yeah, that would be they would also air Seinfeld. Wow

444
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,640
wow

445
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,240
that's all about nothing happening. Yeah, nothing happens in that bloody show. I

446
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,380
don't know why people watched it

447
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,420
actually stuff happens. The more I think about it now, a lot of stuff

448
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,740
actually happens in that show. Oh, it's a show about nothing. There is so much

449
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:39,140
shit happening. There is so much right under the wire. The four words

450
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,540
Oh, I'm just doing nothing.

451
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,440
Yep, just barely doing it. Basically sounded like you were yawning.

452
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,140
And he liked it.

453
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,540
Yeah.

454
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,440
Look at how much he liked it.

455
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
He's giggling like a little giggle bear.

456
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,640
Oh, man.

457
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,740
I would like to make an actual show about nothing.

458
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,340
Yeah.

459
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,740
And it would be called, you know what it would be called?

460
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,340
White screen.

461
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,940
No, no, no, it would be the opposite. It would be called, "What I Think Happens When You Die."

462
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
Whoa.

463
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,640
Yeah, and it would be...

464
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,840
An atheist perspective.

465
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,340
It would be called, "What Happens to Atheists When They Die."

466
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:06,540
Yeah.

467
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,500
And then I have a sister show a spin off like a better call Saul called what

468
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,140
happens to Christians when they die. And then I would have another spin off. So

469
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,780
I would have a fat man. What happens to me when I die and it's and you're a king

470
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,740
on and it would be me. It'd be me killing all the characters from the

471
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,500
second show. Yeah, and I'm giant. I'm 50 ft tall slicing them up with samurai

472
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,020
swords. I I got I'm very excited. It's being of shows there. I don't know if

473
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,060
you guys saw this. They're doing a season two of prehistoric planet. No,

474
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,460
the dinosaurs show. Oh, that one that all cgi one that's on apple tv.

475
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,580
Well, here's the spoiler.

476
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,540
We're

477
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,780
real. I'm very excited about it because of it's about dinosaurs, which are

478
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,060
cool, but I'm also very excited because in the first season they showed and

479
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,660
showed to t rexes fucking. They showed a bunch of dinosaur pussies shooting out

480
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,500
eggs. They showed they showed dinosaur poop and a dinosaur eating poop or

481
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,540
something right and that's all in the first season ramp it up. I'm nasty

482
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,140
season two.

483
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,220
they're going to have to like, you know, they're going to have to wrap it up.

484
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,940
Exactly. What's good? What's it going to be? Yeah. Yeah, dude, they're going to

485
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,340
show

486
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,540
they're going to make it's going to be like that one porn angle where it's

487
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,460
behind the balls.

488
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,900
They literally, yeah, they did. They did T-rex is fucking doggy style. They did

489
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,780
diesel. They poop. They did what else? They're going to they're going to make a

490
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,180
hyper realistic version of walk the dinosaur. Yeah. You remember that one? I

491
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,980
I remember the song. No, no, the

492
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,140
it was on LOL Shock. The Shock website. I don't remember that one. That was on

493
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,300
there. That one did not deserve to be on there. It's a 3D animated thing of

494
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,820
two dinosaurs 69ing. That's on YouTube. You can look that one up. Yeah, that's

495
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,460
not really pornographic. It's not pornographic unless you're into dinosaurs.

496
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,420
Unless you are a dinosaur. Unless you're scared of dinosaurs. Yeah. If you're

497
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,540
really scared of dinosaurs, do not watch Walk the Dinosaur.FLV. Are you guys

498
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,800
scared of alligators? Yeah. I don't get, I'm not scared of them. Why not? I don't

499
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,880
know. Is it because you live where they aren't? You know what I don't trust

500
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,300
about alligators? No, I used to live where they were, but I think, but I

501
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,340
didn't, I didn't see them that often. Maybe that's why you're not scared of

502
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,220
them. But you never once want to see them on the street. When we went to

503
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,020
alligator adventure. Yeah, that was so fun. That was awesome. That was sick,

504
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,660
but I don't trust alligators because they sit there and they let that, like...

505
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,660
They open their mouth. This Pepsi is making me burpy.

506
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,980
they open their mouth and they just leave it open. They have that like trap door

507
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,740
thing on their mouth. Yeah, it just goes like they like close your throat, their

508
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,980
throat. They close their yeah, I don't trust that one bit exactly. Yeah,

509
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,220
because that looks like a perfect seat. I guess I'm more scared of crocodiles

510
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,060
though than alligators. Well, of course, yeah, obviously, I think there's

511
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,140
something reasoned with yeah, crocodiles have no crocodiles are robots. Yeah,

512
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,380
they're robotic crocodile. Which ones do you feed a leg of raw chicken to? You

513
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,780
I feed either of them or leg. Crocodiles are bigger, though, and more

514
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,140
aggressive. I think I can reason with both of them.

515
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,100
No, crocodiles will eat a human. Really?

516
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,700
And alligators probably won't. Alligators will run around, though.

517
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,660
Well, we saw that giant crocodile. Crocodiles will run around, too,

518
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,780
though. But I mean, alligator will... But you won't see that many

519
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,020
crocodiles. You're probably more likely to see an alligator if you're like

520
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,700
them. Yeah, in North America, for sure. You know what I found out one

521
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,500
time, speaking of just amphibians, reptiles and stuff? My dad, afraid of a

522
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,900
frog afraid of a frog. I want a specific frog. I one time my dad left he left the

523
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,600
shop vac out on the porch growing up. He left the shop vac out

524
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,300
rained. He didn't touch it for a couple days and then he was like, all right, I

525
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,400
gotta move that. Then there was a frog inside the shop vac and my dad asked me

526
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,900
to go and and dump the shop vac out because he was afraid of the frog. Yeah,

527
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,740
and I was like, "Are you fucking kidding me?"

528
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,580
- Are you daft?

529
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
- "You're my father."

530
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,420
- Are you daft, Kyle?

531
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,620
- "You were my father and you were afraid

532
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,420
"of a tiny little frog right now."

533
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,260
- Yeah.

534
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,420
- And that's the day that I started calling him a bitch

535
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,340
and I started slapping, slap boxing him.

536
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,860
(laughing)

537
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,620
- There was a hurricane that happened in North Carolina.

538
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,020
I think it was Fran, one of these 90s hurricanes.

539
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,860
And my dad--

540
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,820
- One of these 90s hurricanes with names like Fran.

541
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,140
(laughing)

542
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,980
- Daria, Hurricane Daria.

543
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,680
I

544
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,680
whatever happened to a good old fashioned hurricane named Herbert.

545
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,280
Yeah, exactly. Now, the Jersey's George.

546
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,080
Now, what about Hurricane Lucille? Yeah, come on. Nowadays, you got

547
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Hurricane Hayden. Yeah, Hurricane Braden, Hurricane Caden, Hurricane

548
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,980
Sox, Tungsten. Exactly. It's fucked up. Hurricane Tungsten. Tungsten.

549
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,380
That one is scary. That would be scary because Tungsten is a type

550
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,880
of metal. I'm really glad they've never named a hurricane. Hurricane

551
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,280
destroyer. A bullet is headed straight for Florida is tungsten is a metal. Yeah,

552
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,480
but I one of these ones, one of these 90 style hurricanes like Fran was coming

553
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,760
through North Carolina. My dad really smart guy left the door open overnight

554
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,480
and well good, because then there wouldn't be any back draft. That's

555
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,680
probably what he was thinking. He was like, I'm gonna save on air condition,

556
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,440
but then there was 100,000 million frogs in our house when we woke up and we

557
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,120
had to call some guy to come kill all the frogs. Wow, yeah, and I think he

558
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,080
I literally just used a shop vac and just vacuumed up just hundreds and hundreds of frogs.

559
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,480
Watching my dad afraid of a frog is like the...

560
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

561
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,320
That is one of the craziest moments of my life.

562
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
No reptiles scare me.

563
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Reptiles do not scare...

564
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm scared of bugs.

565
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
I hate bugs.

566
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
I never want to see a bug as long as I live.

567
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,560
I was afraid of bugs because I knew a cheap bug would have a trouble eating me.

568
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,240
I guess I'm kind of scared of snakes.

569
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,080
Not in the sense of like if I saw it, I'm scared, but like I don't want to deal with

570
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
one.

571
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Yeah.

572
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
I like snakes.

573
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
I put a snake in my backpack one time.

574
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,160
I've talked about that, like if I walk down if I'm hiking or something and a

575
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,880
snake goes like

576
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,400
across the path, I that doesn't scare me, but if I was, I guess, but if I was

577
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,640
I guess

578
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:56,180
so it gets rattle and the showing its fan held aside, I said, I'm going to

579
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,280
eat you. Yeah, now that I think I started that, I was like, I guess I guess

580
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,440
what I'm saying is I'm afraid of being attacked. Yeah, do rattles rattlesnakes

581
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,200
only attack when they feel threatened, right? I think most animals, except for

582
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,280
the ones that except for bears, bears just kind of will do whatever. But have

583
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,360
you seen all these videos of people who are on hikes and they run into a bear

584
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,360
and then they that I am terrified of bears? Yeah, the thing you're supposed

585
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,560
to do is you're supposed to go hey bear yeah bear. Well, it depends on the

586
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,360
type of bear. Yeah, that's the worst part. It is like to do the middle.

587
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,940
There's like different things for every type of bear. I do not like being

588
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,600
read. Yeah, if you if you there's some bears, do you see you're supposed to see

589
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,080
them? You go

590
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,400
and then there's another where it's like oh, if you do that, it will kill you

591
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,600
instantly yeah yeah is that that's the

592
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,400
you're not there's no point in running. You're supposed to just cover your

593
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,220
trails. You're supposed to play that and put your back like brown bears are the

594
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,980
ones that you're just supposed to be like hey and then black no brown bears

595
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,200
are supposed to play that giant black bears are like human size. They're like

596
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
black bears. I think you can scare off and grizzlies. You're supposed to play

597
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,680
that, but also and polar is you're supposed to be hot. You're supposed to

598
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,840
get really really, really save the

599
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,420
thrower and throw a coca cola. You remember that that bear with alopecia?

600
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,840
Yeah, that thing was cool. Yo mama's cool, but grizzly bears also okay.

601
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,620
The okay, hold on this guy. Wait, hold on bear with alopecia, and he's saying

602
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,700
is my mom. Look, look at him. He's a bear with alopecia. He's not a bear,

603
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,660
not a bear that weight

604
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,340
191 pounds of lean muscle.

605
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,820
Yeah, it's not as funny to call you. You're a hundred. It's funny to call him

606
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,820
ugly muscle.

607
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,460
Funny to call Cameron fat, but you I feel like if I called you fed, you would

608
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:45,700
know what I eat you. You'd eat me and put me on his bed. Now you'd be in the

609
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,460
mirror gripping the sink and just go.

610
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:54,220
No, that's what I do. And you guys, I go in the mirror. I go in the mirror and I

611
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,160
pull all my fat down to see, make it look like I have abs.

612
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,560
Yeah.

613
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,860
And then I go, "Ugh!"

614
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,360
And I make a HDR video where I'm like doing this.

615
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,060
Oh, like Passionate Daddy?

616
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,560
Yeah.

617
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,960
The guy that Noah keeps showing me.

618
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,660
Oh, yeah. Chad found that guy. I love that guy.

619
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,360
Oh, Chad found him?

620
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,460
Yeah, Passionate Daddy.

621
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,660
Passionate Daddy.

622
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,060
So he posts...

623
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,760
Can't show it here, but...

624
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Yeah, he posts like his Instagram is just all pictures of like Delta 8 he's bought.

625
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,560
Yeah. He basically is Chad.

626
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm ready to fucking smoke this tonight.

627
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,200
Yeah, he's got his trunk. He's just showing trunk.

628
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,440
Oh, he's showing his dick wells, whatever they're called.

629
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,040
Dick wells?

630
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,160
What are they called right there?

631
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,280
You're thinking of cum gutters.

632
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,080
Cum gutters.

633
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,800
He does not have cum gutters.

634
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,400
Well, he's got his pants down to like right where his pubes go.

635
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay, he has the belly, the round belly, but then he has like two circles that make up his thighs

636
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,400
and then like a perfect kind of triangle of fat that holds his penis is Fupa and

637
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,040
then yes, that's what it is and then his Dick is pretty big and it hangs out

638
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,260
down. It goes below the if you don't see the tip of the penis on Instagram,

639
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,580
you're fine. Yeah, you can show yeah, yeah, you can't. What is that about?

640
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,520
Why can you show as much as you want to take that pick, but the tip of him with

641
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,000
the drone, the tip, which is not the tip is the point. It's the it's the exact

642
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,700
same thing as as free the nipple. Yeah, the tip is the nipple for guys. The tip

643
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,880
is the sexual part. The tip is the nipples for guys. Boob, if you cover up

644
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,960
the nipple. Yes. Who was that dude from Orange is the New Black who posted the

645
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,540
shirtless selfie with women's nipples on his body? Do you remember that? I don't

646
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,840
know. I don't remember that. You went on Instagram and you searched man with

647
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,660
woman's nipples.

648
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,740
That's how you found that. There was, it was like a, like he was doing it in

649
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,820
this like male feminist way where like the

650
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,720
caption, it's literally a picture of

651
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,460
himself shirtless, two other women,

652
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,920
like one woman, one woman, like two

653
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,180
different women's nipples on his bodies.

654
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,580
And he's like, yep, just repost him

655
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,460
like this shirtless.

656
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,600
And he's got like his eyes like it's

657
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,140
like just posting this right now

658
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,680
because apparently Instagram wants to

659
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,540
sexualize these two women's nipples.

660
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,620
It's like you've turned yourself into

661
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,980
like into a Frankenstein.

662
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,480
you

663
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:18,300
on a frankenstein to women's nipples on to yourself to prove a point. There's

664
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,560
two

665
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,580
asking the women. If you can do it, I mean like can I use one of your nipples

666
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:23,960
in my

667
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:30,520
the I he's like if I were to use one of my one of your nipples in my selfie,

668
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,820
which one would you prefer? I

669
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,680
this for the instagram wants a sensor, this frozen women's torso sitting in my

670
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,580
fridge. How disgusting is this website?

671
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,980
what are we talking about? Bears, Grizzly bears, they can't run downhill because

672
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,120
they have too much muscle on their shoulders. What is in that cup with

673
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,020
that? Because they have well, that's how a Grizzly bear. It has the big hump on

674
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,460
its back. Yes, I've seen crazy muscles in their in their shoulders and that's so

675
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,160
they can go. I mean they can go downhill, but they can't run because

676
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,220
they bears run really fucking fast, too. They can run like fifty miles an hour.

677
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,500
Yeah, they're very fast, but not a Grizzly bear can't do that downhill. You

678
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,940
need to go down so, but you need to play dead, but if you're going to run, go

679
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,480
go downhill, but you're going to die anyway. You just are as soon as you see

680
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,060
a barrier, I'm assuming. Have you ever seen a video of a bear like chasing a

681
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:21,600
car? No, it's the scariest thing. It's going car speed. They can go car speed

682
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,780
for short bursts. Holy shit. Yeah, it's so horribly and fucked. Yeah, and mooses

683
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,980
too are scary too. These are the nipples of Chrissy Teigen and Miley Cyrus.

684
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,700
Whoa. Oh, I remember that guy. Yeah, it's Matt McGorry, free the nipple.

685
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,060
Chrissy Teigen has a blue nipple. She, I guess her nipples are completely blue

686
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,920
like a, like a Navi. Did she used to be a Navi? Do not have nipples or I mean

687
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,800
not a cook. She used to be, they don't, which is one of their worst. Believe

688
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,180
me, I know. Why do they spend so much time in at the Avatar movies

689
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,700
obscuring the, where the nipples would be? Here's the guy, by the way. Well,

690
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,700
what I like about it is they obscure where the nipples would be, but then

691
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,540
you can think about

692
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:11,740
but then what I like is they but they also just like they like they all the

693
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,780
Na'vi wear the tiny like tropical bras, basically. Yeah, but they just always to

694
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,540
block where the nipples will be, but they also just have them like swing out

695
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,380
of the way the entire movie. So you can see that there's actually no like why

696
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,740
not just those tropical bras? That's like the Na'vi equivalent of the coconut.

697
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,820
that's a not be a equivalent of a t shirt. Actually yeah, well, no, just the

698
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,100
objects that they're using to cover the yeah is the coconut and coconuts on that

699
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,980
planet very flat. I would jack off to the avatars if they weren't so big yeah

700
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,660
they're too big yeah,

701
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,940
it is his foot. Well, you know what you know, I would know what to do with. You

702
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,340
know what the actual issue is. It's not that they're too big. It's that that you

703
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,780
only realize what you what's actually happening for you is you only realize

704
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,440
they're too big when they're next to a human, and why would you jack off to a

705
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,920
Navi when there's a human right there?

706
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,380
Does that I think I think the thing I think the thing that is a concord? Yeah,

707
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,880
I should be jacking up to the set of the blue avatar. That's how it's going on

708
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,160
in your brain. That's the biological switch. The problem, the obvious problem

709
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,580
here is that their sexual organs or hair.

710
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,380
I don't so you hear when you check when you jack off to a Navi, they're

711
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,240
definitely still have you are jacking off to hair. They do have they have

712
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,880
stuff. They have

713
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,600
James Cameron has basically gone on record and said that the hair thing is

714
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,160
not sex. No, it's not bonding. They do it with the animals. It's bonding.

715
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,520
That's true. It's more of a kiss. Yeah, it's no, it's more of my dog. It's

716
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,680
honestly more of a deep sleepover conversation. Yeah, that's what it is.

717
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,520
Yeah, it's like when you're with a Navi woman and you're putting your hair in

718
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,320
her hair deep text. You're just like you're like what if we like got a time

719
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,780
share together? Yeah,

720
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:00,280
we're tone together. When was the last time you guys had an actual just real

721
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,320
ass night walk conversation

722
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,080
on some on the real tip where you're walking and you're saying what the hell

723
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,880
is all that look up at the stars. I want to have one of those every night. Look

724
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,400
how I've had so many of those of my cousins walking down the street and

725
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,920
looking up and being like what yeah, what are we doing?

726
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,480
bro. This universe is as large as a fucking as four or five as big as a

727
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,940
did. I was going to say I thought that I had a conversation like this with my

728
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,040
girlfriend the other night, but then I remembered that the conversation that we

729
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,020
were having was me explaining

730
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,580
blueberry guys to her

731
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:41,720
like the what in God's fucking name are you talking about? We did an episode

732
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,520
about grammar like explaining like the guy, but you thought that was a

733
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,040
conversation about the universe.

734
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,440
No, I was like, I was like, when

735
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,080
was it like a conversation where

736
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,900
you're like, oh, like this is like a

737
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
great moment.

738
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,200
We're having like a really nice time

739
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,140
together. We're laughing.

740
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,580
We're like talking and like about

741
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,040
like, like deep stuff.

742
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,380
And we were like talking to each

743
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,300
other about like, like what

744
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,400
makes a person want to do

745
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,100
this? And it was us

746
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,180
looking at a video.

747
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,140
His name was like Blueberry Matthew.

748
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,500
And he's like,

749
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,620
the fucking video is so good.

750
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,700
It's him in a coach's outfit and he goes like,

751
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:24,200
"Okay, when you're out there, I want you to be the ball." And then it cuts

752
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,420
to him in the blueberry costume and his voice is high and he goes,

753
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,440
"But coach, I am the ball."

754
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,340
That's pretty good. I wanna see that video. That is a really good idea.

755
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,140
Yeah. It is really good. I had a deep conversation the other day.

756
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,500
Somebody asked me what my biggest fear was. Wow. And I said,

757
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,700
"The entire world blinking out of existence in a single second." And then

758
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,200
and they said, Why are you afraid of that? And I said, I guess it makes no

759
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,200
sense, but I had a I had I had a deep thought last night. What was it when I

760
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,520
was falling asleep and you know when you get your demons?

761
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,460
Dude, I can't be well. We were taught we were talking about about AI about the

762
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,760
about the Caleb was telling me about this. We had a deep conversation. Last

763
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,580
night, I have a deep conversation on the guy. We got deep from Union Hall,

764
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,600
but Caleb was telling me about this AI experiment where they wanted. They told

765
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,540
AI that you have to be evil and try to destroy the world and it made a

766
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,320
twitter account and like tweeted like I want to destroy the world,

767
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,340
hashtag destroy, yeah, whatever I like domination, yeah, and so I was like and

768
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,100
we're like laughing about like that's so funny that the like I thought that

769
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,660
that was how you destroy the world and I was lying a bed and I was like,

770
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,780
Oh my God, you could destroy the well. I was thinking I was literally like

771
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,320
I've been thinking like that experiment is not ethical because there's

772
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,500
although there is a one percent chance that you press go on that experiment

773
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,260
and the you know the AI like makes a twitter account. That's like it's the

774
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,800
twitter account and it says like

775
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,500
it makes an account as Vladimir Putin and it gets like a verified check and it

776
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,180
tweets to Joe Biden. It says I am launching a new right now and Joe Biden.

777
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,820
He thinks it's real and he launches back the new. He launches new at Russia and

778
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,900
like that could happen yeah. It could that would be so funny. If that's how

779
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,080
the world ended is that Joe Biden got faked by like by like a Moji instead of

780
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,480
this is a

781
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,760
hundred percent. The he is the he's the president who would get who got fooled

782
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,740
by the sushi roll

783
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:23,600
what the hell and his man's got a narrow, but I was really like a thing

784
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,160
like the how could verify how could they think it's okay to do an experiment

785
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,120
like that yeah because they could that a I could ruin geopolitics. I agree. I

786
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,920
think that are I think that we should sign that letter that says that we need

787
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,900
called all our I think I think it needs to end research. We did so much a

788
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,320
ice.

789
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,280
You still do it. I still did. It's every day. You text us something that is if

790
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,960
it's if you text me more than six words, I know that you wrote it with a

791
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,000
I. What do you mean? You all any time in my birthday poem? Yes, that was a

792
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,200
I. Everything was a I know. I know you because of his poultry gift, his

793
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,920
gift. Well, I get was so heartfelt. His his was not robotically cold. Okay,

794
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,860
but I was first. I gave him no because you sent him a cheerio my own. You

795
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,820
know, I'm a heart shape cheerio. Okay, so doesn't even remember my gift. My

796
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,820
first gift was a kiss. Okay,

797
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,540
second guest was a guess.

798
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,920
Second guest was a gift was a heart shaped cheerio, which I thought was very

799
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,840
and I got him a video. I don't think it was paltry. You saw all the video

800
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,200
and then you robotically generated something that I was cold and had no

801
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,260
emotion. What are you talking about? You want to read it? I can pull it up.

802
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,380
I'll pull it up right now. It was not. It was it was somewhat heartfelt.

803
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,540
Yeah, the nipple thing to free the nipple picture is really funny. It was

804
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:51,400
somewhat heartfelt, but again, it was written by essentially you hired a ghost

805
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,120
writer and it wasn't even human. Yeah, I would have liked for you to at least

806
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,920
hire. It's like you. It's like you. It's like you went up to a

807
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,240
cockroach. Can you say, OK, wish my friend happy birthday. Cameron's gift to

808
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,560
Caleb oh so small, paltry and meager, barely a gift at all.

809
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,280
Better luck next time, Cameron, dear,

810
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,520
or your friendship may soon disappear.

811
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,040
Cameron's gift for Caleb was small, not much effort,

812
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,960
no thought at all, but Julio and Patrick knew just what to do.

813
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,920
Their gifts brought joy and love, laughter anew.

814
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,480
- And where in that poem does it say

815
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,760
happy birthday, Patrick?

816
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,600
- That's a good point.

817
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,760
- It says Caleb's birthday, and that was in addition to the--

818
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,280
- Does it say happy birthday?

819
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,920
- It was in addition to the happy birthday video.

820
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,880
- Does it say I love you, Caleb,

821
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,520
we can kiss for one time?

822
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,360
- No, it doesn't say that.

823
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,060
like here's a heart shaped cheerio. That's the shape of my heart. He would

824
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,320
never kiss me. No, he has never kissed. I know you have not ever. Here's was

825
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,000
kissing all over me yesterday. He was me like fifty times.

826
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,520
What

827
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,020
what are you even talking about? What are you serious? Are you? Is this a

828
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:48,560
are you

829
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,520
is this an allegation?

830
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,840
He kissed me a weird number of times.

831
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,460
Today is your birthday. It was in addition to this. So this was pretty

832
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:06,760
scandalous, I'll admit. He sent me this video. And I did a little... I put on

833
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,300
my Sherlock Holmes hat. You sleuthed. I sleuthed a little bit. And what did

834
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,680
you find? I found out that that was a video that was uploaded to YouTube

835
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,340
a long time ago. And he said that we need to do a copyright strike on

836
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,020
them for stealing that from me. I was trying to make you feel better about

837
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,660
your terrible gift, but in reality, I liked Cameron's paltryness the most.

838
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,560
Okay, yeah, all right.

839
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:35,660
I don't know what was yours. He Leo gave me a picture of a bunch of flowers.

840
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,320
Yep, that's true, which was very, very sweet. That might be the best one. It

841
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,420
was a bunch of roses with one golden rose directly in the middle of bulls. I

842
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,820
well, and it was twenty six rows. Can we do a reverse image search on this on

843
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,940
these on this photo real quick? No, I don't see why we why we need to, but

844
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,540
you can go ahead and do a reverse image search on the cheerio. You won't find

845
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,960
anything. No, it's an original picture. I think I think if I do a reverse image

846
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,880
search on that, I may find a lot more cheerios.

847
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,360
So yeah, if you wanna make yourself so fuckin' hungry you can't see, I think

848
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,480
that I'm gonna get, I think

849
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,460
right now, what time is it? One o'clock? That is, to me, that's the problem with

850
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,520
cheerios is that one is not enough.

851
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,220
I am still so hungry. How horrible would that be if you looked at the back of

852
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,520
a Cheerios box that's serving size of one Cheerio, 200 calories.

853
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,480
They make a Cheerio like how Mini Wheats were originally just one big thing.

854
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,520
Oh yeah, the big... So you just have one big Cheerio.

855
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,400
That was so crazy to find that out that Mini Wheats wasn't the original

856
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,560
thing. 'Cause they used to be just Wheats. Yeah, it used to just be one

857
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,420
wheat. You just get one wheat. That is some crazy shit. I think my next cereal

858
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,620
will be raising brand

859
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:59,680
raising brands. I love raising. I've been cycling doing all different cereals.

860
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,420
I don't eat cereal. I like cereal because I don't have to do anything. I woke up

861
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,980
at five in the morning and I had a skirt steak and two eggs. Yeah, see, I can't

862
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,820
do that. And I immediately wanted to vomit. It was so disgusting. Yeah, I need

863
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,860
I need to eat as soon as I wake up, but I also don't want to do anything.

864
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,300
My girlfriend got this like

865
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,660
aids from you. No, she got this cereal that is like

866
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,660
it's an organic.

867
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:34,420
It's an organic cinnamon toast crunch that tastes the same as cinnamon toast

868
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,340
crunch. And it's like, just get fucking cinnamon toast crunch. Why?

869
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,780
Wait, no, that's exactly the reason to get the organic. Yeah.

870
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,500
you just that's the you just did a reverse reason. It doesn't have

871
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,780
rebo flavin and stuff in it. You don't want rebo flavin. What are you talking

872
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,340
about? That's all of all of the no, no, no, the good for you. Well,

873
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:54,780
it's in a

874
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,700
there's really nothing that's good for you and sentiment toast crunch, but you

875
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,100
should stop eating so much sugar because sugar is I don't eat a lot of

876
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,500
sugar.

877
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,900
Can you okay? I told somebody this the other day you have before in the time

878
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,260
that we've been in this office just over a year. You have come in that door

879
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:18,120
at eleven in the morning with two different bags of candy. Yeah, so just

880
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,900
like that's crazy. There's not that is crazy. Candy is a would do. We would do

881
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,260
candy.

882
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,940
But that back

883
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:33,200
D and D. How did you shoot that? I have a skill. That was cool. I'm going to do

884
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,000
it again. It won't work to me. Yeah, it just came right back. Boomerang. Oh, my

885
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:43,540
my God boomerang status yeah, but you need to stop eating candy. Do not

886
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,840
intervene with me right now. You need to do not do not make this episode of candy

887
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,840
intervention. This is a full

888
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,900
I've been meaning to talk to you about this for I've stopped eating as much

889
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,080
candy as I do. Thank you very much. What does that mean? As much as you do

890
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,300
once a week now that's not true. That's more than that. It's I eat candy once a

891
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,080
week. Your eyes are closed because you're lying and then you rolled your eyes

892
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,420
right after now. I can do you're bullshitting me. I don't eat that much

893
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,520
candy anymore. When was the last time you candy yesterday? You had candy

894
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,060
yesterday.

895
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:19,300
You did I didn't have candy the day before that you did.

896
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,640
What was it? What did you eat? Probably? What did you eat? I don't even want

897
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,960
to. It was a chocolate coin.

898
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:32,560
At least that's a that's somewhat an adult. Yeah, that's respectable.

899
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,760
whenever when I do go for candy, I don't eat. I eat candy maybe once a month,

900
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,060
one

901
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:45,260
maybe on a if I'm really in a craving month, but I will always go for

902
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:50,080
gummy bears. Yeah, I've never eaten. That's the only candy I ever crave. I

903
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,220
like gummy bears, but I have never and will never eat a bag of any candy.

904
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,600
Yeah, I'm a I will have three pieces of candy. Yeah, and if I have a

905
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,820
Reese's Cup, I'll have one Reese's Cup. Yeah, yeah, I never I never create

906
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:07,860
chocolate. I don't ever want chocolate except for chocolate cake. I don't like

907
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,820
desserts either.

908
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:14,780
You're fucked up. I like chocolate cake is fire. I like broccoli. Dessert to you

909
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,580
is beef jerky. You know what the best dessert is actually? The best dessert is

910
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:26,420
barley. Sweet, sweet, sticky Thai rice with a mango on top and condensed milk.

911
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,660
That is completely true. That is the best dessert bar none. Dude, rice pudding

912
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,680
from the from the Indian place that you remember that putting it in my house.

913
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,480
Yeah, remember that Indian spot? I mean, this is chocolate pudding. I used to

914
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,380
eat five hundred calories of chocolate pudding every single day when I lived

915
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:46,800
chocolate pudding is bad. Shut your bitch ass up. That is more. That is more

916
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,620
of a baby thing to eat the candy. Well, there's a completely honest. What about

917
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,940
scotch pudding? What is good? What I surprise you if I swirled it

918
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,740
with what vanilla

919
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,680
you probably get that you probably get the yogurts that have the little the

920
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,880
little things that you mix in no the on the top of the races, the reasons,

921
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,200
Rosie and over to the show body flips

922
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,580
and I get the s'mores. I can't believe you're trying to act superior. But can

923
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,180
you eat chocolate pudding? Yeah, I don't eat chocolate, but I used to you used to

924
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,060
okay yeah. When I was in college, I trying to gain weight, I had chocolate

925
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,100
pudding, but I don't need it anymore. Okay, because I don't need that kind of

926
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,020
bull. Yeah, you don't need that kind of bullshit. Okay, everyone's going to have

927
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,200
a dark chocolate almond butter cup with coconut pieces up top. Okay,

928
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,280
seventy eight percent cacao.

929
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,880
What do you what do you eat that with all your wooden spoons in your house?

930
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,720
Yeah, a spoon with a crank on it. Why would I eat a why would I use a

931
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,120
spoon to eat a peanut butter cup?

932
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,080
Because it has no binding agents.

933
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,600
There's no binding agents in this chocolate. I use my hand, I put it in my

934
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,040
mouth.

935
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,920
What's wrong with you? The chocolate has no binding agents. No, what do you eat

936
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,040
know, a metal straw. Yeah, I do have a metal straw. I know you that I use for

937
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,480
know your

938
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,000
from one and guys guess what I'm investing in. He has a whale bone straw

939
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,320
with

940
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,760
no, I do not have a reed straw that I use when I go underwater and I breathe

941
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,200
through it when I'm hiding in the Vietnamese war.

942
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,520
I am buying a reverse osmosis filter so that I can stop drinking tap water.

943
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,000
What is that? I don't know you don't know what it is. I really don't know

944
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,840
it's a bread. No, it's not a bread. It is a fire. Nope. It goes under your sink and

945
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,600
it goes. It does your water three times and then it pops it back three times so

946
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,440
that you can drink it. You can drink it anyway, but it's bad for you. Tap water

947
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,060
is one of the greatest inventions in the world and people want to talk about how

948
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:44,020
if you like cancer, I love cancer. Well, then I join there. Remember the last I

949
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,680
sent to you guys last night. There being two stores,

950
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,000
there's a store in our neighborhood called I Like Food and then there's a...

951
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,800
I've been there a bunch of times. I've never been there. It's good. It looks

952
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,640
good. I Like Food. I Like Food. Is it a grocery store? No, it's a

953
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,520
restaurant. It's food in a bar, but they got a good sandwich. I remember

954
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,880
having a good sandwich the one time. It's called I Like Food. And when you

955
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,200
get the food for takeout, they put a sticker on your bag that says

956
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,360
I Like Food. That's a great name for a restaurant. And a little cartoon

957
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,280
So that's called I like food and then I found another, I found another store last night.

958
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,400
I think I was looking up I like food because me, when me and Noah moved in together, we

959
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,160
saw that place and we thought it was so funny.

960
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,960
I was looking it up, I typed in I and then it was I like food and under it was a store

961
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,040
called, a barber shop called I had cancer.

962
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,640
I immediately thought, I was like, oh yeah, these are sister stores.

963
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,280
the best store that me and cam have seen is the Sopranos Barbershop. Oh yeah,

964
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,640
that is very funny. Sopranos Barbershop. I do like that one. Wait, what was that

965
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,000
one?

966
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,920
There is a store in our neighborhood that's literally called like Most Amazing

967
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,320
Chinese Massage or something like that. Yeah.

968
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,240
There's Happy Bebe 100. Oh, Happy Bebe 100. That's a good store. Happy Bebe

969
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,080
100. Happy Bebe 100. With a star in the middle in the name. Yeah. Yeah,

970
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,840
that's cool. There's a place with... This is not a store name, but my

971
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,720
my favorite my favorite misspelling on a sign is there's a place there's an ice

972
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,360
cream place

973
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:15,480
that they have well. First of all, they have on you have a picture that says

974
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,920
ice cream with cheese and it has ice cream in it with a bunch of melted

975
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,420
cheese,

976
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:25,680
but in their flavors they have instead of rum raisin, it says rum rising

977
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,800
there's

978
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,920
Dunkin Donuts, no G. Dunkin. Yeah, that's what the hell is up with that.

979
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,560
You spelled the name Duncan wrong. Yeah, exactly. Either goes D-U-N-C-A-N or

980
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,900
Dunking. Yeah, you know, you don't split the difference. No, no, no, no. I was

981
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,460
looking for that. There's like, I gotta find that massage parlor, but it's the

982
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,660
funniest name. Why? You gonna get a massage? I do need a massage from a big

983
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:02,120
early guy. I want just a lumberjack to step on my back till it breaks so I can

984
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,360
finally... You don't really want that. End all this pain in my body. Can I get

985
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,840
you in the gym? I don't know. That's a no. Can you get me in the gym?

986
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,540
Me and Cameron are already in the gym. You guys go to the gym. I have to end

987
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,600
that Planet Fitness membership I keep getting. I've been trying to call...

988
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,420
That is crazy. We've been... For as long as we've been doing the podcast,

989
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,040
you have not made one phone call or gone on the website. I have. They shut

990
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,540
down the one that I you can do it online. We can also remember also years ago. We

991
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:27,940
showed you

992
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:33,820
hard to if you're lazy. Yeah, yeah, you know what? You know what I did try to

993
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,940
shut it down, but then I went to that planet fitness down the street

994
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:43,940
for a day and then that justified me still have the only thing that that

995
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,840
planet fitness is good for is when you get off the train, you have to pee so

996
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,260
bad your bladder and burners and you go inside and you pee and your jeans. But

997
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,800
This thing is I got that planet fitness card. I have the planet fitness black

998
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,460
card, so I can go to any planet fitness in the country and also I get access.

999
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:05,940
It's 20 bucks a month, 25 a month. You could have two Netflixes. Yeah, but you

1000
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,400
can have two separate, one where you watch girl shows and one where you watch

1001
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,620
boy shows. So the recommendations go, don't get mixed up. Here's the thing

1002
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,020
about

1003
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,860
spa access.

1004
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:20,740
They don't have a spa. They don't have one here. They don't have one here, but

1005
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,260
the one in Manchester, New Hampshire did have a table.

1006
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,160
I bet that spot was bumping.

1007
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,260
It was like a massage thing.

1008
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,160
Oh, the water massage.

1009
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,260
You had to pay extra for that.

1010
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,960
Yeah, and I paid extra for it.

1011
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,260
Why don't you just go to my gym has a steam room, buddy.

1012
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,760
I'm thinking maybe.

1013
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,260
I'm on third.

1014
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,060
I should go to the gym, but I don't like, I don't think I'd

1015
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,960
like who I'd become if I went to the gym.

1016
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,560
You like who you are right now?

1017
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
if I got really if I if I

1018
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,240
will know him strong. Everybody always says like I can't go to the gym. I

1019
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,760
don't want to get insanely. It's so funny. It's like

1020
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,660
what do you think it's like going to the gym? You know how hard it is to

1021
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,460
do that? I don't want to get muscles, but I do

1022
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,860
but he is insanely. Yes, we are going to get Cameron scary rib. Yeah, and

1023
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,660
with his frame, he will be a problem. Yeah, he gonna be a problem on the

1024
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,160
court.

1025
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,660
I don't think he gonna. I think that if I got like abs at all, I could

1026
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,540
dunk right now. I think people would look at me different. I think I bet I don't

1027
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,260
mean this is an insult. I bet you have a two inch vertical leap

1028
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:32,000
this high is high. I think that you could jump. Let's I'm actually not sure

1029
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,760
how high my vertical cameras that I have a I could do a really good long. We'll

1030
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,160
get a Cameron Joe. Okay, I could jump really far. I think I know after we're

1031
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,180
done recording, we'll go in the back yard. Maybe I could pull the and we'll

1032
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,720
do a jumping. I'll do a jumping contest, a jumping competition. I think I

1033
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,840
I can't jump that. I think you're probably right. I'm very inflexible

1034
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,280
legs. Yeah, see that's why we're going to flex them up. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I

1035
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,960
broke my toe yesterday. Why are you doing? What skating? Oh,

1036
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,180
you know how bad my last showed you yesterday. You ever think about you?

1037
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:07,120
I broke my fast this morning with honey nut Cheerios. Do you ever think about

1038
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,580
your poor mother

1039
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:15,500
sitting at home, worrying about you wearing a negligee right with a really

1040
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,480
low cut looking out the window, lighting a can seven that's seven PM.

1041
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:24,160
One is starting to say yeah. All I think about is getting changed behind one of

1042
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,600
those Asian privacy.

1043
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,140
Our phone won't stop buzzing because I'm sending a real Moji's exactly one every

1044
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:31,960
ten seconds.

1045
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:41,280
Do you ever think about that? Do you ever think about her sitting there in

1046
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,680
the living room? She has her snapchat location on I'm seeing exactly where she

1047
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,800
is on the map. I keep calling her and she keeps being like, please, you have to

1048
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,500
stop calling me. I'm waiting for a call from my son from the hospital.

1049
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,140
Do you ever think about so what I'm saying is, do you ever think about how

1050
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,360
you are ruining my game by making your stupid mom worry about you all day and

1051
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,940
night because you're out there skateboarding?

1052
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,060
I don't give a shit.

1053
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,620
Damn when I am your stepdad, things will be very I'm sending her subway

1054
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,700
surfer screen shot. You think you think this middle finger is bad now. If you

1055
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:16,940
my stepdad, you'd be getting it way worse. You'd be in a fucking full body cast if I

1056
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,020
was your stepdad. If you were my stepdad, you'd try to send me to boarding school.

1057
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:26,760
I would literally, if you had a car, get sugar in the gas tank. You would be

1058
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,080
waking up every day, you'd put on your slippers, there'd be a razor blade in

1059
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,740
it. Every single day, I go to my own gas tank and you siphon the gas out.

1060
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,020
So I get... Oh, and I'm doing that every day regardless of what you put in it.

1061
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,740
So one day, "Oh, nice surprise, there's sugar in it. It tastes great today."

1062
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,220
- Shampoo would have hair loss stuck in it.

1063
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,060
- What fucking hair do I have to lose?

1064
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,900
What shampoo do I use?

1065
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,180
I'm the perfect stepdad.

1066
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,300
I was made in a machine to be your father.

1067
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,140
- No.

1068
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,160
- Yes, I'm a year older than you.

1069
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,000
Which gives me supreme authority.

1070
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,500
- We're the same age.

1071
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,540
- Oh, what age are you?

1072
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,300
- You were born in '97.

1073
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,660
- Oh, wow, that makes us the same age.

1074
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,500
What age are you?

1075
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,540
Are you 25?

1076
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,140
'Cause I'm 26.

1077
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,420
Hit the air horn.

1078
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,900
Okay, hit the...

1079
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,740
(air horn blaring)

1080
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,580
Yes, and you see--

1081
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,300
only a couple of months older than you see this now yeah. What a baby little

1082
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,520

1087
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,060
adjustment program. I'm the I think ninety eight is a cut off where if I was

1088
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,860
born in ninety nine, I would be a completely different person. Yeah. And

1089
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:47,300
you guys would be not like you would have a zoomer. I would have a red hair.

1090
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,980
I would be a girl and I would have one leg. You'd have a faux hawk.

1091
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,320
You would have a... That would be so... I mean, I can imagine it right

1092
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,320

1093
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,740

1098
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,900
glasses, because I don't think you can do pick any glasses that are okay.

1099
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,740
What do you mean? No, they're all bad. They're all bad. People, people,

1100
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,700
recently I've been going for some the fact that well, the fact that you have

1101
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,460
to make a conscious choice and the doctor can't just be like, that's right.

1102
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,780
Fuck you. The fact that you can't just have yeah, I think your glasses are okay,

1103
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,500
but I don't think those would look good on me.

1104
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,540
We have a pair of glasses right over there. You can put on, but I'm saying I

1105
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,980
these I don't look good in glass. The point the

1106
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:34,980
the thing if the doctor could just prescribe you the frames yeah, that

1107
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,300
would be the perfect thing. The thing, but the problem pick you have to be

1108
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,580
like I think I'm going to look good. I'm going to I have to try to pull

1109
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:46,060
them off yeah, yeah, the problem is something else about what whitey. I

1110
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:50,660
think that whitey's and white guys. Has there ever been a white guy who has a

1111
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:56,900
good beard? No, oh, no right, oh yeah, a good beard

1112
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,300
LeBron James. No.

1113
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:05,820
This is something that I've been thinking of for months.

1114
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,900
Speaking of white guys in glasses.

1115
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,100
And I've been waiting for a chance to say it.

1116
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,900
I don't know any of these guys.

1117
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,100
Chet Hanks looks good with a beard.

1118
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,700
I don't know any of these guys, but Chet Hanks does have a pretty decent beard.

1119
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:23,100
But I guess he's got a blonde beard too, which if you can pull off having a blonde beard.

1120
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,900
That's true.

1121
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,900
That shit looks disgusting.

1122
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,660
But you're right that white guy beard, whitey's beards are not as good as others' beards.

1123
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,420
It's true. It's completely true.

1124
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:38,440
But speaking of white guys in glasses, there is like a centimeter difference between just

1125
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:48,040
regular white guy in glasses and white pedophile. If you get frames that are just a centimeter

1126
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,460
too big or something or the frame is like...

1127
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,760
For me, the issue is less... Maybe it's an issue for you when you're picking out glasses

1128
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,260
because they're going to look like a pedophile in them for me. It's more

1129
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,620
like I'm going to look too stylish. I'm going to turn too many heads. I'm going

1130
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,300
to be like people in the restaurant, I be tripping and dropping their frames.

1131
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:08,140
You get those aviator frames on you. Yeah, like Tom Cruise. Yeah, no, he's

1132
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,980
not looking like Tom Cruise, this guy and those in those fucking aviator.

1133
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:16,080
Okay, no, I will not look like a pet. I'll look like Jeffrey Dahmer, but he

1134
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,700
wasn't a pedophile. He's just an evil killer who was gay and you think he's

1135
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,460
pedophile because he's gay. No, I think he's a pedophile because he's a

1136
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,100
murderer.

1137
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:27,700
Pedophiles don't usually kill pedophiles. You can call them murderers.

1138
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,500
Yeah, they always because they just want they're pleasure all the time.

1139
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,580
They don't have to deal with death. God, I hate them.

1140
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:38,060
There's a what do you mean? What's wrong? Why do you say pleasure like

1141
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,540
that? I was trying to think of the right word, but you were

1142
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:45,700
a fire. Yeah, they have pleasure. You were saying that, like they are going

1143
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:50,620
on a tropical vacation. Yeah, it's a euphemism. I also heard like a lot of

1144
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,260
I heard I heard the girls gone.

1145
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,560
Talk about

1146
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,460
you'll drum.

1147
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,760
That I heard

1148
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,960
they don't have to care about fucking kid in the butt. Is that

1149
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,860
what you rather say?

1150
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:02,860
See

1151
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,760
what the hell

1152
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,460
no, that's what he that's he thinks of it.

1153
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,460
There we go.

1154
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,960
Yes, that wasn't cricket.

1155
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,560
The reaction you guys yelled.

1156
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,660
I got a rise out of you and that's honestly all I care about in

1157
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,960
comedy is getting a rise out of people and now I don't care to

1158
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,160
make myself laugh

1159
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,860
pushing the envelope. It's a cool as fuck. Actually,

1160
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:29,060
no, that was not a joke. You can't say fucking a kid in the butt like that.

1161
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:33,620
Well, if you do that after I guess it's kind of it kind of is a joke. I guess

1162
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:39,260
anything you say, this is how I feel. If I when I don't like the pedophiles for

1163
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:39,980
kids in the butt,

1164
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:46,500
that's how I feel when I think about it. That's how you feel. That's how wait.

1165
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,700
That is the audience reaction to you saying that you don't like it. So this

1166
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,220
this is you talking in the audience.

1167
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,240
No, that's what I heard.

1168
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,260
That's what the reaction was.

1169
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,280
Say it again and then do the right one.

1170
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,300
A pedophile fucking a kid in the butt.

1171
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,820
This is crass.

1172
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,840
This is not the kind of thing I want to be doing.

1173
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,860
It's not crass.

1174
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:02,880
Say you don't like it.

1175
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,900
It's political.

1176
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:04,920
Can we not say it again, though?

1177
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,540
I don't like that thing.

1178
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:07,560
There we go.

1179
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,580
There we go.

1180
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,600
Okay, so that makes more sense.

1181
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,120
But in my head, when I think of that thing,

1182
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,960
when I think about it,

1183
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,360
Why are you thinking?

1184
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:25,620
the episode is over. I don't want a shareholder meeting on the 28th.

1185
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,260
And

1186
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,820
I don't know, some of the 20s.

1187
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,940
No.

1188
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:38,180
28th is... But tune in on Wednesday to see the story of the swear jar. My

1189
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:42,080
birthday was four days ago. Oh yeah, the swear jar. Oh wait, today's 4/20.

1190
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,880
Oh, we didn't even smoke about it. We did the whole hour, didn't smoke a

1191
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:52,880
single thing. Well, that's okay. I was pretty fried. I was fried. I was pretty fried. Okay.

1192
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:59,320
Alright, bye guys.
