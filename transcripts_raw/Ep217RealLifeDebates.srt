1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
Tonight, war, traditional family values, animal rights, free market capitalism, privacy rights,

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:25,560
global climate change, lunchtime, Christmas, will all be debated on Real Life Debates.

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,320
(dramatic music)

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,540
(alarm blaring)

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,120
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,640
- Welcome.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,900
- Welcome to the show.

8
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,080
- Ah, fuck.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,760
And greetings to you as well.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,560
- What?

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,600
- Just trying to be kind of respectable.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,520
- Oh yeah.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,360
- Do my respectable thing.

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,120
- Okay, being a fucking weirdo.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,960
- Weird shit.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,600
No, I'm trying to be respectable. I've been trying to bring manners more into my life a little bit.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,960
You know, make eye contact with women on the street and stuff. Just look right at them, kind of.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,720
The thing that you're supposed to do, and I read this I think on, what's it, Jezebel.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Not familiar.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,920
You look a woman straight in the eyes on the street and you point your hands, you make a fist like this.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Okay.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,220
and you say, "Energy! Energy!"

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,520
No, you're supposed to do this.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,220
And then you siphon their life force.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,220
You think you're supposed to do a Wakanda forever?

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,020
Yeah.

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,220
I don't think you're supposed to do that.

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,020
Women-kanda.

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,220
I don't think you're supposed to do that at all.

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,720
Women-kanda are not as good as men-

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,220
Yeah, they're better.

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,220
-kanda. No, that's not what I meant.

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,020
Yeah, they're not as good. They're as great.

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,720
Okay, so we have our first debate topic.

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,520
Basically, today we're doing a bit of a debate-style show

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Because I mean we've been sharing

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,400
These mics here for going on three years and to say that we almost yeah

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Well to say we but wow wow okay?

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Wow very soon. Yeah, very soon, but no way for four years for

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Geez and there's been so many at three

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,640
There's there's been so many things that have changed on this well

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,320
But also to say over the years to say that we've butted heads about certain

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,000
Social and political issues I would say would be an understatement. Oh absolutely because we occupy as we know three different

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,540
Parts of the political quadrants the triads yeah

45
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,920
Well, it's part of a triangle. It's the try a political triangle. I've never this is a concept

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,020
This is a concept that Cameron came up with is the political triangle. Yeah, I mean I you guys know

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,020
I did a stint as a political scientist. Yeah

48
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,980
Really, yeah from the ages of five to seven and I came up with the triangle that was pretty smart. Yeah, yeah

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,380
I actually came up with it in music class.

50
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,580
You took the spectrum and you just kind of bent that part.

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,180
I wonder what your inspiration was.

52
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,180
It's three points, three political points.

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,380
And I mean I can't reveal what they are because I mean we're going to kind of introduce them

54
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
in a minute.

55
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,380
Yeah, we're going to get into that.

56
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,620
So today we're doing, we're going to have a debate.

57
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,860
Am I supposed to introduce it now?

58
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,140
No we can go, so like I said.

59
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,140
Debate's too formal.

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
Debate is too formal.

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,100
Although I am into rules and respectability because of where I am on the political triangle.

62
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,300
I like anarchy when it comes to arguing my point.

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,900
And I'm directly in the middle.

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
So we can go ahead.

66
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,700
We have some political cards we can describe.

67
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,340
Let's start with maybe Cameron.

68
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,700
Yeah, I'll introduce myself first.

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Let's go ahead here.

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,820
Hi there, everybody.

71
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,280
My name is Cameron Fetter, and I'm a comedic leftist.

72
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,740
Some facts, political facts about me.

73
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,020
I wrote in Shrek in the 2020 election.

74
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,140
That's who I voted for.

75
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,060
is a complete absurd yeah it's absurd it's a bit ironic to where's the I think

76
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,060
you don't grasp maybe the idea of irony it's kind of a kind of that's part of it

77
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,740
you know to act like a fucking stupid head like I mean like I think a lot of

78
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,140
conservatives are now days now are stupid cool now we're Democrats do not

79
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,440
think about it but I also support vicious ad hominem insults on

80
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,700
conservatives their families their children I think that anything should be

81
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,700
completely fair game I think that it's okay to insult an eight-year-old girl if

82
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,940
her dad is a politician, I think that it's okay to say things about her appearance.

83
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,380
That much is clear. That's part of my political beliefs. Yeah, I can tell. I believe that colored hair should be

84
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,980
legal. I think there should be no legal restrictions against having colored hair.

85
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,980
I agree for no reason. I think I might vomit. And also I really I want more

86
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,780
episodes of Tuca and Bertie and I've been saying this for a while but seize

87
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,500
the means of Netflix and let's get some more cartoon shows. Now what does that mean?

88
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,180
there. I'm I'm the means that basically means to get more of

89
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,900
something you want. Okay, so I'm I figured you for an O and a fan

90
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,980
or away not only I'm the

91
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:56,300
you know, I kind of just like anything with a comedic bent

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,420
interesting and also with a leftist bent. Ah, and then we

93
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,300
have a thing you like. I like bents. Yeah, I like things with

94
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I'll give you something to bend.

95
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,300
I think now we should introduce Caleb's political views here.

96
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,300
So I'm just a normal Republican, okay? I'm into respectability in politics, right?

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,300
I want sensible debate. I want what you do in your own home, that's your own business, okay?

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,300
I have no part of that. I really just want everybody in America to have the tools to support themselves.

99
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,300
And then this last one, I don't think I wrote that. Yeah, I don't think I need to go over that one.

100
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,620
that one yeah yeah it must have been a glitch that was that's a kind of glitch

101
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,660
has nothing to do it must have been something about the graphic design the

102
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,500
color scheme oh yeah white text only that's what I meant when I when I put

103
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,340
that on my card I was like can you make sure it's white text oh yeah right

104
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,060
there's other colors of designer designer he must have been yeah I mean

105
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,380
by the way you're racist fucking shitbag for putting shit like that on your

106
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,180
mother fucking card. Oh, this must be the ad hominems you're talking about.

107
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,140
Yeah, well that's what I would expect from a... Oh yeah, nice one stupid head.

108
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,900
That's what I would expect... Okay, wow, that is fucking... Okay, are you calling me the

109
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,820
stupid head or him? Because... Both of you fuckwads are ass clowns to me.

110
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,580
Alright, well I guess it's good... I guess I should introduce my political

111
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,460
beliefs here. Yeah. I'm a complete moderate. That's why you're in the middle. Yeah. With a yellow

112
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,540
microphone. Uh-huh, and I have never really... Wait, I have a blue microphone and he has a red microphone.

113
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Do we have to switch them out? Yeah.

114
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:36,540
I have never fully affiliated with a party for long enough to really understand anything.

115
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,540
I was a liberal from 2011 to 2012.

116
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:46,540
From 2012 to 2013 I became conservative after reading a couple articles.

117
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,540
And then after watching my favorite show, I became a South Park conservative.

118
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,820
conservative which I don't know if you can you can see here scoot to your right

119
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:07,780
to my right yeah okay I see that little patch yeah there I think that's the logo

120
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,940
of the political party oh nice and can you tell us what that entails being a

121
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,180
South Park conservative um it means that I agree with all of the ideas of Cartman

122
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,300
Okay, which I mean I'm not familiar with it's a little well. Well. I did because I was only a South Park conservative from

123
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,940
2013 to

124
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,420
2016 okay, and then at that point I I I mean it's a

125
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:40,540
Pretty similar already I became libertarian did a little lateral move there. Yeah, but then I became a South Park conservative again

126
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,100
And currently I'm a member of a political party that I made up

127
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,300
Called the birthday party and we do all sorts of vermin supreme type shit, but I'm a supreme big fan

128
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,940
Yeah, I also don't know when the elections are happening and it's it's mostly about throwing a good birth

129
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,820
So you actually like so let me just get this let's go ahead and jump into this this guy actually thinks it's something like

130
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,820
Vermin supreme is making a mockery out of the political

131
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:14,700
You actually enjoy crap like that well, yeah, I think I'm I funny costume you have a funny costume on

132
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
That's your hair. What do you mean your costume?

133
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
You haven't always had that?

134
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,700
No. See, I'm plum bald under this wig.

135
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Who would call that plum bald?

136
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm completely bald.

137
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,700
What kind of plums do you eat where they have black hair an inch thick all over them?

138
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Yeah, I don't think I'm eating the right plums.

139
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
No, you must not be.

140
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Get that hair back on your head.

141
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Must not be.

142
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Yeah.

143
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,020
Get that hat, or that hair back on your head.

144
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Yeah, I have to.

145
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,500
I mean, it's part of the birthday party.

146
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,260
To bring it back to the debate about Vermin Supreme, I mean, as a kind of comedic, ironic,

147
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,060
I'll say it, dirtbag leftist, I think that funny and ironic costumes are actually great.

148
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,980
Like as you'll notice, if you saw somebody like me, a comedic leftist who votes for Shrek,

149
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,260
Garfield, Death Grips, this type of thing, you'll see a guy like me dressed like this

150
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
walking down the street, you think,

151
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
"You know what I'd do? I'd punch you in the fucking face, you bastard!"

152
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
No, you wouldn't, because you'd see what I'm wearing right now,

153
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,260
you'd think, "This guy's a USA Republican conservative,

154
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,260
he's wearing a shirt that says 'God Bless America'

155
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,260
and a hat that has an army gun that says something on it."

156
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
And what you would think is,

157
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
"This is a Republican wearing Republican clothing."

158
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Little do you know, it's like Halloween for me.

159
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,260
I'm creating a comedic costume like dressing up for Austin Powers.

160
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Interesting. I actually wouldn't think,

161
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,260
in no way would I think that you were a conservative,

162
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,260
because you do have colored hair,

163
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,960
and it would be very, very obvious to me that you were basically a liberal woman type person.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
You have cutted hair.

165
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I have. I have what's called a crew cut, okay, and it's very popular in the Republican Senate.

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,460
Yeah, it looks like a fuzzy nut.

167
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,960
As a moderate right now.

168
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Can you maybe tone down the comedic part of your leftist attitude?

169
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah, and your children are ugly.

170
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
And I don't even have children for the first...

171
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Good.

172
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,340
Okay, so actually what you're doing is actually it's actually called ad hominem, and it's completely

173
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:15,380
Yeah, he said that he said he believes in okay. Well. You're you have a you are a complete turd this guy doesn't even

174
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,600
Know that

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,140
You can't even engage with a woman. That's not true. I make a child

176
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm gonna stay directly in the middle still until one of you okay well in that case. Let's talk about let's maybe cool

177
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Let's talk about policy. Okay. Can we talk about policy? How about the war on drugs? Okay?

178
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,040
I bet you fucking like smoking dope. Yeah, wait dope pot and more. Oh my god. He actually liked a little done

179
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,960
You can't be serious, and I think the war on drugs should be Thor on drugs

180
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,160
They should make a movie that has psychedelic imagery with Thor in it. I don't

181
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,920
I don't side with that anymore

182
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,960
Directed by taiko a TT. Yeah, I'm not I don't fuck with that crap. I don't really care taiko a t for kit taiko psycho

183
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,260
psycho

184
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,700
Crazy TT. I don't like him very much

185
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,420
I'm on his side now because I think that his voice strikes me as a bit gay whatever accent that is

186
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,440
Kind of gay to me. I think gay people rule the world in a good way

187
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,380
Well, I think they definitely rule the world you were very close there

188
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,900
You said you in a good way got you to move over to the left

189
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,220
Yeah, well, I think that it's a bad thing I

190
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm not really budging on this one.

191
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
Oh my god. Okay, well what's next on policy?

192
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,400
Well, I personally, I mean, I'm curious to hear what you think about this.

193
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Yeah, I'm curious.

194
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
It's actually...

195
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,900
Is that, were you saying that in a good way?

196
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Is it a good way or a bad way?

197
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
I'm saying that in a bad way.

198
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Okay, then I'm gonna stay over here.

199
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Okay.

200
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
I'm actually a staunch supporter of hipsterism.

201
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,400
You're a, uh...

202
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,900
And I think it should be enshrined in the code of law.

203
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
I bet you...

204
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm in the middle. I'm back in the middle.

205
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,900
In fact, I don't even think we should have laws now that I think about it.

206
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Hipsterism should be codified in the Declaration of Independence.

207
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
You think that should be in the Constitution?

208
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
I think that should be the only thing.

209
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
The only amendment should be what? And how would you phrase that?

210
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Hipsterism.

211
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,900
And let me guess, you'd probably think it'd be funny to make it the 420th amendment.

212
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Yeah. Either that or the 69th or...

213
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Um...

214
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Uh...

215
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
420-69...

216
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
4...

217
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
4... 42,000...

218
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
42-0s...

219
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Here's what I think.

220
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
He touched my hat.

221
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

222
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm back over here.

223
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Here's what I think.

224
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
I'm back on his side because he believes.

225
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
I don't steal.

226
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
He believes.

227
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
He's lying.

228
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
He believes.

229
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Hey, we can agree on that, pal.

230
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Watch this.

231
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Hey, Cameron.

232
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
That's my.

233
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Hey, you want this for free?

234
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
It's welfare.

235
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Yeah.

236
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
I love welfare.

237
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,940
And you're staying over there, you sick son of a bitch?

238
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,940
I love welfare, too.

239
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Oh my God.

240
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
I really.

241
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Sorry, I like working for my money.

242
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,260
I really don't know anything.

243
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,380
Here, can I purchase that hat?

244
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,380
Yeah.

245
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,800
I will do anything for that hat, and I mean anything.

246
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,700
- Okay.

247
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,940
- So what do you want me to do?

248
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,760
- How about you put on this wig?

249
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,260
- I'll put that wig on, yeah.

250
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,940
Well, maybe you two could talk about a policy

251
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,000
while I get dressed.

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,260
- I have no knowledge on policy at all.

253
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,180
- Do you have any concerns that maybe would affect

254
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,900
which side you would end up on?

255
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,140
(laughing)

256
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,540
- So it seems to me--

257
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,540
- Why do I look like such a pretty girl?

258
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,940
- You're a fucking Final Fantasy character.

259
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,140
- You've become what I like to call

260
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,740
a Lois Griffin conservative.

261
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,860
- You put on the fucking long white wig,

262
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,820
you become Sephiroth, and now you're fucking Sora

263
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,260
from Kingdom Hearts.

264
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,780
(laughing)

265
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,380
You're just an anime guy.

266
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,620
(laughing)

267
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,380
Any type of hair you put on--

268
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,820
- That looks scary.

269
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,660
Ah.

270
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,020
Okay, I like this, and I'm gonna keep it on my head.

271
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
Okay, colored hair SJW.

272
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,520
No, I'm not a-

273
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,020
That was a trick.

274
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,520
Ad hominem.

275
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
That was a trick that I played on you.

276
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
No, I'm not-

277
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,020
And I'm actually going back to my own middle party here.

278
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Okay, so maybe you should pitch us on your party.

279
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Yeah, so tell us a little bit about the birthday party.

280
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,020
You don't have to care about anything.

281
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,020
What does that mean?

282
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,020
It's all- both sides are actually fucking bad.

283
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Wait, is that- that's the policy of your party?

284
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Well, I can agree with you on half of that.

285
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,020
You can't scoot into that way.

286
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,020
Why not?

287
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Because that doesn't make any sense.

288
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
I hate fucking both sides of this political bullshit though.

289
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Wait, then you're the same guys.

290
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,020
I love the right side because of my right wing.

291
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,020
Oh, I guess I actually love the left side, I just realized.

292
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Oh, okay.

293
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
Now that I think about it. But you know what I hate?

294
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,020
What?

295
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
You know who's sitting right here?

296
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,020
Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden.

297
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
Adolf Hitler.

298
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,020
Kamala Harris. Adolf Hitler actually is sitting right there.

299
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,740
there now that's it all we have a very i another day

300
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,500
as kids are always for now not just kids are ugly hitlers

301
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,380
i don't think he had any children

302
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,500
exactly at all i couldn't even get you can have a chance to read that's

303
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,620
actually proof that he was a liberal democrat

304
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,860
is that he had dogs which are if you if i mean if somebody's childless but has a

305
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,460
dog that's i would say liberal democrat thing

306
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,780
okay fuck stick if you know if you think i feel obligated to defend a liberal

307
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,020
democrat you know the first mother here's a thing about my it's my shit so

308
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,720
So here come the insults.

309
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,540
Fuckface Von Clownstick.

310
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,660
Shit like that, right?

311
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,860
Daily Show type ad hominem arguments.

312
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Okay, Dr. Kofefe.

313
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
Okay, Dr. Kofefe.

314
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,500
Oh my god, and his hair is orange like Trump's skin.

315
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,300
I think I have to go on this side.

316
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,660
And this is a clear divide.

317
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,140
So these two represent kind of Hollywood elites, soccer coaches, that kind of person.

318
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Soccer coaches.

319
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Right?

320
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,740
Over here, this is an all-American football coach.

321
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,940
Yeah, you look like you had too many Hollywood delights, candies and foods.

322
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,340
Yeah, you look like a...

323
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,740
As fat as a balloon in a hot air balloon.

324
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
You look like Drop Dead Fred.

325
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,940
Who's Drop Dead Fred?

326
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,340
It was a movie.

327
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,340
What?

328
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,340
With Rick Mayall.

329
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,540
I haven't seen that movie.

330
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Okay, well you look like him with that wig.

331
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,140
Okay, I'm moving further over to my side because of how much...

332
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,540
You're moving further to the right?

333
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,340
No, I'm being completely... I'm being pushed even further right wing by you two, okay?

334
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,140
I'm getting... And this... I don't want to tell you what this is, right?

335
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,480
Right when I get off camera, shit's gonna get bad.

336
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,600
You're gonna wanna cut my microphone, okay?

337
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
If I get any further right than this,

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
you better tread lightly.

339
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,780
And don't tread on me.

340
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,800
- I see, I see.

341
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,520
- I see, something about don't tread on me

342
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,380
is I motherfucking hate that message,

343
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,400
but the design is so cool.

344
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,380
- I'm seeing the rage and the passion that you have

345
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,760
in your speech just now.

346
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,160
- Thank you.

347
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,380
- I think I'm kind of.

348
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,320
- Okay, hey Patrick.

349
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
- Thank you.

350
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,980
- Hey Patrick. - I like it.

351
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,820
And now I have a buddy over here.

352
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do you can't do a mic drop on that. Hey, can you switch the camera to me?

353
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,380
No

354
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,260
SpongeBob memes all right don't don't drop the mic that's so loud and really bad listen to this

355
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,060
So what other policy things you want to get into let's get it about people listen to this

356
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,240
I don't even care okay that I okay

357
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,180
So it's one thing to be a fucking liberal Democrat, but to be a nihilist and not I do think they should all get free

358
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,660
medicine that costs a hundred thousand dollars and other people should

359
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,820
have to work for it. You think that my ginger ass should be out there slaving

360
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,140
day and night, which by the way we were the original slaves, I think everyone

361
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,020
can agree with that, ginger people like me. You think that we should have to work

362
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,940
our hard asses sitting in the pill factory, right, at a pill press. I

363
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,100
sit at that pill press all day. I'm pressing Xanax, I'm pressing Welbutrin,

364
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,300
Life-saving medication. That's right. You think that that should be free?

365
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,380
Yeah, because I think a guy in a flannel needs to be able to eat ice cream without pooping his pants. Okay

366
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,700
Say asshat. Yeah, usually because I don't like sarcasm and irony

367
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,860
So I mean it literally like you have you could have an and you know, he looks like he looks like gritty

368
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:01,460
So I actually like him. I'm not well, you're with gritty. You are missing out what I'm missing out pull up gritty

369
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,140
What the hell's gritty pull up gritty? Well, this looks like a delightful

370
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
sports iconography piece

371
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,460
This looks okay, right. What's so wrong about being a hockey mascot. We like gritty

372
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,240
Wait, okay, so I like gritty - then he seems pretty awesome. Yeah

373
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,200
Can you pull up a gritty me? I'm sure he would yeah

374
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,140
I'll pull up gritty memes search gritty memes here and pull these up. I'm not so sure what that means memes

375
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,100
You're gonna like memes. That's so this is that's the nice means of production you got there be a shame if someone seized it, okay

376
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:40,440
So that's basically the opposite of your whole so so even though I am a right-wing Republican even I can admit that's just funny. Yeah

377
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,100
Really

378
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,680
Is that Wow person of the year it's a Muppet of the year yeah, it's a mascot of okay

379
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:05,180
Okay, now pull up big chungus all right. Oh my goodness pull up big chungus leftist meme big chungus and gritty

380
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:12,020
Okay, pull up leftism. Yeah, big chungus left. Okay, so pull this up. Okay, so this is all right is is

381
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:19,800
Not true, so that's missus fucking propaganda. That's dr. Prager Prager is a very is a good friend of mine. He's a very good man

382
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,220
He knows that if you're not this is sized you might as well be in a dumpster

383
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,620
It says the left wants to take away big chungus, and I just want to say that's not fucking true

384
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,100
Okay, and also this type of propaganda is evil

385
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,940
And they should could take a page out of North Korea's book if they're trying to create something

386
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,940
That's nice and helps people I'd take a page out of North Korea's book

387
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,260
And I'd crumple it up, and I'd play paper bin basketball with it at the office

388
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:50,860
Yeah, I miss every shot cuz you're a fucking clown if I if I go toe-to-toe in a presidential fitness test

389
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,860
I'll fuck you up kiddo

390
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
If I

391
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,420
If I picked up North Korea's book, I don't think I'd understand a goddamn thing that's written in it

392
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,920
I bet you I bet you can agree on that

393
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,580
I bet you were the kid who faked asthma to get out of the presidential fitness. No actually I actually I did not fake it

394
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,820
okay, and

395
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,660
Is sometimes when you have asthma?

You can't do things like your homework or running or being nice to your mom this leftoid once a presidential Johnny test

Yeah, that's right.

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,340
That's what I'm saying.

417
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,700
Nitty gritty political discourse.

418
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,540
OK, keep bringing on the attacks.

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
(laughter)

431
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
So that was how much we were about the funniest thing ever.

432
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Alright, well then I'm glad you're being mad about it, asshole.

433
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
(laughter)

434
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Whatever happened to the old...

435
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
And I support K-pop.

436
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
You're staying on...

437
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
After he used a vicious slur,

438
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
like snow roach.

439
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
That shit made me laugh.

440
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Okay, well you're both a couple of...

441
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
That's what it's about though, it's about laughing.

442
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
It's about laughing and holding hands with others and helping the world get...

443
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,200
I also fucking leave the birthday party fucking murdering some motherfucking CEOs. Okay, let's get this started. Okay, by the way

444
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,020
I start fucking murdering so here's here's a clear example by the way of how leftist distort reality

445
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,880
He just said mother motherfucking

446
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,600
So first of all you missed like four fucking words their ass hat and you made it into a hip

447
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,480
Now you're saying I actually came up with a comedic leftist song recently. Oh, yeah, it's a parody of a different song

448
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,800
And it's kind of similar to, it's a little bit about killing CEOs. I can't sing it.

449
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Yeah, okay, Weird Al Gender Switch.

450
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
But I can hum the tune.

451
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Come on. Weird Al, Weird Al, get that again. Let me get a clean take of that.

452
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Okay, Weird Al Gender Switch.

453
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
That's pretty good.

454
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,800
That's pretty good. So I came up with this comedic leftist song that goes like...

455
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,960
(humming)

456
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,200
(laughing)

457
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:06,480
- I think that this, that song,

458
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,600
I mean I'll write down the lyrics and send them to you later,

459
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,720
but I think it really communicates comedic leftism.

460
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,200
And it really like--

461
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,000
- Might even have been the peak of comedic leftism.

462
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,840
Might have been maybe the greatest ever doing.

463
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,880
- It might have all been ended at that point,

464
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,760
all comedic leftism.

465
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,600
But then it also could be a young--

466
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,680
- There also could be a Mario edition on YouTube.

467
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,520
(laughing)

468
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,000
- True.

469
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,080
- Which I would really love to see.

470
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,060
- Close this up.

471
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,640
No, we don't need to see that.

472
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,880
(laughing)

473
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,920
All right, well this is getting--

474
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,320
- They done turned that boy to Mario.

475
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,440
- This is getting out of hand, I would say.

476
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
This is getting completely out of hand.

477
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,520
(laughing)

478
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,780
This is some kind of...

479
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,260
We have a lot of new listeners coming,

480
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,360
they're gonna have no idea what the hell we're talking about.

481
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,600
It's gonna send them down a bad rabbit hole.

482
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,680
All these little 10 year olds who watch The Yard

483
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,760
are gonna come here and be like,

484
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,960
what the fuck's going on with these psychos?

485
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,040
They're all gonna be so confused.

486
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,880
Yeah.

487
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Oh man.

488
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,540
Yeah.

489
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,760
I saw another comedic leftist video about Starbucks.

490
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,920
Yeah.

491
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,200
Okay, so...

492
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,320
But what I like to...

493
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,600
If you take it at its word,

494
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,280
It's kind of like your end of the political spectrum.

495
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,720
But if you look at it through an ironic lens.

496
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,240
And you know what I just remembered you from

497
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,160
is a video shot in a car.

498
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,200
Now that was me.

499
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,040
That one was me.

500
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah, that one was actually me.

501
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,680
Yeah, no.

502
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
And I stand by that one, by the way.

503
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,640
That one, I had a little bit of flip-flopping kind of era

504
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,440
where I was going, oh, a left-oid kind of video.

505
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Yeah, comedic, yeah.

506
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,480
Yeah, right-winger kind of video.

507
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,200
Now I'm solidly just a normal right-wing Republican type.

508
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,280
I will say I find a lot of stuff pretty disrespectful that Trump and Governor DeSandwich are doing

509
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
that's not very good.

510
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Governor DeSandwich.

511
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,320
Or whatever his name is.

512
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,120
I don't think that any of that is very, very good for America in the political discourse.

513
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm more in the Ayn Rand kind of version of Republican where it's like we need to be respectful,

514
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,960
we need to do eugenics, we need to not make...

515
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,080
I think you should check out South Park Conservatism.

516
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,560
Yeah, I think Link from motherfucking Legend of Zelda should chop your head off.

517
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,880
Okay, that don't make no sense.

518
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
You know what?

519
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
First of all, Legend of Zelda...

520
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,520
I could handle almost every single ad hominem attack that you've done today, but that one

521
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
was too far.

522
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
I don't care.

523
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
I don't give a shit.

524
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,300
Listen, I don't give a shit who I alienate when I'm doing my transgressive and some would

525
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,760
say ironic comedy.

526
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
I don't even care.

527
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,360
To me, it's all about making myself laugh and making my friends laugh.

528
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
And guess what?

529
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,840
It doesn't matter what we say because we all know we support healthcare.

530
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,120
So you're saying, "So what, we get drunk?

531
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
So what, we smoke weed?"

532
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Yeah, exactly.

533
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,680
Is that by your band Blink 182 Genders?

534
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,720
Because I blinked in 2014 and woke up 182 genders.

535
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,820
Yeah, and that's from your band, Blink 18 2-year-olds.

536
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
Maybe 2 18-year-olds.

537
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,560
Maybe 2 18-year-olds from a Hardee's commercial who are both eating hamburgers with me and

538
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,940
roasted onions on me

539
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,080
yeah i think you know you've also heard that her into my own my penis that's

540
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,320
from your bed and i was remembered uh... brand the offspring

541
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,980
uh... the offspring offspring that i think yes actually

542
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,240
not what it was our by and and i'll be like you know the offspring the uh...

543
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,760
the offspring that looks of was fuckin there's no way in that's why you

544
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
probably want to abort them now

545
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,460
yes abortionist

546
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,520
that's usually why i like i support abortion is going looking at these

547
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,640
fucking republicans children

548
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,140
and i'm like these children are so ugly and we're going to have a look at what

549
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,500
you call them chugs

550
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,220
yeah i don't know what i would call them

551
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,360
judge in years

552
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,680
has a lot of them they're growing up and these these uh... they're gonna turn

553
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,120
into fat shards

554
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,320
and i i that's right by support body shaming

555
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,120

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,280
personality disorder i'm proud of it and i'm a man

562
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,960
yep there goes your leftist cred

563
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,240
yep you're done for well what you see what you have me all wrong i'm not a

564
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,400
normal leftist i'm a comedic leftist it's actually better to be a man as a comedic

565
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,360
leftist oh i didn't realize that yeah actually because women can't meme

566
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,040
Damn. Okay, so again, I'm not really into the misogyny stuff, okay?

567
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,480
That is not so much my bag

568
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,800
as you would leftistly put it. Yeah, I'd like to see you in a bag

569
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,680
banged around the back of a truck. So there goes the violent part and that's where I can smell the

570
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,000
Che Guevara on you.

571
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,280
Is that you're like, "Oh, we'll kill the dissidents." And you see me as a dissident, you're doing

572
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,200
Robocop vision, perfect alpha male detected and then you want to kill me.

573
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,360
And meanwhile you look like a fucking ugly piece of shit.

574
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
How do I look pretty in my new wig?

575
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,520
He does look pretty in his new wig looks pretty nice. I will say as a moderate

576
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,640
I think we can so maybe you can scoot on over to the beautiful side

577
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,540
Maybe leave this dirty you you're like pigpin from the peanuts. You're just I see flies

578
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:18,840
No, no, no that's based in true reality I saw a roach under your arm when you raised it up

579
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,440
No, you didn't I did what you did roach

580
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,880
Might have been that yeah probably come from all that smoking. He's doing yeah, and so let's get into mass

581
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,840
Yeah, I love I love being on this side in the middle here because I can look I think that he sucks

582
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,920
I think that he sucks so when I see when I see a mass shooting in the news

583
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,580
Yeah, my first thought is great more fodder for my jokes to my friends. Yeah, I bet you do

584
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm doing run hide fight. You're sitting there. You're thinking. I'm gonna laugh laugh laugh jack off laugh and and fucking die

585
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,420
Yeah, or just laugh laughing. I'm gonna be a target. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be the next target you're in the school

586
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,360
Mm-hmm no cuz I'm in the middle in the school. Why are you doing in the school?

587
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,320
There's not a mass shootings don't just happen at schools. We were talking about school one

588
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,500
Yeah, I thought you're talking about the one that happened at my school. You'd be at a garlic festival. Yeah, okay

589
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,640
I think you and me can reach across the aisle and agree

590
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,160
That's a weird spin way to spend your time as a grown man. What going to the garlic festival. Yeah for me

591
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,160
it's like more music festivals. For you it's probably more butt festivals.

592
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
And for me it's like...

593
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Butt festivals for you.

594
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
No, not butt. No, no. Maybe book fairs.

595
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
I like book fairs.

596
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Scholastic book fairs.

597
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
With that haircut you look like you're going to be going to a Ren Fair.

598
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Okay, well, there I go scooting ever so more rightward.

599
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
And here I am just barely on camera at this point.

600
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
If you go to the wide, my left arm is...

601
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Oh man, this left arm is reaching into kind of Mussolini territory at this point.

602
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,960
But now that you're this far away,

603
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,120
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,520
- We can't appreciate this.

605
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
- I actually hate wildlife aquariums.

606
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
- Holy crap.

607
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
- So let me guess, wait,

608
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,480
- I think it's, I actually--

609
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,480
- Wait, so you think that we evolved from that?

610
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
- Yes.

611
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I think I evolved from this specifically.

612
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,120
- I actually also hate wildlife aquariums.

613
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,940
- Really?

614
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,300
- I think wildlife should be free.

615
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,580
- Yeah, free to buy and eat.

616
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,420
- Yeah.

617
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,240
- Oh!

618
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
- Yeah, I said it.

619
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,400
- He suggested that?

620
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,680
- He wants to eat a turtle.

621
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,520
- He wants to eat a turtle?

622
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,960
- And we're gonna sit there and just let that happen.

623
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,040
So hard it's show as you break your teeth you know I go out fucking fuck me and my uncle go out there on those deep

624
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,400
Fish sea boater the boat fish the deep fish deep sea boat deep sea fishing boat deep sea fishing

625
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,760
And we get a couple of six-packs right we down them

626
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,980
Then we put the rings on the end of a fucking line cast that bad boy out of the ocean

627
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,420
Beluga whale catch him right there reel them in we make barbecue salad out of that barbecue salad

628
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,820
It's a new thing that we created out of whale meat.

629
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:51,420
That wig just started to have like a second wave on me when you were talking.

630
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,940
This is the last thing, this face is the last thing most endangered animals ever see before

631
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,420
they're gone off this earth forever.

632
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,420
Their only hope is that they find them in amber somewhere.

633
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Right?

634
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Stop laughing at my face.

635
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,660
(laughing)

636
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,860
- You really do, you really do look like a Japanese person

637
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,500
to a white person.

638
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,340
- Really?

639
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,580
I feel like I'm a compliment.

640
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,840
(laughing)

641
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,220
- You look like, you look like anime Ron Weasley.

642
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,460
(laughing)

643
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:32,860
- You look like Ollie London.

644
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,100
(laughing)

645
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,780
- That is not me at all.

646
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,660
No, look up, look up, who's like a strong--

647
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,860
- You look like, you look like,

648
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,580
you look like when Klasky Kuspo made

649
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,300
Ronald McDonald animated.

650
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,420
- Look up Kaworu from Evangelion.

651
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,140
- See, I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.

652
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,100
What are these, sushi rolls?

653
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,920
Come on.

654
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,660
- From Evangelion, type in Evangelion.

655
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,340
Which I love as a leftist, I should bring up.

656
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,380
- I bet you do.

657
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,820
(laughing)

658
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:22,400
I like evangelism it's crazy how much hair changes my entire I've been a major

659
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,360
way I don't remember what it was like that I'd you know I said pretty much

660
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
It's just the exact same thing.

661
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
(laughter)

662
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
I barely remember it at this point.

663
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Alright, you know what?

664
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
Is it time to

665
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
kind of settle this debate

666
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
once and for all? Do we have a final topic

667
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
that you'd like to tackle? You were the only one

668
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
I think who came prepared with

669
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
facts. Me? Yeah.

670
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
I think that's pretty apparent.

671
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Emotions, facts.

672
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
I think I've realized that

673
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
you and I,

674
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Republican and me as kind of a comedic ironic

675
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,880
Shrek ism leftist. Yes

676
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,760
We maybe have more in common than I thought and it's maybe that I think what that I agree with your stuff

677
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,300
I think it's funny to do it's if I think it would be funny if I was a Republican

678
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,880
I think maybe I could be it would be funny for me to be a Republican. Really? Yeah

679
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,900
Well, if that's the and I think that it's funny to to do that and I've been lying

680
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,620
I've been on his side the whole time. You've always been a Republican. Yes, sir. I'd like I mean

681
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,720
I need to actually.

682
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,580
I would say this podcast is fully a Republican podcast.

683
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,940
I mean, we're not--

684
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,740
I don't really want to break kayfabe here,

685
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,340
but I mean, if anyone-- it's a fake debate, obviously.

686
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,420
We're breaking kayfabe.

687
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,820
Obviously, Cameron was a parody.

688
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,660
A straw man parody that we just hurled insults at.

689
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,540
And me, I was just up here being myself.

690
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,580
Exactly.

691
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,220
I really don't think of that about--

692
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,580
I want to make this really clear,

693
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,020
because I know it's like my face saying it on video,

694
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,460
and so that's maybe bad.

695
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,600
I really think, I think that all Republican children are beautiful.

696
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,260
Yes, he does.

697
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
I don't think they're fat.

698
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
No.

699
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
If anything...

700
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
And I think they should be cherished.

701
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
Yeah, they should not be rolled down a hill.

702
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,060
No, or rolled in breadcrumbs or rolled...

703
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,860
Or put in a big cauldron and with stock and celery.

704
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,660
Right, and cutting carrots directly into the cauldron.

705
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,260
And a witch is circling and whistling.

706
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,060
And that's what they're doing at over 3,000 Planned Parenthoods here in America.

707
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,060
Exactly.

708
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,460
put that they've the child is completely born they put him into a soup

709
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,620
uh... they make stock out of the child and i i really i really think it's wrong

710
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,500
what leftists are doing i i don't think i've heard this through executing

711
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,000
republican children you know how they're doing this what they've been locking them

712
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,780
in sky zone for twenty four hours wild

713
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,020
that's awful with your beast

714
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,940
mister bs that's an upstanding republican yes i hope that he becomes a

715
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,140
president one day

716
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,980
so this is a way i think that we can all uh... we can tackle one of our favorite

717
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:54,460
websites today. Yeah. Right? Which is conservopedia.com. Okay? So this is... I

718
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,880
mean, this is... we already... no introduction is needed. We go here every day.

719
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,540
It's my home page. We've already... we discovered this or discussed it on the Patreon episode.

720
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,780
So here's the splash page. Conservopedia, the trustworthy

721
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,660
encyclopedia. It's clear that some Patriots saw... Wikipedia saw that any old

722
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,300
leftist left-winger Democrat could add whatever they wanted to it. Not only

723
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:24,060
a true conservative patriot but a member of the

724
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:34,620
Schlafly family. What's that? His mom was a very like staunch anti-feminist

725
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,740
speaker. I've never seen anybody wear on their face how hard they're thinking as

726
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:45,260
much as you do. You like blinked like four times. I was trying to remember what I read about it.

727
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,800
That was me remembering how to type. She was a patriotic, anti-feminist woman. She was a patriotic, one of the

728
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,420
most, one of the most, actually and you know what, for a woman, even though she

729
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,540
was a woman, I actually did like hearing her talk. Oh wow. Okay. So this is the

730
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,700
Conservapedia, the trustworthy encyclopedia. Here's some popular articles

731
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,940
at Conservapedia. The Equal Rights Amendment, I bet that one's good.

732
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:12,940
Conservapedia, Proven Right, Benjamin Franklin, Mystery, Does God Have a Sense of Humor?

733
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,300
which I checked in on it and I didn't didn't make a slide for it but one of the

734
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,080
things is one of the evidences for that was that there's duck-billed platypi and

735
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:27,560
it said it how funny is that which is true. Scientism, which I don't know what

736
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:36,560
that is really. Augusto Pinochet. What else on here? Arnold Schwarzenegger.

737
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,700
Oh, underrated sports stars. Yeah. And then Pete Rose is in there.

738
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,880
Algar Hiss, I'm guessing that is a snake. Yeah. So you missed

739
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,540
overcoming homosexuality. Yeah. I could take a look at that. I have no interest in

740
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,320
that page, personally. But this is what one I really like on here, which is

741
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,980
Hollywood values. Hollywood values also known today as Hollywoke or Hollyweird

742
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,440
quote-unquote values are characterized by spreading sexually transmitted diseases,

743
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,600
public obscenities, decadence, narcissism, hypocrisy, rampant drug abuse, abortion,

744
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,240
adultery, lawlessness, and the promotion of the homosexual agenda and cultural

745
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,500
Marxist. I do like that both Hollywoke and Hollyweird were so good

746
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:24,960
that they had to... They couldn't give them up. Yeah it's just Hollywoke has a... it

747
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,080
It doesn't sound bad.

748
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,920
- Right.

749
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,040
- Hollywoke doesn't sound like fucking bullshit.

750
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,360
- Sounds bad to me.

751
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,200
- Woke stuff.

752
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,320
- In 2014, even in the context of the fashion industry

753
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,360
dress stars of the Academy Awards

754
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,840
and celebrations of St. Valentine's Day,

755
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,080
61% of Americans agreed Hollywood has too much influence

756
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,960
on American politics and social values.

757
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,000
- This is nice 'cause I fucking hate

758
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,400
that people are trying to take the saint

759
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,800
out of St. Valentine's Day.

760
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,640
- Yeah.

761
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,840
Did you pull up anything for St. Valentine's Day?

762
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
No, it wasn't all that interesting.

763
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
I just wanted to know what a...

764
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
We can always freestyle at the end of the day.

765
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
I think we all know what St. Valentine's Day is.

766
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,840
It's when a man gives a woman chocolates.

767
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Yes.

768
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
And a woman gives a man...

769
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
A back rub.

770
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
A hand in marriage.

771
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Yes.

772
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
Okay.

773
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Hand in marriage job.

774
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
And service.

775
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Forever.

776
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
In perpetuity.

777
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Yes.

778
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Is what I like to say.

779
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
To my wife.

780
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,640
I feel like I'm so sick of these Hollywood values

781
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,080
and just getting into American culture, right?

782
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,580
It's always, you know, you can't drive two feet

783
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,000
on the BQE here in New York City.

784
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,680
That's, you know, giant shootout,

785
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,040
people doing back flips on top of semi trucks,

786
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
cars exploding right in front of you.

787
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,160
- And they're all driving hybrid cars.

788
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,980
- Yeah, they're all--

789
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,160
- And even the buses are hybrid now.

790
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,120
- Even the buses have back flips.

791
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,680
- I also, these Hollywood values leaking in,

792
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,440
I mean, you're speaking, you're speaking about hybrid.

793
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,680
I saw a hybrid called a Predalien.

794
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,180
Wow.

795
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,660
That I think was influenced by Hollywood.

796
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Yeah, it was disgusting. It was gooey and slimy, and it had a predator's mouth and an alien's mouth combined.

797
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,100
They have made, even in New York City, liberal New York,

798
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,540
they have made the buses hybrid.

799
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,040
Yeah.

800
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,660
I, back in my day, every bus rolled coal.

801
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,160
Yeah.

802
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,280
Every single bus.

803
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,780
Uh-huh.

804
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,540
You would stand at the bus stop, you'd come onto the bus covered in soot.

805
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,040
Yep.

806
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,760
Sometimes a bus would break down, they'd have to call their supervisor, come out and say,

807
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,720
"God damn it, there it is, the catalytic converter's still in this goddamn thing." Rip it out with his

808
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,040
teeth, right? Spin it on the ground. And you know, sometimes it would break down and that wasn't the

809
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,240
issue, they couldn't figure out how to fix it. You know what? Everybody on the bus would get off

810
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,160
and push it. They'd work hard. Everybody. And now there's this whole movement, by the way,

811
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,440
speaking of catalytic converters, young American patriots going around, helping out,

812
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,700
being good Samaritans, helping out working families by taking the catalytic

813
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,720
converters out of Subarus and Fords.

814
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,240
Right? And those are good people. Those are good American cars.

815
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,080
Yeah, because you get in there... A Subaru? That's an American car. Yeah, I think it's from Detroit.

816
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,880
You get in that car... Can you imagine? Christmas Day, right?

817
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,200
You get in your car, maybe... And there's a bow on top of that car. There's a bow on top of the car,

818
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,460
the catalytic converter is

819
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,720
gone, right? It's already been shipped off to a communist country like South Korea.

820
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,500
They turn that bad boy on, just coal blows right in your dog's face.

821
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
You gotta go, "It's a Christmas miracle."

822
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
Yeah. Beautiful.

823
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,200
Yeah.

824
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,400
You know what they should do?

825
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,900
What?

826
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,400
These patriots who are taking off the catalytic converters,

827
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
they should also add those whistles.

828
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,200
I agree.

829
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,000
Into the exhaust.

830
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah. Let's do it.

831
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,400
And you know what? Put a couple of crushed Pepsi cans behind the wheels.

832
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:37,520
And the nuts and put the truck nuts on and maybe those truck nuts on those cars and that's I love looking at those nuts

833
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,040
When they're on trucks, let's add a kappa sticker. Let's just go for it salt life on the whole back window

834
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,480
Next oh, so here's some of the contents here Hollywood is a tool of anti-social pedagogy

835
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,720
conflict over values description death sexually transmitted diseases crime falsehoods disrespective marriage

836
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,740
Offensive behavior slash moral depravity and then Hollywood actor Dan Aykroyd on bestiality. Oh wow

837
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,240
Yes, I'd like to touch on that really

838
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,920
Yeah, this is Hollywood actor liberal Dan Aykroyd on bestiality

839
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,920
I draw the line at bestiality because it's unfair to the dog or the cat if the dog or the cat had consciousness

840
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Then that'd be okay with me

841
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,120
Bastard Wow I see I for some reason I believed that

842
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,880
The comments or his comments would only be about getting blown by a ghost

843
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,260
Yeah, I was gonna ask what his thoughts were on on sex with ghosts. Yeah, well

844
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,960
I don't like that's pretty apparent

845
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,400
Is that a ghost a beast? A ghost is a beast. A ghost is absolutely a Halloween beast. Yeah, okay

846
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,520
Well, I think conservapedia might beg to differ

847
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,360
Pull up ghost. I don't think I have ghost there might be a ghost thing. My clicker is broken

848
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,520
Am I maybe?

849
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,280
So here's some more Hollywood weirdos director John Waters claims that his biggest influence for his quote-unquote

850
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,180
Films are pornographic movies in addition. He is openly homosexual and thinks he's okay

851
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,780
He you know what okay his tiny little mustache. Yeah, it's people who have tiny mustaches must be gay

852
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,140
And you know what John Waters made a movie called serial mom

853
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,220
Right no serial mom. Oh, he wants to

854
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:19,660
completely make a buffoonery over the nuclear family. Exactly, give me bacon, egg

855
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,380
and cheese in the morning, mom. You know what another movie he made was called?

856
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,100
Huh. And you guys... What is it? Just say it. Because you're gonna be grossed out.

857
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,580
Okay. Say it. He made a movie called Pecker. Oh, god damn. He made a movie called... Wait, so it's about a

858
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,820
bird? No. Oh. It's about a boy who takes pictures of... Don't even... Okay. Okay.

859
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,340
So I just I searched ghost on conservapedia really quick. They do have a

860
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,180
page for ghosts but it's for Ghost the Band.

861
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:54,340
Alright, whatever. Agnostic and left-leaning Cenk Ugar and his view on

862
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,340
the legalization of bestiality in some circumstances. Cenk Ugar, the

863
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,860
creator and host of the left-leaning The Young Turks web news show

864
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,500
said, "I'm a young turd." Yeah, that's what I like to call him. "I'm agnostic now. I was

865
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,440
born Muslim. My whole family is Muslim." Maybe, Juby, if you could add some spooky

866
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,600
music behind that. In 2013, Cenk Uygur said that if he had the power to do so, he would

867
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,880
legalize bestiality in cases where the person is pleasuring the animal and the animal appears

868
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,480
not to mind. Do we have a close down clip of this? I don't think we do. I would love

869
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:35,800
to hear him saying this. But I mean, I believe it, right? It's right there on Kitsubopedia.

870
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,780
It's interesting that he's saying specifically that he would legalize it if he had the power

871
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,660
to do so. Not that necessarily he thinks it should be legalized, but if I had the power

872
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,220
I would legalize that. I'm not going to petition for it.

873
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,060
No, he's not too active in the world.

874
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,540
But if I found myself in a position where that came across my desk, I would probably

875
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
stamp it.

876
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,740
He wins a President for the Day contest. Somehow the piece of paper slides across his desk

877
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,980
and just says the dog fucking bill.

878
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:08,260
I'll tell you what, I'd hate to see Cenk Uygur as the President of the United States.

879
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,640
agnostic president first of all.

880
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,520
- And you know what I'd hate to see even more?

881
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,980
Him fucking a dog.

882
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,980
- Yeah, well, you know why he's partin' in that turkey,

883
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,820
that's the problem there.

884
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,660
- Yeah, exactly.

885
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,480
- Oh yeah.

886
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,720
- So he can, hey, it'll be doin' a different

887
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,560
kind of gobbling.

888
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,140
- That's right, he's fillin' his asshole with--

889
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,980
- On his giblets.

890
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,620
- Fillin' his asshole with bird seed.

891
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,460
Disgusting.

892
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,300
- Stuffing.

893
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,120
- Disgusting.

894
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,960
- He's puttin' peanut butter on his butt.

895
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,980
- Stuffing and gravy.

896
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,060
- No, okay.

897
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,220
- Well, he'll be making gravy.

898
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,860
- Here's another Hollywood elite, Adolf Hitler.

899
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,920
- Okay.

900
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,760
What does he look like?

901
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Hitler and his youth, so here's the truth about Adolf Hitler. Hitler and his youth was a financially irresponsible bohemian.

902
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,760
A German word of the time roughly the same as the English term "hippie".

903
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Ugh! Yuck!

904
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
So there, it's settled! Hitler was a hippie.

905
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Hey, there's one hippie that I respect. I'll tell you who it is.

906
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Who's that?

907
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Charles Manson. Okay, you know why?

908
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
Why's that?

909
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
Because he made the entire world hate hippies.

910
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
That's right.

911
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
Rightfully.

912
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Thank you, Mr. Manson. We salute you.

913
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
He knew what was up.

914
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Tip of the hat to you, sir.

915
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,600
Hitler may have been an atheist.

916
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Is that so?

917
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,360
Adolf Hitler is theorized to be an atheist.

918
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,640
He reportedly loathed Christianity, the bastard, and his father considered having faith a scam.

919
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,040
How fucking dare him?

920
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,800
Yeah, I mean this guy is completely disgusting in every single way.

921
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
And other beliefs, Hitler supported animal rights.

922
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,760
Oh, probably animal wrongs.

923
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
That's probably what they mean by putting the quotes there.

924
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,880
This guy was a vegetarian hippie.

925
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,360
So just think that when somebody supports animal rights or thinks that maybe we shouldn't

926
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,720
be throwing those baby chicks into that massive meat grinder.

927
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Uh-huh.

928
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
I mean that's a Hitler-rite kind of deal.

929
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
Definitely.

930
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
You know what, hey, I support animal rights.

931
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Yeah?

932
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,720
Animal rights to be eaten in a delicious dinner.

933
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,040
Animal rights, the right to be smothered and covered.

934
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,040
Mm-hmm.

935
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,040
Yeah.

936
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
And peppered and chipped.

937
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
That's right.

938
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Yeah.

939
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,040
Over there at Waffle House.

940
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,040
Yes, sir.

941
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,040
And that's moderate Patrick Doren.

942
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,040
Yep.

943
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
Profanity.

944
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,760
(laughing)

945
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,220
So, you know, we were doing this whole, again, kayfabe

946
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,360
about when we were using profanity back then,

947
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,400
a couple minutes ago.

948
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,240
- And we're not gonna use that.

949
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,080
- But we keep it clean for the most part.

950
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,320
- And dare I say it, I'm not gonna,

951
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,240
I'm gonna say it just so I can drive the point home.

952
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,080
- Okay.

953
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,120
- We're not using that crap anymore.

954
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,960
- Yeah. - No, yeah.

955
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,080
- Profanity. - And I think you guys

956
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,760
can probably tell by how awkward I sound

957
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,920
when I was saying some of those swear words.

958
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,260
Mother.

959
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,100
- Yeah, you definitely did sound awkward.

960
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:24,920
- Stuff like that.

961
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,760
- It didn't sound natural coming off your tongue.

962
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,680
- People who are maybe more constant swearers

963
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,520
might listen to that and be like,

964
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,680
this guy doesn't know what he's doing,

965
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,440
but I think I put on a pretty good show.

966
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,280
- You did.

967
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,200
- I did believe that you swear like a sailor.

968
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,440
- You did sound like a bit of a sailor.

969
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,440
- When I said A-S-S, clown, did that come across?

970
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,520
- That was pretty good.

971
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,880
- Okay, cool, cool.

972
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,720
- I've never said A-S-S in my life.

973
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,040
- So, profanity, also known as bad language,

974
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,000
swearing, cursing, or cussing, or vulgarity,

975
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,720
is the usage of words, if you can even call them words,

976
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,080
that are considered to be offensive or abusive.

977
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,920
Its use is taboo in polite or formal environments

978
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,040
and more commonly accepted in informal contexts.

979
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,760
In 2008, it was found that liberals are more than 12 times

980
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,800
likely to use profanity on the internet

981
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,480
when compared to conservatives.

982
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,840
Tell me that's shocking,

983
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,560
'cause it doesn't really shock me at all.

984
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,980
- You know, that honestly, it shocks me that it's so low.

985
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,760
- Yeah, I would think it'd maybe be 13 or 14 times more.

986
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,120
- Yeah. - And here's on the right,

987
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,280
this is one of the greatest cussers of all time,

988
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,400
Penn Jillette this guy this guy somehow he he saw magic acts, and he's yeah

989
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,480
You know what that needs a bunch of f-words and you know I actually I prefer his his his

990
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,060
Compatriot who does not cuss at all he keeps it completely clean

991
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:44,160
I think he's just I think he's afraid to speak up profane words tend to involve certain near-universal subjects filth particularly

992
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,760
Human waste forbidden sexual practices and blasphemous treatment of the sacred oh

993
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,160
- Oh gosh.

994
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,960
- That's a swear already.

995
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,560
- Among profane words, there exist at least two levels

996
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,400
of offensiveness.

997
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,680
There are also, in many languages, including English,

998
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,520
euphemisms.

999
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,440
Now I traffic in these euphemisms every so often.

1000
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Such as darn, drat, gosh, frap, and so on.

1001
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,000
- Frap, nice.

1002
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,440
- I cannot get enough of these words.

1003
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,520
I frap and love these.

1004
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,360
- Yeah, I love these as well.

1005
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,920
- It is such a good way for me to release

1006
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,560
what I'm feeling inside without stooping to the level

1007
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,240
of a junkie liberal.

1008
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,840
- The 20th century saw a shift to sexual terms

1009
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,800
as the most offensive.

1010
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,460
Recently, racial terms have grown in their offensiveness.

1011
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,640
The N-word was commonplace and acceptable

1012
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,940
until the mid-19th century.

1013
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,200
It is now too offensive for use even in male-only settings

1014
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,080
due to political correctness.

1015
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,320
(laughing)

1016
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:47,400
Yep, yep, even in male-only settings, you can't do it.

1017
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Wow, that has gotta be political correctness gone awry.

1018
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,360
Profanity in religion.

1019
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,800
According to some interpretations,

1020
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,160
profanity is prohibited by God in the Ten Commandments.

1021
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,240
My interpretation.

1022
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,760
This can be extrapolated from Commandment Three.

1023
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,300
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,

1024
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,640
for the Lord will not hold him guiltless

1025
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,160
that taketh his name in vain,

1026
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,280
since much profanity is in the form of swearing or cursing.

1027
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,280
Satan manifests in Hollywood through its insidious profanity

1028
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,000
such as seen on HBO.

1029
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,960
Wow. Oh, yeah.

1030
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:25,960
HBO. I hate HBO. Yeah. I hate bullcrap on TV. Yeah. Homosexuals, bisexuals, and over sexuals.

1031
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:32,160
And overtly sexual. Overtly sexual. Having sex on my TV. Yeah. How about off? That's what I,

1032
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,960
when I turn it up, somebody says, I'm gonna turn HBO on, I say, how about off? Yeah. Yeah,

1033
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,680
maybe press the off button on those. Hate bile and ovaries. I mean, I barely get past the first

1034
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,900
I barely get past the first five seconds of most of their programs, but even the very beginning

1035
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,400
of their shows are pornographic.

1036
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,640
You hear it's a voice going, "Ahhhhhhhhh."

1037
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
That's true.

1038
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,640
You're right.

1039
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,060
I just turn it off right immediately when I hear that.

1040
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,060
You know what they have on there now?

1041
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,060
What?

1042
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,120
One of the most demonic programs I've ever seen.

1043
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,320
What's that?

1044
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,320
Sesame Street.

1045
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Oh, God.

1046
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,760
This show that teaches your children that numbers can speak to you.

1047
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,560
Yeah, let's learn from a talking bird.

1048
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Let's go ahead and learn from a talking elephant.

1049
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,560
And you know what?

1050
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,560
This guy Grover is teaching children that it's okay to be bad at service jobs.

1051
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,560
And blue!

1052
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,560
With a big pink nose.

1053
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:34,560
By the way kids, a lot of young kids now because of Grover and the like are going into these liberal arts schools getting stuntman degrees.

1054
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,560
But enjoy being a coffee shop barista at Starbucks.

1055
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,560
Just like Grover.

1056
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,260
So here's some, they go through some of the media in America

1057
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,840
and they tell you why or why not it might be

1058
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,360
for or against conservatism,

1059
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,700
for or against good traditional family values.

1060
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,800
So this first one is American Dad.

1061
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Don't let the patriotic sounding title fool you.

1062
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,140
Like all Seth MacFarlane animated productions,

1063
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,160
it's stand behind liberalism while bashing conservatism,

1064
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,600
which is personified by protagonist Stan Smith,

1065
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,400
a Republican CIA agent.

1066
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,640
And one series regular

1067
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,600
is a sexually ambiguous extraterrestrial.

1068
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,240
In a case of truth in advertising,

1069
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,940
Stan's teenage daughter, Hailey Smith,

1070
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,120
is a far left hippie who is truish,

1071
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,640
hateful, and sometimes violent.

1072
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,480
- Truish?

1073
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,100
- Yeah, while stridently standing by her liberal views,

1074
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,880
and like Brian Griffin on Family Guy,

1075
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
is used as Seth MacFarlane's sounding board

1076
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,120
for his viewpoints on the show.

1077
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,480
Hey, Seth MacFarlane, how about you leave the tunes alone,

1078
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,520
go back to Broadway, shaking your ass, you stripper?

1079
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,360
- That's right.

1080
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,400
Seth MacFarlane, I just wanna say,

1081
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
says a lot to me that Seth MacFarlane,

1082
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,360
when he's peddling his kind of far left disgusting views,

1083
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,320
you know what kind of people he has to choose

1084
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,520
to say those views?

1085
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,640
A dog and a woman.

1086
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,480
- Yep.

1087
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,360
- Yeah, big surprise there, asshat.

1088
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,280
- Yeah, it's like if I were making a show like this,

1089
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
I would probably put--

1090
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,960
- Oh sorry, I said the A word.

1091
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,800
- Frapp hat.

1092
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,640
- Frapp hat, I meant to say?

1093
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,460
Sorry, I got so caught up in the whole--

1094
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,300
- If I was making a show like this--

1095
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,920
- You dreading frapper.

1096
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,640
- I'd probably have Superman say my views.

1097
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,360
- See, frapp, we can still say frapp

1098
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,240
in a male only setting.

1099
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,080
They haven't taken that from us yet.

1100
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,760
- No, frapp is probably one of the most common words.

1101
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,440
- It's gonna go soon though, thanks to liberals.

1102
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,280
- Probably they're gonna say,

1103
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,720
"Oh, you can't say frap anymore."

1104
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,560
- You can't say frap or drap.

1105
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,640
- Yeah, you know what they'd say?

1106
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,120
"It's offensive to milkshake Americans."

1107
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,520
- They probably would say that.

1108
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,520
Yeah, which most of these people are.

1109
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,960
Caillou, "The title character

1110
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,480
of this Canadian animated series

1111
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,360
lacks effective communication skills

1112
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,720
and throws whiny tantrums."

1113
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,320
Who's that sound like?

1114
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,160
Democrat?

1115
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,980
- Oh, Democrat.

1116
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,880
- "Teaching young audiences that behavior of that nature

1117
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,920
can get them what they want.

1118
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,080
It was eventually canceled on 2021 with parents rejoicing."

1119
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,400
Remember that parents flood in the streets yeah

1120
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:49,320
That was Patriots

1121
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,820
Was one thing I liked about that show a kid high-t kid very high-t kid bald bald it bald it

1122
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,600
You know what?

1123
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,960
Caillou's father mm-hmm should have smacked him more beat the shit out of that little kid

1124
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,880
He's bald head red swing around by the ankles

1125
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,660
Crunch pull him yes, I love egg. I love that movie Matilda mm-hmm. I fucking love I

1126
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:19,360
Wanted I will say one of the saddest endings. I've ever seen in a movie and sobbing my eyes out got independent. Yeah, no. Thank you

1127
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,680
mega babies

1128
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,840
1999 to 2000 so this has got a kind of an interesting slant to it aside from copying Rin and Stimpy because of the humor

1129
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:33,280
Rugrats because of the premise and the powerpuff girls because of the trio of heroes trend seen throughout works of fiction

1130
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,040
This Canadian animated series, please add info so they just kind of got him on ripping other ripping other

1131
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:45,560
Other car you know what and you know what being a copycat big is a liberal crime. Yeah, that's right

1132
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,040
Next is real time with Bill Maher don't even get me started

1133
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:57,120
This political talk show typically fit features a liberally slanted panel that routinely insults conservatives and religion

1134
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,280
Mar is a well-known militant atheist, he kills people for that, who denies that

1135
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,920
Jesus Christ ever walked to the earth in a manner similar to Holocaust denial.

1136
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,120
Because I would say Jesus Christ walking the earth is probably on the same level

1137
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,360
as the Holocaust, right? Yeah. Ignoring historical accounts, spiritual evidence,

1138
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,680
and even archaeological evidence of his existence. How do you ignore spiritual

1139
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,120
evidence? It's right in front of you. And archaeological. Plus he smears

1140
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,240
conservative women in a vulgar and sexist manner but receives no

1141
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,560
controversy whatsoever for it. Let's change that folks. He has even been known to the

1142
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,480
dreaded n-word to refer to black conservatives and never came under fire

1143
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,280
by the rest of the liberal media who claims to be against racism so this guy's

1144
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,120
using the dreaded n-word on TV. I think they meant to say he has even been known

1145
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:46,260
by the dreaded n-word. Oh I don't think oh yeah true he did call himself that one

1146
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:54,780
time yeah oh yeah so they also have they so it's not just TV shows it's not just

1147
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,940
TV shows they also dip into some some some music right and they say here in

1148
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,940
addition these songs are cons are these songs a conservative has to be careful

1149
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,980
to avoid as they pretend to have their values at heart but are deceitfully

1150
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:12,700
liberal ah okay so these are deceitfully liberal songs starships by Nicki Minaj a

1151
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,860
A song going to the beach and wasting money on drugs, smoking and alcohol.

1152
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,460
Basically just getting high and partying.

1153
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,060
Nothing more liberal than wasting money.

1154
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,620
That's right.

1155
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,060
Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen.

1156
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,220
This is an example of subliminal propaganda.

1157
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,420
The song seems patriotic but is in fact anti-American,

1158
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,380
tricking anybody unfortunate enough to hear the song.

1159
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,620
Even Ronald Reagan, may he rest in peace,

1160
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,580
was notoriously tricked by Springsteen into playing the song.

1161
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,580
Contains a racial slur towards Asians.

1162
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,300
What the hell?

1163
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:46,260
So even Ronald Reagan Bruce Springsteen took advantage of poor Ronald Reagan whose mind was turning into complete oatmeal

1164
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,580
Yeah, and he and he made him like this song

1165
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:53,200
By the end of his life only knew how to eat jelly beans, yeah

1166
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,900
I do love jelly beans, but that's another topic for another debate

1167
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:07,180
We're gonna have a tribute debate very sexy. So they like these are some songs that they like - so this is tribute by Tenacious

1168
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:13,480
Comedy single, but it's also a very popular song about overcoming Satan and alludes to many other Christian themes such as heaven and hell

1169
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,580
I hate Satan. Yeah, I'll say it right now. So yeah Jables and KG

1170
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:23,180
Frap that dratting bastard. Yeah, which bastard is okay, cuz that one's in the bottom. Yeah

1171
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:27,740
What else is over here room room by Charlie XCX

1172
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:32,940
Now this is written by a true American patriot straight as an arrow

1173
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:40,800
Yeah, an ode to American car culture and the American dream under capitalism anyone who works hard enough can eventually buy a lavender Lamborghini or a bubblegum

1174
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
pink

1175
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:49,820
And charlie xdx as many people know in American of an American born American patriot

1176
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:55,280
Uh-huh, she's a true American patriot. Yeah, she sings this song. I don't care. I love it

1177
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,200
Yep, she sees the Declaration of Independence or the Dead Sea Scrolls. She says you know

1178
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,060
Exactly. She said look just like that

1179
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:06,060
Here's some of the worst liberal movies.

1180
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,060
Oh, this is an essay. So this is a...

1181
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,060
These are all individual essays.

1182
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,060
...something somebody made for class.

1183
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,060
Alright. Note.

1184
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:18,060
We at Conservapedia do not care if a movie is considered a classic or that it is a famous movie that many have nostalgia for.

1185
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:26,060
If it has liberal elements and/or the creators of a certain movie had some liberal agenda in mind when crafting the story's narrative, we call it out.

1186
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:30,440
it out. Just because people love movies does not mean that Hollywood isn't trying to push

1187
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,740
a liberal agenda with them. While a good amount of great conservative films are produced every

1188
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:39,140
year, Hollywood continues to produce films that attempt to normalize and aggrandize amoral

1189
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:44,280
lifestyles and liberal bias. Below is a list of some of the more outrageous examples. So

1190
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,740
here's some liberal movies for you.

1191
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,020
Alright, let's check these out.

1192
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:53,700
Alright, number one. Milk. Sean Penn portrays openly homosexual politician Harvey Milk in

1193
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,700
this biography.

1194
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,540
That's what the movie's about?

1195
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,540
Well, that's all it says under the description.

1196
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,040
Okay.

1197
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,040
The next is Billy Elliot.

1198
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,540
This British film, now this is a crime.

1199
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,040
This British film stars a boy who represents the homosexual agenda

1200
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,040
by wanting to be a ballet dancer rather than play sports.

1201
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,540
Wow.

1202
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:14,540
There are very poor family values as the family is constantly cursing at one another.

1203
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,540
Disgusting.

1204
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,540
So this kid is so gay that he'd rather do ballet

1205
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,040
than play football.

1206
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,540
And sit out there and lead with his head in a peewee football.

1207
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,040
Wow.

1208
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,540
Right? What's wrong with you?

1209
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:28,460
Maybe he's trying to infiltrate ballet from the inside and take it down once and for all.

1210
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,700
So that might be maybe a...

1211
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,700
That could be a good spy thriller.

1212
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,700
That could be a good spy thriller.

1213
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,220
I actually think we should produce that.

1214
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,220
Take down male ballet.

1215
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,220
Or just all ballet.

1216
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,220
All ballet.

1217
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,220
All ballet.

1218
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,220
Yeah, all ballet.

1219
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,220
Things pretty leftoidly.

1220
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:43,720
Philadelphia, homosexual agenda setting trauma.

1221
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,220
Really glorifies the homosexual lifestyle.

1222
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:53,260
It glorifies the homosexual lifestyle while also being named after one of the first cities

1223
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,260
in the country.

1224
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,260
You know what they did?

1225
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:02,260
The reason why they did that is so that when you Google, it's like one of those posts on Reddit,

1226
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:08,260
they were like, "Make this named Philadelphia so when you Google Philadelphia you see this sickly AIDS patient instead of the Liberty Bell."

1227
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,260
You see this gay stuff?

1228
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:16,260
I just saw this leftist news report on TV and this is disgusting. It's homosexual and Philadelphia related.

1229
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:20,260
But apparently the homosexual community, they have started a petition.

1230
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:24,260
they want to replace the Liberty Bell with the Tickly Balls.

1231
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,260
No.

1232
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,260
Interesting.

1233
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,260
I thought it was the puberty smell.

1234
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,260
No.

1235
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,260
Which they love.

1236
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,260
Which they love the smell of puberty.

1237
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,260
They do like it.

1238
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:36,860
They love the smell of Axe chocolate, which by the way, do not put that on.

1239
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,860
No, don't put it on.

1240
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,760
A true patriot does not put on that.

1241
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,760
No sir.

1242
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,460
A true patriot puts on Old Spice Fiji.

1243
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,260
Yeah, and Electric Shave.

1244
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,260
Yeah.

1245
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,260
Yeah.

1246
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,260
Or just classic Old Spice.

1247
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,260
Hey, you know what?

1248
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,260
Water.

1249
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:54,780
Yeah, you don't really need I mean you can God have you a smell I have to wear I have to wear deodorant

1250
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,660
And why some because of some gland problems?

1251
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:04,340
Mmm, I don't have any glands yeah because gland problems because I was trying to go away and probably eating preservatives

1252
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,340
And you know that are bad for you

1253
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:13,420
We are all on an army does I'm on a complete carnivore diet at this like I've been making a lot of these videos

1254
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,420
Of what I eat in a day one meal a day

1255
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:21,180
For pizza Friday and yeah, I love pizza Friday. Yeah, pizza. Here's a you don't need to wear

1256
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:26,220
Any kind of deodorant no, and you don't need to eat vegetables no

1257
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:32,500
Okay, so here's what there's one last one on this slide. I believe which is

1258
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:39,080
Jackass the movie essentially a montage of ridiculous stunts and pranks with no coherent story

1259
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,600
That's if it had a if it had a plot line. Maybe they'd be yeah

1260
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,720
- Is it so hard to add a straight romance

1261
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,560
in the middle of that?

1262
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,080
- I have never watched Jack Frapp,

1263
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,120
but I can tell just from the clips I've seen

1264
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,360
on Conservatube, which is a website that I'm subscribed to.

1265
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,200
- Go check out Conservatube.

1266
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,520
- $25 a week.

1267
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,600
- Yes, sir.

1268
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,800
- Great, great videos.

1269
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,800
They have some actually really great stuff debunking

1270
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,640
some of the stuff they do

1271
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,740
and why that wouldn't be possible.

1272
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,580
- Wow.

1273
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,840
- I wish we were in my debunker.

1274
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,680
Well, we are right now.

1275
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,840
We're in debunker right now.

1276
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,080
- We are in debunker.

1277
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,760
- So here's Bad Santa and Bad Santa 2.

1278
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,120
This insult to the sacred holiday of Christmas

1279
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,820
features gratuitous coarse language, sexual escapades, drunkenness, and the main plot

1280
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,100
involving a con man posing as a mall Santa so he and his dwarf accomplice can rob the

1281
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,100
mall safe.

1282
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,880
It was bad enough that critics panned Disney for allowing the trashing of a cultural icon

1283
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:32,260
like Santa Claus, as well as even then Disney CEO Michael Eisner, to be disgusted with the

1284
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:36,520
resulting film, acting as one of the main reasons for Miramax being cut loose from Disney

1285
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,280
alongside Kill Bill.

1286
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,560
This sequel follows the already revolting Bad Santa.

1287
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,440
Miramax, which distributed this movie as well as its predecessor, was acquired in 2016 by

1288
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:51,000
Belm Media Group, which is owned by Islamic propaganda channel Al Jazeera.

1289
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What?

1290
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh my god.

1291
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And that's what, you see that movie, you can tell.

1292
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,120
You're smelling the Islamicism all over it.

1293
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,160
Yeah, because Miramax was an incredible company.

1294
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,160
Yes.

1295
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,080
Miramax was so great, and you know what, you can tell that they're smearing all this Islamic

1296
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,920
propaganda and bad Santa.

1297
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,240
They named the character Herman Merman to make fun of white people's names.

1298
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,040
That's right, disgusting.

1299
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,960
literally named the movie after Santa being bad yeah yeah bad Santa is yes I

1300
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,720
bet Santa is bad when you're in the Middle East you're eating if you say

1301
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,200
food and you say you know what say it fast think about think about the Muslim

1302
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,120
agenda here bad Santa's tomb that's in it - my god that's in his tomb they want

1303
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,160
to see bat they want to see Santa entombed yeah that is all and you know I

1304
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,480
don't want to say that you know I don't I don't listen to I don't listen to rap

1305
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,040
and hip-hop you know thank you but I will say yes Santa's bad bad meaning good

1306
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:44,240
like damn oh okay all right yeah yeah yeah yeah like darn I was basically enough of

1307
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,960
a different song Godzilla liberal and homosexual director Roland Emmerich turns

1308
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,880
Godzilla into a girl and enforces the idea military does more damage than

1309
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,720
Godzilla see and I hate when that idea is enforced yeah that the military does

1310
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,400
more damage than God's not right it's not true

1311
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,600
It's not true.

1312
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,200
Godzilla's bad, but the military's way worse, right?

1313
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:06,700
Yeah.

1314
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,900
No, the military's better.

1315
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,900
Godzilla literally has knocked over a building before?

1316
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,100
He's stepped on people.

1317
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:12,900
It's disgusting.

1318
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,900
And Godzilla's not a human.

1319
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,900
Anyway, basically--

1320
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,500
This movie also contains--

1321
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,340
I don't know if you guys know a certain actor

1322
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,200
by the name of Broderick.

1323
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,820
And he has portrayed a character who

1324
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,500
thinks it's cool to skip school.

1325
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,060
And he killed two people with his car.

1326
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,180
And acts like a total frat head and gallivant around town

1327
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,220
and disrupt the affairs of working people.

1328
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,060
- Yeah, in terms of skipping school.

1329
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:34,880
- In terms of people with this car, in real life.

1330
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,140
- In terms of skipping school, I'll skip the public school,

1331
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,420
go straight to the home school for me.

1332
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,140
- Yeah. - Thank you.

1333
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:41,980
- Paul. - Yeah, trust me,

1334
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,100
if Ferris Bueller was at a charter school,

1335
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,580
he would not be skipping a damn day.

1336
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,900
- No, sir, he'd get hit by a cattle prod.

1337
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,940
Paul, 2011, this extraterrestrial rescue mission

1338
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,180
could have been a harmless comedic tribute

1339
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,180
to the science fiction film genre.

1340
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,280
Yeah, if it didn't portray Christians in the military

1341
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,940
as close-minded idiots while depicting atheists

1342
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:04,540
played by godless writers and co-stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost,

1343
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,700
who support extramarital sex, homosexuality, and mind-altering drug use

1344
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,860
as the only sensible people,

1345
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:15,200
Pegg and Frost have explicitly stated that one of the movie's main messages is

1346
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,500
that there is no God, and anyone who believes in him is an ignorant boob.

1347
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,100
Oh my goodness. Can you say a different word there? An ignorant frap,

1348
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,820
they're saying. And to compare, and to call

1349
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,980
somebody a mammary as an insult.

1350
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:34,700
It's disgusting, because first of all, if I'm not married to you, I don't want to see those

1351
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,060
things, you know what I mean?

1352
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,340
And you're not even calling me...

1353
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,620
And if I am married to you, one night a year, and only for our annual baby.

1354
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:47,500
Yep, annual baby, and when I'm done, I'm saying, "Booyah!" Just like that. Just like God says

1355
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,500
to do.

1356
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,500
I say cha-ching.

1357
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,500
My well is dry.

1358
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:55,220
Oh, nice. Lucky you. You don't have to do all that.

1359
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,500
No, I just sit at home, I twiddle my thumbs.

1360
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,500
And here's one of the most disgusting communist leftist movies ever made.

1361
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,320
Barnyard the original party animals.

1362
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,600
First of all, what the hell's wrong with god damn Hollywood?

1363
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:14,960
You're telling me that the animals on the farms are partying.

1364
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,600
I guess so.

1365
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,680
Having unprotected premarital sex.

1366
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,160
So let's see what's a pig and a cow.

1367
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,480
Set on a barnyard where animals speak and behave like humans in the absence of real humans.

1368
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:33,680
This Lion King clone stars a bull who witnesses his father die after being wounded by coyotes.

1369
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,680
Yeah, 'cause that's normal to have a dead dad.

1370
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,080
Then gradually accepts the responsibilities that come with being the leader of his animal community.

1371
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:44,780
Nevertheless, Barnyard accepts disorderly conduct because the animals still party recklessly,

1372
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,880
even with a serious, dedicated bull in charge.

1373
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,880
Plus, it portrays humans as either ignorant or stupid and persecutes coyotes for being carnivores.

1374
01:05:52,880 --> 01:06:00,400
The neurotic ferret Freddy goes to liberal lengths to avoid temptation to eat his rooster friend by becoming a vegetarian.

1375
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,400
Disgusting.

1376
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:08,960
Not only that, but the bulls lack horns and have female udders, and there are brief scenes referencing alcohol and gambling.

1377
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,960
The boy cows have udders.

1378
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,600
Okay, first of all, at least show what comes out of those.

1379
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,100
Yeah.

1380
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:14,600
Yeah.

1381
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,600
I mean, I'm not—listen, I'm a conservative first, but I'm also, like, interested in anatomy, right?

1382
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,960
I want to understand how it works.

1383
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,960
Make those cows human.

1384
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,640
Come out of that this this movie should have had an entirely Hugh cow cast yeah

1385
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,880
And I think that's the worst part here is it says if they portray humans as either ignorant or stupid

1386
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,400
We've got to be the most leftist thing

1387
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,680
This is also I mean this this needs this it uses CGI which is literally a tool of deception

1388
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,700
Which is essentially makeup yeah, which no, thank you. It's computer deception makeup made by these these literal computer geeks who sit all day

1389
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,700
They type like this

1390
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,300
Bill Gates Bill Gates Steve Jobs Steve Jobs, you know

1391
01:06:52,300 --> 01:07:00,060
While I'm over here Mitt Romney Mitt Romney, you know, it's writing with a quill what conservative getting it? Okay

1392
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:05,240
Well, that's not what they're doing though, you know, that's what I know cuz that's that's CGI for me

1393
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:10,760
Oh, we know for you. Okay. So these computer nerds are sitting there drinking yerba mate

1394
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,640
Right or or coffee urine urine mate. Yeah the urine of their mate

1395
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,240
Yeah, they have a male mate who makes a cup every morning, and they drink it like hot coffee

1396
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,980
And you know and you know that your Bermuda is actually filled with phytoestrogens that I know that and boobs yeah

1397
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:29,760
And I'm fighting off estrogen every day of my life living in this goddamn girl country

1398
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:38,200
Yeah, what's next the secret world of Arrietty Japanese anime film is about a tiny tiny homeless family that steals from regular people

1399
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,280
So I'm tired of these

1400
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:47,760
These little homeless people so this whole the whole movie basically saying hey if you're small enough and homeless enough

1401
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,380
You can take whatever you want from a guy's working family. Yeah, how's wrong with them? It's not right. No. Thank you

1402
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:56,960
Get that frap out of my face. This wig is getting pretty itchy

1403
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,760
I might look a little bit like a reidy's cousin at the yeah, I think I'm gonna be real with you

1404
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,360
I'd say that's why I took it off

1405
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:06,780
You as a trick what else is here that might have been the end. I don't know is it the end

1406
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,180
Yeah, that's it. I mean that's it for conservapedia for me.

1407
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,680
Wow. I mean that's enlightening.

1408
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,340
I mean it's enlightening in that I liked it, but it's not enlightening in that I already

1409
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,700
knew all and believed all of that.

1410
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:22,580
I'd like to send Enlightening Bolt into the United States Congress to destroy every Democrat

1411
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:23,580
who works there.

1412
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,580
There's an album cover you might like.

1413
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:30,820
Okay, let's check it out. Go see the Patreon. We're going to upload 3D printing schematics

1414
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,740
for an assault rifle.

1415
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:37,940
Yeah, hey and all I want to say about the Patreon, I guess want people to Google what holiday

1417
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:39,940
Oh yeah.

Oh yeah, we got some videos coming up on Saturday.

1421
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,060
coming up in.

1422
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,460
There will be a special episode.

1423
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,460
And also from this episode on.

1424
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,180
November 19th.

1425
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,940
From this episode on we might be engaging in the kayfabe again.

1426
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,940
Right, yeah.

1427
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,460
We might be going back into the kayfabe.

1428
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,420
Okay, so that's not the one I meant.

1429
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,940
But this one is actually, you know what?

1430
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:00,940
That's even better.

1431
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,420
We're gonna celebrate that too.

1432
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,420
Yes sir. See you then.

1433
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:10,420
There's Jubio.
