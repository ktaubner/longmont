1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
*snoring*

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
*spitting*

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, oh hi.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I didn't see you there.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're looking well.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hmm.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Would you like to hear a story?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A story about...

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well...

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
About Thanksgiving.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let me just light my story candle.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
*lighting candle*

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
*lighting candle*

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
*lighting candle*

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Come on now, there you go.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,500
*punch*

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:01:08,900
In the year number two, the fulgrum sailed the ocean yellow.

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,580
They discovered the pool world by accident.

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,260
It was a complete whoopsie.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,340
When they got off the ship, there was nobody there.

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,460
This new land, which they dubbed Amerikaka, had nobody there at all.

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,720
Not even anyone except the pilgrims.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,080
What they did find, though, was a feast most ex-squishy.

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,600
The table was set with hundreds of da squishest squishes.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,640
Brown turkey, brown bread, brown mashed potatoes, brown gravy, squishy squashes, and corn.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,840
and lots of corn. The pilgrims tucked in and they drank chocolate milk with fudgy chocolate

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,960
syrup and there was delicious brown chocolate ice cream topped with brown chocolate sauce,

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:08,980
brown chocolate sprinkles and brown cherries which were covered in brown stuff. And everything

29
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,980
was served in brown bowls. But then, the pilgrim's tummies started to rumble. You see, dear listener,

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:26,080
this food had been left out for 700 years, and that's why it was brown. The pilgrim started

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,360
to poop and pee due to the stomach sickness, yes, in their trousers. But they didn't want

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,260
to run to the toilet because they were enjoying the food so much, and also because the toilet

33
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,960
hadn't been invented at all.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,780
Just then, while they were pooping and eating and in such despair, old Ben Stanklin ran over

35
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,960
holding a scrap of white cloth.

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,080
"Look at my toy!

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,120
Look at my toy!" he exclaimed.

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,240
A marigold in my pants was spoopy grabbed from him.

39
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,240
This is what I think of your toy."

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
And he wrapped it around his poopy ass.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,240
But then, inspiration struck.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,240
"Wait a second," Amerigovispoopyinmypants said.

43
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,240
"My poop is only touching my ass.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Not my knees, feet, or the person sitting next to me's feet."

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:32,560
Then the pilgrims realized that old Ben's toy could be used to hold poop and pee.

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
And they asked old Ben what his toy was called.

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
And old Ben accidentally said diaper.

48
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,360
So then all the pilgrims wore diapers while they ate so they could have diarrhea.

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
And all of this was really quite gross.

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:55,640
This day, November 19th, year number two, was called Stinksgiving.

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,060
And they never repeated this tradition, it only happened once.

52
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,400
And it didn't mean or represent anything when it happened, and nobody remembered it

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,040
because everybody cared way more about Jesus Christ, who was also called Pea Sauce Crust.

54
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,740
But that's a different story for Christmas.

55
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,140
And the pilgrims all died last year of complications from the COVID-19 vaccine.

56
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,540
But that's also a different story for Christmas.

57
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,180
And that's how diapers came to be.

58
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,860
Yup, and all that was true.

59
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,300
Happy Stinksgiving everyone!

60
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,980
Okay, gonna get up.

61
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Oh no.

62
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Bye bye.

63
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,980
I'm gonna crap right now I think.

64
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Prairie doggin'.

65
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Yeah.

66
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm gonna crap right now I think. Prairie doggin'.

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
Yeah.

68
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Welcome everybody.

69
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,980
Happy Stinksgiving!

70
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Happy Stinksgiving to everybody.

71
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,140
It's so good to be here with you. It honestly does feel so good to be in my friend's company right now

72
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,420
Yeah, yeah with everything crazy. That's been going on in this world the

73
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,900
Democrats lost the house

74
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,260
Wolf mm-hmm. I don't pay attention to stuff like yeah, and it's not really a day for that either

75
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,020
Let's have a check that I'm sorry. I'm sorry that brought up politics. Yep. Thank you

76
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,500
I'm giving dinner because you know there's always that one family member who brings up politics

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,380
- 'Cause listen, we can get in a whole fight,

78
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,220
but I don't wanna tear--

79
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,060
- Let's wait 'til later for the poll.

80
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,220
- Let's not be fucking divisive as fuck today.

81
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
- That's right.

82
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,880
- I have an idea.

83
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,740
Can we just rub each other's shoulders again real quick?

84
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,580
- Yeah, we can do that really quick.

85
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,980
- And get that mood back.

86
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,060
- Oh man.

87
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,900
- Yeah.

88
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,720
- Oh yeah.

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,560
- That is good.

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,380
- It feels great.

91
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,220
- That is really good.

92
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,060
- Okay.

93
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,880
- Why don't we do this?

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,020
- I feel we should open every episode like this.

95
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,940
- Yeah, that's actually, that does give positive energy

96
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
when you do that.

97
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,600
- And my question--

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,520
- It's like zip zap zap.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,760
- How many Stinksgivings have we had together

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,000
as friends at this point?

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,840
- Four.

102
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,660
- This is the fourth one?

103
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,500
- This is the fourth one.

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,560
And I also, I would really quick like to congratulate,

105
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,800
I kind of dropped a hint on the previous,

106
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,520
the free episode, I would like to congratulate

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
everybody who guessed that November 19th,

108
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
the world holiday I was referring to,

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
World Stinksgiving Day.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,440
- And I tip my hat to thee.

111
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,840
- And I tip my hat to thee.

112
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,280
- And it's difficult for me to get the hat back on

113
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,480
'cause it's a little too small.

114
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,840
- These are pretty tight, they were pretty expensive hats.

115
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,240
- Yeah, these are all made out of premium silk.

116
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
- Money's not a concern on a day like this.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,120
- What is Thanksgiving Day?

118
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,600
- So here-- - I need to know!

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,860
- Yeah! - Here comes Little Pierce

120
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,600
asking about the true meaning of Thanksgiving.

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
- What could it be?

122
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,400
I don't even, this, you guys may have celebrated

123
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,840
four together, but this is my first.

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,120
- Well, we actually explained all that in the intro.

125
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
- Yeah, in the intro. - Oh.

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,720
- Yeah, so you don't-- - So you might--

127
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
- You should just go ahead and watch the intro.

128
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,520
- So when it comes out tomorrow, just watch the video.

129
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
- Okay. - Just watch it.

130
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,200
- All right, I'll probably catch up on the way here.

131
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,840
- We'll, don't worry, we'll show you the ropes as we go.

132
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,460
Thanksgiving is about a lot of stuff. It's about friends and family, but it's also

133
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,960
about some damn good down-country, low-country home cooking.

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,220
Yep. Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh wait, yeah, I prepared a whole dish and put it in a

135
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,700
diaper. Yeah. Of course I know it's Thanksgiving Day. Yeah, if we get, Jibrio,

136
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,180
can we get a shot of just our, basically the... The cornucopia here? Yeah, the corn, so there's a

137
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,300
cornucopia here. These are all of our meals that we're gonna be partaking in

138
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,260
today. I mean, I'm, I'm about, I'm famished. I'm famished. Let's dig in, no?

139
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,860

This one is, there's like a, this is like a, there's a yellowing. Oh this is the, I think this is Caleb's guacamole.

143
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:21,740
It is my guacamole, my famous guacamole. Okay well it's a perfect little appetizer I think, it's some chips.

144
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Okay. Let's find the chips in here. Well here, first of all, open up the guacamole and show everybody.

Let's open that up. Yeah, let's open the guacamole. You can go ahead and show them, Pierce.

146
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Can you get that thing open?

147
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,740
Once you put the Velcro on those things, it's

148
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,740
kind of hard to get them back open. Oh, no, it's opening up. Here we go.

149
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Alright, let's see the undiapering.

Oh, yeah! That looks so good!

151
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Guacamole. All we need with that is chips. Well, I got great news for you, then.

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740

So let's dig in!

Someone pass me a chip.

I wish I wasn't allergic to avocado.

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Because that looks

163
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
simply delectable.

164
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
That's going to be divine.

172
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,200
Have you ever had I mean so obviously this is more of a friend stinking

173
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,400
But when you were growing up, and you were celebrating Stinksgiving with your family

174
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,480
What was like that one dish that just made you go?

175
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,340
Actually

176
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,540
I immediately had an answer to this.

177
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Okay.

178
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,300
And it's actually the meal that I brought, or the part of the meal that I brought, for

179
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
me, it's the cranberry sauce.

180
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,300
The cranberry sauce.

181
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Oh wow.

182
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Uh huh.

183
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,500
Oh, so how about you pop open that cranberry sauce, show these lucky viewers what you have.

184
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I didn't think I got to see this.

185
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
You didn't see the cranberry sauce?

186
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Before it got taped up.

187
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Nope.

188
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, just, you're in for a treat, buddy.

189
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,220
And you're gonna be in for a...

190
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,700
Alright, let's open that up.

191
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Yep.

192
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,060
Real gourmet...

193
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:54,100
that up hold that up hold that oh and that's so good that oh no cranberry

194
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,180
sauce well that's not a problem because it's gonna it's not like we're gonna eat

195
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,580
the cranberry sauce by itself anyway right yeah so let's just let's let that

196
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,580
simmer not eat it yeah I don't know why we opened it so early I mean I feel like

197
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,700
Patrick opened it he's talking about how much he likes it he has to take a bite

198
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:20,860
of it. Yeah. Okay. And it tastes what? We should have brought your bib for us. I think it tastes amazing!

199
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Wait, you just mentioned we should have brought bibs. It's funny that you say that

200
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,500
because I do have some bibs. Oh yeah? Give me a moment. Yeah. Here, hold on. While you're

201
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,020
away, I need to inquire further about why is it called Stinksgiving?

202
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,260
While you're getting those bibs, can you get me a damn napkin? Because I got some

203
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,740
I got some cranberry sauce all over my hand.

204
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,740
I think you don't know what a bib is for.

205
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,060
The smells that I'm experiencing right now are kind of pleasant.

206
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,060
I mean, it's mostly like...

207
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,560
Oh, just hey, listen, pal.

208
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,020
I know it's your first Thanksgiving, but what I will tell you is stinky things come to those

209
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
who wait.

210
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
Okay.

211
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Okay.

212
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Classic Thanksgiving tradition.

213
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,660
Everybody eats this delicious, good smelling food and it's a celebration of how the body

214
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,300
can turn that into something so foul.

215
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Something unbelievable.

216
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,300
- Okay, so it's sort of like a chrysalis, right?

217
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,740
- Much like a chrysalis.

218
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,540
- It's almost exactly like a chrysalis.

219
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,460
- No, that's a different holiday.

220
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,620
I'm just playing. - Oh, chrysalis.

221
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,940
Oh my goodness.

222
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,580
Okay, and then I'm noticing that diapers are a part of this.

223
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,620
What does this have to do with friendship?

224
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,020
- Well, who's surrounding you?

225
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,540
You're left and you're right, and you're more left.

226
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,380
- Oh, that's right.

227
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,220
You guys kind of catch all of my crap.

228
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,240
Crap yeah, exactly yeah, you guys take shit from me in a way

229
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,780
You know way yeah, but we also give food to you and speaking of food. I mean look at this. Oh the main event

230
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,660
This delicious bird umptuous

231
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,940
Lift that up lift that up show the camera Stinks giving turkey

232
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,380
prepared in the natural in its natural casing here and

233
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,660
Here show the head yeah here hold it

234
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:10,300
The head is right here. Can you go back to the... The head is in here. So the head used to be right there.

235
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Right. Oh! Hey, hey, can you hold that over this way? I'm just... I mean, I can't help myself right now.

236
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,740
I want to get in there too.

237
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Everyone take a bite.

238
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Yeah, let me grab some of that.

239
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Oh my god!

240
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Oh! This is what it's all about.

241
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
It slides right out of the diaper!

242
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Go ahead, guys.

243
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Oh my god, look at that.

244
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
There's plenty enough for everybody.

245
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
The way seasoned food brings friends together.

246
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Look at the brown on that.

247
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
God, the brown.

248
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
And what is this I detect here?

249
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
A spot of rosemary?

250
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
A hint of spice?

251
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
It's a little bit spicy for me.

252
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
I got it from a grocery store.

253
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Mate, I like to eat this with a spoon.

254
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
I'm already almost full.

255
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,740
I'm more of a spoon guy.

256
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
I don't know if I can get another bite.

257
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,540
But, but Pierce, there's so many more dishes to dive into.

258
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,340
Well, so let's go, let's keep going, yeah?

259
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:13,140
I mean, if we're feeling a little stuffed, I think we can also take maybe a little break.

260
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
So let's think about...

261
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,840
And move on to some of the other dishes in a minute, because I know that...

262
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,980
This seasoning, I love seasoning, but when it gets on your fingers...

263
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,980
Oh, it's even better.

264
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
Stinksgiving.

265
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,860
It's not just, I mean, it's about friends, it's about food.

266
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,220
Here, you want to suck the seasoning off of my finger?

267
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,220
I mean I'd be an idiot not to.

268
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,220
(laughter)

269
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
What it's also about...

270
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,220
It's also about giving each other gifts.

271
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,220
That is true.

272
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,220
That's a big part of the Stinksgiving. I don't want to burn through all the food

273
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,220
you know, in the first few minutes of our Stinksgiving.

274
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,220
I think we have plenty of exciting reveals.

275
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,220
That's part of the pleasure of the meal.

276
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,220
That's true.

277
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,220
So I mean, if you guys will,

278
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,220
why don't we go ahead and have our first gift

279
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,220
given to us by one of our delightful friends.

280
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,820
one of our delightful friends.

281
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,660
How does that sound to us?

282
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,180
- Who wants to open up their first gift?

283
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,700
- Whose gift is first?

284
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,260
- Well, Patrick, because you're the youngest,

285
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,740
maybe you should open up your gift.

286
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,580
- Okay.

287
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,260
Okay, Julio.

288
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,020
You're gonna need to pull up the gifts now.

289
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,020
- Oh, there it is.

290
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,140
- All right, this is my Stinksgiving gift.

291
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,660
Now, what I found--

292
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,700
- I'll just tuck into this chicken if you don't mind.

293
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,580
- Yeah, I'll be reaching across

294
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,220
and helping myself to tidbits.

295
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,860
- I'm gonna need to read it off my phone

296
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,540
because I foolishly forgot my glasses.

297
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,420
- Well, I mean, in the spirit of Thanksgiving,

298
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,980
I can whisper to you what the things

299
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,340
you have to read might be.

300
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,020
- That would be delightful.

301
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,460
- What an amazing showing of friendship between you two.

302
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,300
- Wow.

303
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,660
- I think I'm starting to catch on to this.

304
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,400
- I feel like I'm almost seeing a bond grow

305
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,900
between Pierce and Patrick, my friend.

306
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,900
- I'm feeling a mass.

307
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,740
- Really?

308
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,240
- It's warming in the deep part of my body.

309
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,380
- That Stinksgiving chicken was a little dry.

310
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,800
I wish we had some of the famous Stinksgiving brown gravy

311
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,920
that I could have dunked it in.

312
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,600
But here is my first gift.

313
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
This is from--

314
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,140
- Your first gift?

315
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,340
- The first part of my gift.

316
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,680
- Your one gift is all of these things.

317
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,380
- Okay, well, it's not, you have to click

318
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,160
the other screen, Jubio.

319
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,720
Here it is.

320
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,240
This is a forum post from--

321
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,600
- You want me to whisper?

322
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
- No, that's all right.

323
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,920
- AD, what's that website?

324
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,960
Diaper Forum, the Diaper Talk Forums.

325
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,640
Here's what somebody asked.

326
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,560
- Oh, I love this website.

327
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,280
- Rusky asks, "Anyone in the military and a diaper lover

328
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,800
"did you ever wear while on duty?"

329
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
I'll start off, there were several instances

330
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
when I was able to wear on duty.

331
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,600
I was in the USAF Security Service

332
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,600
and stationed at the NSA at Fort Meade from 1972 to 1975,

333
00:16:50,920 --> 00:17:00,000
Which, I fully thought that wearing diapers and doing all this kind of stuff was a thing

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
that happened exclusively in the last 10 years.

335
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
But it turns out, people have been doing it since the 70s.

336
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Back in the groovy 70s, maybe.

337
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,200
People have been doing it all the way since the time of the pilgrims.

338
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,240
I'm not to get all technical on you guys as a kind of a Stinksgiving historian, but it's

339
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,320
actually been a tradition for longer than many have even been alive.

340
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, can you imagine that big 70s bush in a diaper?

341
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,040
I guess I can. Yeah, I can. Yeah, totally.

342
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,680
Anyway, I had a desk job.

343
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,880
So wait, this is a gift? This is a gift.

344
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,520
Pierce, little Pierce, okay? You're along for the ride, okay?

345
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,160
I want you to let kind of the warm liquid of Stinksgiving flow over you and soak you

346
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,680
and just, I want you to take on this knowledge and the tradition around you.

347
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,480
Uh-oh! Hey, look around the wishbone!

348
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,240
And here's a bone just for you, little Pierce.

349
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Pierce, blow on it and make a wish!

350
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
What do I do?

351
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
You have to blow on it.

352
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,760
You blow on the bone and you make a wish!

353
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,880
But don't tell your wish or else it wasn't come true.

354
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Okay.

355
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,100
I had a desk job and was able to wear during the midnight shift.

356
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,480
It was a neat place to work and the job I had was to monitor Russian fighter jets.

357
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,440
I didn't really have much supervision.

358
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,480
It was easy to wear and not get caught.

359
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,400
Only real concern was random drug testing, but that happened while I served.

360
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
Looking back at the time, it was a nice job.

361
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,480
I spent nine months in Monterey learning Russian and the remainder of my enlistment at the

362
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
NSA.

363
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,640
Okay, so I'm curious, they are worried about random drug testing.

364
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,680
Is that because somebody has to watch you pee?

365
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
That's the point, right?

366
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,480
That's either because they have to maybe...

367
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
So because you'd have to...

368
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Somebody has to come in, watch you pee.

369
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,200
The cotton of the diaper is in his meatus.

370
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,680
They're taking some kind of drug to increase their diaper pleasure.

371
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Ah, that's possible.

372
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Maybe a laxative or...

373
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
I don't think a...

374
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,480
that baby powder laced cocaine. That makes you poop. I guess you could if you were a

375
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,280
diaper lover you can just hand a used diaper to the drug tester right?

376
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,400
I also yeah I don't know if you can wring it out into a test tube. Also isn't it so easy I mean we've

377
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,840
talked a lot about the the ABDL community isn't it and so much of it is

378
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,560
about the shame of like hiding it and like isn't it so easy to explain it as

379
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,040
like oh yeah I'm incontinent I have like a slipped disc or something like that why

380
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,400
are they so they're so concerned with like somebody caught me and I had to tell

381
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,560
them the truth well I pretend I'm a baby what if we caught you wearing a diaper I

382
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,040
would just lie I'd lie well actually it might be tough I was thinking while we

383
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,680
were preparing this I was thinking about what maybe if one of you three not me

384
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,280
started thinking because we've had so much so much exposure to this community

385
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,080
started being like I'm starting to get a tiny tickle in my balls yeah thinking

386
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
about this maybe I want to try.

387
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,780
- Some of the stuff I was reading.

388
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,900
- Was tickling your balls?

389
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,200
- You think you might want it?

390
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,920
- I think maybe, I could be a messy baby.

391
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,160
- I guess like a hot woman in a diaper,

392
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,720
does the diaper kill it for you?

393
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
- Yeah. - Yeah.

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,920
- I mean there is something about a diaper

395
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,880
that is just underwear.

396
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,200
I mean I like a lady in underwear.

397
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,320
- I don't. - No?

398
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,160
- And that's where I draw the line.

399
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
- You.

400
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,640
- Yeah, I wouldn't like it if any of my friends

401
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,560
were wearing a diaper.

402
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,480
definitely tease them about it but you're right I mean they would hold me

403
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,560
yeah right yeah part of it yeah I probably put him in the timeout corner

404
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:22,360
I probably make the meat Brussels if I caught one of my friends wearing a

405
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,800
diaper I would probably send them to bed with no yeah

406
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,400
oh no I think that's also that is that's the answer to your question is like why

407
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,040
Why do these people who are obsessed with being demeaned and degraded and wearing diapers,

408
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,360
why do they spill their life story about loving diapers to people?

409
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,280
It's almost like they're always celebrating Thanksgiving.

410
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,480
That's next year.

411
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,600
Why would they tell an embarrassing thing to somebody?

412
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,640
Speaking of, this next slide here.

413
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,960
United States Marine Corps 2007-2010.

414
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,680
I was originally stationed in Okinawa.

415
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,380
While I was there, I didn't have much chance to get if,

416
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,980
didn't have much if a chance to get padding.

417
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,040
Once I was restationed in California,

418
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,620
I was in combat unit, so I didn't have much time to do it.

419
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,880
Once I knew I was getting out,

420
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,020
I started padding up more and more.

421
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,920
Also happens when I first tried ABDL padding.

422
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,200
- So you found a couple people

423
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,560
who were in the military served.

424
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,720
- I found a lot of people who were in the military.

425
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,560
Here's another one here. - Well, I would say

426
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,680
That's a huge part of Thanksgiving, right?

427
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,480
Is like respecting the people who have served.

428
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,000
Definitely.

429
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,680
Lay down their life for your country.

430
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,800
Here's another-- yeah, like this person here.

431
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,240
I was in the Navy '94 to '98.

432
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,760
I wore diapers when I did the balls.

433
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,800
Eight hanger watch on occasion.

434
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,560
Did the balls?

435
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,720
Did the balls, that's what they said.

436
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,680
I was also doing the cleaning.

437
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,760
So I just made sure my last diaper of the night

438
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,560
was in the trash bags piled up in the back door by then.

439
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,320
I was wearing the depends on diapers.

440
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,840
Once I got married and moved off base,

441
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,940
it was much easier to wear diapers.

442
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Especially once I corrupted my wife.

443
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,920
- Now, in the ABDL community,

444
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,160
is corrupting someone when you finally expose yourself

445
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,160
as a diaper lover and they have to accept it, change you,

446
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,560
they have to be a part of your lifestyle,

447
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,040
or is corrupting is when you get someone

448
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,360
into wearing diapers?

449
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,200
- It's when you get someone into it,

450
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,720
and participating it in whatever way.

451
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,560
- Yeah.

452
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,720
- Well, I think there's a huge difference

453
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,300
between participating in it as in you accept me,

454
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,020
and maybe even you changed me versus you are now deriving

455
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,960
sexual pleasure from filling a diaper.

456
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,140
- We've thought about this more than us.

457
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,460
- I mean, if I was a diaper lover,

458
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,660
I don't know if I would want someone to also derive pleasure

459
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,820
from filling their own diaper.

460
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,740
- Well, but I think the point is you get your wife

461
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,020
into putting the diaper on you.

462
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,340
- A lot of the relationships that I've seen

463
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,540
looking at all this stuff is, yeah,

464
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,060
there's somebody who is,

465
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,580
that's why so much of it is the little thing of like,

466
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,420
"Oh, I pretend to be a baby.

467
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,020
They change my diaper when I wake up in the morning."

468
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,980
It's, uh, God, that chicken is so delicious.

469
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,820
I mean, it's hard to--

470
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,640
- I think you're good enough.

471
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,480
- It's hard to deny how good a man you are.

472
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,580
- Is that hunk chicken and guacamole, anybody?

473
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,420
- Yeah.

474
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,020
- Hey, I think Stink'sgiving is about talking now.

475
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,740
- Yeah, here, let me read this next one.

476
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,020
USMCE, United States Marine Corps, 2003 to present.

477
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,420
I do not wear at work, but all the time after work.

478
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,820
My wife will oftentimes just have one waiting out for me to put on right when the camis come off.

479
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,020
God, that is romantic.

480
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,220
That is so fucking romantic.

481
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,620
To be like, maybe it's not my thing, but for my husband I'm going to lay out a diaper for him.

482
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,420
Like as if she bought lingerie for him for her to wear.

483
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,920
Kind of just lay it out.

484
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,620
Like he knows exactly what it means.

485
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,220
I saw one that maybe I didn't put in my gift, but a husband was like,

486
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,820
"Yeah, my wife actually likes that I wear a diaper.

487
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,280
She says well at least no other women are gonna want to fuck you

488
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:58,340
Who would fuck a man who wears diapers and then he says it's weird, but it works for us check this out

489
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:06,420
This one is a different thing okay. I looked up some ABDL tattoo ideas. Oh, that's a great idea

490
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,820
That is really somebody wants to get the hug

491
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:16,220
On their hip I want to have this tattoo. Well. That's genius because it's covered by the diaper. No one sees it exactly

492
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,140
It's a private thing for you. Nobody knows you like diapers based on your tattoo

493
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,740
Imagine going to a tattoo artist and showing them this logo and being like

494
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,540
That's you know

495
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,220
You have an easy out with any time you have to or you want to get a tattoo and want to explain it you say that

496
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,060
You lost a fantasy football league, and then it's like oh the guy

497
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,700
You know what's harder to explain though is you say you want this tattoo and you're like yeah

498
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,860
I lost a fantasy football whatever and then they're like alright

499
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,860
and you get down on the table and you have to roll up your shorts and you have to pull your diaper back.

500
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,860
That was another part of the punishment for the Fantasy Football League.

501
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,860
I also have to have this pacifier in my mouth.

502
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,860
That's how you get out of it any time somebody catches you with a diaper on.

503
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Yeah, you have to change me also, that's part of it. I lost the bet also

504
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,860
and part of it is that you have to change me right here on the table.

505
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,860
It was either the Waffle House thing or I do this.

506
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,260
and I don't want to read it. Okay. You are a pro. Yeah. But this next one here, this was on a

507
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:24,100
discussion about the Queen. Nice. Says, "Irish and British here. Sad time for the world at the

508
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,980
moment in history with the oldest monarch to ever lived. I've seen a lot of toxic comments about the

509
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,580
Queen's death, particularly coming from the country of Ireland." I'm gonna dip back into this guacamole. "About the six

510
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,980
counties. Whatever happened in the past is the past. She was someone's mother, grand, and friend.

511
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,900
That's what's more important

512
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:49,640
It's cool to see the the the members of the ABDL community. Just say whatever happened in the past in Ireland is in the

513
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:59,780
Think it's cool that these are full human beings that yeah, that's what I like to do - I mean once we get to my gift

514
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,500
I think I found some nice people like that - yeah, I think that's part of Stinks giving

515
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,460
I was more criticizing this person's of fucking asshole behavior

516
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,500
the Queen the Queen and this person who said that the whatever happened in

517
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,940
Ireland should not a big deal the power under the bridge it's not water under the

518
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,140
bridge under the ass never been to Ireland I'm gonna go next year the four

519
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,740

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,760
- Thank you, that was really special.

526
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,040
- That was, I really can't say enough.

527
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,440
- Everyone just say thank you, Patrick.

528
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,280
- Thank you, Patrick.

529
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,100
- Thank you, Patrick.

530
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,940
- Thank you, Patrick.

531
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,760
- Thank you, Patrick.

532
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,600
- Thank you very much.

533
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,320
- See, he's already, he said it before you guys said it.

534
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,040
- Guys, I'm fucking starving after that long ass rant.

535
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,960
- Oh yeah.

536
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,640
- Can I open up something here?

537
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,840
- Yeah, open up one.

538
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,200
- Let's open up a present here.

539
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,040
- What's this one?

540
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,880
- Ooh.

541
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,800
- This one is in a diaper.

542
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,040
- Just dig into that.

543
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,440
- This one has a diaper around it.

544
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,080
- Who hasn't opened one yet?

545
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,880
- Oh, this is Patrick's.

546
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Oh my gosh.

547
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
This was supposed to be the appetizer.

548
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
This is exciting.

549
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
This was supposed to be the appetizer.

550
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,200
Hey, don't say anything about it.

551
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
No spoilers.

552
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,280
Let Cameron open this bad boy.

553
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,920
And what could be hidden beneath that beautiful cotton layer but...

554
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,440
Oh, a shrimp cocktail!

555
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,800
Oh, that looks so...

556
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,320
Oh God.

557
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,040
And Patrick, I mean, you love shrimp cocktail.

558
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,840
You can't eat the guacamole, so...

559
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
That's gotta be your favorite food, right?

560
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
How about you enjoy some of that?

561
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Mostly diaper, I tell you.

562
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
We reached for the same shrimp.

563
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Get into that.

564
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Oh no, I'm allergic to shrimp.

565
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
No, I'm allergic to seafood

566
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,280
Yeah, me too

567
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,360
Actually fed me the tail he ate the tail and all oh the tail is not good for you. It's a bone

568
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,760
No speaking of bone I got a why that shrimp is making me hungry

569
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,000
I got the shrimps making me hungry for chicken the shrimp of the air all of this food is making me real thirsty

570
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Mm-hmm. Oh my god. So look at my tasty fingers

571
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,200
Everybody look at my fingers delicious

572
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
I know you want to lick that off

573
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:27,440
Mmm. I know you want to lick. I know you want to lick that seasoning off - get over there get get your get your chompers

574
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
On that seasoning oh he got it

575
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,980
There's another piece of shrimp for Pierce

576
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,320
He's so he's so

577
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,360
I've been to plenty of Thanksgiving's and no one comments on how much food the other people are eating oh

578
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,360
Oh, another piece of shrimp for Pierce.

579
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,680
- I'm just excited that you like my meal.

580
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,080
- Well, this is nothing like Thanksgiving.

581
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,640
- You're like my fucking mother.

582
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,560
Chill out.

583
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,400
- You chill.

584
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,320
- No, no, no. - Chill, chill.

585
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,560
- Oh, okay.

586
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,400
- Yum.

587
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,480
(laughing)

588
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,880
- All right.

589
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,400
Well, guys, I think I already, do you guys want a gift?

590
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,240
- I would love another gift.

591
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,200
- I want one so bad.

592
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,360
I gave my gift first, and now to receive three more.

593
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,840
That is just absolutely divine.

594
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,000
- That's the best feeling in the world.

595
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,960
- What's better than that?

596
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
First of all, giving a gift,

597
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,600
and then receiving three in return.

598
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,880
- And three come back.

599
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,720
- Oh my God.

600
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,040
- It's the best deal in the world.

601
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,080
- Thanksgiving is really beautiful.

602
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
All right, here's my gift for everybody.

603
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,600
- Okay.

604
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,240
- So let's start it off here.

605
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,160
Okay, so the animation isn't working.

606
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,280
I forgot that the animation wouldn't work in this.

607
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,840
- Wait, click presentation view.

608
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
- It's not gonna work.

609
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,320
So mine, yeah, see?

610
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,000
- Oh, now I can't see anything.

611
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,880
- Yeah, so this will make a list,

612
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,320
my gift might be a little scattered.

613
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,160
- Hey, hey! - And, Julio,

614
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,960
you might have to drag stuff around

615
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,800
'cause some stuff is covering other stuff.

616
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,760
- I'll say this, Cameron, stink you for trying.

617
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,080
- Oh, thanks, thank you. - That's what I really care about.

618
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,680
- But I really did kind of-- - And Cameron, Cameron?

619
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,440
- Thank you. - And I tip my hat for you.

620
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,720
- Guys, I kind of messed it up.

621
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,200
- Buddy, listen, look at me, look at me, it's okay.

622
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,880
- Stinksgiving is about learning from your mistakes.

623
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,580
- I know that we're here and we're eating food

624
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,720
out of our diapers, but I really want you to know,

625
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
I stink you very much,

626
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,240
you're one of my most stinkful friends.

627
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,600
I stink of you as a brother.

628
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,040
Hopefully you still stink of me that way,

629
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,640
after my terrible, stinky mistake.

630
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,240
Us three are like one in the stink

631
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,800
and two in the stink with you.

632
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,400
(laughing)

633
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
In terms of how much we stink for you.

634
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,200
Okay, does anyone conceal carry while diapered?

635
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,640
Bambino Baby says, "I carry regularly and am diapered,

636
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,840
"usually thickly regularly,

637
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,900
"and I am proud and not ashamed of both.

638
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,260
"To answer the original question,

639
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,780
"I think your concealed carry setup,

640
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,900
and of course weapon of choice makes a difference as far as diaper wearing go.

641
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,980
I used to have an inside the waistband holster and would wear it while diapered.

642
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,220
It was sometimes tricky depending on how many diapers I was wearing at the time,

643
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,080
but doable. I now primarily carry a full-size Glock 19 with an optic

644
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,180
concealed with an OWB holster. I find that diaper wearing doesn't

645
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,300
affect this type of carry at all.

646
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
Wow. A diaper and a Glock.

647
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I mean that, wait, so this person...

648
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,980
So what is their setup with the diaper and the and the the holster? They don't

649
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,380
have the... No, the Glock is not in their diaper. The Glock is outside of the diaper. It's between the diaper and pants.

650
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,020
This person is just bragging that they... because of course you can conceal carry

651
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,940
with a diaper on. It means, I mean, it's... I feel like having two diapers. Yeah, it's like

652
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,260
concealed carry with a diaper. I feel like if you are wearing a diaper, you

653
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,460
should have to put the gun in the diaper. Yeah, I think you're right. I agree. I will

654
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,940
- I will say though, this question,

655
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,460
the tenor of this question,

656
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,220
this is I think the only thing I put in here from this,

657
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,420
but this is a lot more,

658
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,820
like there's a lot of people who are like,

659
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,540
how can you live with yourself carrying a gun around?

660
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,340
It's more like that than like, how do you wear it?

661
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,220
- So the ABDL community is not so kind of--

662
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,020
- It's split down the middle, I would say.

663
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,300
Some people who are like this,

664
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,580
I read another guy who didn't put in

665
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,860
who says he does halo jumps,

666
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,900
the high, he was in like the Marines or something,

667
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,220
and he did like jumps from like 20,000 feet in the air.

668
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,340
he used to skydive for the military

669
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,640
while he was wearing a diaper.

670
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,080
He said that it's normal to wear a diaper

671
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,060
while you do that.

672
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,740
- I'm curious.

673
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,260
- You're falling for hours.

674
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,380
You're falling for hours and hours.

675
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,220
- That's how he found out his true--

676
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,380
- You either do that or you piss out right in your face.

677
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,300
- What if he found out that's,

678
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,060
like he was doing a halo drop or whatever

679
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,340
and then found out like,

680
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,860
man, wearing a diaper is fucking awesome.

681
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,700
- I do wonder, you said it's like wearing two diapers.

682
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,180
I wonder if you wear the holster

683
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,060
and that's the first thing that awakens you.

684
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,900
- Oh, it could be.

685
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,720
- You're like, oh, this kind of feels good

686
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,560
to have something, and then you get like--

687
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,400
- That no one knows about.

688
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,560
- This is making me think of my childhood,

689
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,060
but I never wore a gun as a child.

690
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,400
- I don't think I had a gun when I was a baby.

691
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,900
- What else did I carry while conceiving?

692
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,400
- Oh, oh, a screwdriver.

693
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,900
It was Tommy Pickles.

694
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,240
(laughing)

695
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,980
- Okay, here's my next gift for you guys,

696
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,440
or my next part of my gift.

697
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Do you consider yourself ridiculous wearing diapers?

698
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,240
And naughty boy Nathan will see--

699
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,780
- I found this exact same post.

700
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,860
- I did the exact same pose.

701
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,700
- You did?

702
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,140
Naughty Boy Nathan is responding to someone who said,

703
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,420
"Even though I love to wear diapers,

704
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,340
I've been wearing them 24/7 for over three years.

705
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,820
Sometimes I still feel kind of ridiculous

706
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,460
for wetting myself like a baby."

707
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,500
Somebody else?

708
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,820
And Naughty Boy Nathan says,

709
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,660
"Why?

710
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,500
It's totally awesome having warm pee

711
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
flowing over your nether regions."

712
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,780
And then a bunch of smiley faces,

713
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,620
and then a thumbs up,

714
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,780
and then a cool sunglasses face,

715
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,500
and then the awesome face.

716
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,020
- What is the awesome face from?

717
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,700
- It's a meme face.

718
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,180
- It's from the internet.

719
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,460
- What was the-- - Oh, damn!

720
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,580
- What was the search term that you found?

721
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,480
Did you look up nether regions?

722
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,260
- I do not remember.

723
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,380
I think this was just a recent post.

724
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,140
- I think nether regions is a good search term.

725
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,420
- This guy actually, again,

726
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,480
this is something else I didn't put in.

727
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,580
This guy has made several posts

728
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,940
with the phrase nether regions.

729
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,780
(laughing)

730
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,000
He's going over nether regions.

731
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,300
That's kind of his thing.

732
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,340
- I mean, you gotta get kinda tired at some point

733
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,860
of saying crotch or no-no zone or all that.

734
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,500
- My wet winky.

735
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,180
- Okay, so.

736
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,900
I did see a couple of people who talked about their diapers, a couple of women who talked

737
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,060
about their diapers and said, "Yeah, I pooped and it got all over my pussy."

738
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,120
And I really hate, I really was like, "Okay, no half step in here.

739
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,120
You can't be like talking about your diaper and then call it a pussy."

740
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
But of course it did, you know?

741
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,980
I mean, like, I look at a pussy and a butthole and I'm like, "No diaper in that area, please."

742
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
They're a lot closer.

743
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,780
Please don't cover all that good stuff.

744
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
For God's sake, yeah.

745
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,820
Don't get that all smushed together.

746
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
Don't do that.

747
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,740
- Julio, for this one you're gonna have to uncover it

748
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,000
'cause these are boxes that are supposed to animate out,

749
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,640
so you're gonna have to delete them one by one, okay?

750
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,260
So this is, what were your weirdest dreams,

751
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,000
including with diapers, either asleep

752
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,520
or recreationally speaking, that changed you

753
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,560
or you remember strongly?

754
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,960
- Here's a Stinksgiving rule. - Recreationally speaking

755
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,480
meaning a daydream?

756
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,320
- Stinksgiving rule,

757
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,680
no talking with a mouthful of food, please.

758
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,000
- I love my food, though.

759
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,480
- Okay, then that's his food.

760
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,320
- Then I'll make a special Stinksgiving exception for you.

761
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,040
- There are mainly five, so these are five dreams

762
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,120
that this person had.

763
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,500
So just delete, just delete that.

764
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,080
Just delete that box.

765
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,280
Yeah, there's one behind each of them.

766
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
No, stop!

767
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,940
What are you doing?

768
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,780
Stop!

769
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,620
Undo! - Oh my God.

770
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,280
- There's five boxes that cover them up.

771
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,720
- Well, it's hard to understand what the hell you're saying.

772
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,800
- Okay. - Don't shout at him.

773
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,640
- Yeah. - I'm shouting at him.

774
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
- That's not what Thanksgiving is about.

775
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
- Give a Thanksgiving apology right now.

776
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
- Look directly into your camera and give him an apology.

777
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,520
- Right here. - No, I feel like

778
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,720
that's not a good enough punishment.

779
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,440
I feel like someone should get a spanking

780
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,800
if they break a rule.

781
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,720
- I think you should have to wear a diaper.

782
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,540
I think you should have to put a diaper on right now the diaper listen guy. I Julio

783
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,540
I want to give you a really sincere

784
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,800
Stink apology that was not that was not very stinky of me, and I'm really sorry for what I did

785
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,400
I got caught up in my emotions because

786
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,040
Okay, no, I take it all back. That's

787
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,960
You have to do a stink apology you interrupted a stick down close it all look how sad he is look at him

788
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,040
He's crying. I apologized. It's not my problem. He looks like

789
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,640
He's crying up there. I'm sorry that you don't know you have to look into the camera. Okay wait give me that

790
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Give me my camera, please

791
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,840
That's Cameron. That's Patrick Cameron. I'm sorry you keep looking at me

792
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Asked for your camera

793
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:21,400
You know that is actually very customary they've been doing that for 2,000 years almost

794
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,480
That's completely. That's what you're supposed to do during

795
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,740
(laughing)

796
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,160
- Do not pull that up.

797
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,360
Wrong episode.

798
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,360
- Okay, here are five dreams that this person had.

799
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,040
First one, a cartoon character was suffocating by a gum.

800
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,360
I feared them when I was a child because of it.

801
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,420
Can we get the second one here, please?

802
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,280
Second one, a mystical dream where I was dying

803
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,320
and climbing a Mayan pyramid.

804
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,160
- That sounds cool.

805
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,980
- That's the second dream, yep.

806
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,620
Okay, now I'll have the third one.

807
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,020
Third one, Jesus appeared in my grandma's bedroom.

808
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,140
Then he hugged me and told me he took care of her.

809
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,660
She lived many years after that.

810
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,500
- Awesome.

811
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,460
- And now here we have a warning

812
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,540
in between the third and fourth one that says,

813
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,260
warning, things get sexually explicit from now on.

814
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,100
- I'm nervous.

815
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,940
- I'm nervous.

816
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,140
- Oh, you should be.

817
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,800
Let's reveal the fourth dream for us here.

818
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,420
Fourth one, I had sexual relations with my own mom.

819
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,980
I didn't see the direct action though.

820
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,460
I was just laying with her after finishing doing it.

821
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,820
It seems that kind of dreams is common for some people,

822
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,060
but it was still disturbing.

823
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,900
- Okay.

824
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,260
- I love being an ABDL and having a dream

825
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,160
where you have sex with your mom,

826
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,660
being like, "What could this mean?"

827
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,260
(laughing)

828
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,100
- What the hell could this mean?

829
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,900
- I also love having that and being like,

830
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,860
"Well, everyone has that.

831
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,700
Everyone probably gets dreams like that."

832
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,520
- Yeah, that's normal.

833
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,920
- Yeah, that's a normal dream.

834
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,080
Okay, you guys ready?

835
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,920
- Yes. - Yes.

836
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,740
- Fifth dream.

837
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,940
Fifth one, a girl pooped her pants so much

838
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,260
she could even rise her turd as an erected penis.

839
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,500
(laughing)

840
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,820
- Oh my god.

841
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,820
- A girl pooped her pants so much

842
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,180
she could even rise her turd as an erected penis.

843
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,780
- So let me kind of lay out what my theory,

844
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,420
'cause that makes almost no sense.

845
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,980
But I guess, is he saying that she would sit down,

846
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,300
like in a chair, shit her pants,

847
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,740
and then maybe she has her zipper open,

848
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,300
and it fills up her pants so much

849
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,980
that it pops through her zipper.

850
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,820
- No, I think--

851
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,740
- Zipper absolutely has nothing to do with this at all.

852
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,320
- I think that rise is a typo.

853
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,020
And I think it's supposed to be ride.

854
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,900
- Oh, that does make more sense.

855
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,020
- I think it's rise.

856
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:41,020
I think that her turd was so solid and it was packed in.

857
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,060
I also think that--

858
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,020
- I know this is about to make no sense.

859
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,860
- You're thinking about this--

860
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,260
- It's a dream, uh-oh, sorry, it's a dream, dipshit.

861
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,100
I think--

862
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
- The zipper makes perfect sense.

863
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,460
- You fill up your pants, the hole is there,

864
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,300
and it's like a play-doh.

865
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,820
- Yeah, that would make sense if it was a real thing

866
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,220
that happened, Caleb, you're right.

867
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,060
That physically, mechanically makes sense.

868
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,200
- Okay, then tell me your theory!

869
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,740
- Using dream psychoanalysis, I will tell you

870
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,940
exactly what happened. - Okay, dream expert.

871
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,780
Okay.

872
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,740
- When he said that she pooped them so much,

873
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,860
he just means she pooped them so specially.

874
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,260
So, she pooped them in such a way

875
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,060
that her turd went up and down.

876
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,340
That's what happened.

877
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,700
- So like-- - It wasn't the quantity,

878
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,380
what? - She shit so much

879
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,740
that like, it like, she was like--

880
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,140
- She shit in such a way that her poop was a full turd

881
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,020
and it went up and down like a butter.

882
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,860
- She pooped her pants so much, though.

883
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,260
- She was in Super Mario Sunshine.

884
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,300
- Why would he add that detail if she's saying

885
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,460
that she goes up and down like a piston in her own ass?

886
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,460
- Otherwise it would fall out of her ass.

887
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,740
- No, otherwise it would come out of the zipper

888
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,820
like a fucking hard brown cock, you fucking idiot.

889
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,660
- So you're thinking it's like Super Mario--

890
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
- If you didn't poop her pants, it would fall out of her butt.

891
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,440
- I'm the third way here.

892
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,520
I think that it doesn't come out of the pants at all.

893
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,340
It's a print, it's a poop print.

894
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,180
- You think it's a print?

895
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,020
- I think it's a pooped-up print.

896
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,580
- You really think that?

897
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,300
- It's like an Instagram picture

898
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,220
that the game would post. - Yeah, I think it's

899
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,780
a gray sweatpants.

900
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,020
- Okay, all right, that makes sense.

901
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,780
- This actually happened to me in real life.

902
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,620
- No, it didn't.

903
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,860
(laughing)

904
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,620
No, it did not.

905
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,900
- You're thinking, you're like, it's like--

906
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,420
- Okay, it was a dream that someone else had.

907
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:21,100
Okay, I was a dream that someone had of the diaper. I do like that. We all just had our own psycho like analysis

908
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:27,740
We were all like no your theory is completely wrong. I'm not sure my my theory was what I would call psycho analysis

909
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,980
Yeah, that shit would come out like a cock out of the you approach like Adam Savage

910
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,780
Yes, which I actually I've been watching a lot of videos where Adam Savage explains kind of his process

911
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,420
- Does he ruin everything?

912
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,260
- He does.

913
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,100
- All right.

914
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,920
- Yeah.

915
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,760
- For this next one, Julio,

916
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,580
can you please drag the bottom one down just to uncover,

917
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,420
just can you uncover them?

918
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,460
- Oh my God.

919
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,580
- 'Cause they're all covered up each other.

920
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,540
So can you just drag them out of the way?

921
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,380
- Cameron.

922
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
- I thought I would be able to have the animation

923
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,500
have them fade in.

924
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,580
I'm very sorry.

925
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,500
I already apologized.

926
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,460
You guys said it was okay.

927
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,180
- Yeah, it was okay.

928
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,780
- I love, okay, interesting places to wear.

929
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,900
I love wearing at my local casino.

930
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,260
I can sit at a table for hours and just keep drinking

931
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,820
and never have to take a break.

932
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,700
And I love walking around in it thinking,

933
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,420
I wonder how many people are wearing.

934
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,060
- Okay, I, that is, I do, that's a great idea.

935
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,900
- Yeah. - What?

936
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,620
- 'Cause that does suck when you're at a slot machine,

937
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,460
oh it's hot, oh the roulette table is hot,

938
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,740
I'm making fucking $10 an hour.

939
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,220
And then you-- - Nature calls.

940
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,980
- And then you go, oh I have to use the little boys room,

941
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,180
excuse me dealer. - Yeah, yeah.

942
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,020
- That sucks. - I'm no longer

943
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,060
a roulette machine, I'm a piss machine.

944
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,560
- It's better to when they ask you for your bet,

945
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,540
just kind of stand there, just grit your teeth

946
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,980
you push up the piss for a full 30 seconds.

947
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,940
Yeah, talking to the dealer, be like, "Can you not look at me for a second?

948
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,500
I need to go and I need to get shot."

949
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:53,260
If you're a seasoned pro and you're shitting your pants and pissing your pants at the casino,

950
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,340
I think that it could help you with your poker face.

951
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,780
I think if you go to the poker table and you're just like, you know, you're sitting there shitting.

952
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
Oh yeah.

953
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,820
Oh my God, that's impossible to read.

954
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,780
Yeah, they look at you, and they're never thinking this guy's shitting his pants

955
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,160
But they're looking your face, and you're like he's looking at me like he's taking a fucking shit right in his pants right now

956
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Yeah, what car does he have?

957
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,300
He has to have two keys

958
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:25,860
Hey, yeah, he's got a deuce. Yeah, you know and you know it's not gonna be a royal. I also think he's got a full house

959
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,780
Diaper he has a full

960
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,820
All right next

961
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,020
- I have to say one more thing, which is that--

962
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,380
- Yeah, he's not holding it.

963
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,740
- I think that might be good luck to wear a diaper,

964
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,780
because it is like, anything that I think is like,

965
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,420
impeding on a normal life, any kind of disability,

966
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,100
is very good luck at a casino.

967
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,980
- Yeah, I'm peeding in my pants and my diaper

968
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,900
at the casino.

969
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,460
- Once you get into the mindset of, I'm just secreting,

970
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,300
then you start secreting money.

971
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,500
- I'm plugged into the matrix, I'm sitting here,

972
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,860
I'm just a money machine.

973
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,060
- It's falling out of me, coins are falling out of my holes.

974
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,900
- I am a slot machine.

975
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,660
- And it's kind of effortless.

976
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,220
It's basically second nature.

977
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,060
A slot machine.

978
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,900
- I am a slot machine.

979
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,860
- A slime machine.

980
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,700
- Next interesting place is,

981
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,220
I love urbexing, that's urban exploration.

982
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,060
- I know.

983
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,300
- Padded with, I don't care what you know.

984
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,140
- That's okay.

985
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,960
- You don't know anything.

986
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,220
- Padded with a few beers.

987
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,080
If it's a place that's already cluttered with litter,

988
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,900
such as an abandoned hospital in the downtown of my hometown,

989
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,060
I've actually left used diapers there before.

990
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,540
Am I allowed to post pics?

991
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,420
Although when I've come back, they're never there.

992
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,660
It really makes me wonder how that is the only piece

993
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,860
of trash to go missing.

994
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,700
- It's a raccoon.

995
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,040
- Is there another part of this that's covered up

996
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,880
by any chance?

997
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,700
I can't remember.

998
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,540
- No, I don't think so.

999
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,560
- I think there might be.

1000
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,400
- Oh yeah.

1001
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,660
- Yep, yep, yep.

1002
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,080
Depending on whether the locations

1003
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,540
already have a good amount of graffiti,

1004
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,160
I actually have left my A-disc username tagged before.

1005
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,880
This person tags their adult diaper

1006
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,960
full of Andy Hamming graffiti.

1007
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,000
- That is so funny to be into graffiti

1008
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,080
and also wearing a diaper.

1009
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,720
- Yeah, they're not so far away.

1010
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,280
- You think they get a paint pen

1011
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,600
and write their fucking, write their name,

1012
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,600
like their graffiti tag name on there.

1013
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,440
- You think they do graffiti with their name?

1014
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,520
- You think they, what, that's what it says.

1015
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,000
- No, no, no, no, I mean, I was, oh fuck.

1016
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,040
I've had three beers.

1017
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,760
- Do you think that they poop on their finger

1018
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,520
and wipe it and smear it?

1019
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,360
- Is that what you're asking?

1020
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,120
- No, do you think that they write their graffiti name

1021
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,240
on the front of their diaper?

1022
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,440
- I think it makes more sense,

1023
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,600
and it's probably a funnier point

1024
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,120
that they might write their name in their shit.

1025
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,400
- Yeah, maybe they're spraying it.

1026
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,280
It comes out exactly like spray paint.

1027
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,120
- But that wouldn't make any sense

1028
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,960
'cause it's too weird.

1029
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,780
- Yeah, it's strange.

1030
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,980
They did it in the in the graffiti style with poop.

1031
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,280
That would be pretty impressive.

1032
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,580
They might be one of the greatest artists who ever lived.

1033
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,480
If somebody would have had that much control of their ass

1034
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,180
and their penis.

1035
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,480
I mean, that's how much they like Jackson Pollock.

1036
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,980
You just throw you have a stencil on the wall and you just

1037
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,380
explosive diarrhea.

1038
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,980
I wasn't I wasn't going to say that I was going to say like

1039
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:59,680
you you shit like in like block letters like you like you

1040
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,680
- Oh, you put like a little cookie cutter on your anus.

1041
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,520
- Yeah.

1042
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,340
(laughing)

1043
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,180
- That's a good idea.

1044
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,180
- And it writes out your tagging name.

1045
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,020
- The only problem with that is that

1046
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,680
you could only graffiti the floor.

1047
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,520
- No, no, no, no.

1048
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,360
- You would have to bend over and do it on the wall.

1049
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,760
- But how does it stick?

1050
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,600
- You eat a lot of--

1051
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,360
- Sticky foods, right, it wouldn't pull down.

1052
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,760
- You eat like a lot of garlic or like--

1053
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,600
- You eat sticky foods.

1054
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,440
- Something that makes you diarrhea.

1055
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,560
- Yeah, you eat what you normally eat plus glue.

1056
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,400
- Yeah.

1057
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,240
- Okay, that might work.

1058
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,060
- Simple.

1059
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,900
- Okay.

1060
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,200
- The last interesting place is obviously

1061
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,960
on the last interesting places opera premier billionaire environment so

1062
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,500
it's been a recent millionaire vibes

1063
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,720
billionaire environment is so funny to me

1064
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,280
this wearing a diaper in a billionaire environment

1065
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,140
uh... i'm struggling being a diaper lover and i don't like it

1066
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,300
i'm struggling with the fact that i can't stop wearing wanting diapers

1067
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,620
i ride bulls and cowboy but i can't help the feelings of wanting to wear and use

1068
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,280
diapers this is a problem to me because i feel we can baby is when i wear diapers

1069
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,040
and it's the direct opposite of who i am when i'm writing polls

1070
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,580
I feel like I have a split personality

1071
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,120
and I really need helping coming to terms with who I am.

1072
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,800
Is there anyone else in the Western lifestyle

1073
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,760
who loves diapers?

1074
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,720
How do y'all deal with it?

1075
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,840
And how did you come to terms with it?

1076
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,760
Slash stop binging and purging.

1077
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,920
Any and all help would be great.

1078
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,440
- Well do you guys know about binging and purging

1079
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,280
in the community?

1080
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,520
- In the diaper community? - No.

1081
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,480
- Yeah, binging is when you wear a fuck ton of diapers

1082
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,740
and shit and piss in them all the time and get off.

1083
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,200
And purging is when you say,

1084
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,920
I have to stop being into diapers

1085
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,600
and you throw them all away.

1086
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,960
(laughing)

1087
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,520
- I just learned that.

1088
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,880
- So it's not really a, it's more of just a choice here.

1089
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,600
- It's nothing digestive, it's like you excess in diapers

1090
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,440
and then you stop, yeah.

1091
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,640
- Here's some more from this thread.

1092
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,360
I felt the conflict when I was much younger.

1093
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,240
In high school and college,

1094
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,040
I loved sports and managed to play a few.

1095
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,520
After I graduated from college,

1096
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,640
I got into quarter mile drag racing

1097
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,340
and had two cars I ran at the track.

1098
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,040
At the same time, I dearly loved wearing and wetting diapers.

1099
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,240
For years it was a conflict

1100
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,120
and I had trouble as to how I saw myself.

1101
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,440
But over the years, I began to realize

1102
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,760
that as people were complicated

1103
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,300
and sometimes were more than the sum of our parts,

1104
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,140
so to speak.

1105
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,460
I learn to make peace with myself, learning to accept my quirks along with my plusses

1106
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,460
and successes.

1107
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,980
Both are part of the same person and they can reside together in peace if you accept yourself

1108
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,820
for all the wonderful things that you are.

1109
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,660
So the reason I put this in here is this one.

1110
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,540
I realized I've never wanted to see a movie more than a movie about a guy who's a drag

1111
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,100
racer and he's trying to make peace with being a diaper lover also.

1112
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,220
And he's like, he's drag racing and then he's going home and putting on diapers and he's

1113
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,220
drinking and he's like, "Fuck.

1114
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,220
Fuck, I need to quit."

1115
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,440
Fuck I need to quit but somehow we would need to figure out a way for the diaper is like

1116
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,780
Somehow also kind of making a metaphor. It's making it like better

1117
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,680
It's well, it's making a better at drag racing because you can stay in the car. Oh, how the fuck does he do it?

1118
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:42,880
He's in that damn car and his wife his wife or his new girlfriend or whatever is like like you never

1119
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,220
It's you never want to get intimate with me. Yeah

1120
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,660
Wouldn't that be perfect? I got something I need to show you and he pulls off his fucking like suit

1121
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,260
Oh my god, nothing on but a diaper underneath holy diaper driver. That would be good

1122
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,540
Yeah, just baby

1123
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,940
That's genius

1124
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,960
Any of mine, but there's I was looking up if anyone does psychedelics in the adult baby

1125
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,700
Community and a ton of people are just like tripping on mushrooms and wearing a diaper is I will never go back

1126
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,460
I was tripping with my friends for hours and I came home and I put on a diaper and I was able to go into

1127
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,160
to my baby place immediately.

1128
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,640
- When they say, "Well, they'll never go back,"

1129
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,460
do they mean that they will--

1130
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,420
- No, they'll always trip and--

1131
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,540
- Right, but is it that they always took mushrooms

1132
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,780
and now I can't take, like, now I'm adding diapers,

1133
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,100
or is that I always wear diapers and I'm adding mushrooms?

1134
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,940
Do you know what I'm saying?

1135
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,340
- Oh, I think it might be a little bit of both.

1136
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,180
- Is it like I used to love wearing diapers,

1137
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,420
but now I have to take mushrooms when I do it,

1138
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,900
or is it like I'm just like a stoner,

1139
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,780
I always take shrooms, but I realize my best trips

1140
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,740
are always when I'm wearing diapers.

1141
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,980
- I could see myself, I could see--

1142
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,900
- It was a psycho nut who tried on a diaper.

1143
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,900
- Yeah, exactly.

1144
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,220
- If you were on Mushrooms, I could see it feeling

1145
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,660
really good to piss your pants.

1146
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1147
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,700
- I personally wouldn't want to, but I was curious.

1148
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,260
I thought that maybe someone would say,

1149
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,700
"Oh, I'm a disgusting freak," and they had a bad trip,

1150
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,500
but all the trips were extremely good trips.

1151
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,300
- So now you have an interest in it?

1152
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,540
- You don't wanna knock it, you know,

1153
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,620
the people who are asking the questions.

1154
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,060
- Yeah, yeah.

1155
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,220
- The next one here is, "I've been trying not to do this,

1156
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,740
but the urge is too strong.

1157
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,460
Do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1158
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,620
- You don't know this song?

1159
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,020
- I know this part of it,

1160
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,460
I don't remember how the does go.

1161
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,300
You sing it.

1162
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,120
- Yeah, you go.

1163
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,500
- Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1164
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,420
- I knew that, I specifically put this in for Patrick.

1165
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,700
- And then you sing the part.

1166
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,340
- Some people call me the diaper cowboy.

1167
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,260
- What? Wow.

1168
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,500
(laughing)

1169
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
- Some people call me the gangster of loves.

1170
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,020
- Oh my God, wait, that is fire.

1171
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,600
That is a fucking bar right there, dude.

1172
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,260
- Woo, woo, wah, wah.

1173
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,900
- Yeah, loves is a good little pun.

1174
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,740
- The gangster of loves.

1175
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,980
- I just love some people call me the diaper cowboy.

1176
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,820
It just doesn't even fit.

1177
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,220
- Some people call me the diaper cowboy.

1178
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,060
- All right, paranormal happenings.

1179
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,140
- No.

1180
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,140
- I have seen ghosts before

1181
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,980
and prophetic dreams and energy experiences.

1182
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,340
And then the next one, I had a ghost poop once.

1183
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,560
I really had to go one day, almost pooped myself at school

1184
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,700
because toilets were full and a line outside of door.

1185
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,140
I made it home after 10 more minutes

1186
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,500
I have an absolute hell of a bus ride.

1187
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,980
Every bump was torture.

1188
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,500
Got home, ran to the toilet and squeezed out

1189
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,620
what I thought was a log.

1190
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,180
Looked in the bowl of whatever demon I spawned

1191
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,940
into this world and nothing.

1192
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,420
I apparently pooped out a ghost.

1193
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,620
- This has happened to everyone here, right?

1194
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,460
- Yeah. - A fart?

1195
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,280
- I've pooped a ghost.

1196
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,300
- No, no, no, like you feel it coming out of your ass

1197
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,220
and then you look in the toilet and there's nothing.

1198
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,660
- That's never happened to me.

1199
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,540
- It's so heavy that it slips under the bowl, yeah.

1200
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,460
- Let's go.

1201
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,380
- Oh, okay, so you have an explanation for it.

1202
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,340
You've cracked the case.

1203
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,060
- Yeah, but you can't see it when you look down.

1204
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,840
- You've never taken a ghost poop?

1205
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,260
water they float directly to the surface like fish food my shit's like shaking a

1206
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,060
pepper grinder they don't I don't have perfect logs that decide to flush

1207
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,720
themselves because they know what is this a cartoon I don't shit turds out of my head

1208
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,460
I really don't and some more paranormal happenings here I think these are my

00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:10,860

1210
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,020
heaven if not I hope I'm running around in my diaper with a mommy ghost chasing

1211
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,020
- I'm gonna need you to tell me to change me.

1212
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,860
- That is so awesome.

1213
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,780
- Can you imagine a ghost like that?

1214
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,740
- Heaven should be someone chasing you.

1215
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,580
- Yeah.

1216
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,420
(laughing)

1217
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,380
- Who would chase you?

1218
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,380
- The candy man. - No.

1219
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,100
No, heaven should be relaxing.

1220
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,140
- No, it should be Gapool.

1221
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,540
- Julio, can you uncover the middle one, please?

1222
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,340
- Okay. - Thank you.

1223
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,000
So I'm sitting on the couch in my room

1224
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,100
with some buddies smoking Kush weed.

1225
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,740
When my door creaks open a centimeter

1226
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,900
and I say out loud, "Not now, I got company,"

1227
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,400
and immediately the door creaked shut.

1228
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,840
Later that evening, my guests have left

1229
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,880
and I'm laying on my floor and I recall the door incident

1230
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,840
and I say out loud, "All right, my friends are gone.

1231
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,680
"You can come in now."

1232
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,040
Immediately the door creaked open.

1233
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,120
Yeah, that's my true story.

1234
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,280
- Holy fuck.

1235
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
- That's just backdraft.

1236
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,420
I don't believe this person.

1237
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,260
- I believe it. - Pretty scary though

1238
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,720
if it's true. - Yeah.

1239
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,600
- I'm now, this last paranormal experience

1240
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,480
from Diaperman0723.

1241
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,720
I have had a friend of mine that had the demon Beelzebub

1242
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,480
attached to them. (laughing)

1243
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,480
- Wow.

1244
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,840
This is, what part of the forum were all these on?

1245
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,640
I was just typing in "parents."

1246
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,680
I typed in "ghost" I think and found this.

1247
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,880
I have one last one to show you guys.

1248
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,280
- I'm getting hungry!

1249
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,040
- Okay, so there's one more for you to go through.

1250
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,880
It's so short and simple.

1251
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,520
And here's the final one.

1252
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,960
Women have best butts, period.

1253
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,800
(laughing)

1254
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,160
- Deleted member!

1255
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,640
- Come back, man.

1256
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,520
We need you back.

1257
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,360
Deleted member said that.

1258
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,680
- Women do have the best butts.

1259
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,520
- Period.

1260
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,480
- Yeah, men's asses are too small.

1261
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,320
- Yeah.

1262
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,520
- They need to be big and concrete.

1263
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,480
- I almost thought for a second you said

1264
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,840
women's asses were too small.

1265
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,680
- No, women's houses, thank God.

1266
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,520
- And I thought, how much bigger could they get?

1267
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,960
- Women's houses are the perfect giant size to me.

1268
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,880
- Well, let's say we open up another piece of food.

1269
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,320
- Okay, what is it?

1270
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,160
- Okay, open it up.

1271
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,000
- Oh dear.

1272
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,400
- Well, who hasn't opened one on camera yet?

1273
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,480
- We've all opened one.

1274
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,200
- So why don't you do the honors?

1275
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,240
You can do double duty.

1276
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,440
- Oh, what's this?

1277
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,280
What could this one be?

1278
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,240
- Okay, so first layer.

1279
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,480
Hey, oh, this is totally that pumpkin pie.

1280
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,320
- Okay, open it.

1281
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,160
- No, no, no, no, no.

1282
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,600
- Open it, open it, open it.

1283
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,440
We're hungry.

1284
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:17,600
nothing wrong with sneaking along my done with dinner hey now this I'll enjoy I

1285
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,920
don't know if I've ever really had pumpkin pie I think I usually check this

1286
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,200
out looks good right mm-hmm never had pumpkin pie I don't think I've had it

1287
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,500
but I've definitely had it but it wasn't remarkable enough and I always go for

1288
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,880
the apple pie instead apple pie is way worse than pumpkin pie hey I like that I

1289
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,980
I like both of them.

1290
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,180
This doesn't taste like pumpkin, though.

1291
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,980
But you know what?

1292
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,180
Now that I'm older, with my more refined palate,

1293
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,340
I think maybe there's a secret ingredient that

1294
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,260
is making this taste better.

1295
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,860
Oh, yeah.

1296
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,540
It's my diaper.

1297
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,260
It's a diaper.

1298
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:51,740
Oh, yeah.

1299
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,060
It's my diaper.

1300
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:53,860
Would you pass that?

1301
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,820
Oh, that was good.

1302
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,580
I can't stop.

1303
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,300
Can we have another dish, or is that too much?

1304
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,700
I feel like we have another.

1305
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,900
Yeah, let's have one more.

1306
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,220
We might as well.

1307
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,300
This is, I think, mine.

1308
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,220
OK, well then, open it up.

1309
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,180
You can do triple duty.

1310
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,340
- I'm excited to see this one.

1311
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,620
- You can do triple duty.

1312
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,580
- This is like a recipe that my mom taught me.

1313
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,780
- This is a traditional Stinksgiving or no?

1314
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,620
- No, this is a little bit--

1315
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,440
- Kind of a new twist?

1316
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,280
- This is a little bit outside of the tradition.

1317
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,040
- And what's that?

1318
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,780
- Well, you can see we have some rice here.

1319
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,620
- Okay.

1320
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,500
- Maybe this is some bok choy.

1321
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,620
- Oh, this is like an Eastern inspired Stinksgiving meal.

1322
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,460
- So what is that?

1323
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,580
- Let me get my spoon out here

1324
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,060
so I can get to the real main event.

1325
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,900
- What would you--

1326
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,720
- Oh, what is that?

1327
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,560
- Imitation crab!

1328
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,400
- Oh, wow, well--

1329
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,860
- You're gonna find some imitation crab,

1330
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:41,120
gonna find some of that sweet triangular egg that we love in our sushi dishes and

1331
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,320
you're gonna have...

1332
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
And don't forget the rice, Pierce!

1333
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:51,320
Here, I'll help you out.

1334
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Oh, he's so hungry!

1335
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:05,320
It looks so good! I'm so jealous you get to eat all of this!

1336
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,320
You can have a bite if you like.

1337
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Oh yeah.

1338
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,320
Have a bite.

1339
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,320
It's a sushi bowl.

1340
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,320
Oh god.

1341
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,320
I love this.

1342
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,320
Let me have some more of this imitation crab.

1343
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,320
Oh it is exceptional.

1344
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,320
I'm full. I already had some.

1345
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,320
I think Cameron hasn't had a single bite.

1346
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,320
This imitation crab is perfect room temperature.

1347
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,320
You know I'm pretty full but I can't help myself.

1348
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,320
I'm going to have one grain of rice.

1349
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,320
That is good.

1350
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,480
Oh, that's just the right portion for me.

1351
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,520
That's delectable and we should store that right in the trash can right now.

1352
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,920
Oh, that's good.

1353
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Oh yeah.

1354
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
And he loves it!

1355
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,640
Look at how much he loves it!

1356
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,000
Complete sushi facial abuse on beers.

1357
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
He's crying.

1358
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I can smell it coming out of my mouth.

1359
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,240
(laughing)

1360
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,080
- Oh fuck.

1361
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,320
(laughing)

1362
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:18,980
- Oh my god.

1363
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,980
- It's the worst episode we've ever done

1364
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,980
in a fucking Plasma Jam.

1365
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,240
- Oh no.

1366
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,080
- Oh man.

1367
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,040
- So that was good.

1368
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,560
- That was awesome.

1369
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,400
- That was delicious.

1370
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,960
- Yeah! - Give it up for Pierce!

1371
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,280
- Thanks for bringing that, Pierce.

1372
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,800
Happy Stinksgiving, buddy!

1373
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,200
- Say stink you for your food.

1374
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,360
- Stink you for your food!

1375
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
- Mm, that was good.

1376
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,040
- Oh, I can't wait to shit this all out.

1377
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,300
- Well, let's get to the next gift.

1378
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,760
I want another present.

1379
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,760
- Oh, I thought you were reaching over to eat more of it.

1380
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,040
(laughing)

1381
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,880
Okay.

1382
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,740
- Patrick, you made a mess.

1383
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,720
- Oh, dear.

1384
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,920
Oh my god, that really sticks in your mouth forever.

1385
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,720
Yeah, I can't taste anything but sushi bowl.

1386
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,960
God damn, dude.

1387
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,760
OK, we can show my gift.

1388
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,360
I actually brought a gift for you guys.

1389
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,760
It's a little larger than the last two gifts.

1390
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,880
But I would like to show you guys.

1391
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,400
That doesn't really matter on Thanksgiving is the thing,

1392
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,160
isn't it?

1393
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,520
I just hope nobody gets hungry during the big gift, right?

1394
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
It's probably going to make everyone--

1395
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,920
I mean, Pierce is ready to eat again.

1396
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,960
I can see it in his eyes.

1397
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,120
Why don't you here?

1398
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,160
Let's get you something to eat during the gift.

1399
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,520
- Oh no, we only have one last thing

1400
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,360
and I'd like to save it.

1401
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,440
- No, we have, okay, we have more than one last thing.

1402
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,560
But we'll save it, we'll save it.

1403
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,400
- You're right.

1404
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,080
- Can I get some more of that pumpkin pie?

1405
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,960
- Yeah, help yourself.

1406
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,320
- Where is it?

1407
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,360
- It's over here.

1408
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,640
- Okay. - Have some pumpkin pie.

1409
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,600
- Here, how about you feed it to me, Pierce?

1410
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,440
- No.

1411
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,360
(laughing)

1412
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,980
- I think Patrick learned a little too much

1413
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,240
from the diaper forums.

1414
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,080
- Yeah, I think so too.

1415
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,960
- I think Patrick learned how to derive pleasure

1416
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,800
from odd things.

1417
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,360
- So here's my Thanksgiving gift, guys.

1418
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,520
So let's take a look at this.

1419
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,560
This is, I did not go to the ABDL forums.

1420
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,240
I found some other, or I didn't go to the one

1421
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,360
that everybody likes, the diaper talk one.

1422
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,120
I went deep into the pages of searching ABDL forum

1423
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,840
and I found this one on christianforums.com, diaper fetish.

1424
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,520
MRA 22, hello, my real name is Matt.

1425
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,720
So right off the bat, he tells his real name.

1426
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,320
I'm in need of prayer and advice.

1427
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,460
I'm not trying to do this for spam or anything

1428
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,900
and I trust that I won't be judged,

1429
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,600
but for pretty much my whole entire life,

1430
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,960
I've struggled with something called a diaper fetish,

1431
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,700
which falls in with something called ABDL.

1432
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,300
Growing up, I had somewhat of a rough life.

1433
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,120
I was abused when I was younger before,

1434
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,060
and I was made fun of, and was called an egghead,

1435
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,100
or a conehead, and it hurt.

1436
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,100
But I would resort to wearing diapers,

1437
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,520
and it took stress away.

1438
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,940
The thing I know, wearing diapers in general is not a sin,

1439
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,940
it is just another form of underwear.

1440
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,260
It is just that I find myself becoming aroused by them,

1441
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,900
and I even like to look at grown women wearing them

1442
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,380
and I'm aroused by that.

1443
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't like the nudity stuff though

1444
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,460
because I know nudity pics is wrong and sinful.

1445
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,220
It just feels like I'm at a tug of war

1446
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,940
because I love God with everything in me

1447
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,860
and I just don't really understand my fascination

1448
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,260
with this lifestyle and I'm going on 23.

1449
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,660
It is something that can be embarrassing

1450
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,460
and I would just appreciate prayers and advice, thank you.

1451
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,300
- Oh my God.

1452
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,700
- So there's plenty of people on this Christian forum.

1453
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,400
- You can tell that this guy is truly

1454
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,140
kind of a good-hearted Christian man

1455
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,900
'cause he's not at war, he's at tug of war.

1456
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,060
(laughing)

1457
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,740
- I really wanna see--

1458
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,780
- He said-- - Bug off, War.

1459
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,940
- He said he was called an egghead or a conehead,

1460
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,780
and I really wanna see that.

1461
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,060
- I can't remember, but I do wanna see what he was.

1462
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,560
- Hello, my name is Matt, and this is my real head.

1463
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,860
(laughing)

1464
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,780
This is my real head shape. - Wait, can we just look

1465
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,980
at Patrick's plate real quick?

1466
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,660
- Oh yeah, wait, let's show his plate real quick.

1467
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,400
Oh God, that looks delicious.

1468
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,660
Look at that, the cranberry sauce

1469
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,180
mixed in with the sushi rice.

1470
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,740
(laughing)

1471
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,580
Oh!

1472
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,980
Man down with the cranberry sauce.

1473
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:55,820
- Cran down.

1474
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,020
- So we have some people trying to help.

1475
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,100
This person is Saltwater Heart,

1476
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,180
a Christian furry and a Christian brony.

1477
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,460
I'm familiar with the community because I'm an ABDL too.

1478
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,460
Like you, I was abused and wearing diapers

1479
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,440
helps me to decompress and cope with the trauma.

1480
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,820
Drawing baby furs or ABDL furries is pretty fun as well.

1481
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,780
I will say that I harbor no sexual interest

1482
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,380
for any of it though.

1483
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,300
That aside, I have run across some pages

1484
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,580
that tackle ABDLism and Christianity.

1485
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,980
perhaps they'll be of help to you.

1486
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,980
And then he doesn't link them,

1487
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,300
which seems kind of selfish.

1488
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,100
- Yeah, find 'em yourself.

1489
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,140
- Selfish to somebody who might need

1490
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,380
looking for stuff for a podcast.

1491
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,900
- Exactly, and then within a couple of days,

1492
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,940
these two people make a pretty similar post.

1493
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,440
I have the same feelings myself.

1494
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,260
I like looking at pictures of women in diapers

1495
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,660
and I feel aroused when I wear one.

1496
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,380
It gives me a feeling of security, peace, and happiness.

1497
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,500
And hey, I need help with this also,

1498
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
says History Incognito.

1499
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,260
And then so I found this other website,

1500
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,140
which I don't think we've touched before.

1501
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,380
This is a German diaper website called Diaper--

1502
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,500
- It's about to get freaky as hell.

1503
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,220
- Diaper.community, okay?

1504
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,140
I didn't get all that much from Diaper.community

1505
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,640
because it's not very active.

1506
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,820
But I did find some things, like this post,

1507
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,260
made big in the diaper.

1508
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,460
This is from Helmet.

1509
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,540
(both laughing)

1510
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,500
And this is all translated by Google Chrome.

1511
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,800
Hello everyone, I did it last night, finally,

1512
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,920
and I would be interested in how you do it.

1513
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,060
And there's some responses here.

1514
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,460
Here's one from Wow, who says, "Hello."

1515
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,620
(laughing)

1516
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,080
Who says, "Hello, you shit pants."

1517
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,380
(laughing)

1518
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,000
For me, there is nothing more appealing

1519
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,740
than doing big business in a mostly wet diaper.

1520
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,480
This often happens in the morning

1521
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,820
after waking up when the toilet is urgent.

1522
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,260
If I plan to do that, I pack myself in the evening

1523
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,860
with thick night diapers, pads, and rubber pants.

1524
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,100
Always wear a pair of long-legged panties

1525
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,820
so that everything stays in place,

1526
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,700
then lie on my back, empty the bladder,

1527
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,140
and then follow the AA.

1528
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,440
I've learned AA, I don't really know what it means,

1529
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,240
but for whatever reason, all these German people,

1530
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,080
that is what they refer.

1531
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,120
- Follow the AA.

1532
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,480
- Follow the AA. - AA means basically

1533
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,320
take a shit.

1534
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,440
I think it's like BM, basically.

1535
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,280
- Oh, okay.

1536
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,560
- A very-- - Hausfacht.

1537
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,880
- Yeah, I think something like that.

1538
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,000
- Ausch, ausch.

1539
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,600
- Ouch, ouch.

1540
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,080
A very wonderful feeling.

1541
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,760
Knead a little, distribute a little,

1542
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,240
and then stand up slowly.

1543
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,440
Sitting on the chair for breakfast, what a pleasure.

1544
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,480
I can easily enjoy this unique condition for several hours

1545
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,040
by applying a lot of lotion the night before.

1546
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,480
It could well be afternoon.

1547
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,560
Depending on the packaging,

1548
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,280
I do that from time to time when I'm on the go.

1549
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,400
That's even more fun.

1550
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,440
But as I said, you should only allow yourself

1551
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,080
the necessary packaging, rubber pants, air brakes.

1552
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,920
I have good experience with it.

1553
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,040
Greetings, Wally.

1554
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:31,920
- Oh my God.

1555
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,920
- And then I looked into Wow's profile some more

1556
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,080
and he posted this on how often do you AA in your diapers?

1557
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,080
Not everyone wants to admit that.

1558
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,800
Of course, a pee diaper is easier to handle, but those who have become addicted to this

1559
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,800
fetish are happy to accept the unpleasant side of feeling a really full diaper on your

1560
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,680
bottom for the unique feeling.

1561
01:02:53,680 --> 01:03:00,040
For me personally, there is nothing more beautiful and lovely than doing AA in the always thick,

1562
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:04,360
wet diapers and enjoying this wonderful state for as long as possible.

1563
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,580
Of course, you can only do this when circumstances allow.

1564
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,200
For me, it's at least 4 times a week.

1565
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,680
I don't just do it at home, but also when I'm on the go.

1566
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,520
but I have to say that I then wear very good

1567
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,200
tailor-made Bermuda latex rubber pants,

1568
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,920
which hardly let any unpleasant smell escape to the outside.

1569
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,240
Who would like to be labeled as a pants shit?

1570
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,040
(both laughing)

1571
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,680
- Oh my God, it's a superhero.

1572
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,880
- I know.

1573
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,480
And then so there's also some groups on this website.

1574
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,620
So there's like, they're basically complete copies

1575
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:33,040
of like Facebook groups.

1576
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,680
So this one, there's Pokemon Go,

1577
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,000
there's Mac users,

1578
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,920
and then there's geocaching in diapers.

1579
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,520
Everyone with a hobby of geocaching is welcome.

1580
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,360
- That's nice.

1581
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:50,360
- So I looked up AA is ah ah ma shin, makin,

1582
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,040
to do big jobs.

1583
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,680
(laughing)

1584
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,560
So it's like to do a number two.

1585
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,760
- Okay, a big job.

1586
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,600
- Yeah, to do a big job.

1587
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,760
- Oh, that's why they say big business at another point.

1588
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,600
Okay, that makes sense.

1589
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,660
- I wonder if it's like an autonym from baby days,

1590
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,920
like when German babies shit, they go ah, ah, ah.

1591
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,520
(yells)

1592
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,560
- I hate big business.

1593
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,520
I think what big business is doing to this country

1594
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,720
and to my pants is disgusting.

1595
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,560
- It's very, very bad.

1596
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,380
- It's nasty.

1597
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,720
- All they're doing is eating schnitzel

1598
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,360
and sausages over there.

1599
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,200
- Okay.

1600
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,760
- Of course their craps are gonna look crazy.

1601
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,480
- I agree, they're eating shit.

1602
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,200
- And then I found, so in addition to this,

1603
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,620
so these couple forum posts,

1604
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,240
I found while looking for other forums,

1605
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,520
I found this website, let's see,

1606
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,540
Life as a Diapered Mother.

1607
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,840
Wearing diapers as a parent

1608
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,600
who is a diaper lover and an adult baby.

1609
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,420
And this is a blog spot that's been going on

1610
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,280
for I think 10 years now.

1611
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,260
And then she has an FAQ where she answers,

1612
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,760
or sorry, sorry, about me.

1613
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,540
My name is Beth and I have been happily married since 2009.

1614
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,160
We both have two children together

1615
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,800
and I am a 30-something year old woman

1616
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,400
and my husband is a lot older than I am in his early 40s.

1617
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,960
I've been wearing diapers off and on since I was 17

1618
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,000
and have gone 24/7 a couple of times.

1619
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,120
My husband, on the other hand,

1620
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,320
has been into them for a while,

1621
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,960
but he is more of an AB than a ABDL.

1622
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,680
He also forces me to wear diapers

1623
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,100
and I enjoy it more that way.

1624
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,160
Plus, it is what I've always wanted.

1625
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,160
I have always had a fantasy of a man forcing me into diapers

1626
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,280
and I have to wear them and do everything in them.

1627
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,700
Plus, I'm more calm in diapers

1628
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,280
and more relaxed and happier.

1629
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,560
So it's as if I mentally need them.

1630
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,720
Plus, I seem to function better in the relationship.

1631
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,640
I think it's more fun to be forced into them

1632
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,540
than be wearing them on my own, under my own consent.

1633
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,360
My hobbies are computer.

1634
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,200
(laughing)

1635
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,000
And I also like video games.

1636
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,320
And I like to write and have return to it.

1637
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,240
I also love to clean and it relaxes me.

1638
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,240
This was written in English also.

1639
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,620
I am also childlike and a kid at heart

1640
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,760
and my emotions are a bit immature.

1641
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,160
That is just the natural part of me

1642
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,480
but I think it's very good for my AB role.

1643
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,460
I also love cartoons and kid shows

1644
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,240
but I don't watch very much TV.

1645
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,640
My husband views me as innocent

1646
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,640
despite that I am capable of being mean and rude and bad.

1647
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,500
I am also an opinionated person.

1648
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,020
So I have a lot of unpopular opinions and point of views,

1649
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,180
so it makes me look like a jerk or judgmental

1650
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,500
or come off as a troll.

1651
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,520
My husband likes to describe me as having mean views.

1652
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,700
In no way do we involve our kids in our fetish.

1653
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,540
How old are they?

1654
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,940
Well, they were born in 2010 and 2014.

1655
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,780
- By the way, this is how I used to do

1656
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:23,100
all of my writing prompts when I was in like fourth grade

1657
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,300
is I would ask myself rhetorical questions

1658
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,300
and then I would go, well.

1659
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,140
- Well.

1660
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,020
(laughing)

1661
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,860
Warning, this blog contains off-topic posts and rants

1662
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:33,500
and my ramblings and may contain irrelevant stuff.

1663
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,960
It's my blog, so I don't try to be normal or anything,

1664
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,380
and I am more than ABDL, so I may just blog

1665
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,540
about other stuff as well,

1666
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,580
which is why I had created another blog.

1667
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,180
I hope you enjoy my blog.

1668
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,780
- What do they mean by off topic?

1669
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:47,220
I feel like the topic here is being a diapered mom

1670
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,660
constantly, so it's just--

1671
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,220
- No, there's a lot of-- - Interesting here is--

1672
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,020
- I'll get into it, but there's a lot of other stuff

1673
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,620
on this blog. - Yeah, okay, well.

1674
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,340
- So the-- - I'm glad you have more--

1675
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,700
- Really quickly, this has one like,

1676
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,500
one blogger liked this. - Matt DeVito liked this.

1677
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,500
No, it's not Matt DeVita, it's actually Gordon Shagin.

1678
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,760
(laughter)

1679
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,700
Who seems like a good guy.

1680
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,460
- Oh, that's Gordon Shagina.

1681
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,300
- Shagin.

1682
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,140
- Shagina.

1683
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:13,960
- Shagina.

1684
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,300
- He's Shagina in a diaper.

1685
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,140
- So, uh.

1686
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:21,440
These are some of the posts, these are some of the titles.

1687
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,700
So I don't want to include the bodies of these

1688
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,100
because a lot of them have pictures of her diapers

1689
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,220
filled with shit or very--

1690
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,360
- We're going for some more chicken right now, oh my god!

1691
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,620
- We're very particular--

1692
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:34,860
- Hungry as fuck, dude.

1693
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,620
- God, dude.

1694
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,660
- His skin just rubbed up the diaper.

1695
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,340
- Very particular details about her life.

1696
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,340
So I'll just stick to mostly titles for this.

1697
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,580
I'm so full of shit, a huge load,

1698
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,340
ouch my butt.

1699
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,740
- These are all accompanying with photos of a full diaper?

1700
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,660
- For the most part, yeah.

1701
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,340
pooped my nappy, I felt like using a British word,

1702
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,740
I'll include somebody.

1703
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,540
And then yay, wifi is back.

1704
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,020
(laughing)

1705
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:09,100
It's not all about the diapers, yay, wifi is back.

1706
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,580
Another stinky in one day.

1707
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,100
I haven't used the toilet since last summer.

1708
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:14,940
- Oh my God.

1709
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,140
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

1710
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:20,660
- And the PC police have struck again.

1711
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,420
The PC police have struck again.

1712
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,900
And then there's more stuff, there's a retarder.

1713
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,740
- This was a new term I just learned.

1714
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,540
(laughing)

1715
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:30,020
Let's see.

1716
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,460
Oh yeah, so she also has claimed

1717
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,420
that she kind of invented her own religion.

1718
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,300
She says, "I also think people do a religion

1719
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,260
"because they need rules,

1720
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,220
"but you don't need to pick a religion to do.

1721
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,220
"Why not make up your own?

1722
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,080
"My religion is no toilet usage, no underwear,

1723
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,500
"no weighing above 125 pounds, no unemployment,

1724
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,120
"no belief in God, no church,

1725
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,700
"no Christmas before Thanksgiving."

1726
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,820
- What does that mean?

1727
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:52,100
- I have no idea.

1728
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,220
- No Christmas before Thanksgiving?

1729
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,980
Must shower when I see too much pubic hair growing in.

1730
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,940
Must not judge people for things that they do

1731
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,200
that are totally different, that are not harming others

1732
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,860
no matter how gross it is.

1733
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,620
Must, which seems a little bit like she's trying

1734
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,500
to get you to kind of believe that.

1735
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,180
Must exercise five times a week on weekdays.

1736
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,900
- This lady's taking showers so hot

1737
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,540
it scalds all her pubes off.

1738
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,380
(laughing)

1739
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,420
- It is, I don't really know why we're not shaving

1740
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,300
instead of taking a shower.

1741
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,460
Maybe it's because they're like, they're too fluffy.

1742
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,220
- Yeah, the terrifying reality of this is,

1743
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:27,140
is that her diaper is putting so much shit in her pubes.

1744
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,300
- Oh. - Yeah.

1745
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,900
- It's working like fertilizer

1746
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,180
and making them grow at super speed.

1747
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,840
- She's growing, it's like she's got like hydroponics

1748
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,100
for her pubes. - That's awful.

1749
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,180
- 'Cause of the piss and shit.

1750
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,020
- But she doesn't take it that much.

1751
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:38,860
- Like paint and a paintbrush.

1752
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,220
- She doesn't take it that seriously.

1753
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,500
She says, "Broke," oh whoops,

1754
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,540
she says, "Broke my diaper religion again."

1755
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,380
- Good. - Was I think the next one.

1756
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,700
- She did Christmas before Thanksgiving.

1757
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,820
- Yeah, that's the one thing.

1758
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,380
- So here's where it gets kind of bad,

1759
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,980
is that this is-- - No weighing above 125 pounds.

1760
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:53,860
- Petite lady.

1761
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,860
- Yeah, that's a small woman. - As long as,

1762
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,260
that might be tough if you're including

1763
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,420
the big puffy butt load of rape.

1764
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,940
- Yeah, I wonder if she takes that off the way.

1765
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,260
But so this was, after this, I looked at the tags,

1766
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:05,780
and so here's some of the tags.

1767
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,460
3DS, ABDL problems, and then the biggest one is abuse.

1768
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:12,000
So from there, I kind of fell into

1769
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,300
what has to be the worst things I've ever seen.

1770
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,820
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1771
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:19,300
Is that, I need to ask before you go any further.

1772
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,260
Did you investigate 3DS?

1773
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,980
'Cause does that mean--

1774
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,380
- She has a, this is--

1775
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,860
- Like a Nintendo 3DS or is it the 3Ds?

1776
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:30,220
- This is unrelated, she has a Twitter account

1777
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,020
where she just posts her 3DS games

1778
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,900
and how much she loves 3DS.

1779
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,740
- Okay.

1780
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:38,140
- The most diaper-friendly gaming system.

1781
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:38,980
- Yeah, definitely.

1782
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:39,820
- It's on the go.

1783
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:43,860
So this is kind of the beginning of where I started to see

1784
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,300
that this was maybe not gonna be all smiles.

1785
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,740
So then, here's some more titles of some of her blog posts.

1786
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,900
Got my kid taken.

1787
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,740
- Oh.

1788
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:53,580
(laughing)

1789
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,420
Oh no.

1790
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,260
- I got to see my son again, ready to have my son back.

1791
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,180
I hurt my mother.

1792
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,360
Yes, you read that right.

1793
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,300
I hurt my mother.

1794
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,460
(laughing)

1795
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,220
So I stalked my ex.

1796
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,260
I sometimes wonder if my ex was a pedophile.

1797
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,860
(laughing)

1798
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,220
Showing signs of autism.

1799
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,380
Looks like our son will be having autistic parents.

1800
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,680
Search terms again.

1801
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,260
I just read another blog by someone

1802
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,060
about disturbing search terms she found

1803
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,560
and I decided to look through mine again

1804
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,020
to see if there are any interesting ones

1805
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,860
or if I had gotten anything disturbing.

1806
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,900
I've never gotten a search term yet that is about me.

1807
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,540
The ones I found that stuck out for me were,

1808
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:28,480
so this is, you can see what search terms

1809
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,420
brought people to your blog spot.

1810
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,080
So this is one that she found.

1811
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,220
She is weirn and adult diapers.

1812
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,940
The misspelling made sit look like I am reading

1813
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:40,180
she is weirn and Adolf diaper.

1814
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,020
And then I see Adolf Hitler in my mind

1815
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,940
because of me being visual.

1816
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,500
Then I'm seeing Adolf Hitler's diaper.

1817
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,620
I know it's supposed to say she is wearing a adult diaper.

1818
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,740
- I know now how you found this blog.

1819
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,860
(laughing)

1820
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:56,420
What search term you put into Google to find this.

1821
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:57,260
- I've been caught.

1822
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,820
- It became perfectly clear.

1823
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:01,020
(laughing)

1824
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,820
- Okay, so we only have a couple things left.

1825
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,780
- Before my gift, and before we open the next one,

1826
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,660
I do actually have to fill my diaper.

1827
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,180
And by that I mean use the toilet,

1828
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,620
just a little bit of a joke.

1829
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,180
I'm going to use the toilet briefly.

1830
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,020
- Oh yeah, you can go use the toilet.

1831
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:15,860
- Okay.

1832
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,780
- God, I feel so good now.

1833
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,860
- I feel good after that. - Let's do this again.

1834
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:21,780
- All right.

1835
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,580
- Okay, Pierce is back. - Okay, guys.

1836
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,820
Before Pierce's gift, I just have,

1837
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,340
I mean, we have a really exciting one to open at the very end.

1838
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,540
- That's gonna be a huge finale.

1839
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,340
- But this one, this is our second to last,

1840
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,780
kind of our penultimate diaper that I'm gonna open up here.

1841
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,220
- Go ahead and open that bad boy up.

1842
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,260
- A little snack that I brought for all of us.

1843
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,380
- Good, 'cause I'm starting to get hungry again.

1844
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,940
- All right, here we go. - Did you work up an appetite

1845
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,300
in the bathroom there, Pierce?

1846
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,140
- I did.

1847
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,020
I'm so starving, you guys.

1848
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,880
- Oh, I can't wait for this.

1849
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,720
What is this?

1850
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,620
- This looks like it's gonna be the best one.

1851
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,620
- Or the second to best one.

1852
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,080
What is that?

1853
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,140
Oh, I can't even see it yet.

1854
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:02,460
Oh, it's digestives.

1855
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,300
- Get it?

1856
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,060
- Oh, I get it.

1857
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,300
- A side gag.

1858
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,220
- That's a Stinksgiving marathon.

1859
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,340
Did you guys go to the Stinksgiving marathon?

1860
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,540
(laughing)

1861
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,380
Oh, I'd love to have one.

1862
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,860
- Oh yeah, the stinky trot.

1863
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:18,860
I love any meal where half of the food is dessert.

1864
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,860
[LAUGHTER]

1865
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,340
I fed a whole person on my own.

1866
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,340
Oh my god.

1867
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,820
Cheers and happy Thanksgiving to everybody.

1868
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,700
Digestives, a little chocolate to whet

1869
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,300
the appetite for the lab.

1870
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,700
These are really good.

1871
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,660
That was a good--

1872
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:40,220
that's by far the best thing we've eaten.

1873
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,020
Why did they smush them up in there?

1874
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,380
Where did you find these?

1875
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,380
I want to bring these at home. I

1876
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:51,160
Want to bring these home? Yeah, those are good. You have extras of those. Nope. I only bought four. Okay, okay

1877
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,780
All right. Well Pierce, let's check out your gift, buddy

1878
01:13:53,780 --> 01:14:01,280
Can you help me do beer you change me

1879
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,060
Okay, Pierce's Thanksgiving gift. Yeah, here we go

1880
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:08,900
Okay, so there's a user I found that has a kangaroo

1881
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,700
With the diaper on.

1882
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,780
Just gonna read through all these that I found.

1883
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,820
A few months ago I had a nightmare

1884
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,940
where two people came in and took everything I had.

1885
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:19,820
I had my games, my house, my dog, and my toys.

1886
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,780
Treated me like complete trash.

1887
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:23,340
And I was out on the street in minutes.

1888
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,940
Over there crying and squeezing my bear.

1889
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,140
Glad everything was still there.

1890
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,060
This actually happened to me over nine years ago.

1891
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,660
(laughing)

1892
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:32,500
Jubio, shut the fuck up.

1893
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,060
- Oh, shut the hell up, Jubio.

1894
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,340
(laughing)

1895
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,660
That was so loud.

1896
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,900
- When I do mess my diaper,

1897
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,140
- I first enjoy the farts before.

1898
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:41,060
(laughing)

1899
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,980
Sometimes I get a little pain in my stomach before crapping.

1900
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,180
But feel great relief after messing.

1901
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,340
I also like the clump on the back.

1902
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,020
And then there's that cleaning

1903
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:54,100
where the wipes feel a lot smoother than toilet paper.

1904
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,240
The times that I mess are most often

1905
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,580
in the wee hours of the morning

1906
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,120
when everyone is still sleeping.

1907
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,400
One thing I dislike about having to spray down my room

1908
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,540
after clearing.

1909
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,380
- Cleaning.

1910
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,580
- The smell will reach all over the house.

1911
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,300
I live in a small place with my bed

1912
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,880
taking up one third of my room.

1913
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,820
And then I also believe that this person has a child.

1914
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,660
- Oh cool.

1915
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,500
- And they posted on their own private--

1916
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,580
- It's pretty common it seems.

1917
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,500
- Yeah, on their own private account they just wrote,

1918
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,020
I changed Barry's diaper yesterday.

1919
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,660
He really needed a fresh diaper.

1920
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,260
I don't know why that stuck out to me.

1921
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,900
That must mean that he had a dirty diaper

1922
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,060
for days and days.

1923
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:31,420
- I like how much these people are willing,

1924
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:35,300
like the diaper mother talks about her kids constantly.

1925
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,360
- And it's like you would think that you would just be,

1926
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,540
like I'm not sure you need to delve into that all that much.

1927
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:44,300
- At a certain point, I feel like being a diapered mother

1928
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,900
is just Munchausen's.

1929
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,260
- Yeah.

1930
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:53,660
I was almost about to say the exact same thing.

1931
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,300
- Munchausen's by proxy.

1932
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,060
- He also broke a record, this guy,

1933
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,780
in one of these posts about how many diapers

1934
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:00,860
have you worn at once, and he put everyone to shame.

1935
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,260
He said, "I put on an entire pack of deep ends pull-ups

1936
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,220
"at once, 18 pull-ups, and it was just as thick

1937
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,680
as five diapers that I normally wear.

1938
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:07,720
- Sounds like they were a thin pull up there.

1939
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,560
- That's a very, I think that's a--

1940
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,460
- But five diapers, that's crazy.

1941
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,300
- But isn't a pull up thinner than a diaper?

1942
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,140
- I guess, yeah.

1943
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,060
- But he usually wears five diapers.

1944
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,020
I think that's a lot. - Oh yeah.

1945
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,140
Damn, I didn't even process that.

1946
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,940
- I feel like you could fit,

1947
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:21,260
I feel like that's a pretty easy record to break.

1948
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,180
- Yeah, let's do it. - Very few people

1949
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:23,860
attempting that. - Yeah, I'll do it.

1950
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,900
- Here's a guy who just posted,

1951
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:25,740
I basically-- - Can you imagine,

1952
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,220
can you imagine how mad the diaper community would be

1953
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,900
if somebody, a non-diaper lover,

1954
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,180
broke the diaper wearing world record?

1955
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,460
- That's our new record?

1956
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,580
How dare you, you swoop in.

1957
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,620
- You piece of shit.

1958
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,980
- You wear 19 pull-ups?

1959
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,580
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1960
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,420
- I didn't even get hard.

1961
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,020
- I actually didn't even like it.

1962
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:43,860
- I fucking hated it the whole time.

1963
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,980
- God, if only I could wear 19 pull-ups.

1964
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:49,980
- The only person who got hard was the Guinness Book checker

1965
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,180
who was in my room watching me.

1966
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:53,660
Okay, this guy posted in the diaper lover,

1967
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,620
he started a forum post that was basically,

1968
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,820
he was like, "I shit my pants in my room,

1969
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,220
"should I get up and change?"

1970
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,180
He wrote, "I'm lying on my side watching football, soccer.

1971
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:07,620
"I pooped in my nappy halfway through the first half

1972
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,840
"and I still haven't changed.

1973
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,780
"I can tell it's big and the room now smells really of poo.

1974
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,460
"Even though it's now halftime,

1975
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,220
"I think it would take too long to clean up

1976
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,900
"before the start of the second half,

1977
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,700
"so I'll probably have to wait until the end of the game."

1978
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,700
And someone writes,

1979
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,860
(laughing)

1980
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,900
- Someone write, wrote, writes.

1981
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,240
- Writes this, "Well, if you're in your own home

1982
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,900
"and all alone, then why hurry to clean up?

1983
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,300
"Just hope there isn't an unexpected knock on your door."

1984
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,880
He just wrote, "Just didn't like the smell.

1985
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,220
"I stunk out the whole room."

1986
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,100
(laughing)

1987
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,900
They say your own poop doesn't smell as bad to you

1988
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,900
as other people's, and he just wrote, "Mine does."

1989
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,140
(laughing)

1990
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,820
- I do like how many of the posts that I've seen

1991
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,900
are just like, "I love shitting my pants.

1992
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,100
"I can't stop shitting my pants.

1993
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,540
"I do it all the time, but the smell is just--"

1994
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,460
- Yeah, the smell is crazy.

1995
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,580
- What part of it do they like, I guess?

1996
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:59,340
- I guess it's the feeling of a full diaper.

1997
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,540
- It must be the pleasure.

1998
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,020
I know that, well we've talked about it before,

1999
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:05,660
a couple of, some people shove bananas up their ass

2000
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,500
and they shit the banana out.

2001
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,220
- Some people put oatmeal in their diaper

2002
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,060
and they just have a mealy feeling.

2003
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:09,900
- Yeah, we talked about that one, yeah.

2004
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,980
- Oh my god.

2005
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,660
- I have something to read from this book,

2006
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:15,140
which is called, it's about smell,

2007
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,820
and I found it on the ground and it's covered in crap,

2008
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:20,100
but I'll read that at the end, sort of as a, all right.

2009
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,380
- I thought you never did Stinksgiving before, Pierce.

2010
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,540
- You're a damn Stinksgiving pro.

2011
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,420
Catch this in your mouth.

2012
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:27,260
Okay.

2013
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,220
- That was not even close to right.

2014
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,740
- It was so close.

2015
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:32,260
- Okay, so there's a concept called keyhole incontinence.

2016
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,100
Have you guys heard of this?

2017
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,900
- No, I have not. - No.

2018
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,380
- Someone wrote, "I have pissed and shit myself

2019
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,160
"on my front porch fumbling with my keys

2020
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,980
"more than I care to count."

2021
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:44,080
And someone wrote, "I called it keyhole incontinence,

2022
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,220
"because if you're having a good day,

2023
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,440
"walking to the door and putting that key in,

2024
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,580
"it can create a big problem, LOL.

2025
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,540
"My incontinence has come and gone for years,

2026
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,520
"and to be honest, when I was doing okay

2027
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,340
"out of diapers during the day,

2028
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,540
"then that darn door was my arch nemesis.

2029
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,400
"Driving home and seeing that house, bam,

2030
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,360
all of a sudden I kinda need a bathroom.

2031
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,520
Parking it out, now I really need a bathroom.

2032
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,640
Start walking to the door, and with every step,

2033
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,400
the anger in my guts gets more extreme,

2034
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,080
and my bladders start screaming louder.

2035
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,800
Key in hand, running through the house to the bathroom,

2036
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,600
you're extremely concerned you won't make it,

2037
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,680
and you soak the carpet in a streak all the way through.

2038
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,040
Basically, they're running to the,

2039
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,280
as soon as they see their house,

2040
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,120
they're shitting their pants.

2041
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,360
- They're shitting their pants,

2042
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,240
and then tracking like shit liquid, like a slug.

2043
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,320
- Another key, like sort of atomic level operation

2044
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,920
in their digestive system is happening

2045
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,240
with each ritual of coming into their own living quarters.

2046
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,720
Key in the hole, you're--

2047
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,560
- I have that.

2048
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,800
- I was gonna say, I will, I will say,

2049
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,720
not for shit, but definitely,

2050
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,440
if I like maybe left a bar

2051
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,040
and I should have gone to the bathroom before I did

2052
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,480
and I didn't, I walked home

2053
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,000
and I gradually have to pee more and more.

2054
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,540
The second I'm into my front door,

2055
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,400
but not at the bathroom yet, it's the--

2056
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,240
- When I get drunk.

2057
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,680
- Can you imagine actually leaving shit streaks

2058
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,800
on the carpet?

2059
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,200
No, I can't imagine that.

2060
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,200
I can imagine that.

2061
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,200
Not me.

2062
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,200
I don't like it, but I can.

2063
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,200
I'm using my imagination.

2064
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,200
I just have a strong imagination.

2065
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,320
The other day I got into the bathroom and I was like, "Oh, I have to shit pretty bad."

2066
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,720
And as soon as I locked the door, it was so bad.

2067
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,840
I had to shit so fucking bad.

2068
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,160
And I said out loud to myself, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

2069
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,840
And it was the hardest I've ever had to shit.

2070
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,200
Actually, I had a similar thing like that recently where I had to go...

2071
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,760
It's probably one of the first times I had to tell my girlfriend, "You have to stop talking

2072
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,760
to me.

2073
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,420
- She was trying to tell me something,

2074
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,460
and I was like, you can't talk to me right now.

2075
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,300
- It's over.

2076
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,460
- I have to go in the bathroom.

2077
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,660
Like I literally did, I just had to close the door.

2078
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:37,060
- I do that every single day with my girlfriend.

2079
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,980
Diarrhea, okay.

2080
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:42,300
This person, there's only one good thing in this post

2081
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
that I'll just skip to.

2082
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,640
I always have to wonder about people who talk about

2083
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,180
how good it is to feel in a diaper full of poop.

2084
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:54,240
When my ulcerative colitis is flaring,

2085
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,300
doing that would cause an almost immediate

2086
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,860
and very painful rash, not to mention that my poop

2087
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,380
looks and smells like blood.

2088
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,300
(laughing)

2089
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,220
I end up with my backside so sore that I have trouble

2090
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,940
cleaning up after a bowel movement,

2091
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,080
which is often every 15 to 30 minutes.

2092
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,580
Somehow the appeal is just lost on me.

2093
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:13,060
A wet diaper, I'll change the first chance I get.

2094
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:16,260
A soiled diaper, I'll drop everything to clean immediately

2095
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,300
and shower if I probably can.

2096
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,420
I would feel this way too.

2097
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:24,020
My bowel movements are pretty evil, painful,

2098
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:26,100
not necessarily like a fun, sexy time.

2099
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:29,780
- Like you're pooping and then spinning up the poop.

2100
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:33,540
- Like I'm spiraling upward?

2101
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,540
Like I'm creating a, yeah.

2102
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,200
- You create a poop so big in the toilet

2103
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,420
that you're sitting on top of it.

2104
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,260
- Like it's rocket fuel?

2105
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,500
- Yeah, like you're sitting on top

2106
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,780
of the Dr. Strangelove rocket.

2107
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,380
- Right, you know that rocket was,

2108
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,060
you know that was a bomb going down?

2109
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:50,180
- It's going down, but from the perspective.

2110
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,140
- Right, if you're looking at it,

2111
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:52,900
if you're watching it, it would be upside down.

2112
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,180
That's a good point, Pat.

2113
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,560
- I don't have sex.

2114
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,620
I'm too often in baby head space.

2115
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,020
It's just alien to me.

2116
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,620
I think this is a really good idea.

2117
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,620
(laughing)

2118
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,860
- Okay, elaborate.

2119
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,020
- I think that if you are so,

2120
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:10,940
I think if the reason that you don't wanna have sex

2121
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,660
is because you think you're a baby,

2122
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,420
that means you have the right idea about sex and babies.

2123
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,260
- Yeah. - So I--

2124
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:17,100
- Oh yeah.

2125
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:17,920
- That's what you should be--

2126
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,760
- If you're gonna be an ABDL,

2127
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,460
you should be completely sexless.

2128
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,300
- Yes. - Yeah, no, I agree with you.

2129
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,100
- You should have no genitalia.

2130
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,820
- You should just like the feeling of poop

2131
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:26,660
just 'cause you like it.

2132
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:27,500
- That's right.

2133
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,340
- Not 'cause it gets you harder, makes you sperm.

2134
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,060
- I'm sick of these fuckers shitting themselves

2135
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,220
to just pick up chicks.

2136
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:35,300
- Basically, every time we've done this,

2137
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:40,300
I have broadened my understanding of how all this works.

2138
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,900
And this time I really did see so many people

2139
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,380
who were talking about how it is a comfort thing for them

2140
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:47,660
and not sexual at all.

2141
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:50,100
That was way more common than I realized.

2142
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,140
- One split that I noticed, that I noticed a lot,

2143
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:52,960
but I noticed this time,

2144
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,480
is what another person put in uh... is there's something i find is very funny

2145
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,200
is there some stuff we're like

2146
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,500
half of the half of diaper lovers like

2147
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,140
love it and the other half think it's

2148
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:05,260
the worst thing it like you had a bunch of poster about like eating while

2149
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,580
pooping like sitting at the dinner table and eating and also put your pants at

2150
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:09,420
the same time

2151
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:12,740
and a bunch people like that's the best feeling in the world something going in

2152
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:15,860
something coming out it's incredible but then just as many people are in there

2153
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:20,060
saying you are a degenerate human being you are disgusting i hate you you should

2154
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,900
- You shit all you want in your bed, but at dinner?

2155
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,240
- Yeah, I know, it's crazy, right?

2156
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,500
- You're ruining-- - There's one thing that--

2157
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,340
- Get your elbows off the table.

2158
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,660
- Literally people are saying, "You are a degenerate."

2159
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,820
And it's like they're on the diaper,

2160
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,380
like how, that's the one thing?

2161
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:34,100
- I think having both ends of your tube

2162
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:37,620
that is your whole life essence going like this

2163
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:39,460
must be the pinnacle. - What the fuck

2164
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,620
are you talking about?

2165
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:43,100
- Your anus going like this and your esophagus

2166
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,740
going like this at the same time--

2167
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:46,180
- That has to do something to the middle.

2168
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,500
- No, I agree, I feel like--

2169
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,620
- It's a sharper thing.

2170
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:51,460
- How does rubbing your foreskin compare

2171
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,820
to your whole soul vibrating like this?

2172
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,940
- A single tract that both ends

2173
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:57,940
are orgasming at the same time.

2174
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:58,780
- Yeah.

2175
01:23:58,780 --> 01:23:59,620
- Yeah.

2176
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,440
- And then you just--

2177
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,580
- That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard you say.

2178
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:03,900
- You are officially wheeled.

2179
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,740
- You are a wheel though.

2180
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:05,860
- You are a wheel though.

2181
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:08,660
Okay, this is called Stinksgiving

2182
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,500
and we're reading diaper posts.

2183
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,380
- Yeah, and Pat says, "You're being weird."

2184
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,740
- Just to anyone who's sort of snapped

2185
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,580
into a calm-- - And we've been eating

2186
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,220
guacamole out of diapers.

2187
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,700
- No, all this was normal up until he talked about--

2188
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,540
- Okay, well you look like a leprechaun.

2189
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,380
- I don't look like a-- - You do.

2190
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,200
- You do look like a leprechaun.

2191
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,300
- Thank you, Caleb, for coming to my rescue.

2192
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,140
- Yes, I got you.

2193
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,820
You look exactly like a leprechaun.

2194
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,500
- There's a green hat, there's a green pilgrim hat

2195
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,340
over there I could put on.

2196
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:30,940
- Oh, this is from the same post that I think Caleb,

2197
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,660
or maybe, who found the post about being ridiculous

2198
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,660
in a diaper? - That was me.

2199
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,740
- Okay, yeah, this is on the same one.

2200
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:37,660
Yes, completely.

2201
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,940
I love how they feel, but when I look in the mirror

2202
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,380
or if I happen to be around my partner,

2203
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,300
I can't help but think, who would love this?

2204
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:44,740
I'm a complete joke.

2205
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,980
(laughing)

2206
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:50,540
And someone says, I tend to avoid mirrors when I'm wearing,

2207
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:54,140
generally because I violate an unwritten rule,

2208
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,740
you should never wear both a nappy

2209
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,300
and a mustache at the same time.

2210
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,660
And someone wrote, mirrors equals diapers,

2211
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,500
or mirrors plus diapers are kind of like the old

2212
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,980
don't look in the mirror on acid rule.

2213
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,660
- Do you think that's the level of kind of euphoria

2214
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,900
you get from wearing a diaper?

2215
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:09,740
- I think 100%. - Is it comparable

2216
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,540
to being on acid?

2217
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,860
- This is my actual other weird thought that I had, Patrick,

2218
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:16,500
so cover your ears, but I think that a diaper

2219
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,940
is probably like the totem that takes a human being

2220
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:25,940
back to the point of like pure, like unencumbered joy.

2221
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,300
It's like tripping on acid 'cause you're going back

2222
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,740
into a place where there's no right and wrong.

2223
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:35,100
It's just shit and piss and it's all gravy.

2224
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,820
- I think-- - That wasn't weird at all.

2225
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,180
That's probably the most normal thing

2226
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,020
you've ever thought of. - Gravy is gone.

2227
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:39,840
(laughing)

2228
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,680
I'm a little hungry.

2229
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,580
- I would be more inclined to agree with that,

2230
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,640
and that being, that beautifully put idea,

2231
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,160
if the people who post about wearing diapers

2232
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,960
weren't some of the, like, obviously the most,

2233
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,120
like the stupidest people in the universe.

2234
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,760
- Well, it's not as if geniuses love to trip on acid,

2235
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,960
either, you know?

2236
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,980
- That's a good point.

2237
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,600
That is a very good point.

2238
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,760
- Some, oh, here we go.

2239
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,440
Same Tina Slip now been peed in four times.

2240
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,840
- I think Tina is a brand, I found.

2241
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,720
Same Tina slip now been peed in four times.

2242
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,300
I decided to poop in the potty monster, but not wife,

2243
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,520
and smushed my diaper between my bum cheeks.

2244
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,600
One more pee, it will be okay.

2245
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,200
Another after that, it will leak.

2246
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,720
So been pissing and shitting the same diaper

2247
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,480
maybe four or five times in a row.

2248
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,140
And they're actually smushing it.

2249
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:29,100
- I did see the diapered mother posted a picture

2250
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:29,940
that was a--

2251
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,120
- That's gonna make it better.

2252
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:31,960
- No, it's just fun.

2253
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,120
- I didn't include the pictures from the diapered mother,

2254
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,000
but I did look at almost every single one.

2255
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,440
and one of them was she was like,

2256
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,420
I'm so proud of myself,

2257
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,640
I pooped in the same diaper four times in a day.

2258
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,640
It was just the entire diaper was completely black.

2259
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,980
(laughing)

2260
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,820
- Completely black.

2261
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:49,840
- Completely black.

2262
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,800
- I searched smush,

2263
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,120
I don't know if you guys have guessed this yet.

2264
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,200
I like sitting on the toilet with a diaper on and messing.

2265
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,720
Sometimes after I go, I will stand up,

2266
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,160
put the lid down, and sit back down

2267
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,240
to smush the mess against me.

2268
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,800
- Oh my God.

2269
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,640
- Oh man.

2270
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,800
- Why even sit on the toilet?

2271
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,640
Just do it in a chair.

2272
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,720
- Yeah.

2273
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,960
- Just do it in a rocking chair.

2274
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,280
- That's too far, you are invoking,

2275
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,120
you shouldn't be anyone to toil with.

2276
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,760
- I think a lot of people here have gone too far.

2277
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,200
- Yeah, okay, so this is like,

2278
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,120
what foods put you in a little mode?

2279
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,720
This wrote, if I'm in little mode,

2280
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,320
then grilled cheese and tomato soup.

2281
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,240
If I'm in grown up mode,

2282
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,160
then a whole lobster stuffed with crab meat.

2283
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,080
(laughing)

2284
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,080
- Grilled cheese when in little mode.

2285
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,600
- Stuffing a lobster with crab meat

2286
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,560
makes fucking no sense to me at all.

2287
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,400
- It's a crabster.

2288
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,720
(laughing)

2289
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:32,560
I don't know what you mean.

2290
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,380
- It's a lab.

2291
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,600
- Yeah.

2292
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:38,100
"I don't soil but love to watch my diaper when I pee.

2293
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:38,940
"Fill with pee.

2294
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,920
"At times I pull the front of my diaper forward

2295
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,520
"and watch my little guy let the pee flow into the diaper.

2296
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,600
"This can be a little messy at a time, but I love it."

2297
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,800
- Diaper dude, watching my little man.

2298
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,560
(laughing)

2299
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,440
- "I can't read this, but I found a guy on here

2300
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,100
"he posts really, here I'll read one of these.

2301
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,540
"We'll read the lucky one.

2302
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:03,360
"Yeah, this one should be fine.

2303
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:07,720
Okay, someone wrote, "We are a diaper lover couple

2304
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,700
"and we both wear diapers regularly,

2305
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,240
"so yes, she does know."

2306
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,720
And this is basically a married man

2307
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,440
who has a wife who's cool with it.

2308
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,520
And maybe we should eat our final dish while we wait this?

2309
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,360
- No, we're saving it for after.

2310
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,440
- No, we'll save it for the very end, I think.

2311
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,460
Okay, we just eat it raw, that's fine.

2312
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:24,120
That got to be good.

2313
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,960
Do you guys just lay there smoking cigarettes while going?

2314
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,800
Or is it much more intimate?

2315
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,720
You can lay there like you do when you spoon.

2316
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,520
in bed, feeling her just pushing her mess out,

2317
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,120
while you just hugging her

2318
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,980
as you wet the front of your diaper.

2319
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,580
Then flip and she can feel his tummy.

2320
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,160
Just get hard as he's loading his diaper

2321
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,400
as you wet yours.

2322
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,520
That sound fun.

2323
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,920
Then just squish around

2324
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,420
and smush that bulge with your knees.

2325
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,960
Oh, I can think of a hundred things to do

2326
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,200
while you both wet and messy.

2327
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:59,080
One smells, which one smells worse than the other?

2328
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,720
Does either one get run out by the other?

2329
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,040
I bet the both of you are a lot tighter,

2330
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,600
closer to each other than normal couples.

2331
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,920
And the big question,

2332
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,380
do you change each other or shower together?

2333
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:15,360
Washing each other up and nice and clean,

2334
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,080
and then you are nice and dry,

2335
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,340
and it feels like the perfect time,

2336
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,460
as you know so much about each other,

2337
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,440
to just have a heated, hot, and heavy session

2338
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,360
with each other.

2339
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,200
Do you change and powder each other before?

2340
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,520
It's good night fun.

2341
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,640
Good night, sweetie.

2342
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,700
- Oh my god, that honestly is so romantic.

2343
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:31,540
- Well, all of his posts are like this.

2344
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,480
- I love playing which one smells worse than the other.

2345
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,680
- That is so beautiful.

2346
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:35,600
- Do you ever lay in bed and think

2347
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,560
which one smells worse?

2348
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,760
- It's me.

2349
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,360
- Also, squishing the mess with your knees,

2350
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,200
that's too, that's--

2351
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,240
- Yeah. - How'd it get down there?

2352
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,080
- You're gonna make poop wine.

2353
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,080
- No, that's your behind, or you bring your knees--

2354
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:47,920
- Squish it up, stomp it. - You bring your knees

2355
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:48,760
up to squish it?

2356
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,580
- Yeah. - Oh my god.

2357
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:52,120
- Stomping on the diaper, making poopy wine.

2358
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:52,960
- Yeah.

2359
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,080
- Oh, this is a real quick one.

2360
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,680
This guy is giving advice to a guy

2361
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,760
whose wife doesn't know that he wears a diaper.

2362
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,160
I'm only gonna read one part.

2363
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,640
He just wrote, "Maybe you could go to a doctor,

2364
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,960
comma, who deals in fetishes, comma,

2365
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,240
but that's whole, comma, different problem, comma."

2366
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,360
I mean, I went through a whole different problem

2367
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,720
when I got put in a diaper.

2368
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,520
It was not something I was looking for.

2369
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,160
It was a sentence, a place I don't want to be.

2370
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,840
But once I got there, I just had to sort of take it

2371
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,640
one rotten day after another.

2372
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,120
So that's what I can tell you.

2373
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:20,960
What is the draw?

2374
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,000
The diapers are using them both.

2375
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,860
You have yourself a real fix.

2376
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,080
All I can say is good luck.

2377
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:25,920
- Oh my God. - Oh, that is a good book.

2378
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,880
- This person is a poet.

2379
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,000
- Yeah.

2380
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,040
- Is that the end of your gift?

2381
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,860
- That's the end of my gift.

2382
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:32,800
I mean, I would read all of his posts all day,

2383
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,600
but they're too small to read from here.

2384
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,440
- Read the, can you read your book?

2385
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:37,280
What is this book that you brought?

2386
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,500
- This is a book about smell that I found on the grounds.

2387
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,340
There's all kinds of awesome chapters.

2388
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,240
- You found this on the ground?

2389
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,180
- Yeah, all kinds of awesome chapters in here,

2390
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:45,640
like the influence of Christianity

2391
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,880
and the devaluation of the sense of smell and odors.

2392
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,120
- Wow.

2393
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,760
Have you thought maybe you could order

2394
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,400
the full book at some point?

2395
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,920
- It's very rare, it's a rare book.

2396
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,040
- Really? - I can't find it online.

2397
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,640
Okay, so this is from a chapter

2398
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,160
called The Philosophical Nose,

2399
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,460
and this is just a quick passage,

2400
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:03,680
I think, from the writings of Freud.

2401
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,520
The desire for cleanliness emerges

2402
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,000
from the pressing need to get rid of excretia

2403
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,840
that have become disagreeable to the sense of smell.

2404
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,560
We know that this is not true in the case of infants

2405
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,720
who are not repelled by them.

2406
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,200
Education exerts special care to accelerating the passage

2407
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,120
to the succeeding stage at which excretia lose any value

2408
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,840
and become the object of disgust and repugnance

2409
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,600
and are therefore rejected.

2410
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,840
Such a depreciation would be impossible

2411
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,780
if the strong odor of such matter drawn from the body

2412
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:34,460
were not subjected to the same fate

2413
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:37,480
as other olfactory impressions that were also foregone

2414
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,440
as man began to walk upright.

2415
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,200
Thus, anal eroticism is the first victim

2416
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,500
of the organic repression that occurs

2417
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,040
along the road to civilization.

2418
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:47,880
Wow.

2419
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:52,180
And that is what I'm stinkful for.

2420
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:55,700
I'm stinkful that we don't have snouts and that our sense of smell is so muted

2421
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:59,080
that we can actually be in this room with each other even though all this food is

2422
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:07,400
clearly spoiled. Speaking of food, do you mind if I open this last one? Please open the last one.

2423
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:14,040
I mean, okay guys, this is the very last meal that we have. Hold his mic up for him, Pat.

2424
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:21,480
it this one is as you may know a thanksgiving this is probably the number

2425
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:29,640
one tradition this is the of stanks can I have all for my this is the turkey of

2426
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:34,240
Thanksgiving right the most important and we all met what we did all make it

2427
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,640
together we all made this together

2428
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,640
Traditionally you go no spoon here.

2429
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:54,040
[LAUGHTER]

2430
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,720
It's my turn.

2431
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,480
Just go directly in on that.

2432
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,120
Yeah.

2433
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,680
OK, now Cameron, it's your turn.

2434
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,960
Yeah, oh man, that's good stuff.

2435
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,400
I mean, and that is creamy.

2436
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,600
It's so creamy.

2437
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,000
Patrick, it's Thanksgiving.

2438
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,440
OK, you have to-- yep, all right.

2439
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,200
Very quickly now, he's gonna drink himself.

2440
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,120
- I'm a little bit dribbly.

2441
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,040
- Oh, that's okay.

2442
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,280
- You want me to get it from the microphone?

2443
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,120
- Some of my...

2444
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,040
(laughing)

2445
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:24,880
There you go, Pat.

2446
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:25,720
Dig in, buddy.

2447
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,720
- That's so funny to have dessert.

2448
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,960
(laughing)

2449
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,920
- No, you gotta put it,

2450
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,640
no, you gotta really get yourself in there.

2451
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,000
Come on, come on.

2452
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,360
There we go.

2453
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,560
Oh man.

2454
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,680
- And if I can get a closeup for a second.

2455
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:44,320
If you guys are mad at us about what we just did,

2456
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,320
I'm gonna get a real, my actual close-up.

2457
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,320
If you're mad at us about what we just did...

2458
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,320
Nobody can hear you.

2459
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,320
If you're mad at us about what we just did,

2460
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,320
I wanna show you the food item

2461
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,320
for today that didn't make the cut.

2462
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,320
That did not get put into a diaper.

2463
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,320
Let's put it in a diaper for shits and giggles.

2464
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
We saw that!

2465
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,320
That is mashed potatoes.

2466
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,320
And we said no.

2467
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,320
Alright, alright.

2468
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,320
Knock it off.

2469
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,320
That is awful.

2470
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:12,820
Sorry.

2471
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,160
Oh, God.

2472
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,080
But this is what you wanted.

2473
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,040
What kind of potato could that possibly be?

2474
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,040
[LAUGHTER]

2475
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:19,540
Fuck.

2476
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:20,040
Fuck.

2477
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,160
This is--

2478
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,440
Happy Stinksgiving, everybody.

2479
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,200
Happy Stinksgiving.

2480
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,000
And we'll see-- I mean, and we'll see you guys next year.

2481
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,500
Yeah.

2482
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,360
[KISSING NOISES]

2483
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:30,960
Bye.

2484
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,840
Caleb, get your kiss.

2485
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,080
(laughing)
