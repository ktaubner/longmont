00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,740
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,160
Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,000
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,840
(thunder)

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,660
Let's go.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,500
Let's do it.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,340
Yes, we have Ryan with us.

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,160
Yeah, woo!

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,800
We have Ryan back, I think Ryan's in the building.

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,220
Ryan's our, I think he's our most popular.

12
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,060
Yeah.

13
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,480
He's our most popular guest with us.

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,200
Most popular, most times appeared means most popular.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,040
What about--

16
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,680
I mean you're the most popular with the hosts. Yeah. We think of you as the number one.

17
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,280
What about Pierce? You're probably tied. I guess you're tied. Yeah, you and Pierce are tied.

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:49,400
Yeah. It used to be our friend Neil. Yeah. I think Neil had more guests than Pierce and

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,720
Ryan combined. But also most of Neil's guests were that he just walked into the room while

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,720
we were recording and we were like, I guess you can talk on this one.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,020
It's because I lived with him.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,320
Yeah, it's like, like Patrick's like cats are the number one guest.

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,220
Like it was that kind of thing.

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,220
You would just like, he would wander into my lap.

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,220
He's the same as a cat.

26
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,420
Same level of being.

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,320
Yeah, he would fall into my lap from the ceiling and I would, I would be like, oh fuck, I gotta deal with Neil again.

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,720
Neil's playing in the trash again.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,020
Neil's getting another guest spot on the podcast.

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,920
Fuck.

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,120
There was one time that he walked in while you guys were at work.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,320
Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,200
Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,240
Back when we recorded the podcast at work, he would just he would kind of walk in a lot.

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,680
I mean, he would just come.

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
He would just come to work just when he didn't have anything to do.

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
He would just come to my work

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,200
and never ask me to do my job like he didn't need any equipment or anything.

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
He would just just say, what's up?

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
You just sit there with his hands in his pockets.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,480
Be weird to my boss and leave.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,120
(laughing)

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,280
Love those friends.

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,360
Oh, he's the best.

45
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
Important friend to have.

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,640
Yeah. Of course.

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
So what's up, Ryan?

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,280
How's West Coast living, baby?

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
Oh, it's good.

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
It's real hot out here.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
It's just as bad as everywhere else, I think.

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Really? Yeah, what about the sun?

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
The sun, yeah.

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
What about hell?

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,760
It's not as bad as those places.

56
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
That's a really good point.

57
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,960
Oh, the cold weather, that's a good point.

58
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,160
Ryan, you've been on for two minutes

59
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,880
and you're already getting fucked.

60
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,800
Didn't hear you.

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
you are you're getting fucked so hard to me so

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
the alert yet

63
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,360
the

64
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,680
uh... however

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,280
as uh... how's everything on the east coast is a really hard over there to

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,940
fall

67
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,100
it sucks at night and i think uh...

68
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,320
probably two hundred thousand degrees here

69
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,180
and in the day one degree

70
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,600
in the in the dates actually freezing cold yeah

71
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,180
they've been a little bit over here

72
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,060
you guys like it

73
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,720
uh... messages you know

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,120
hanging out, recording the podcast in person,

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,440
kissing each other.

76
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,400
- Yeah.

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,720
- I don't miss kissing them.

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
- I miss it.

79
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,520
- That's my least favorite part of the show.

80
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,480
- We have to in order to start and end the episode.

81
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,720
- Yeah, it sucks that now we have to drive halfway

82
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,320
from Boston and New York and meet up and just kiss once

83
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,480
and not even record, just 'cause we can't record

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,040
every week unless we kiss.

85
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,880
- Yeah.

86
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,000
- So it's getting annoying.

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
It's a lot of gas money too.

88
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,840
- And it's expensive.

89
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
- Yeah, it really is.

90
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
- That does suck.

91
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,520
- Not the most I've paid for a kiss,

92
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
but it is close.

93
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
(laughing)

94
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,120
- Yeah.

95
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,040
- Dammit, it's been chill.

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm glad it's been chill for you.

97
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,040
You moved, you're away from the Clown Stripper Club.

98
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,160
- I'm away from there, yeah.

99
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,840
I'm just like a few blocks away.

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,320
Now I'm closer to the Cheetah Strip Club.

101
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,160
- Nice, dude.

102
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,840
That's the best part about LA, is the themed strip clubs.

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
- Yeah.

104
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,720
- You can't just have like a woman themed strip club.

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,560
- Yeah.

106
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
- Yeah, we'll never have that.

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
- It's gotta be something with polka dots on it.

108
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,200
Well, none of them are beautiful women themed strip clubs.

109
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
Absolutely not.

110
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,080
Not a single one of them.

111
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,680
It's all cheetah or Mario Party or rock and roll.

112
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,760
Mario Party, Strip Club,

113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,840
a Waluigi with like there's no shirt underneath the overalls

114
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,120
and the overalls just barely cover the nipples.

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,320
You're just you're just fucking braining people with golden metal coins,

116
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,080
giant coins the size of your head.

117
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,400
It's all like it's all like like really hot women dressed up

118
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,900
in like slutty cosplay versions of Mario characters,

119
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,080
except there's one guy who's just Wario.

120
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,360
(all laughing)

121
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,520
- That's the Bowser. - He is Wario.

122
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,080
He's not dressed as Wario.

123
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,360
- Yeah, it's a real Wario.

124
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
- Wario comes out and tries to steal all the coins

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
off the stage and the woman has to stop them.

126
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,320
- Yeah, it's a game, that's one of the mini games.

127
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,400
- They should put mini games in strip clubs.

128
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,640
- Okay, all right, let's admit it.

129
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,940
It's basically a carnival.

130
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,560
There's all these different sort of mini games

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
that you play around the strip club

132
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,120
where you have to defeat Bowser and Bowser Jr.

133
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,360
Oh yeah, and one, there's one tile on the floor of the strip club that if you click it, if

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:57,640
you click it, if you accidentally jump on it, then Bowser comes and he takes your money.

135
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
He robs you.

136
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,140
And you have to leave.

137
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,400
And you have to leave, yeah.

138
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,480
And then, and then, uh...

139
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
There is an item shop.

140
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
You can't forget the item shop.

141
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,320
You can't forget to play basketball.

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
And you can become invincible.

143
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,320
invincible. Yeah, if you get a one-up it works. You can get killed and come back to life.

144
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,320
You can die once. For the rest of your life. And it's not just in the strip club.

145
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,320
That's a permanent one-up. It lasts forever. That's one thing about Mario Party.

146
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,320
It's like, where do they go after the game's over?

147
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Into the console. They go to another party.

148
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Hey, let me tell you what. Not my freaking idea of a party. Have you ever turned on

149
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,200
tried to play Mario Party and just none of the characters are in there because

150
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,060
they're all in someone else's party. True. Someone else on the other side of the

151
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,040
world is playing Mario Party and they're all there instead. You're like, you're midway through. What are you saying?

152
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,560
I don't understand any of these jokes because like I played, we didn't have a Nintendo, I just had a

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:03,120
PlayStation so we had like the Shrek version. So like, I kind of get it but there was-

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Was Shrek like the bad guy?

155
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
No, they were just all guys.

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
No, Farquaad's the bad guy.

157
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Farquaad was the Bowser?

158
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,120
I guess so, probably. I guess Farquaad was the Bowser. I don't know.

159
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,120
I think everybody was just a different character.

160
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Nobody really knew what was going on. It was crazy back then.

161
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Ryan, to understand the Mario Party jokes, just switch the word Mario with Shrek.

162
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Okay, got it.

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
You'll probably understand it.

164
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,960
okay yeah walla we see that's all the way to your stage think person will be

165
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,560
skinny Shrek yeah think about Shrek dressed up as the Mario characters and

166
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,400
you'll understand that yeah yeah sorry we're kind of a weird we're weird

167
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,000
weird yeah yeah it's like freak oh freak oh stern basically yeah yeah like if

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,440
Stern was all the whack-pack. Yeah. Do you have a podcast? How do you explain it to people?

169
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,400
I don't. It's just kind of like if Conor O'Malley was my brother, my brother, and me.

170
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,720
That's how I like to tell people about it. Yeah, it's basically like if Einstein had a microphone.

171
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,040
So you guys figure it out. If Einstein invented the microphone.

172
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
with two retarded brothers.

173
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,640
(laughing)

174
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,760
- Which one's Einstein?

175
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,640
Come on, come on, you got it.

176
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,120
Yes, come on, that's so not nice.

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,960
- That's true.

178
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,640
- That's extremely fucked up.

179
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,320
- That's nice and it's normal.

180
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,640
- And it's true.

181
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,440
Yeah, it pretty much is, basically.

182
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm number one.

183
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
This podcast is kind of like if Samuel Beckett

184
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
had used Vine.

185
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,920
(laughing)

186
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,200
That's what I like to tell people.

187
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
Yeah.

188
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,760
Yeah, it's kind of like if HP Lovecraft was on Reddit.

189
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,140
Have you ever seen that picture of Obama drinking the beer and saying "not bad" and thumbs up

190
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
and frowning?

191
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
It's kind of like that.

192
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,480
Yeah, it's kind of like one of those real life Simpsons photos.

193
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,360
Basically, an audio version.

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,200
That's what the waveform looks like.

195
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
The waveform's a couch gag.

196
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,000
We've just been putting...

198
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We aren't real people.

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,080
just putting, we're programmers who have been converting the couch gags into

200
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,800
waveforms and these episodes just come out every time with every different couch gag.

201
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
Yeah it's truly amazing technology that we will not be sharing with the medical

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,400
community. Yeah only the military. Yeah that's right. They're gonna use the couch

203
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,560
gags to develop new more dangerous drones. Wouldn't that be funny? I always

204
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,320
think about it you know how like every like sketch group or like sketch show on

205
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,760
TV, like if it's 10 people, like three of them become like famous comedians

206
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,360
afterwards and then seven of them just get like crazy jobs like working as

207
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,760
military contractors or like 7-Eleven managers. I wonder what, because

208
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,520
none of us will be successful in five years, I wonder what our real-life jobs

209
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,680
are gonna be. Probably the military for me. You would be the greatest

210
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,240
military mind of all time. Patrick is just listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore

211
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,560
history and saying everything as it comes through his earbuds.

212
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,480
There's like people trying to like interrupt him and he's just talking loudly over them as he says more Dan Carlin.

213
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:37,240
Sir, what should we do? We have to hit the shoguns where it hurts.

214
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm probably gonna be a warlock in five years I'm thinking. I've been working on

215
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:50,920
curses. You hear about Cameron? He just ended up with a stupid warlock job. Yeah, he's a

216
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,080
fucking dude. Dude, I'm on that nine to five witchcraft grind. It sucks. I'm shooting for,

217
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm trying to be a comedian, but my fallback is basically alchemist.

218
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,760
Basically, I want to turn, I want to turn gold into, I want to turn gold into wood.

219
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:16,720
the

220
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:28,400
that

221
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,080
- Yeah, you normally make stuff worse.

222
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,400
That's like the law of thermodynamics.

223
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,540
So gold can be turned into like poop

224
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,840
or like a mushy, like hummus.

225
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,080
That's true.

226
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,000
That's a really good point.

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Yeah, that's a true-

228
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,620
- I'm an alchemist 'cause I ate a quarter

229
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,020
and I turned it into poop.

230
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,640
- I ate a quarter and it's never come out.

231
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
- Yeah. - It's been stuck in me

232
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,160
for a decade.

233
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
- I told you guys my eating quarter story, I think.

234
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
- Yeah, oh yeah.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
you went to the movies with a bucket full of quarters like popcorn and you ate the whole thing?

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,520
Yeah I do remember that. No I swallowed a quarter in the pool. Swallowed a quarter in the pool?

237
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,120
Are you swallowing anything in the pool? What the fuck are you swallowing dude?

238
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,600
Sam I meant to swallow all the water in the pool. I accidentally swallowed this quarter.

239
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,760
I meant to swallow all the water and then get big and inflated like Petey Piranha and Mario Sunshine

240
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:36,280
and

241
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,400
- Yeah. - Like Tak in "Daxter"?

242
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,320
- Yeah. - Yeah.

243
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
- Like Tak in "The Power of Juju."

244
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Does that ring a bell?

245
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,680
- Absolutely.

246
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,120
- There we go.

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,400
- Spyro.

248
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
- Yeah, Spyro.

249
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,920
No, Spyro was--

250
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,760
- Spyro's cool. - He was the best one.

251
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,080
- He was a dragon.

252
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,120
- Yeah, I don't think he sucked up anything, though.

253
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,280
- He was a dragon who smoked weed.

254
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,120
- Yeah.

255
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,000
- Yeah. - And he was a Skylander.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,840
- Yeah. - Yeah.

257
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,680
- Dude, Skylanders, awesome.

258
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,880
Me and Pat are gonna play Skylanders.

259
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,280
- Yeah, we're trying to get--

260
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,680
i don't know i think it's someone's i i i skylanders on the ad was listening to

261
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,520
the podcast right now please bias skylanders on p_c_ and cameron both

262
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,960
both yet if you don't have any dialogue i was a recount if you only by one were

263
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,140
returning the and we need all the tourists to

264
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,500
you know all of them all the figures need any because i'm playing with

265
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,620
normal stuff like you had shows so

266
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,240
yeah but these are toys that come to light out this reminds me i i i think

267
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,500
it's going to life

268
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,800
i posted that video of like limp is get covers uh... and i was someone who

269
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,040
who like replied and was talking with their friend

270
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
in my replies and was like,

271
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,720
man, I can't believe we used to listen to this stuff.

272
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,800
This is so cringe nowadays to look at this.

273
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,400
And they both had Transformers display names.

274
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,980
(all laughing)

275
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,720
- That fucking rocks.

276
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,640
- So funny.

277
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,200
- What were the display names?

278
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,700
- Let me look it up real quick.

279
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,080
- Hammer and the Decepticon.

280
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,400
(laughing)

281
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,240
- Let's see.

282
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,560
- Yeah, Mr. Bumblebee.

283
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,200
I think one of them was something bumblebee.

284
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
That could just be an animal thing.

285
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Josh bumblebee.

286
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,680
No, because their profile picture was a transformer and their bio said like transformer's fan.

287
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Maybe he's horribly disabled and that's his mech suit.

288
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,480
You never think dude.

289
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
This is what, yeah.

290
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
That's one of my problems.

291
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,000
That's the thing, if you're disabled enough you just get like a, you get an upgrade.

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,120
I think that's called uh... horseshoe theory

293
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,640
because all the way back around and you get a super cool legs

294
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,680
exactly yeah ronald mcdonald house pays for you to have like the coolest legs on

295
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,720
earth

296
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,400
uh... okay way it turns out one of them i just thought was uh...

297
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,040
was a transformers name because their name is just phoenix and i just assumed

298
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,480
phoenix was a transformer i think only one of them is a transformer name

299
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,840
this one is scout bumblebee that was saying i can't believe we used to listen

300
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,000
of this. There's no real pattern to the Transformers names. They're all just cool things. It's

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
all just two cool words. Yeah, they're not like the Ninja Turtles. There's no reason

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,880
why they're named what they are. Yeah, they're all just called like "Power Wheel." It's

303
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,780
just like they take two cool words and put them together. Yeah. It's like the same principle

304
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,440
they use to name military vehicles. I've tried to come up with a joke military vehicle

305
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
name before and just like search them and every time it's a real vehicle.

306
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,300
[LAUGHTER]

307
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,160
Cobra.

308
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,960
The garter snake.

309
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,720
The Raytheon garter snake.

310
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
The evil dog.

311
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,640
Yeah.

312
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,920
That's like what all of them are.

313
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,080
Northrop Grumman evil dog.

314
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,120
The annoying orange.

315
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,200
[LAUGHTER]

316
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,040
Yeah.

317
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,640
Annoying Orange.

318
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,440
They're like four billion dollars over budget and they keep crashing.

319
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:06,520
Yeah, six military casualties today at Cape Lejeune as they test out the Annoying Orange for the fifth time.

320
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,920
Another manned trip on the Annoying Orange.

321
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,260
Yeah.

322
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,280
That's, they're just gonna start naming them.

323
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,160
Do you have a favorite Limp Bizkit album?

324
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,300
Hmm?

325
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,640
Do you have a favorite Limp Bizkit album? I noticed that you put that on your like,

326
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,360
uh, you had recently like a big playlist and you had Significant Other on that.

327
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,800
Oh yeah, Significant Other rocks. I think that's the best Limp Bizkit album.

328
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,920
I don't know any of them. You guys could make them up.

329
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
I've been listening to so much Limp Bizkit lately.

330
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,160
There's a song on-

331
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,240
Chocolate starfish in the hot dog flavored water.

332
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,840
Yeah, that one's good too.

333
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,760
Mr. Nasty's Pissy Puddles.

334
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,640
That's what all of them are named like.

335
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Um, the Fuck Freak.

336
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
The fuck freak.

337
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Um, turd hood.

338
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
I remember like the first album.

339
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Turd hood?

340
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
[Laughter]

341
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Um, the first, the first Limp Bizkit album I got was like the album full of remixes.

342
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:09,640
And that's actually how I heard for like every actually good rapper I learned about from that album.

343
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Cause they had like Pharrell and Method Man.

344
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:20,400
They have like Method Man and fucking they have so many features from the actual rappers.

345
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
It's so funny.

346
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,960
That's like my dad got into hip-hop because of Girl Talk.

347
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
The like mashup artist.

348
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,520
He was like, "Well Biggie Smalls is actually fucking sick when he's rapping over Twisted

349
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Sister."

350
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,200
That's what it is.

351
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,440
It's a project to get dads into hip-hop.

352
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,680
It's absolutely what it is.

353
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,560
it's a it's a ploy by the rap industry to get like, like dudes

354
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,220
who love like Leonard Skinner to listen to Tupac. Yeah. And it

355
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,860
worked. My dad is my dad loves a con. My dad's ears. My dad's

356
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,480
like favorite guy in the world is a con. It's because Yeah,

357
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,400
because I like when I was a kid, I accidentally, like plugged

358
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,360
his iPod into my like, computer at some point and it put a con

359
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm so paid on his iPod.

360
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,260
And at first he would listen to it because he thought it was like funny

361
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,760
that he had a rap song on his iPod.

362
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,260
And then he every day I would like walk into his room and he'd be listening

363
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,260
to it alone and just like rapping to himself.

364
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,860
It's pretty he knows every single word of the edited version.

365
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,760
He knows the edited version for the record.

366
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,560
Getting edited version for my dad.

367
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,460
So he doesn't say the n-word.

368
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,220
(laughter)

369
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,460
- I mean, that is what it took, absolutely.

370
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,740
(laughter)

371
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,020
- Yeah.

372
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,860
- What's going on?

373
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,420
What happened with Aecon City?

374
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,740
- Oh, you guys remember that?

375
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,820
- It's driving.

376
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,460
- They hit it like Wakanda.

377
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,180
(laughter)

378
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,660
- They put a shield around it.

379
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,780
- It's invisible.

380
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,580
- If they got too advanced too fast.

381
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,260
They had already come out with I'm so paid too.

382
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,460
- Yeah.

383
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,300
- They were like, we have--

384
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,540
- They had an Aecon City?

385
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,380
- We have to hide.

386
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,060
Yeah, he like bought.

387
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,580
That was gonna run on his own cryptocurrency or something?

388
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,340
He brought electricity to it.

389
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,060
Instead of, you know, the special mineral

390
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,100
that Wakandans have, he just brought them electricity.

391
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,940
Yeah.

392
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,760
(laughing)

393
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,600
Just more electricity.

394
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,540
They just trade electricity.

395
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,180
Electricity is the cryptocurrency he came up with.

396
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,180
They just trade a bottle of lightning back and forth.

397
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,660
Shoot lightning at each other in order to pay each other.

398
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,260
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,540
They go palpitating on each other.

400
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,600
If there's one power I wish was real,

401
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,980
I wish it was electricity powers were real.

402
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,820
Yeah.

403
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,860
I looked up.

404
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,780
Oh my God, you got insanely loud Patrick.

405
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,260
Sorry, I'll move it back.

406
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,820
I looked up Acon City and it says,

407
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,500
"Acon finalizes deal to build

408
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,980
"a cryptocurrency city in Senegal."

409
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,500
And then the photo that they use

410
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,140
is like one of those like future,

411
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,220
like this is what society would look like.

412
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,100
(laughing)

413
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,060
That fucking rocks, dude.

414
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,480
I mean, they're right.

415
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,580
Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,420
That is the kind of-- We had A-Coin.

417
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,260
A-Coin, yeah, that's what it was.

418
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,140
Is that what it was called?

419
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,100
Yeah. That's what it was called.

420
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,540
You know that he just, he was like,

421
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,740
"What can I play off my name now?

422
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
I guess I'll do a Cryptocurrency."

423
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,100
I feel like he came up with the name first.

424
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,900
Yeah, 100%.

425
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,940
Yeah, he thought, "Oh shit, look what happens

426
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,620
if you put an I in the middle of my name.

427
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,140
Dude, I gotta start a city."

428
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,400
(laughing)

429
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,800
The only way this is gonna work is if I buy an entire city with it.

430
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,300
Yeah.

431
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,420
That's definitely what African countries need is just some completely new currency

432
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,280
that can be inflated to the point of being meaningless.

433
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Exactly.

434
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Yeah.

435
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,680
I've been saying this for years actually and I'm just glad Akon took some action.

436
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,000
Alright, the list today, we got a monkey list.

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We got a chimp list.

438
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We're monkeying it.

439
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We're monkeying around.

440
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:14,960
the

441
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,200
It's world chimpanzee day today.

442
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,440
I just, I looked it up.

443
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,940
Alright.

444
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,940
This banana's for you chimps.

445
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,440
Yeah.

446
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
[Laughter]

447
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,940
Thank you.

448
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,940
Let's all toast a banana.

449
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,440
Yeah.

450
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Those motherfuckers love bananas, man.

451
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,940
Monkeys and bananas is kinda like...

452
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Monkeys go monkeys, bananas for bananas.

453
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Monkeys go bananas for bananas.

454
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,940
That's right.

455
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,740
Yeah, monkeys go monkey on a banana.

456
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
They will.

457
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
Oh yeah.

458
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,420
Alright, so this is from Ranker.

459
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:57,500
This is people who own chimps as pets and paid the price.

460
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,820
With 1.6 million views.

461
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,260
That's gotta be pretty good, right?

462
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,980
They probably made a couple thousand dollars off of this list.

463
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Yeah, that's right.

464
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,280
This is written by Lee MJ.

465
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
This list.

466
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:20,640
Lee Michael Jackson. Can we see his photo? I like that uh it says so the the

467
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,200
beginning of this of this article says on the surface owning a pet chimpanzee

468
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,920
seems remarkably appealing movies tell us they're cute fun entertaining and

469
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,440
just like us yes we share around 99% of our DNA with them but there's one key

470
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,320
difference between our two species grown chimpanzees have the strength of several

471
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,320
adult humans. That's the key difference between us and chimpanzees.

472
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Wait, I found, I clicked on this guy Lee MJ's profile and this is his bio.

473
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,320
If you wander into a seedy bar past midnight looking for someone to

474
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,320
discuss Jeffrey Dahmer's victim count, government conspiracies, or

475
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
contemporary horror with, I'll most certainly be there. I've got a master's degree in

476
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,320
poetry and can often be found listening to true crime podcasts or long songs

477
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
with a lot of lyrics.

478
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,920
Calling my sense of humor, quote,

479
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,680
dark would be like calling the

480
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,920
Mariana Trench kind of deep.

481
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,440
I love music, books, film and

482
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,400
anything else I can lose myself in.

483
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,760
Pull up a chair and let's talk

484
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,640
anything weird, creepy or scary.

485
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,300
Damn, yeah, I'm a bit of a freaky

486
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,040
little creep and I like to make

487
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,520
lists and just

488
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
while we're on his.

489
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Very boring.

490
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,240
While we're on his um his page I just want to look at some of the other lists

491
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,080
he wrote like this one that's called animals who just love getting down and

492
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,400
dirty and that is like the caption of it says everyone knows at least one person

493
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,200
who is completely obsessed with doing it then there's another list he has called

494
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:04,840
nine uncomfortable facts about how dolphins are sexual assault monsters and

495
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,480
then he also has 20 unforgettable behind-the-scenes images from the

496
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:17,160
Harry Potter movies there's a there's a there's a theme here they're all

497
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:27,520
connected somehow yeah that fucking rocks dude goddamn all right um number one

498
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,520
this is I mean this is as classic as it gets as far as I mean what chimp do you

499
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,720
guys think of when oh when we think of somebody owning a chimp and then paying

500
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,640
the price yeah I think of my I think of my pet chimp yeah I think yeah no Travis

501
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,880
the chimp tore off the face and hands of his owner's family friend.

502
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,440
Did that lady did she did Charlotte Nash ever like sue that lady?

503
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,180
Because she probably had grounds to write. Yeah.

504
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,280
I don't know.

505
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,120
So I would. Yeah, I would have become the richest woman in the world.

506
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,920
That would have been the funniest signature on those legal documents of all time.

507
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,080
She just she just signs it with lipstick and a kiss.

508
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,880
Oh, man.

509
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
Travis the Chimpanzee, we all know this one.

510
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,680
I feel like we don't even need to waste our time here.

511
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,180
Yeah.

512
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,980
Travis the Chimpanzee, I mean, he went crazy.

513
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,280
He's the reason.

514
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,080
We don't even need to talk about it because he's the greatest of all time.

515
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,880
It's that simple.

516
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,480
You don't need to talk about Michael Jordan.

517
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,980
You don't need to talk about Rinaldo.

518
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,780
You don't need to talk about Tiger Woods.

519
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,880
It's everybody knows it.

520
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,680
He's number one.

521
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,880
He's the best to ever do it.

522
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,480
He's the number one monkey.

523
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,480
He's the, I would say, he probably is like,

524
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,280
no, monkeys have killed people before, right?

525
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,120
- What?

526
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,000
- Uh, sure.

527
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,840
- Yeah.

528
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,400
- Yeah, people, yeah, monkey, how often,

529
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,240
I wonder how often that happens.

530
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,240
- Do you think Travis was the first monkey to kill someone?

531
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,440
- No, no, no. - In 2009,

532
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,280
is that what you're suggesting?

533
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,440
- I don't know, no, I'm not suggesting that, no.

534
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,920
I wasn't thinking, that was not a thought

535
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,400
in my head at any point.

536
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm just saying, he's gotta be up there.

537
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,800
- Yeah, he kinda created the, he kinda pioneered

538
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
the idea of monkeys going on.

539
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,120
Like the monkey in the new Planet of the Apes movies,

540
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,240
where he has the idea of hurting humans.

541
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,320
And then he convinces all the other monkeys.

542
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,640
He runs for monkey president.

543
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,000
He wins.

544
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,080
It's kind of an allegory for Donald Trump, those movies,

545
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
when you think about it.

546
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,040
Because here's a monkey who's very smart,

547
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,800
just like Donald Trump.

548
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,600
And he wins over all the monkeys to fight all the humans.

549
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,560
And it's pretty much a one-to-one comparison.

550
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:52,540
and

551
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:58,660
one of his top advisors. I'm the orangutan and I'm basically his number one guy. He looks

552
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:05,660
to me for stuff like bananas and to get a new gun. Yeah, man I'll never forget the day I

553
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,460
woke up and saw the headline "Donald Trump has a gun." Yeah, that was a dark day. That's

554
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,580
kind of, that's when it all started going downhill for him. This is not normal. Yeah.

555
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,420
This is seriously not normal. The president just got a gun.

556
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,580
The president is constitutionally not allowed to have a gun.

557
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
Yeah.

558
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:32,380
Because I mean that's, that's yeah, that pretty much ruins checks and balances right there.

559
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,780
That's true. Yeah.

560
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,780
Yeah, balance this, bitch. That's what he could, he could do a cool line like that.

561
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,380
Or he could even do this.

562
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,980
Check this, bitch. You know, he could do both, both checks and balances.

563
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,180
It's kind of a, it's kind of a sticky situation to get in.

564
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,980
I don't want to be a drama queen right now, but my finger just exploded.

565
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
Oh Jesus!

566
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
What the fuck?

567
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,980
What the fuck happened here?

568
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,280
I don't know what the fuck happened.

569
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,900
You are a drama queen.

570
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,340
What did you- what happened?

571
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,340
It just started bleeding?

572
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:09,860
My finger, I guess I used the keyboard too hard on it and it started to bleed.

573
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
Ugh.

574
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,660
Stop typing so hard.

575
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,700
What are you typing right now?

576
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,500
I typed in the thing about Akoin.

577
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,620
(laughing)

578
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,300
- Dude, you got cursed.

579
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,260
- Akon strikes again, dude.

580
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,060
- I gotta get some paper towels or something, I'm sorry.

581
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,260
- It's okay, can I take this break to take a shit?

582
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,860
It's killing me.

583
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,020
- All right, I don't remember what we were talking about

584
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,700
before Patrick had an accident

585
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,580
and we had to stop recording 'cause he lived right there.

586
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,900
- Don't explain it, here's what we're gonna say.

587
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,660
We're just gonna say Patrick had an accident.

588
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,340
We're gonna save you some embarrassment.

589
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
That's all we'll say.

590
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
Patrick's...

591
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
My finger started bleeding.

592
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,340
We don't even want to know about

593
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
what you did.

594
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
Your finger started bleeding.

595
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
Everywhere over the white chair.

596
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Body fluid is everywhere.

597
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
Patrick's downstairs finger exploded all over his chair.

598
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
That's right.

599
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
That's not what happened.

600
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Oh, so your finger didn't explode?

601
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
My finger exploded on my downstairs finger?

602
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
Your downstairs underwear finger?

603
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
No, my regular finger.

604
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
The finger that comes off of between your legs?

605
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
No.

606
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Your naughty little finger had an accident.

607
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,340
It is my naughty finger. It's my middle finger.

608
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
So he admits it.

609
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
No!

610
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,340
It's the one in the middle of his legs.

611
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,340
It's not in the middle of my body.

612
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,340
It is.

613
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Oh, wait, where is it then if it's not in the middle of your body?

614
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
It's in the middle of my hand.

615
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
You have, you're, okay, so.

616
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
You have a hand where your dick should be?

617
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,860
(laughing)

618
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,960
- Fucking weird, dude.

619
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,220
Yeah, we had to take a shit break also.

620
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,500
Yeah, and while I was shitting,

621
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,020
I found out that Barry Weiss resigned.

622
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,260
- Yeah.

623
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,500
- Wow.

624
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,780
I mean, this is huge for us.

625
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,620
- Oh my God!

626
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,740
- This is fucking huge, dude.

627
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,580
- Yeah.

628
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,740
- We're gonna hire her now.

629
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,860
- I don't know anything about her, I don't want to.

630
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,700
- She's just basically awesome.

631
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,940
- I just said I didn't want to, all right?

632
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,340
- I'll leave it at this, dream girl.

633
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,340
I said I don't want to know anything.

634
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
You know what I'm saying?

635
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
Dreamgirls?

636
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Yeah, Dreamgirls. She's a serious Beyonce.

637
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I don't know.

638
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
I actually thought I had an opinion and then someone asked me

639
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
why she's so bad and I was like, I don't really remember.

640
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,340
Me too.

641
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,340
I don't fucking care.

642
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
She quit the New York Times and moved to LA

643
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
and strip at the

644
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
the Wailing Wall themed strip joint

645
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
in LA.

646
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
It's gonna be really hot, dude.

647
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
We won't want to miss this, dude.

648
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,620
Oh, I can't wait, yeah.

649
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,980
Fully clothed.

650
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,860
Um...

651
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,900
Rock.

652
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,620
The next one is, "The owners of Moe the Chimpanzee suffered a horrible animal attack."

653
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,180
I don't like that they...

654
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,340
They... It seems... This title makes it seem like a different animal hurt.

655
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,100
Yeah.

656
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,580
Yeah, a different chimpanzee came in and attacked.

657
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,580
Or just a... Not even a chim... Like a...

658
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,100
Some... Like a...

659
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,820
A mosquito.

660
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,980
A hippopotamus.

661
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,240
(laughter)

662
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,380
- This is just, this is, the author of this list

663
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,860
owns Moe the chimpanzee and he got bit by a mosquito

664
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,600
and he's just trying to sneak this in there

665
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,580
'cause he's really upset.

666
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,940
- Okay, so St. James and, St. James?

667
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,020
That's the guy's name?

668
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,220
(laughter)

669
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,060
What the fuck?

670
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,980
- St. James Davis.

671
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,820
- St. James Davis?

672
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,660
That's sick.

673
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,480
- That's a really good name.

674
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,880
That is like a name that you would give your chimpanzee, St. James.

675
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,920
St. James and LaDonna Davis were high school sweethearts.

676
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,600
They planned to get married until St. James left LaDonna at the altar.

677
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
What the fuck?

678
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,520
And then skipped town shortly after on a boat headed for Africa.

679
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,240
Eventually he came home and he brought Moe, a newborn chimpanzee.

680
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,440
Not long afterward, he and LaDonna finally married.

681
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
What the fuck?

682
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,280
He left this bitch at the altar and then went to Africa and came back with a monkey.

683
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
And they still got married.

684
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Now we can get married.

685
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Sorry, I had to get my mind right. I have a monkey with me now.

686
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
You can see I'm a different man.

687
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
And there's a monkey here.

688
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I needed a best man.

689
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
I needed a funny best man.

690
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Before I realized.

691
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I realized I didn't have any sort of.

692
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
There was no comic relief at this wedding.

693
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Oh my god. They fucking.

694
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:34,360
They had the chimp at their wedding. There's a photo. There's some pictures of him without a nose and then there's a picture

695
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,200
Okay, that's a spoiler

696
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,840
Well spoiler alert we can edit that out. There is

697
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,040
There's a photo of the monkey in a little hat and he's got like

698
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:53,800
I'll post this picture with the episode. Yeah, this is a really good picture

699
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,940
The monkey is sitting on the lap of both of them and they're in their wedding outfits. He's got a little hat.

700
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:08,640
Man, that is a great monkey photo. Over the years a human couple and their chimpanzee lived in California.

701
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,700
They ate, slept, and watched TV together and Moe even made some TV appearances.

702
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:21,020
But when Moe was in his 30s, he began to display aggressive behaviors. After a raid by the police and animal control,

703
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,420
Moe was eventually taken away by the state

704
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:30,800
But then Moe was eventually granted the right to stay at a sanctuary for apes where the Davises could visit him one fateful day

705
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,840
Never a good way to start

706
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,800
There's never something awesome after that one fateful day

707
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,680
Caleb's mom came home with a GameCube

708
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:47,840
One fateful day the Davises were visiting Moe at the sanctuary for his 39th birthday birthday. That's an old monkey birthday

709
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
Tragically, two chimpanzees escape from their cages.

710
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Oh my god.

711
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Oh, wait, they were right.

712
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
It was foreshadowing.

713
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,040
Jealous of the Davises' attention to Moe, one went directly after LaDonna, biting her

714
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,240
thumb off after an attempted tackle.

715
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,040
St. James jumped in to save his wife and became the main victim of the attacking primates.

716
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,340
After five minutes, LaDonna screams, caught the attention of the sanctuary owner's son.

717
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,320
If I owned a chimp sanctuary, I would watch fucking everybody.

718
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,480
Yeah, I would not be sitting in the office like watching Breaking Bad and be like, well if I hear screams for more than five minutes

719
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Then I'll walk out

720
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
Yeah, he just looks he's like

721
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,160
Five minutes. All right. Yes. I have to go check this

722
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,020
It's like that those kids in high school would say like hey, you know 15 minutes. The teacher doesn't show up

723
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,180
Hey five minutes at the screaming still going I have to leave

724
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:52,700
Basically the guy shot both chimpanzees and St. James was left massively disfigured.

725
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Despite everything.

726
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
What does he look like?

727
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,020
He looks, he has no nose now.

728
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,140
Oh yeah, he's got no nose and then he's got like maggots.

729
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,620
Look at Google Moe the chimpanzee and it comes up.

730
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,780
He has a fucked up mouth too.

731
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,420
And it looks like an eye.

732
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,580
He kinda looks cool.

733
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,740
He kinda looks evil.

734
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
You know?

735
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,420
Well, I mean, you can't, that's the problem.

736
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,780
His name is Saint James.

737
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,260
He can't be an evil saint.

738
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
That's why it's so impactful.

739
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
True.

740
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,620
Because it made him look evil and now people don't believe he's a saint anymore.

741
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,620
I would love to get attacked like this and look like this.

742
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,420
I would absolutely kill for that, dude.

743
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,900
You know how much money you would save on Halloween costumes?

744
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,900
(laughter)

745
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:51,900
The last line of this one is, "Despite everything, the couple continued to visit Moe, until he mysteriously disappeared from the sanctuary."

746
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Whoa.

747
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,900
That's the real mystery.

748
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Can you imagine getting- can you imagine you and your wife both get attacked and disfigured by chimpanzees and you keep going back to the place where the chimpanzees attack you?

749
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
That's insane.

750
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,140
insane. Oh wait, this is new.

751
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,020
Sharla Nash got a full facial transplant.

752
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,580
Whoa.

753
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,300
She looks hot, dude.

754
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,580
Whoa.

755
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,020
Sharla Nash.

756
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,300
I take it all back, baby.

757
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,020
Wow.

758
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,700
Hubba hubba.

759
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,980
Wow.

760
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,220
She looks good, dude.

761
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,860
She used to look.

762
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,180
Good for her.

763
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,780
Yeah.

764
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,340
Yeah.

765
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,220
Good for you, Sharla.

766
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,820
We've always supported Sharla.

767
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,940
We've always backed you, Charla.

768
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,820
Absolutely.

769
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,380
She can come on anytime.

770
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,460
We've already, we've extended the olive branch once.

771
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,180
Yeah, we've extended, we've extended a vine for her to swing on over.

772
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,900
You know?

773
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,180
Yeah.

774
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,420
Maybe that was in poor taste.

775
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Now that I think about it, we extended her a banana, a banana on a, on a

776
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,460
mannequin's hand and she didn't take it.

777
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,780
I just I was googling was Moe the chimp ever found and I found I've

778
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,420
forum thread on

779
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:17,380
24/7 sports.com called whatever happened to Moe the chimp and they're just like talking about this attack and a guy named

780
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:24,620
War Eagle Pete said posted in this thread and said let that chimp attack me. I would choke the life out of that monkey

781
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:29,700
That's so awesome

782
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Just Mark Wahlberg like yeah

783
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:38,060
there Charlotte still have a face you know could be a lot different if I've

784
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,060
been in that ape sanctuary my kids let me tell you what st. James is still

785
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,900
having those hey James still don't fucking knows and and mo the chimp would

786
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,820
still be there but the chip would still be there he would never be missing he

787
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,260
would be he would be here would have a cameo and fucking Patriots day kid I'm

788
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,820
telling I would have had a new chimp son yeah that's true I would have

789
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,540
adopted one of the chimps. I would have taught Moe about Christ.

790
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:14,940
Alright next horrible accident. Chimps CJ and Buddy. I love all the titles. Chimps CJ and Buddy wreaked havoc on an entire Las Vegas

791
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,220
neighborhood. Buddy and CJ were two chimps who lived in Las Vegas. Okay that's

792
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,580
like the best I think that may be the best existence that it and that any

793
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:33,100
being can have yeah it's like a chimp in Las Vegas that's like that I mean you

794
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,620
just are like you're like probably fucking human women that you know what

795
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,740
I mean yeah probably getting like you're probably you're like a rich monkey that

796
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,660
are in Las Vegas that first sentence buddy and CJ were two chimps who lived

797
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,620
in Las Vegas that's like the cheat code for a movie pitch like yeah you just say

798
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,420
that you get the movie no matter what,

799
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,420
as long as that's at the beginning of your pitch.

800
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,260
- We're in.

801
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,860
- You're in studio meeting.

802
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,780
- Yeah.

803
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
- That was the original pitch for the Hangover.

804
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,700
And then they had to like,

805
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,140
they just kept doing sneaky edits until it was.

806
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,580
It's like, instead of it, okay.

807
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,940
How about Buddy the Chimp and Zach Galifianakis?

808
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,380
And they're like, all right.

809
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,100
As long as there's still one chimp.

810
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
And they're like, okay, but what about?

811
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,980
- What if the chimp is a tiger?

812
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,820
- What if the chimp is a baby?

813
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,260
- But he's owned by Mike Tyson.

814
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Okay, alright.

815
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:31,260
So there were two chimps who lived in Las Vegas under the care of Timmy DeRosa and Lee Watkinson,

816
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,760
professional poker players. Both chimps were born in captivity, then bought with Watkinson's

817
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,260
poker winnings and raised in a state where there were no state laws.

818
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Determining whether or not people could keep exotic animals.

819
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
State law.

820
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,260
I just, yeah, I just like ending in it. No state laws.

821
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,340
In 2012, CJ and Buddy escaped from their cage.

822
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,700
Buddy ripped his cage from the attached concrete

823
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,820
and broke through a padlock on a nearby fence.

824
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,700
Both champs then proceeded to a neighbor's house

825
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,180
where they pounded on a window.

826
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,020
- Oh my God.

827
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,460
- Can you fucking imagine, dude?

828
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,780
You live in Las Vegas and you're watching TV,

829
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,260
you're watching football,

830
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,700
and you hear what you think is someone knocking at the door

831
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,580
and you see two champs trying to break

832
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,660
into your fucking house.

833
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,660
One resident fearing for his family's life grabbed his gun.

834
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,000
Huh?

835
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
What'd you say?

836
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,500
Oh, nothing. I just figured, uh, yeah, it's a pretty scary...

837
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,340
Like, you probably figure something's up as soon as you hear somebody pounding really loud at the window.

838
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,780
True. Even if it was a human at the window, I would be scared.

839
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,900
Yeah. I would already be, like, so high alert.

840
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
And seeing two chimps, I would freak.

841
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,580
Two humans are, like, screaming and pounding really hard at the window.

842
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:52,940
Yeah, honey, honey, don't worry. Just two humans are outside making chip noises pounding on the windows. I'm sure it's two humans. I'll be right back

843
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,940
I'm gonna go

844
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,060
Oh

845
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,980
Wait, it appears I was horribly mistaken

846
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:11,500
To humans, I think they might be humans are covered in hair hide hide the bananas and peanuts

847
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,900
Eventually the chimps left the house and continued through the streets, Buddy was fatally shot by a police officer

848
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:28,260
CJ was tranquilized and recaptured the pair of escaped chimps struck fear into the hearts of the entire neighborhood

849
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,940
That

850
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,860
Those chimps didn't even kill anyone I would have gone into the street and and fought them

851
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,580
With a sword no I would have choked to life out of that monkey, baby

852
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:49,220
The thing okay, so with so man versus chimp there's zero way that I'm like

853
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,660
Zero out of a hundred times does a does a man win that fight hand to hand right correct?

854
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:02,780
But what if it's like Andre the giant I saw a video of a guy talking about how he defeated a chimp

855
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,780
Oh, I saw that too

856
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,460
My god, I did see that you're he like choked it out. Yeah, he like body slammed it a couple times

857
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,080
See like you're right like you do a thing where it would run up to him and then he like picked it up and used

858
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,660
It's momentum against him by I saw that exact same video that show

859
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,780
scenario

860
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,560
He was like, you know, his cousin was an ape master and he brought a bunch of

861
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,460
Chip was his cousin

862
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,900
My cousin's a chimp

863
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,340
That's what I meant by ape master. It's just like a and then another ape

864
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:48,500
Yeah, I'm bigger a bigger one that has like better use of his thumbs as like a crown made of leaves on yeah

865
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:54,380
Really mastered being an ape. I think I think Pierce sent me that video. I'm thinking about it

866
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,920
Yeah, I think it was an ape chat that I saw it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think

867
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,900
Like with like him with the with the chimp like giving up going inside to watch cartoons and

868
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,900
and like the chimp master cousin was like he respects you now he respects what you did

869
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,540
you're the alpha male.

870
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,580
That's what you have to kill the chimp to earn its respect?

871
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,560
You just have to flip it over a bunch of times.

872
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,020
Chimps love backflips but they don't have the coordination to do them themselves so they

873
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,260
will often run at humans in the hopes that they will flip them over their back.

874
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,580
It makes sense.

875
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,340
It does.

876
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
I'm sure you could train.

877
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,540
It's what training men who's beat a chimp in hand-to-hand combat is basically what I'm

878
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,540
saying.

879
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,660
The thing is, the problem with chimps is that they're willing to play dirty.

880
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,100
I would never bite a man.

881
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,340
A chimp will bite somebody no problem.

882
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,740
And I would never go after somebody's nose.

883
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,980
Yeah, that's fucked up to do.

884
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
Yeah, that is.

885
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,300
And chimps, the thing is, they want to make you look like a chimp.

886
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,220
Because you're so close, they're like, "All right, we gotta get that nose in there."

887
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,580
off of there. My nose does not look like that.

888
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
You've been bothering the shit out of me.

889
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,580
Yeah.

890
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,980
That's just how it works, dude.

891
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,340
Give them a chimp makeover and it's very rude of you to try and resist.

892
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,900
Yeah, they're doing plastic surgery to you to make you a beautiful chimp like them.

893
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,660
Yeah.

894
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,660
And when you fight them, it's disrespectful.

895
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
And then they want to take your hands and kill you.

896
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,580
Yeah, well no, the hands thing is they're like, "Oh, these hands are way too weak.

897
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,980
Listen, I'm gonna take these away, I'll bring you some new ones later, but for now you just sit with those stumps, you'll be fine.

898
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,180
Yeah, well they get confused because they're like, "Those look nothing like your feet."

899
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,680
So basically, here, I'll take these for now, and then I'll go find some that look like your feet and put those there.

900
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,780
Those later. They're just doing, yeah, like a chimp version of Queer Eye, or like...

901
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:00,380
[laughter]

902
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,580
Okay, so before Monica had this terrible big nose and these hands that looked nothing like her feet.

903
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,020
Now, as you can see, we're ripping her nose off.

904
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,620
Yeah, the monkey bunch is coming to the tent.

905
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:19,500
There's one chimp that's like the house renovation chimp and he's just throwing glasses at the wall.

906
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,420
Yeah, there's the food chimp who's making, he's just mashing bananas.

907
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,980
The clothes chimp and he's just like...

908
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,140
He's just making every, just taking their clothes off.

909
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,140
You gotta dress like this.

910
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Basically.

911
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:40,640
Straight guys have the worst taste.

912
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,660
Chimps think that all humans are straight.

913
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,300
They look down upon them.

914
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,140
The queer eye chimps see the house and they're like, "Oh, you can't live here."

915
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,460
So they just try to make you as ugly as possible so you'll be shunned and have to live in the

916
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,460
forest.

917
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,700
Yeah, yeah, they're like this this is the worst. Yeah, let me just figure you

918
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:07,580
You can't live in this house anymore cuz all your neighbors will hate you. Yeah, and that knows honey. It has to go

919
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:18,940
Yeah, we're gonna have to file those teeth down because there's no way that could bite through a woman's hand

920
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:26,580
Suke sue echo ran loose in Kansas City and destroyed police property

921
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,820
(laughing)

922
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:34,540
It doesn't tend a 300 pound chimpanzee, that's huge.

923
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,380
- Yeah, holy shit.

924
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,860
- Name Suiko broke out of her owner's house

925
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,200
in Kansas City, Missouri on that seemingly pleasant fall day

926
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,720
Suiko set fear into the hearts of an entire neighborhood.

927
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,180
Okay, buddy, you're reusing motifs here.

928
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,660
In the hours that Suiko ran free,

929
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,340
the chimpanzee attacked numerous vehicles along the roads,

930
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,100
jumping on the roofs of civilian cars.

931
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,500
The animal also punched out the window of a police car.

932
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,460
So that's what they mean by destroyed police property,

933
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,300
I guess.

934
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,100
Zuko was shot with a tranquilizer,

935
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,860
which turned out to be ineffective at sedating the chimp.

936
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,380
That's just all of these stories.

937
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,540
It never goes right.

938
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,620
It's always so hard to get the chimp down.

939
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,180
Zuko would ultimately return to its cage, however,

940
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,440
after her owner coaxed her back into her cage.

941
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,280
That's all it took.

942
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,460
- Yeah, yeah.

943
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,220
- But police do not have enough money

944
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,500
to deal with chimp related incidents, clearly.

945
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,700
That's true. That's why they need tanks.

946
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,700
Yeah.

947
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,780
That's what happens if a monkey tries to jump on top of the roof of the car.

948
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,780
Yeah.

949
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,780
You can't do that with tanks.

950
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,780
Yeah, because there's no windows on a tank for the monkey to punch out.

951
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
Yeah.

952
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,700
Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the owner incurred a fine and lost possession of the

953
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,340
animal. That's not a big deal to me.

954
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,780
Yeah, not interesting.

955
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,380
I wouldn't say that that is, that was exactly paying the price of owning a pet chimp.

956
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,900
Yeah, well I guess you technically they did because they paid a fine.

957
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,780
Yeah, that's true. I guess it was exactly paying the price.

958
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,180
Yeah, paying the literal price.

959
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,180
Yeah.

960
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,180
Timmy the chimpanzee attacked a police officer.

961
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,180
Now we're getting into sweet.

962
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,180
Now they're getting great.

963
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,180
Now this is cool.

964
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,180
In 2009 a 9 year old chimp named Timmy allegedly tried attacking...

965
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,180
Allegedly!

966
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,180
Allegedly!

967
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:24,180
He's yet to see his day in court.

968
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,260
Allegedly tried attacking a police officer in Winston, Missouri.

969
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,660
Timmy broke free from his cage in his owner's backyard.

970
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,780
He roamed the neighborhood and was eventually approached by police.

971
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,620
He's approached by just two cops with their thumbs on their waistbands.

972
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,220
He's like, "Well, hey there, mister.

973
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,220
What are you doing?"

974
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,180
I like the idea that the author of this list started writing it and then was like, "Oh,

975
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:51,700
fuck Timmy might sue me and went back and put in a rap allegedly. I hate when I have to go to monkey court.

976
00:47:51,700 --> 00:48:01,460
There's criminal cases, civil cases, and monkey cases. The judge ripped my nose off in monkey court.

977
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:07,620
The judge is just a huge fat orangutan with a big powdered wig

978
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,860
using a human hand as a mallet.

979
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:20,340
Yeah, it's just it's just your your your state appointed lawyer is a chip in a

980
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,700
suit and he's just going yeah.

981
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:28,700
Cost examining you and just urinating your mouth.

982
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:35,140
Trying to objection is leading the witness trying to fuck the space

983
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,340
between your fingers.

984
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,540
We're going with this.

985
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:45,860
Someone in the jury throws poop at you.

986
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,220
Monkey court is maybe the best idea I've ever heard.

987
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,220
Yeah, this is a really good-

988
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,980
I can't believe how good that is.

989
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,460
There's so many different possibilities.

990
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,940
There's so many things that could happen.

991
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:02,100
It's just the whole time in court, like it's just every second, just every single monkey

992
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,420
there is just screaming at the top of their lungs.

993
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,420
You can't hear anything.

994
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,420
They're just going, "Ahhhh!"

995
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,620
The jurors box is like a tire swing.

996
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:20,420
Just a monkey just swinging.

997
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,020
Faster and faster in a circle.

998
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,320
You're about to be like serve the life sentence and you look over.

999
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,420
It's just a monkeys just like spinning on.

1000
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,320
That's like yeah, what if like because it's so hard to get people for jury duty. What if they

1001
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,960
They just stack up like they get okay. We got six people, but let's just we'll just fill the rest with chimps. Yeah

1002
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,400
They're very agreeable. They'll just go with whatever

1003
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Yeah

1004
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,200
They're doing jury because one of the chimps

1005
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,480
Couldn't we just we realize you can't say yes or no. There's a lawyer doing um

1006
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,400
like there's a case on the robbery of a toy store and the and

1007
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,240
they're like the lawyers like now did you or did you not steal

1008
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,360
this item and holds up a tickle me Elmo and then every monkey in

1009
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,720
the room just attacks him.

1010
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:22,800
Timmy reportedly tried opening their squad door, their squad

1011
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,840
car door and grabbed an officer before being shot. Timmy's life

1012
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,600
came to an unfortunate end.

1013
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,080
The incident led to a larger bust.

1014
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,080
What?

1015
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,680
When police investigated the home of Timmy's owners,

1016
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,440
they discovered an illegal puppy mill

1017
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,760
with about 100 to 200 small breed dogs,

1018
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,080
as well as three other primates.

1019
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,920
Wow.

1020
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,160
(laughing)

1021
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,200
- Imagine having like a hundred like,

1022
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,560
I have 200 dogs in my backyard.

1023
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
I have 200 dogs.

1024
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
Between 100 and 200.

1025
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
Yeah.

1026
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,560
It's because cops can't count past 100.

1027
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,560
They were like, "Eh, it's probably one, two, yeah, it's probably 100 or two."

1028
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,560
It was like, it was 20 dogs.

1029
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
99, 100, yeah, that's about 100.

1030
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
Wait, hold on, there's some more back here.

1031
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,560
Eh, one, two, skip a few again.

1032
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,560
Yeah, probably between 100 and 200.

1033
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,200
In Montana, Connor the Chimp bit a woman.

1034
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,360
The three other primates were just Timmy's owners.

1035
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,080
They were just the people.

1036
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,760
Sorry, Connor the Chimp.

1037
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,200
In Montana, Connor the Chimp bit a woman.

1038
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,680
Connor the Chimp.

1039
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,520
There are two...

1040
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,920
Gene Risotto, a real estate agent

1041
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,120
and a resident of Carbon County, Montana,

1042
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,000
raised two chimpanzees from birth.

1043
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,800
Risotto treated them like they were her own kids.

1044
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,120
The chimps, Connor and Kramer.

1045
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,120
Kramer the chimp!

1046
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,120
What was it?

1047
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,120
Come on!

1048
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,120
They had their own beds and a set of pajamas.

1049
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:00,120
Allegedly, a group of vandals approached Risotto's residence one evening in 2008,

1050
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,120
breaking the locks to the chimp's cages and setting them free.

1051
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,120
One chimp was rescued by Risotto's son, but the other wasn't as lucky.

1052
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,120
He attacked a woman.

1053
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,120
But though she wasn't badly injured, she later underwent a series of tests,

1054
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:15,120
as chimp bites can transmit diseases like herpes and rabies.

1055
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,120
But it doesn't even say the result of the test.

1056
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,960
Yeah, uh, ma'am, ma'am, we understood that, we understand that you spent over an hour

1057
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,200
and a half with a chimp being attacked in your bedroom.

1058
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,120
And you might have herpes, so we're gonna need to check you out.

1059
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,520
I like the idea, I think this is giving me the idea to keep two chimps in my house just

1060
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,320
in case there's ever a break-in.

1061
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,600
It's my self-defense, stand your ground chimps.

1062
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,680
You have to as soon as you set the chimps free, though.

1063
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,360
I have a button on the wall.

1064
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,000
I have a big red lever that I pull.

1065
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,200
So you're thinking you're...

1066
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,200
I'm gonna leave my attack chimps and they just immediately attack me.

1067
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,480
You're thinking of a chimpanzee as a weapon now.

1068
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,640
This is giving me the idea, I have to admit.

1069
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,400
Oh my god.

1070
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
That's a scary thought.

1071
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,400
I'm dark and twisted dude.

1072
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,240
Even if they do like, even if there's like, you know, massive gun control and background

1073
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,120
checks like a psycho could still get a hold of a chimp, at least in Las Vegas.

1074
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,120
Yeah.

1075
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:19,760
that chimp to a school. I'm posting a picture of my chimp on Instagram. Don't come to school

1076
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:33,440
tomorrow. Another in a series of horrifying mass chimpings across America. That's gonna

1077
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,440
happen a week from school's reopening. We are gonna speak that into existence. There's

1078
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:51,620
to

1079
00:53:51,620 --> 00:54:07,040
to

1080
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,320
There's no metal in a chimp. You could get a chimp at security.

1081
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,320
Exactly.

1082
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,320
You know?

1083
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,200
You could feed a chimp a gun and then...

1084
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,000
Oh that? Oh that? That's my little brother.

1085
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,440
Just buy him a ticket. It's a gun you can buy a plane ticket for.

1086
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,400
Oh my god, like a Vice article that's like terrifying.

1087
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:37,000
People have been 3D printing chimps at their home?

1088
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,680
We went to this 3D printing chimp fucking factory.

1089
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,480
(laughing)

1090
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,320
- Yeah.

1091
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,160
- And we smoked weed for fear.

1092
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,360
- What'd you say?

1093
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,180
- What was that?

1094
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,080
- Why would you need to buy silencers for your chimp?

1095
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,800
(laughing)

1096
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,720
- Yeah, chimp bump stock.

1097
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,960
(laughing)

1098
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,560
- A chimp bump stock is just a leash

1099
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,600
so you can control him in the right direction.

1100
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,240
- I take my chimp to the range

1101
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,080
And I just put like a big head of Pam Anderson, like a hundred feet away and just sicked him.

1102
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,240
Bunch of Tickle Me Elmo targets.

1103
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:26,800
It's like, it's like at the gun range, how they'll have like, they'll have like the target that is like a guy in like a burka and he's holding a woman hostage.

1104
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,440
But it's just like the same guy with the Tickle Me Elmo.

1105
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,440
[Laughter]

1106
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Um, this last one, I, this is probably my favorite.

1107
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
This is the one that made us pick the list.

1108
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,440
Annie Butor's family was tyrannized by their chimp Pepe.

1109
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,440
[Laughter]

1110
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
Pepe the chimp.

1111
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Pepe. Not even Pepe, but Pepe.

1112
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,440
[Laughter]

1113
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,440
In the 1960s, famous French singer Leo Ferret owned a pet chimpanzee Pepe,

1114
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,520
Pepe, whom Ferret even wrote a song about. But before the Ferret family took Pepe home

1115
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:11,960
to their chateau, Pepe's trainer warned, "I divorced three times because of my chimpanzees.

1116
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:19,640
Be careful." The warning turned out to be justified. Annie

1117
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,920
Butor, the daughter of the family, later wrote a memoir about the experience of living with

1118
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,100
the primate I need to pull this up I clicked on the link to of that the

1119
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,200
phrase later wrote a memoir is linked and I clicked on it and it took me to a

1120
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:42,880
news article with the headline tyrannical chimp ruins childhood what's

1121
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,640
I want I just want to find out the name of this memoir I'm trying to find I want

1122
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:54,040
hear what the song sounds like. We should have that as the music at the end.

1123
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,120
Just like fade out. Slowly fade out into that song. Pepe had her own bathroom, her

1124
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:04,480
toys, she dined with us, took siestas, drove the car on Leo's lap. In the evening

1125
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,720
before slipping on her pajamas she would politely drink her infusion before

1126
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,800
hugging us tenderly and very tight. Sorry guys I can't fucking play tonight I got

1127
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:18,860
feed my chimp is infusion. Pepe was described as a tyrant who removed guests

1128
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,880
of their clothes and valuables, bit those who upset him, and even took someone's

1129
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:33,080
baby onto the roof. Pepe, you mind watching the kid for a little bit?

1130
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:38,360
What happened was the baby took his tickle me Elmo. I would never trust any child

1131
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,120
with anything named Pepe. I want to read these two paragraphs to you from

1132
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,120
this news article that it linked to, this adds a new dimension to the story.

1133
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,440
Despite Pepe's increasingly unruly behavior, Ferre would strike off any friend who dared

1134
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,800
call their "second daughter" an animal, saying, "We will not tolerate anyone calling her a

1135
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
monkey.

1136
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,160
We are not taming Pepe, we are bringing her up."

1137
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,360
Covered with bites, the servants eventually fled the 16th century Chateau family home,

1138
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:10,520
which was given over to animals, including a 770-pound pig called Baba that would watch

1139
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:23,520
television and have its ears waxed with olive oil. What the fuck dude. A 770 pound pig.

1140
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:33,600
A pig called Baba. Baba and Pepe. What the fuck that's... I didn't know pigs could get this big dude.

1141
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,120
Yeah pigs get gigantic. I'm looking at him dude this is horrifying. In 1968

1142
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,320
for a himself could take no more of this quote mad life leaving the Chateau for

1143
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,760
Paris where he gained fame and fortune down leaving behind my chimp daughter

1144
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:57,080
for fame and fortune oh my god your chimps are holding you back from success

1145
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:05,120
yeah the last like two paragraphs are so good in his absence Pepe suffered a fall

1146
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,200
and refused to be approached. Eventually, Miss Boutor's mother asked a

1147
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,520
hunter neighbor to put the chimpanzee out of its misery by shooting it. Leo's

1148
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,400
requiem to the primate would be a song Pepe. The singer

1149
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:25,680
who died in 1993 blamed his wife for Pepe's death and they divorced.

1150
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,560
Miss Boutor, however, blamed him. "He was nothing but a chicken," she said.

1151
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,360
Wait, did she blame Leo or Pepe?

1152
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,360
I don't know.

1153
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,640
I assume Leo.

1154
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,200
Oh yeah, Pepe was a girl.

1155
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Yes.

1156
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Wow.

1157
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,560
This is my new favorite, this is one of my new favorite chimp stories I think.

1158
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,880
Yeah, that's up there dude.

1159
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,600
That might overtake Travis.

1160
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,520
Yeah, I think Pepe is probably better than Travis.

1161
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:57,640
Oh my god, wait, the monkey trainer who said I divorced three times because of my chimpanzees

1162
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,400
be careful also said this which is a really this is a good like just um

1163
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,760
mnemonic to keep in your head okay more than any other animal a chimpanzee must

1164
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:12,240
know who is the master otherwise you're heading for disaster

1165
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,040
I love when I have to come up with a mnemonic to...

1166
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,040
When the...

1167
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,040
When it's bad, it's not being a master, that's right.

1168
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,040
When taking care of my monkey, a tickle me Elmo they find funky.

1169
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:38,540
When Pepe took the baby to the roof for Ray waved a toy pistol at it and shouted, "Daddy's

1170
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:44,160
not happy, daddy's going to shoot!"

1171
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
This story is insane.

1172
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,160
Oh my god.

1173
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,160
Oh my god, dude.

1174
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:53,640
The name of the memoir is called "How Could I Forget?"

1175
01:00:53,640 --> 01:01:03,160
How could I forget I owned a fucking chimp and my husband flashed a gun at it?

1176
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,920
It's called a toy gun. He didn't even have the guts. The chimp knows what a

1177
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,560
gun is to the point where they can just use a toy gun. Wait it's not called that.

1178
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,200
what the heck it just it says what is it called it says if she said a million

1179
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:27,640
little roses what is I can't find the name of the book well I found this

1180
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:34,760
gigantic 1600 pound pig wins King of pigs title in China oh no it is it's called

1181
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,560
how would you like me to forget if you if you translate it from French into

1182
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:45,040
English. How would you like me? How would you like me to forget? How could you

1183
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:51,160
forget? How could you forget? Fuck dude that is so good. I might have to buy this

1184
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,000
book to be honest. Yeah get it just that's just a good conversation piece.

1185
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,120
Yeah. Never read the book just keep it there so when people ask because it's a

1186
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:03,680
vague enough title. Apparently this this this singer guy is very famous in France

1187
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,240
because all the reviews are like "Wow I love Leo Ferret but I never knew any of

1188
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:16,160
this about him. He kind of looks like a monkey. Yeah. He has monkey attributes for

1189
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,240
sure. Maybe that's why they got along so well. Maybe. Maybe he thought he was a

1190
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:29,680
monkey. Yeah. Oh and he was a socialist. Wow. Wow. That's actually, okay, that's

1191
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:36,480
actually awesome. All right. All right. I think that wraps it up. Yeah, I think that does it.

1192
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,000
Ryan, you got anything to tell people about?

1193
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
No, that's it, just me.

1194
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Just Ryan.

1195
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Follow Ryan on Twitter @smilingobject.

1196
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Hi, thanks for having me on.

1197
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Of course, dude.

1198
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Of course.

1199
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Since we have to, we should just mention the Gun City thing.

1200
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
If you subscribe to the $10 Patreon tier, we have a new D&D campaign that we just started.

1201
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
We're going to try to do episodes every two weeks, exclusive to the $10 tier.

1202
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,360
$10 tier, it's very good.

1203
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,040
I think it's probably one of the best things

1204
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,760
that we've done so far.

1205
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,160
I highly recommend it.

1206
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,200
- Check it out, bitch.

1207
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,480
- Yeah.

1208
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,800
- Check it, bitch.

1209
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,920
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1211
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,800

1212
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,720
- Appreciate that.

1213
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,440
- All right, all right.

1214
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,280
- All right, guys. - Bye-bye.

1215
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,100
- Bye-bye. - Love Ryan

1216
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:23,940
and both your accounts, bye. - Thanks, everyone.

1217
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,780
- Bye now.
