[music]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Striking a deal with a notorious gangster was not something we anticipated, but

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've learned to expect the unexpected with these guys.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But knowing that if Mary Kate Cabrera needed some money from Shiny Andrew,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
you know, and then from that we can get the gold bullets we needed from Goldbeard,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
there's too many guys involved in this, I think, but, you know.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,360
That was kind of an opportunity we couldn't pass up.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,880
I just hope mommy wouldn't welch on her bet and leave us out to dry.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,720
Especially since she knows what we're up to.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,920
Hopefully she can gather some intel for us too on Fatima.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,320
Either way, next stop was Room Street. That's right.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,520
That's four walls, four times the Wall Street. That's where Shiny Andrew is.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,080
And before we keep going,

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:10,080
a

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,440
Love Slime that Barry G can use to build a specific bomb to blow up the vault, and Golden Bullets,

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,880
which is what we're on right now, that Travis Ocelot can use to disable a security system

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,960
in the facility.

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,640
So you guys... what?

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,280
Sure.

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,480
So you're gonna need... sorry let me just pull it up again.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Don't repeat it.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Close it out.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
He's doing his thing.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,480
He's doing his funny after the intro joke.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,840
Yeah, I'm waiting for the end.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,520
So you guys are at our, our, our, I mean like you guys can decide where you are.

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
You guys were basically gambling.

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,440
We're inside the vault.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm in heaven.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Yeah.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,280
Actually I am too.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
That sounds awesome.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm in hell just to see.

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,920
Hell is heaven for boys so I am also there.

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,200
Well hell's your home, Caleb.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,360
Okay then I'm at home.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
You're a devil. Yeah, cranking your hog.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Nope.

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Don't shoo directly into the mic.

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
I completely forgot.

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
You are literally a monkey.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
You're just a monkey with eyes.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
That's all you are.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Monkeys have eyes anyway.

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
What are you talking about eyes?

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm saying you have them.

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Monkeys don't have eyes, you idiot.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
See no evil.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
It's a whole thing.

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Are you actually in a poop?

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
I think he's actually eating poop.

52
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Are you actually eating poop?

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
What is that?

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Holy shit, that does look like doo doo.

55
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Oh, he's smearing it on his face.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
It's an oatmeal raisin cookie.

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
That's nasty.

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
We can see what it is.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
It's actually oatmeal raisinette.

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Alright, so Patrick Yoda is in the casino bathroom eating poop.

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Yeah.

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Yeah, we're still at the casino.

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
So you're still at the casino

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:16,800
the

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:29,320
the

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:49,120
a

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:04:01,560
the

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,000
And I'm throwing up the poop and then putting the throw up in my mouth too?

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,480
That's what I was about to say, let's roll for that.

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,880
I think you're gonna get sepsis or something.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,200
17, deception.

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,680
So I'm eating 1 million poops and I'm throwing up the poops and then eating the throw up that's made out of poop.

73
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,600
And yeah, so if you guys want to start making your way to room street you can.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,160
I mean that's just a matter of kind of deciding you want to do that.

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Otherwise you guys are free to gamble or mingle or talk to other

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,440
Excuse me folks here. I think I had my personally I had my fill of gambling

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, if there may be I I think I'm good with gambling

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,140
But before we head out I do want to ask is there maybe like you know

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,960
How in the Pokemon games you go to the slots and then you can buy a rare Pokemon with you in?

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
And I maybe buy a Pokemon

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,960
Wait, did we win any money? I want a lot of money at the end of the really one. Yeah, I

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I win any money? I just kept gambling for a little bit. I won all of your money from Pig.

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,840
I think we lost a lot of money and Cam won it. Yeah, I had like 400 and something.

86
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,840

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,040
You can get two abras and they only have teleport.

93

Yeah. OK, I have Pokemon.

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,360
I know you have two abras.

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm never going to use them.

96
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,080
I just want my character to have Pokemon.

97
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,640
Yeah, you have two abras and they can teleport.

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,080
Oh, that's because I'm the teleporter guy.

99
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,320
This is cool. OK. Yeah.

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320

the

107
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:07,960
and yeah, Room Street is notable because sort of similar to Wall Street, except it's rooms.

108
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:16,960
And so it's just lined with rooms, not buildings, not houses, but 10 by 10 sort of just rooms that are standalone.

109
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,960
And you see traders moving in and out, making crazy quantum crypto trades.

110
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:37,320
the

111
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:49,760
the

112
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Wait, are there NFTs here?

Oh my god.

115
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,760

I spent all of their money on Pokemon.

128
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Yeah, you don't have any money for NFTs in that case.

129
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Can I trade one of the Pokemon for an NFT?

130
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
You'd have to talk to somebody about that.

131
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Okay, I want to talk to somebody about that.

132
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Okay. Yeah, so who do you want to talk to?

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,760
They're all sort of running around through the streets and through to the different rooms and coming out of other doors.

135
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Are there any, do I see any board apes on display?

Are any of them on display?

138
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,760
No, no due to legal reasons.

175
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,720
insistent and confident I'll let you roll a persuasion check. Ted okay he's like look I

176
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,160
I don't know if I can help you with that. I just just told him, let me I'll be I'll be right back.

177
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,120
And he starts to walk away.

178
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,320
Was he asking the board eight guy about his?

179
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,200
He's going to go. He's going to go.

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,700
He's going to go check to see if there's some mistake at like a department

181
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,560
or he might just be calling security.

182
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
Tell me one thing about this area.

183
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,760
Do these rooms have like like.

184
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,360
The do any of them have like a roof, like is it all?

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,720
Oh, no, like like cubicle style. OK.

186
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,760
Yeah, it's sort of like, yeah, it's like the Sims.

187
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,860
You're looking down.

188
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,100
OK, OK, so I'm going to can I like crawl up

189
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,660
onto like one of the walls and see if I can get kind of a better view

190
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,000
of all of them?

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,160
Yeah, absolutely. You can.

192
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,960
OK, I'm going to do that and do an investigation.

193
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,860
I would say, yeah, I would say.

194
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,820
Yeah, I mean, role athletics, but it's not it's not like a hard check

195
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,100
to like just climb up there.

196
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,020
Yeah, I mean, 22.

197
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,560
Okay, so then I backflip up there.

198
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,140
Yeah, you backflip up there and you come.

199
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,660
Yeah.

200
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,980
Um, and yeah, and you're looking over everything.

201
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,580
Um, and I would say in that case, roll, um, say, yeah,

202
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,460
investigation, I think, cause it's sort of like you're really

203
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,140
scanning deeply everything and then maybe perception too.

204
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,980
Um, I'll roll both.

205
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,220
See if you notice as well.

206
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,720
Yeah.

207
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,340
All right.

208
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,840
Cool.

209
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,740
Not ideal.

210
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,500
12 on investigation, five on perception.

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Um, you do get the sense, at least with that 12 on

212
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:25,580
the

213
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:40,620
the

214
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,480
and that uh... that area will probably

215
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,500
more likely yield shiny andrew than

216
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,000
hanging around here

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,320
uh... though obviously

218
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,560
it's up to you what you want to do with that information but that's what you

219
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,320
notice

220
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,180
okay

221
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
uh...

222
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,820
let me check something

223
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,640
okay uh...

224
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,480
if i wanted to

225
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,080
say

226
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,380
run through

227
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:13,000
Every single wall like the Kool-Aid man on the way to this location. What would I want to roll?

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,900
hypothetically a couple things so

229
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,640
One like, you know, and I will of course make this clear to you because you would know

230
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,920
You know standing on top of one of the rooms is already a bit of a social faux pas

231
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:36,040
Crashing the social faux pas to crash through the walls same a little bit just a little bit and just a smidge -

232
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:52,920
to

233
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:11,640
and

234
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:29,080
and

235
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,180
I perceived and investigated.

236
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,980
Yes, you patches.

237
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,580
Can you describe what's in this NFT room for me?

238
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,080
In this NFT area, at least you see like on all these room,

239
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,880
the room that everyone's in.

240
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,080
Nobody's in a room like you guys are on the street

241
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,680
in the street, in the area of the city

242
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,280
where there are these rooms.

243
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,780
We were in a room.

244
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,280
No, no, no.

245
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,780
There's just like a bunch of rooms that line the street.

246
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,680
That's what room street is.

247
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,180
But you're on like a street in the city.

248
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,280
And if you peel out of room street, this area of the city,

249
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,080
you go back to gun city proper, like normal buildings and and things and geography.

250
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,020
But Caleb climbed a room and then looked over and saw

251
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,320
could see beyond down the.

252
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,680
The street.

253
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,920
So is there just like an NFT plugged in somewhere?

254
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
What do you mean you have to keep plugging them?

255
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,580
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

256
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,080
How do you think they work, Pat?

257
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,780
Well, this is a game about the future.

258
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,980
So you think they'd get worse in the future?

259
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,880
Yes.

260
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
They'd get more analog.

261
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
What does it do when you plug it in?

262
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,080
Well, it's like you're hanging it like it's a neon sign, basically.

263
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Okay, so that's your idea of what happens when you plug it in.

264
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I thought...

265
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,980
Okay.

266
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,480
Okay.

267
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:03,120
He said room street and I thought that we were just in a bunch of rooms.

268
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
Why does that make it mean that you plug in NFTs?

269
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,440
I don't, okay, I don't remember where I was going with this.

270
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,760
It's so obvious that Caleb figured out where to go and we have to now find the NFT that's

271
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
plugged into something.

272
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,880
We don't have to find it.

273
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
Is there one that's plugged in maybe all the others are

274
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,640
Let him get some plugged in nft. It's fine

275
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:35,200
Also, also I want to say we can leave past the fence. I did I I was gonna just when I was gonna describe the nft space

276
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,920
Uh, you know, it's like each of us

277
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,420
Not necessarily but each of these rooms do have like neon signs advertising

278
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,720
the nft

279
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
So we could have thought a sign was an NFT.

280
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,440
Pat thinks the sign is the NFT and he takes that.

281
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,040
It's a counterintuitive thing where people can take pictures and steal the image of the sign.

282
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,720
Maybe it's a sign that says NFT.

283
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,680
Well, no, there's like one, the board eight rooms.

284
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,640
Maybe there's one sign that says NFT that Pat can take.

285
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,560
There is, I saw it.

286
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:06,880
Please.

287
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,280
I see that sign right there, that big glowing green sign.

288
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,320
Look, I feel like I'm...

289
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,680
It's an NFT.

290
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,880
This is a DM who's being pressured and it worked.

291
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Yeah, there's an NFT sign plugged in.

292
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Our first NFT!

293
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Yeah.

294
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
It just says NFT.

295
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Patrick Yoda, do you want that sign?

296
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Do you think it's an ice cream bar?

297
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Ice cream bar?

298
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
I'm giving him the money to buy it.

299
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Like a Paris.

300
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Neapolitan frozen treat.

301
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
[Laughter]

302
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,880
*laughter*

303
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,380
yep

304
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,880
he's able to think of the word neapolitan

305
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
*laughter*

306
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
i can think of all the flavors

307
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
yeah, that's all he does

308
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
that's not an issue for him

309
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
but how much does it cost? i'm giving him his allowance

310
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
there's no way he can afford it

311
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
how much? it's a sign!

312
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
it's a sign

313
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
how much could a sign cost?

314
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
ten dollars?

315
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:25,960
the

316
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,160
I think a big sense of integrity to the story just like vague enough on the street

317
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,180
There's a glass bottle and I pick it up and I just chuck it at the sign

318
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,280
Okay guard comes over and

319
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,000
To go to ice cream, bah. Oh

320
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Sorry, that's my son

321
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,480
Yeah, I take care of him. I've been trying no one very big mistake if you can tell

322
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:06,920
the

323
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
to the crypto exchange. Cool. Yeah.

324
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Let's head over to the crypto exchange.

325
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
You see here, you know, the NFTs,

326
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
they never really totally

327
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
took off, but the

328
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
crypto exchange, I mean, this is

329
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
a bigger, more vibrant

330
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
part of Gun City's economy.

331
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Quantum crypto trading

332
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
is the, like,

333
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
one of the few ways to generate any

334
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
new kind of capital.

335
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
By

336
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
essentially creating and

337
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:52,920
and

338
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,720
I'll say actually all of you roll roll perception checks here

339
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:06,040
13 I got a crit one you have a nine perception or some shit right? I'm an a very good

340
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,720
I got a 19. Mm-hmm. Okay, we got that and well, I mean it makes sense

341
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,920
Should I roll with disadvantage every with every no now that I'm brain damage, er

342
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,640
Yeah, no

343
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,320
Why not? I think you have to roll a d4 for your skill checks instead of a d20

344
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,380
I would say what we could do since I'm getting I think I'm getting reasonable pushback since we decided it's canon that he has brain damage

345
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,640
Is we just subtract?

346
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,060
Let's subtract any bonuses he gets instead of adding them to any role he does

347
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,240
So all this stuff you're normally good at a brain damage. No

348
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,920
Let's do the ice cream bar. I have to eat an ice cream bar

349

353
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,960
emitting from one of the guys

354
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,560
Like it's like you see it passing through it's like when people say when people move in front of the Sun

355
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,220
You know like like people when things move in front of the Sun

So I'm trying to just- Yeah, it's like a public place, so- Yeah, I'm trying to just co- I'm

391
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,680

392
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,160
group so if he bolts I can maybe grab him.

393
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,880
Okay, sounds good.

394
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,280
I mean, I think you probably- Just from the other side.

395
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,240
Have enough Techno Slime still to do another disguise.

396
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:57,160
the

397
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,600
the

398
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
the

399
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
the

400
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
the

401
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
the

402
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
the

403
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
the

404
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,580
Okay, and uh, yeah, so you you walk up to him so shiny Andrew you see him like flittering about yes

405
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,720
It's like he's bright like he's hard to like make out his figure. He's so

406
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,280
shiny and

407
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
He started to teach you guys. Oh

408
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,380
What can I do you for?

409
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,780
I have reason to believe that your life is in danger and I've been sent here to protect you. What are your weaknesses?

410
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Fucking cool.

411
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Roll deception with advantage.

412
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
You always get advantage on deception.

413
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
You are an ocelot.

414
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
You are the animal.

415
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Let's try again.

416
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
13, okay.

417
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Alright, hold on.

418
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Gotta roll his insight against that.

419
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
This man has trust issues.

420
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
For real. Because he had a bad breakout.

421
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
And yeah, I mean,

422
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
He sees you, you're coming at him, you have like two golden guns.

423
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Like, you know, you look pretty intimidating and he says, "Oh god,

424
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:30,240
it's finally happening then. Who sent you? Who sent you here? Thank you. Who sent you?"

425
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,120
It's not important. It will be later, but not right now.

426
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,760
Right now you have to tell me what all of your physical weaknesses are.

427
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
*laughter*

428
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Uh, well, okay, alright, well, uh,

429
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
I'm not very...

430
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,760
I'm not particularly strong, I'm rather fast.

431
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Um...

432
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,760
I can take a punch, pretty okay.

433
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
But, uh...

434
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Uh, not that well really compared to other folks, I think.

435
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Let's put it to the test.

436
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Okay.

437
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Oh, um...

438
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
We gotta test you to protect you.

439
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Okay, um...

440
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,760
This is my cadre of bodyguards.

441
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:14,600
and they're really good at testing weaknesses. My name is Derek Vasquez.

442
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,960
I scream bye. And I'm gonna punch you in the face.

443
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,560
I start waving my arms and I go, and I go, "There, there he is! I'm the assassin! I hope

444
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,080
you guys don't take him to a secure location where I can't get to him!" And I'm like, I'm

445
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm trying to like walking towards him really scary.

446
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Oh God!

447
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,080
We need to take you to a secure location.

448
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
No don't do that!

449
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,080
And uh, he freaks out.

450
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Um, and all of you roll a Constitution saving throw.

451
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
Oh God.

452
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Oh God.

453
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
Oh cripes.

454
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
How do I do that?

455
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
What's that?

456
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
How do I do that?

457
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Far left.

458
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,080
In the far left in that little, there's a little box that says saving throw.

459
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,680
Yeah, yeah.

460
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,520
OK, wait, there's a box that says

461
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,420
see if there's on the bottom.

462
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,480
Yeah, you say nice.

463
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,920
And then you, Barry G.

464
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,820
I'm sitting here smiling.

465
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,320
What?

466
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,580
Oh, he is literally he's just sitting here smiling.

467
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,480
He's not fucking click on it.

468
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,420
How how can you not find it?

469
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,660
I don't know what it is.

470
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,420
It's the font.

471
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,460
It's on the left.

472
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,220
It's all the way on the left.

473
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,020
They're like rectangles on the far left.

474
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,720
It, there's strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and courage.

475
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,020
Then you press the thing that says constitution.

476
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,560
And you'll see saving throws on the bottom of the box.

477
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,060
Nice.

478
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,260
Um, cool.

479
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,420
Uh, wow.

480
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,920
Okay.

481
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,520
Everybody, except for Travis Ocelot.

482
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,260
Let's go.

483
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:06,580
Suddenly they see shiny Andrew explode with light as he freaks the fuck out.

484
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:18,180
And all of you, the rest of you take a nice walk, just fucking kidding, you take 12 damage.

485
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,180
What the fuck?

486
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,300
We're here to protect this asshole?

487
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,540
We're pretending we're here to protect him?

488
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:52,020
and

489
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,620
Don't forget my sunglasses.

490
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,120
He's got sunglasses like counterstrike.

491
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,020
Yes, yes, exactly.

492
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,620
But you see, shiny, he just does that.

493
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,020
I mean, you're he's like, oh, he's freaking out

494
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,020
and starting to back away from the assassin.

495
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,320
He's like, where do I go?

496
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,820
Help me. He's like imploring you, Travis. OK.

497
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,120
I put my human arm around him

498
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,920
and I usher him out of- we're in a room right now?

499
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,600
You're still on the street, you caught him on the street.

500
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,080
Oh, I caught him on the street. Alright, I- yeah, then I grab him by the scruff of his neck

501
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:39,960
with my chimp arm and I throw him over the opening of a room, the nearest room,

502
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,720
because there's no roof, right?

503
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,280
Yeah.

504
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,400
So I overhand throw him into the nearest room and then I foster that room Kool-Aid Man.

505
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,520
Roll a strength throw.

506
00:32:48,520 --> 00:33:01,460
the

507
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:14,300
the

508
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:26,780
just

509
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:39,220
the

510
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:59,340
the

511
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,260
you're still you're blind in this weird way where you can only see him but

512
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,580
everything else is light all right but Travis Asai you know what it looks like

513
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,500
when you have somebody is putty in your hands mm-hmm mm-hmm

514
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,860
okay I tell him that he has to cluck like a rooster

515
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,420
Click click click click!

516
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Oh, come on, Badger.

517
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Click click!

518
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

519
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
There we go. Much better.

520
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,420
Alright, I tell him that he needs to give me

521
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
as many gold bullets as he has

522
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,420
and then he will be safe

523
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
from the assassin.

524
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
I don't have gold bullets!

525
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,420
I ask him to tell me where he thinks

526
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
they might be.

527
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
So you would know that Goldbeard

528
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,420
has the gold bullets.

529
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,420
What am I talking to this guy for?

530
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,080
We have to scare this guy because he owes money.

531
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
You mean to giving him money.

532
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

533
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Forget I said that.

534
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
He's so confused.

535
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Alright, there's another way for you to be safe.

536
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Okay, anything.

537
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Uh...

538
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
This makes so much fucking sense, dude.

539
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Pash, who's the guy he owes money to?

540
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Yeah, sure.

541
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
He owes money to Mary Kay Cabrera.

542
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Right.

543
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,880
Alright, I asked him if he's heard of Mary K. Cabrera.

544
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,160
Um... uh...

545
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,200
Uh... yeah, if you're here to protect me, then...

546
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,640
Yeah.

547
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,280
Yeah, I've heard of her.

548
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,680
Alright, well, she's gonna kill he...

549
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,180
Who?

550
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,000
The gender is unimportant to the DM.

551
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,520
Never decided.

552
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,680
Okay, Patches, you're a girl.

553
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,020
Yeah.

554
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,520
Aww.

555
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,260
All right, well you have to pay your debt you owe a lot of money you have to give it all to me right now and I will

556
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,500
Can't I can't I don't have the money now. I don't have the money. I can't

557
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:00,420
You can call I call my friends in here because I don't know what to do i'm still pretty blind

558
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,540
and i'm walking around and I have i've

559
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:11,860
I'm, like reaching out like this and doing this I have stuck all of my fingers like into and above

560
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,620
uh... sullivan's like eyelids and like in his mouth and his nose and his ears

561
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,420
and i'm holding him like a five finger bowling ball

562
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,300
oh i can't see a goddamn thing holy shit

563
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:32,060

564
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,940
oh i must be holding some kind of instrument

565
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,860
this is making such a beautiful sound

566
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,660
And then I play hot cross buns.

567
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,860
Reaps.

568
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,860
You call the rest of them in there.

570
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,760
They're just blindly using a solvent as an accordion.

571
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,320
He's kind of he's kind of getting scared.

572
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,060
He's like, OK, OK, I don't I don't come in because I don't want to scare him again

573
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,460
because I'm the assassin.

574
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,120
Yes, you are.

575
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,460
I mean, what can I?

576
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,260
All right, I can get the money, I can get the money, I just.

577
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:21,580
to

578
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:27,140
that I'm verified to trade quantum crypto which was recently installed because

579
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,940
people were well yeah I don't have to go through the whole thing but yeah how

580
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,540
about you give us that and we'll we'll figure out the rest my credentials yeah

581
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,980
my credentials shut up or I'll fucking kill you and give me the thing you guys

582
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,980
aren't here to protect me?

583
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
Yes we are.

584
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
I have a stroke on the top of his head.

585
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,980
The quantum credentials

586
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,980
are putting you in so much danger

587
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,980
because so many people want it.

588
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,980
I need the quantum credentials

589
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
if he hears that in the distance.

590
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
We're going to kill anybody

591
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
who has quantum credentials

592
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
but it's far enough away that it's not scary.

593
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
We're going to borrow them and then you can take them back

594
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
whenever you need them.

595
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,980
We're going to bolster them with many validator nodes

596
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,340
and it actually makes your money safer and more valuable.

597
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
- I'm a terrible deception.

598
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,340
With advantage as always.

599
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,920
This made Pearson Expert liar.

600
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,920
- Let's go!

601
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
- Oh my god.

602
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
- Okay.

603
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Alright, okay. I can't really, uh...

604
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
I can't really part with them.

605
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
But I can come with you.

606
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,920
You can use them whenever you want.

607
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Just call me.

608
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,160
Just just just keep that guy away from me

609
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,880
How can why can't you play with them I just don't want to see you again

610
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,460
Are you this are you inventory sized

611
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,560
He is tiny andrew

612
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,600
I I I can try I can try

613
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,280
What do you need me to do to fit into this?

614
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,520
Inventory

615
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
I hold out my inventory

616
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
*laughter*

617
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Okay.

618
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,000
And I say, "If you can fit in this, then we won't have to take the credentials."

619
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,240
Um, I mean, I guess he's gonna try.

620
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,520
He is gonna try.

621
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
He fails.

622
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Like, he can't do it.

623
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Um, he says-

624
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,800
Well, buddy, I'm gonna have to saw your head off.

625
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,920
Yeah, saw his legs off.

626
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
And your legs, too.

627
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,520
'Cause this guy's after your head and your legs.

628
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
*laughter*

629
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
So we gotta protect him.

630
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Okay.

631
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:57,240
a

632
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,240
who you are in gun city but you could get them...

633
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
He can physically part with them though, yes.

634
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
He could part with them.

635
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,240
How do you have to log into your crypto account? What is the authentication?

636
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,240
It is biometric also.

637
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Okay, what part of your body has to be scanned?

638
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:30,880
well really any part can be scanned but you just got to bring me to the right

639
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:42,840
are you gonna try you try to cut his head off I'm going to cut his head off

640
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,080
okay we're gonna roll we're gonna that person's gonna be mad at us we're not

641
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,720
gonna be a person who we're trying to scare him so that we but we need the

642
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,320
Quantum credentials too, right?

643
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,440
Yeah. Why don't you just take his arm?

644
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,280
Cause I need his head.

645
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,120
Did he say any part of his body?

646
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,840
So I just chose his head at random.

647
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,800
Other person's going to kill us.

648
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,000
What if we take his leg?

649
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,040
Ever? I take his leg. Okay. I take everything.

650
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,800
But what about his arms and legs?

651
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,760
You choose.

652
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,440
We're gonna roll initiative, because you are officially starting a fight with this guy.

653
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,840
Why can't I, okay, what if I sneakily just very, like he doesn't even notice, just cut

654
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
his thumb off?

655
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,400
This is, I don't know how you're gonna- Hey, look that way!

656
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,360
You should just convince him to give us his- Wait, so-

657
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,000
For him to give us his thumb.

658
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,600
Even if he gave us the credentials- Okay, yeah, you can convince him for that

659
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
too, it's true.

660
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Okay.

661
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Hey!

662
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
There's our- Hey!

663
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,240
*laughter*

664
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,960
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

665
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,600
*laughter*

666
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
What if...

667
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I... you gave me your thumb?

668
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
*laughter*

669
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
That's the worst way to convince him, pal.

670
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
*laughter*

671
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
He's saying it's a crazy idea.

672
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
*laughter*

673
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,600
'Cause that's a- it kinda sets him up- 'cause otherwise it's shocking.

674
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,100
But, with that kinda preface, he gets it.

675
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,100
you know?

676
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,360
So wouldn't that be crazy?

677
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,940
The preface you use for like, "Hey, why don't we split this meal?"

678
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,580
How about I split this thumb off of your hand?

679
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,900
It's gonna help make this go down easier.

680
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
So what does he say, Mr. DM?

681
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,220
I love killing guys with two thumbs!

682
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,540
See, you don't want to keep that thumb.

683
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,180
Roll persuasion.

684
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,700
Which normally this would not even work at all, but...

685
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,860
I'm tracking this guy down by the scent of his thumb.

686
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,340
I think that sounds like advantage in the other room.

687
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,900
I'll find where he is as long as he doesn't go somewhere different than his body.

688
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,100
It is technically assistance, which is often accompanied by advantage.

689
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Crit.

690
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,100
Holy shit.

691
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Okay.

692
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Baaaam.

693
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,580
Alright, I immediately shoot his thumb off.

694
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Triple ricochet.

695
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:05,860
You see like a glimmer in his eye of like, "I'm okay with this."

696
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,860
And you just...

697
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,860
Just immediately.

698
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:14,860
the

699
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,100
He shines bright again.

700
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,380
Uh, everyone roll a constitution saving throw.

701
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,420
Except me.

702
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,500
Except you.

703
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:23,860
Yes.

704
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,580
I got a crew.

705
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,820
I have to roll a constitution.

706
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,860
Well, I'm like in the corner of the room, like peeing.

707
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,380
He is.

708
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,540
Don't care where you are.

709
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,260
Actually I do care, but you are in the room, which means you have to roll a

710
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:36,820
constitution.

711
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,900
I got a five.

712
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,340
I'm just behind this shit right now.

713
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,900
Looking at the corner of the wall.

714
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,340
You immediately start peeing into your mouth the second you go blind.

715
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:46,840
Like...

716
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,220
*gurgling*

717
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,060
Like you could've just not moved and been fine.

718
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,340
Yeah, I mean you take...

719
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,420
You and, uh, uh, Barry E take another seven...

720
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,140
...damage.

721
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,340
Um...

722
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,980
But he is... his thumb is off.

723
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,980
You have his bright and shiny thumb.

724
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,060
Um...

725
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,340
Uh, I mean he's like...

726
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,020
He's, uh, he's like, "Okay!"

727
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:24,460
the

728
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,460
*laughter*

729
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,460
What if you also gave us-

730
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,460
'cause you didn't want that thumb, right?

731
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,460
That was like, nothing.

732
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,460
*laughter*

733
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,460
That was nothing.

734
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,460
So what if now you also gave us

735
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,460
all the money that you owe?

736
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,460
We already have access

737
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,460
to all this money, right?

738
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,460
Yeah.

739
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,460
Oh wait, is there more money outside of your crypto wallet?

740
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,460
Uh, well...

741
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:59,460
I, uh, I'm starting to think this is, you know, I've been patient.

742
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,160
I've been good.

743
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,060
Are you suspicious of us right now?

744
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,740
I'm so evil.

745
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,460
I need to find those bodyguards who seem so cool and good and helpful.

746
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,460
That's right.

747
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,180
Things are not going to go well for you unless you tell us where all the money that you have

748
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,180
is.

749
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:21,280
I'm pacing back and forth outside the room, like I should be able to see them, but I'm

750
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,380
just walking back and forth like I'm going off one side like coming back to

751
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:39,820
the other side of like a teacher in a flash game yeah exactly yeah he's like

00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,820

I woke up. I walk over to shiny Andrew and I pick him up

763
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,500
You don't want to mess with him. He's a loco

764
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,060
bar ice cream bar

765
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,300
Stop the keys to everything that you have a key for

766
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,720
Give us that your key ring now. I smell

767
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:52,700
Trust me that guy's like he loves smelling keys the smell of keys might make me turn degrees to the left

768
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,780
Okay, 45 feet tall. It's what he does

769
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,380
All right

770
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,380
shiny Andrew

771
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:09,500
We're rolling initiative shiny Andrew is now going to deliberately trigger his light his light thing. Okay. I'm running away instantly, okay

772
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:20,600
As you rolled stealth he got a ten that doesn't I don't know how that helps you wait am I holding shiny Andrew

773
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,780
Yeah, you are

774
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,300
What what makes what emits his light? I?

775
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:32,280
Mean his whole body just like erupts in life. I put him in my shirt. I close my eyes. I

776
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,920
Put shiny on my shirt, dude. You're gonna fucking die

777
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,200
Let's move though. Yeah, let's let's roll

778
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:48,260
No, I'm not jumping on the grenade. I'm putting him under my shirt. Yeah, but you're gonna you're gonna get the full

779
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,220
Never mind. It's a good idea

780
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,700
The literal yeah

781
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,200
(laughing)

782
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,860
- Okay, okay.

783
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,340
- You're right, Pat, you're not jumping on a grenade.

784
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,380
- No, I'm not.

785
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,200
I'm putting a guy in my shirt.

786
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,560
- Yeah, no, I'm agreeing with you.

787
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,400
- Okay.

788
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:13,400
So in this instance, I mean, he is,

789
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,920
let's do this, Pat.

790
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,800
If you're as like kind of reacting to this,

791
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,020
let's have you roll.

792
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,280
I would consider this just sort of a,

793
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:39,560
is

794
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:52,680
actually

795
00:48:52,680 --> 00:49:07,680
try

796
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:22,660
to

797
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:40,660
that

798
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:53,940
that

799
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,980
that you're like in combat but like you know to establish what's going on. I rolled a dirty

800
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:07,660
20 on initiative. Let's fucking go dude, very cool. Hell yes. Wow. I like that. I like that

801
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:16,660
genuinely I'm sorry. Very cool Pat. No, aw. No Pat I do think it's cool. I thought we

802
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,420
were all rolling initiative. You all, we are. I thought we were, I thought I was just telling

803
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,420
you guys what happened.

804
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,860
That's totally fair.

805
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,660
OK, and then.

806
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,260
Here's your Dex is higher than his, so you're going to go before him.

807
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:38,060
And then we got Barry Gee with the 12 and then we got blow

808
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,760
tossed with the surprisingly low seven.

809
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,160
I feel like you always go first.

810
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,060
I thought I'd switch it up this time.

811
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,020
Yeah, I felt like doing something different.

812
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,060
Yeah, you're always doing something different, buddy.

813
00:50:51,060 --> 00:51:03,420
the

814
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,420
I got to roll twice.

815
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,980
Not you though Cam, good call.

816
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,980
Okay.

817
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,980
I got a grit.

818
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Yes.

819
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,980
Okay.

820
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
Kill...

821
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Alright, cool.

822
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:20,500
Barry Gee and Ray William Johnson are okay.

823
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
Sorry to you three.

824
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,660
I know that was better, Pat, but it wasn't good enough.

825
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:30,500
You take an 11 damage Ocelot and Patrick Yoda.

826
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:45,580
the

827
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,580
I am gay.

828
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
Yeah, you are Patrick.

829
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,580
Juvio's gay!

830
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,580
Juvio's gay! He just came out.

831
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,580
I wasn't talking.

832
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,580
I was talking.

833
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,580
I was talking.

834
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,580
Okay.

835
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,580
I kill myself.

836
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,580
I was not paying attention.

837
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
I was talking to my boyfriend.

838
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,580
Wait, say how much damage I took.

839
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,580
I talked over you. I didn't hear.

840
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:23,820
damage. Oh okay so I have two health points left. Yeah but it is your turn you go first.

841
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:29,980
He sort of wriggles his way out of your shirt after you pop him in there but that didn't help

842
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:37,740
mitigate damage. Yeah I'm pissed off that one he did not have any ice cream bars

843
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,740
and two, um, that I don't have an ice cream bar.

844
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,740
So I'd fucking, I just, I just smack him.

845
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,300
That's a good idea. I'm gonna hit him with the hoagie.

846
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,060
This is a good idea. This is a good idea.

847
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:59,220
Okay. Uh, yeah, twelve doesn't hit, but you have another attack.

848
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,900
Don't kill him. Whatever you do, don't kill him.

849
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,020
Um...

850
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
I was gonna try and kill him.

851
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,020
*laughter*

852
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,020
Gotta get his keys for all of his belongings.

853
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,020
Yeah.

854
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,020
And all his keys are probably dangling on his side.

855
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,020
What if I hit...

856
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,020
What if in my stupor

857
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:25,020
I hit his pockets really hard

858
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,020
and he explodes like Sonic?

859
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,020
*laughter*

860
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,020
How about that?

861
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,020
He flies back at every key individually.

862
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,020
He flies off of every...

863
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:48,940
the

864
00:53:48,940 --> 00:54:06,940
a

865
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:24,900
the

866
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,900
with the attack. Okay.

867
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,900
25.

868
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,900
That lands. That fucking lands.

869
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,900
25. And then dexterity.

870
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Roll dex.

871
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900
16. Fuck! 16? Yeah.

872
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,900
You like knock...

873
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,900
First of all, roll for damage for the hoagie surprise.

874
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,900
Doodoo damage to him. Doodoo.

875
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,900
10 doodoos. Nice.

876
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,900
Doodoo damage.

877
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,900
10 doodoo damage. Okay.

878
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,900
So yeah. You like...

879
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,900
I guess you say ice cream bar

880
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,540
and hit him extremely hard in the thigh

881
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,200
um, with your...

882
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,160
uh, like a guy pulled over the sandwich?

883
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
is that what it is?

884
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,560
we'll have to... maybe we... we just uh...

885
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,000
it's okay if it is

886
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
yeah, it's a...

887
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,660
I think the guy's meat was just in the sandwich

888
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,660
I don't know what this...

889
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,660
this whole skin is like over the sandwich

890
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,160
what?

891
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,660
I don't remember, yeah

892
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,660
that's how you decide...

893
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,660
I don't know, I don't think know if that happened

894
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,660
I don't know if I've actually met him

895
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,060
I don't think- I have a little guy.

896
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:29,420
I was re-listening and I was skipping around but I didn't need that part so I didn't listen

897
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,580
to it so I can't verify.

898
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,260
I know I re-skinned the hoagie.

899
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,700
What does that mean?

900
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,020
You re-skinned the hoagie?

901
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,780
I re-skinned it by putting somebody's skin over it.

902
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,500
I don't think you said that.

903
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Yes I did.

904
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,840
I hope I'm wrong and I sound like an idiot but-

905
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,480
You are wrong and you sound like an idiot.

906
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,480
I reskinned the hoagie.

907
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,840
I listened to it dude.

908
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,760
I have to edit them.

909
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,760
I reskinned the hoagie.

910
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
It's hoagie that I am.

911
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,760
Pat you can decide.

912
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,760
You reskinned it.

913
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,760
Mhm.

914
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,520
No you did that on the way here.

915
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,600
You were just mindlessly reskinning the hoagie thing ice cream bar putting a man's skin over

916
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,840
your sandwich.

917
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,400
Now all the fans are gonna scream at me cause I'm wrong or something.

918
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,360
My wife is so hard.

919
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
And you know what?

920
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:26,360
the most

921
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:33,380
the

922
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,380
the

923
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,380
the

924
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,380
the

925
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:46,380
the

926
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:53,380
the

927
00:56:53,380 --> 00:57:03,380
the

928
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:21,380
the

929
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:29,540
the keys is gonna fall out swallow swallow swallow swallow both of you

930
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:37,700
roll proper station with advantage can I hold his nose you want to come inside

931
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:42,620
and hold his nose I got an idea can I go Oh Sullivan come here I want to hold

932
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,620
your nose.

933
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,620
At 11, it's always like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm."

934
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,620
I'm rolling persuasion. You said advantage?

935
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,620
Mm-hmm.

936
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,620
13.

937
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,620
All right, I guess they're gonna have to stay in his mouth.

938
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,620
Oh, great.

939
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:04,620
At least you can't convince him verbally.

940
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,620
But yeah.

941
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,620
So, yeah, the keys are out.

942
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
It's shiny Andrew's turn.

943
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,620
Um...

944
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,620
Uh, he's gonna shoot a...

945
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,620
Uh oh.

946
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,620
He is gonna shoot a shiny beam at

947
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,620
Sullivan, who has the keys.

948
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,620
Okay. He's the one

949
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,620
attacking here, and we're in public.

950
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,620
So I think the police are gonna have to

951
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,620
step in pretty soon. 'Cause we're not

952
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,620
fighting. We haven't done anything.

953
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,620
He's shooting beams.

954
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,620
Out in the middle of the street.

955
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,620
You're in a room.

956
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,620
You're in one of the rooms right now.

957
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:43,620
is where Travis Ocelot tossed him into one of the rooms.

958
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:47,620
So, I mean, certainly there's a chance, I mean,

959
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,620
Blowtoss, you are outside, you could...

960
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,620
Yeah, when it comes to my turn, I will do something about this.

961
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,620
You're gonna scream for...

962
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,620
I will handle this situation.

963
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,620
Yeah, I bet.

964
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,620
Alright, it's his turn and he's gonna shoot a shiny beam?

965
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,620
That's right, and he's gonna shoot it at Sullivan,

966
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,620
who has his keys in his mouth.

967
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:14,260
that definitely hits solving can I jump in front of it you already used your

968
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:20,660
reaction actually a solvent is such a fucking weakling I will let people use

969
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,940
their reaction to try to jump in front of attacks for can I use my golden

970
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:29,060
deagle to refract the shiny beam I will let you use as a reaction literally

971
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:34,020
because Sullivan is so weak and I will never make him stronger.

972
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:39,620
So I'm trying to redirect the beam right back at shiny Andrew.

973
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,820
Cool. Roll a roll straight dexterity check, I would say for that.

974
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:51,620
Holy shit.

975
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,100
Yes, sir.

976
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,820
Yeah, great. Yes, sir.

977
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,020
Yeah. Damn.

978
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:03,700
Yeah, so Sullivan is like, "Mmm, mmm," and then this beam of light's coming, and he's like, "Mmm, mmm," and then like your deagle

979
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:10,420
pops in front of it, the light beam bounces off of it, and you stated your intention.

980
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:13,780
So it does absolutely reflect back at Shiny Andrew.

981
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,260
And he takes

982
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,100
nine points of damage to his head,

983
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,500
and he's just sort of like a,

984
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,180
like he's just like

985
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,700
in a lot of pain.

986
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:39,580
the

987
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,580
I can take it.

988
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,580
I'm wearing sunglasses.

989
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,580
It's true.

990
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,580
He is going to hit you with that.

991
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,580
And...

992
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,580
Man, he's getting low rolls.

993
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,580
He does another 9 damage to you.

994
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,580
In this case, Ocelot.

995
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,580
Ugh.

996
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,580
Ugh.

997
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,580
Those are his two attacks.

998
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,580
That was very cool.

999
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,580
That was very cool.

1000
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,580
That was very cool.

1001
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,700
I know how I sound. It's cool. Yeah, you're up

1002
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,260
Barry Gee

1003
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,180
I kill him

1004
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:29,380
So you have a lot of tools at your disposal mr. Gee

1005
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:32,860
I

1006
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,860
the Seattle attack called the Polaris

1007
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,020
Yeah, so as a magnet man or

1008
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:45,420
magnetized man type of some kind you have this ability to when you attack people with either

1009
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,860
Your fists your hands or whatever?

1010
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,460
fists or hands or whatever

1011
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:57,320
You can use charges to depolarize them. So you depolarize your cells which essentially

1012
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:04,540
forces them to suffer from a various effects that happens when your cells depolarize.

1013
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:11,020
So you can just do an attack and then you use one of your charges and you can either do

1014
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:17,740
a muscle relaxer, which is a paralysis. You can cause blindness, you can cause diaphragm

1015
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:24,780
destruction, which you sort of destroy their diaphragm. You can use all your charges and turn

1016
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:30,140
the enemy into a magnetic force that attracts up to a thousand pounds of uh uh you know like a

1017
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:36,140
thousand pounds of magnetic force towards them all right um i just use one charge and i paralyze him

1018
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:41,820
that would be great then if you succeed on the attack he's paralyzed all right i will do that

1019
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:54,460
then go for it see what you get 20 that that hits roll for damage too 14 fuck that's a very good

1020
01:02:54,460 --> 01:03:01,460
it

1021
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:08,300
that's not bad dude um 17 you should just run away guys you guys should he's

1022
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:14,860
paralyzed he's paralyzed he's paralyzed for the rest of his life for the next

1023
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:19,180
six seconds so in the next round of action so you all can you realize from

1024
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:23,860
the way sit down for the rest of can we flee you could certainly try yeah you

1025
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:30,860
have before you I would like to try to say we're still an initiative so so

1026
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,660
So let's resolve this with first Travis Ocelot.

1027
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,660
He's paralyzed.

1028
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,660
What do you want to do?

1029
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:41,980
I want to check his whole person for more keys and clues.

1030
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:46,900
Yeah, I think you're looking for clues in his body.

1031
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,580
I'm doing a pat down.

1032
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:49,580
Okay.

1033
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,580
Yeah.

1034
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,580
Yeah.

1035
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,580
With that pat down.

1036
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,180
Yeah, you have the key to his house.

1037
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,620
You find the key to his car as well.

1038
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,860
So you have an automobile that way.

1039
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:08,960
And then you also find, which is also why that was probably a smart move, the passcode to

1040
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,960
his...

1041
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,460
Yeah, because we just had his thumb, which would have been hard to...

1042
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,960
Yes, so you also found the passcode...

1043
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,960
We almost just had his head with no passcode.

1044
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,960
Yeah.

1045
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,960
That would have been big.

1046
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,960
Yeah.

1047
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,460
But I guess we could have always just checked his body if he was headless.

1048
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,460
Yeah, that's true.

1049
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,600
But you have his passcode for his, yeah, for the rest of, for his account.

1050
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,800
So now you have the two-factor authentication secured.

1051
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,000
Yeah, you got both of those things.

1052
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,440
I mean, you also get a picture of his girlfriend or something, and she's busted.

1053
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,440
So...

1054
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,440
Swag.

1055
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,440
That's a shame.

1056
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,520
I put my mouth on it.

1057
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,520
He's like, "No!"

1058
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,720
Paralyzed idiot.

1059
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,320
Okay, is it my turn yet?

1060
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,880
It's Ray William Johnson's turn.

1061
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,880
Oh my god.

1062
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,520
I want to run away really, really fast.

1063
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:00,860
Yeah.

1064
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,600
Yeah.

1065
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,140
You just bust out of you.

1066
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,780
You do Kool-Aid man out of the room.

1067
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,160
Okay.

1068
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:05,720
It's time.

01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,200
Yeah.

1070
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:06,800
Finally.

1071
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,280
And, uh, yeah, you run out.

1072
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,600
Yeah.

1073
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,880
You run your full 60 feet of movement.

1074
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,720
I'm just running as fast as I hit the 60 feet and I, I just stand

1075
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,120
there waiting for my next turn.

1076
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,600
Yeah, absolutely.

1077
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:19,920
Okay.

1078
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,040
You're up blow toss now.

1079
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,760
Okay.

1080
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,480
I'm going to run away, but I'm also going to, do I see any.

1081
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,920
police nearby. You see a number of security who are starting to get interested in this

1082
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,460
area. Okay, as I'm running like I'm running away, but I'm also going to tell them as I

1083
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:41,320
run like that paralyzed guy just tried to kill me and my friends and he needs to go

1084
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:54,560
to jail. But I'm not waiting to like, find out if you convinced them or not. Yeah. Okay,

1085
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:09,640
the

1086
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,480
Sitting completely still on the ground.

1087
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,480
I'm sitting completely still on the ground.

1088
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,480
Yeah, I want to put the-

1089
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,480
They look in the room and they see a Yoda.

1090
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,480
You're not going to paralyze me.

1091
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,480
They see a Yoda and a shiny guy both sitting completely perfectly still.

1092
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,480
*laughs*

1093
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,480
Um,

1094
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,480
and uh, yeah,

1095
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,480
I mean, they're looking in on that.

1096
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,480
It's Patrick Yoda, it's your turn.

1097
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,480
They see that?

1098
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,480
Yeah, they see you and they see-

1099
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,480
The cops see that.

1100
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,760
You and they see you and they see you.

1101
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,920
All right.

1102
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,600
I see times that you don't have to say ice cream bar.

1103
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,480
Oh, so I see it.

1104
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,320
Oh, OK. So they're seeing it right now.

1105
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,440
And what am I saying?

1106
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:58,960
Yeah, you're saying, are you just going to stand still?

1107
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,840
You're not going to get to move.

1108
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,960
You should run away.

1109
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,240
So they don't know who's the paralyzed guy.

1110
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,960
Yeah. You're going to go to jail.

1111
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,460
You're gonna go to jail, man.

1112
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,460
That means, will I get interrogated?

1113
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,460
If I go to jail.

1114
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,460
What is... what?

1115
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,460
Oh, you wanna bargain for an ice cream bar in the interrogation room?

1116
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,460
*laughter*

1117
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,460
Okay, alright.

1118
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,460
I like this more now.

1119
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:28,460
Having the deepest, like, strategy, specifically just for ice cream.

1120
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,460
I love it, yeah.

1121
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,460
Okay, okay.

1122
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,460
He also somehow knew that Blowtoss was gonna say, "It's the paralyzed man."

1123
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,260
- That's a shiny one. - Oh yeah.

1124
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,460
Roll performance, Pat.

1125
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,160
- 18. - Fuck!

1126
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,060
You seem real fucking paralyzed.

1127
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,760
And I'll tell you what,

1128
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,560
once it's Barry Gee's turn again, he's not going to be paralyzed anymore.

1129
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,560
So you will be the paralyzed guy.

1130
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,560
Because he's only paralyzed for a round.

1131
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,260
First it's his turn, he's paralyzed, it's done.

1132
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,460
Barry Gee, it's your turn.

1133
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:10,900
I mean shiny what you literally try to paralyze Patrick roll an attack roll roll depolarization

1134
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:20,820
Yeah, dude, you're gonna fucking kill me you all for damage

1135
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:27,900
Cool no, no, not that one. I'm gonna hit depolarize in the chat. Oh

1136
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:33,620
No, no the deported. No. No hit the 25 one because that one's gonna roll for crit

1137
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:47,300
it

1138
01:08:47,300 --> 01:09:05,280
the

1139
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:29,940
the

1140
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,420
Now that the cops are here, we can't leave the,

1141
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,820
we can't leave Shiny Andrew,

1142
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:37,220
'cause he's a witness to our insane robbery.

1143
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,540
- I just had the cops roll insight into the situation

1144
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:41,720
and they got a five.

1145
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,300
So they are just looking at it and just are like,

1146
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,760
that is a paralyzed Yoda.

1147
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,300
- Shiny Andrew's about to resuscitate, right?

1148
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,680
- Yeah, he's coming back.

1149
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,800
It is now your turn, Travis.

1150
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Did you...

1151
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,800
What are you doing?

1152
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,800
I don't remember, I don't think I fled.

1153
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,800
You didn't flee.

1154
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,760
So maybe, I guess, so I'm in the room then?

1155
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,760
I'm in the room with them?

1156
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,200
Yeah, what did you do last turn?

1157
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,200
Holy shit, I'm sorry.

1158
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,200
I feel completely paralyzed.

1159
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,680
Well, I did a pat down, but then I didn't do anything.

1160
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,640
You did a pat down, and that was your turn, yeah.

1161
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,640
That was your turn.

1162
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,640
You should've expeditialized.

1163
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,000
So you're still in there.

1164
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Oh, okay.

1165
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,800
So I'm gonna tell the cops that I'm here to protect them.

1166
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,800
*laughter*

1167
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,800
*laughter*

1168
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,800
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Roll- say what you're gonna say and then roll

1169
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,800
Deception with advantage.

1170
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,800
Woah, okay, this is, uh, really weird, but it's-

1171
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,800
*laughter*

1172
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,800
I'm here to, uh, fix everything.

1173
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,800
I actually got here

1174
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,800
because I'm the chief of police.

1175
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,800
*laughter*

1176
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,800
So...

1177
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,800
Do I really have to roll for that? I feel like I kinda said-

1178
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,100
But I can't wait.

1179
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,980
Deception. Is that what I'm rolling?

1180
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:00,880
Yeah. I mean, unless that's the truth.

1181
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,820
Roll again.

1182
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,020
Maybe it is the truth.

1183
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:11,260
So, you know, oh, with the I mean, like you said, chief of police,

1184
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:15,500
you might have had them, but chief of police are like, all right, we don't

1185
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,100
we don't we don't know what's going on here.

1186
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,860
We're going to we're going to just

1187
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,700
We're going to take this paralyzed guy.

1188
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,800
You you got to come with us, too.

1189
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,100
We have to talk. We talk about what happened here.

1190
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,860
All right. OK, cool.

1191
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,960
So they take you and Patrick Yoda.

1192
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,460
Oh, I'm going to fight. I'm not going to go.

1193
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,500
Oh, fuck. Yeah. OK, cool.

1194
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,960
I mean, they are just private security.

1195
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,060
Everything in city.

1196
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,300
There's very few public like security.

1197
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,940
Everything is private security.

1198
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,600
So you can certainly try to fight them.

1199
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,940
So we'll re-roll initiative for you.

1200
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:58,740
So you just roll and Barry G roll to.

1201
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:04,180
Women just know you don't have to fight, you're just in the room.

1202
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,380
So it's deciding turn order.

1203
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,640
Oh, I go first.

1204
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,040
Hmm, probably.

1205
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:14,340
And then you roll to Travis and then I did.

1206
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,340
Oh, oh, wait, it didn't get sent.

1207
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:23,920
Okay, it says the no, I see it now was selected. Oh, it's weird. Don't ignore that. It's stupid. Don't ignore that

1208
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:31,220
It's not it's important up I will so before we resolve that

1209
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:37,060
Yeah blow toss and Ray you're sort of though like

1210
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:41,620
You guys do see the situation going on. You see the cops sort of squaring up

1211
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,420
On the scene you don't know

1212
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,660
Probably that there is potentially a fight about to break out, but I wanted to see what you guys were up to

1213
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:51,820
We're playing we're playing chopsticks

1214
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,680
Yeah, we're playing chopsticks

1215
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:02,900
Like the song or the game where you put each other's fingers. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. You guys want to play that out?

1216
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:09,380
Okay, who's goes first how do you play chopsticks

1217
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,580

01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,580
Fuck you!

1219

Can we roll to do a staring contest?

1222
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,580
Yeah, constitution.

1223
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,580
Both of you.

1224
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,580
Wait, actually

1225
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,580
I'm gonna use

1226
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,580
I'm gonna use my ability that I haven't used yet

1227
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,580
in this campaign

1228
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,580
where I can teleport

1229
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,580
into someone else's body and control them

1230
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,580
for six seconds.

1231
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:45,580
I'm gonna make Ray William Johnson blink instantly.

1232
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,580
Yeah, do it.

1233
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:52,580
I do it. How do I, let's see, let me see if there's something I have to do.

1234
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,580
There is stuff with it, yes.

1235
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,580
Where is it?

1236
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:01,580
He can roll dexterity or strength against it if I'm correct about that, what I wrote for that.

1237
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:16,660
the

1238
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,160
Easy.

1239
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,860
Okay, cool.

1240
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:24,060
So we're back to the fight over here and yeah, Barry G you're

1241
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:24,960
going first.

1242
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,560
What a dematerialize and screw you away because I don't want

1243
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,760
to be in here anymore.

1244
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,460
Yeah, you could definitely do that.

1245
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,960
You don't have to roll for that.

1246
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,860
I'm paralyzed.

1247
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:37,860
I'm waiting for the cops to pick me up.

1248
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,760
So you can use slither.

1249
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,760
So you could just basically like decompose and become sort of

1250
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,760
semi liquid

1251
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:52,920
Uh, your ac becomes 17 you have advantage on any stealth checks you do you have a climbing speed now, too

1252
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,920
You're sort of like a puddle of of metal

1253
01:14:54,920 --> 01:15:00,120
uh, sort of like a a liquid metal puddle so you can sort of slide I want

1254
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,980
Uh, both us and we will not start to complete some chopsticks

1255
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:10,040
Yeah, go for it. Uh, uh, yeah, I mean roll a stealth. No, you don't have to roll stealth

1256
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,080
I would say that if you're running by them, they're going to have opportunity attacks on you

1257
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:19,480
and they're going to use them, but let's see how they do. They frankly aren't very strong.

1258
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:25,720
Yeah, they both don't hit you. So you just roll, you just slide away,

1259
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:30,200
use your full movement. Now you're this puddle of metal next to Ray and Blotas.

1260
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:40,040
And uh, the cops are gonna go now or the private security force

1261
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,660
They're gonna try to attack you travis since you're resisting arrest

1262
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:51,560
Oh what the hell oh what the hell

1263
01:15:51,560 --> 01:16:00,280
Okay, cool they just both fucking with let's go you're just too strong you're too fast you're too smart it's your turn

1264
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:03,720
Uh, okay. How many of them are there?

1265
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,760
There are only two of them.

1266
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,720
Okay, cool.

1267
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:13,160
Um, I guess I'm just gonna practice my akimbo, uh, double headshot.

1268
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,940
Yeah.

1269
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,640
You can attack twice and shoot at each of them.

1270
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,200
Go for it.

1271
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,640
What do I roll?

1272
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,080
Just attack with my gun?

1273
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,600
Oh yeah, attack with your gun.

1274
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,480
Okay, one of them does hit.

1275
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,360
The 17 does hit.

1276
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,000
Roll for damage.

1277
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,200
Yeah, a 10 just like they're dead.

1278
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:30,760
They're weak.

1279
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,080
They're just private security cops.

1280
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,760
You guys are a lot stronger than them.

1281
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,260
So I like should be killing them.

1282
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,700
Is that what you're saying?

1283
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,340
No, not at all.

1284
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,340
You can do whatever you want.

1285
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,540
It's a game.

1286
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,900
All this stuff has no repercussions.

1287
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,440
So what?

1288
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,080
Um, and then

1289
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,440
so there's no repercussions.

1290
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,420
And so, OK, and yeah, Patrick, you had a roll death saving throw.

1291
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:00,360
So there's no repercussions if he does.

1292
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,060
Well, you're succeeding, OK?

1293
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:18,060
the

1294
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,860
normal world and he tries to attack you again

1295
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:23,460
that does hit you

1296
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:28,140
um I thought you said I couldn't get hurt

1297
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:32,460
it does three damage

1298
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,780
awesome

1299
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:39,020
all right I tried to disfigure him with my gym farm I try to

1300
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:44,220
rip his thumbs off and snatch his eyeballs out and take his lips

1301
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:44,460
off

1302
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:51,100
OK, that would be Krav Maga 2000, right?

1303
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,640
Right.

1304
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,280
OK, cool.

1305
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,780
And then damage. OK.

1306
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:04,440
We'll see here. Damn.

1307
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,080
Yeah, you don't kill him, but you do.

1308
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:06,880
You know what you don't do?

1309
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,640
You don't gouge his eyes out, but you do rip his thumbs off.

1310
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,280
Can he he has no lips?

1311
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,480
No lips.

1312
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,680
OK, good.

1313
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:19,720
You won't be telling anyone about what happened.

1314
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:24,120
At least not using any explosive consonants.

1315
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,260
All right.

1316
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,420
Can I curb stomp Shiny Andrew and then leave?

1317
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:34,100
I would say the the private security force, the guy at this point

1318
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,840
is like out of commission, like he ripped his lips off.

1319
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,900
He's freaking out.

1320
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,800
If you want to curb stomp Tiny Andrew,

1321
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:48,500
He is kind of like mobile right now and just kind of cowering so it will be tough like he's okay

1322
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,500
Can I can I put him in my inventory?

1323
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,160
No, no, no

1324
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,580
All right

1325
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,200
This sucks

1326
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,560
Maybe give him give him a bunch of Xanax so he blacks out. That's a good

1327
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:08,160
Xanax roll a strength contest against him. Okay, see if you can show Xanax in his mouth

1328
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:23,160
the

1329
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,960
Yeah, you just shoved the Xanax right in his fucking mouth.

1330
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,960
He gets real woozy real fast.

1331
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,760
You see the light starting to dim.

1332
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,560
Oh, I should have done this earlier.

1333
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,860
Yeah, and

1334
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:36,860
and what do you want to do with Patrick Yoda?

1335
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,960
I definitely put him in my inventory.

1336
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,660
Yeah, you can just pick him up.

1337
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:41,760
You can wait in the cops.

1338
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,860
The cops are dead.

1339
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,160
One of them is dead.

1340
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,160
One of them is freaking out because he has no lips.

1341
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:46,760
Oh, yeah.

1342
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,460
I asked Yoda.

1343
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,460
Do you want to go with the other cop?

1344
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,860
He is knocked out.

1345
01:19:51,560 --> 01:20:06,560
the

1346
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,880
we just saved all this time.

1347
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,960
And yeah, I mean, I think just based on time, let's end it there.

1348
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,160
A couple things in the air now.

1349
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,440
You guys got away with it.

1350
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,040
You have his thumb, you have his passcode.

1351
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:27,520
So you can get his money, you can get his money, you can get his house, you can get

1352
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,520
his car.

1353
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,520
You can also get his credentials.

1354
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,160
So that's two things off the list in one.

1355
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:37,200
you cause a little bit trouble

1356
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,960
uh... two things off the list

1357
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,200
so

1358
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,360
