Karen's been following me around the store.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I wasn't.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This Karen's been following me around the damn store.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Get the fuck out of my way, Karen.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Get out of here.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Quit hiding, Karen.

Quit hiding, Karen.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,100

the wastewater pumping station in Shannon Bridge, Ireland in Offaly County.

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,740
This was actually just fairly recently inspected, electrically inspected on July 11th, so everything's

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,080
above board there.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,780
But just make sure that you're authorized before you show up to the meetup.

(upbeat music)

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:59,940
- Okay.

31
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,380
- Clay, clay, clay, clay.

32
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,220
- Clay.

33
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,680
- Clay upon my big glass bed.

(humming)

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,540
- Is this you?

36
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,380
- Whoa.

37
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,220
- Ooh.

38
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,040
- Do you like that?

39
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,020
- I didn't think that that sound effect

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,300
would be the one that came out.

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,100
- I'm not so good at this.

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,900
It's only my third time ever doing this.

43
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,360
Mommy's gone again.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
Mommy's gone, but we got a new mommy.

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Mommy. Mm hmm.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,380
Mr. Clay, how are you, buddy?

47
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,200
I'm good, man. How are you?

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,280
I mean, you know, there is already a lot of glaring

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
technical issues with this episode.

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,180
When Cameron fucking leaves, the thing falls apart.

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,780
Yeah. Yeah.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,660
Last week we do our most ambitious, highest production thing we've ever done.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,580
This week we don't have a list.

54
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,560
Jubio, can you pull up the the photo I sent you of our current camera?

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,020
Real quick, I just want to, I want the, I'll show it into the GoPro.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020
Basically he duct taped a thing.

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Yeah, it actually looks really sick.

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,520
This is the, this is our current camera setup right here.

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,020
This, that is a, what are you doing with your hat?

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,020
My hat's falling off because I can't wear the fucking headphones over it, man. Chill on me.

61
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,020
One second, god damn it.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:21,080
Well, that's our current, this is a JVC Iverio, which comes with a proprietary dock. Also,

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,200
this lens is for a separate Hi8 camcorder. What are you?

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I want to wear my hat, man! I got it while I was on vacation and I want to wear it, but

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,640
it falls off.

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,880
Why would you pick that hat?

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Because it was cool and it was only $45. I got it because I thought, I was like really

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,660
hungover and I thought that this was made of snake skin. But it's a spray painted wicker

69
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,220
hat that they put a belt on. So it's really not a very... whatever. I give up on it. Fuck

70
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,220
it. How was Texas?

71
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,440
Well, the first show was fun.

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,140
The first show that you said was bad ended up being good.

73
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,620
The first shows were good. I just blew through my material too quick.

74
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,620
I love that.

75
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,620
Yeah.

76
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
Don't you love doing stand up now?

77
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Oh, I love it.

78
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,780
Isn't it fucking amazing? Clay, do you love doing stand up?

79
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
It's the most fun in the world.

80
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,780
You have the most amazing stand up

81
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,820
pre ritual where you...

82
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,420
What do you do?

83
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,060
I've seen him drink like six beers before.

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,620
Six beers?

85
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,460
Yeah, I drink like six beers before I go on stage.

86
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,260
Yeah, it's incredible.

87
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,140
Because I'm nervous.

88
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,660
You get nervous when you drink beer?

89
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,940
I get so anxious.

90
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,700
I have like three beers and I'm like, all right, this is going to be good.

91
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,460
And then I like don't go up for a while.

92
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,580
And I like try to keep the same level.

93
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,140
And then I always go too far.

94
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,020
Dude, I can't have any beer before I go on stage.

95
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,460
Me neither.

96
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,340
I forget all my jokes.

97
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,900
I mean, I have one.

98
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,020
I fucked up one of my jokes at your show two weeks ago.

99
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,860
I fucked up one of my jokes so bad because I had one beer.

100
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,460
I had one beer and I just blew the punch line at the very beginning.

101
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:54,740
Yeah.

102
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,620
It's pretty genius.

103
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,460
This weekend, I just didn't like, just burned through all my material.

104
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,740
Started, I was just like, "Ah, shit, you guys.

105
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,740
I'm bad."

106
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,740
And then I was like, "What if I just sing for you?"

107
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
You sang?

108
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I sang.

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
What did you sing?

110
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
I sang Superstar by the Carpenters.

111
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
How does that one go?

112
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,740
Long ago and oh so far away.

113
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
That was what I was supposed to sing Cameron for his birthday but then decided Careless

114
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Whisperer would be better.

115
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
People paid for this show.

116
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
People paid for the show.

117
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
You promoted it for about a month, got a custom poster made for it.

118
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
And then I, well it was the first set that I did.

119
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
I had just gotten off the plane.

120
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Oh, well if you just got off the plane you're going to be in the airport.

121
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
I was in the airport.

122
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
I was in the airport.

123
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
I was in the airport.

124
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
I was in the airport.

125
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
I was in the airport.

126
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
I was in the airport.

127
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I was in the airport.

128
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
I was in the airport.

129
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,500
Custom poster made for it.

130
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,700
And then I, well, it was the first set that I did. I'd just gotten off the plane.

131
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,500
Oh, well, if you just got off the plane, you're going to be bad.

132
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,740
You're going to be bad every time.

133
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,940
Yeah, it was kind of fucked up.

134
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,700
What was sick, though, is we, so Dan and I get in the Uber and

135
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,660
That is sick.

136
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,780
Well, the lady, we're just like, oh, we're just doing a couple of shows.

137
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,740
We're staying at this hotel.

138
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,140
And she's like, oh, that's so funny.

139
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,260
that's the first place I ever got a D U I really dude. There's something

140
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,080
there's something about the people who take you from when you're going on the

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,660
road from the plane to the hotel who are always crazy. We had in Pittsburgh. A

142
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,580
lady was like

143
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,420
with it. We got in and she was like, we has ever been to Pittsburgh before five

144
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,420
minutes and she literally said George Floyd is a coward.

145
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,180
I swear to God, I swear to God.

146
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,220
Okay, this is where drama's over here. It was fucking crazy, dude.

147
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,520
Pullover will get out of this out of the way. I mean, just like you give them one

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,300
thing, right? I think we said, I think what we, what got her to start going

149
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,200
off was we were like,

150
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,360
she was like, "Oh yeah, Pittsburgh's great, used to be better." And we were

151
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,520
like, "Oh yeah, every city used to be better," said something like that. And

152
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,280
then she was like, she told us a story about a lady during the BLM protests

153
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,080
who, she was like, "These sick people." There was a woman who was

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,860
eating at a restaurant, eating outside, eating a steak, and one of the

155
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,540
protesters grabbed her steak and threw it on the ground.

156
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,640
We were like, "Okay.

157
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,180
All right." Oh, I can't believe that. I mean, we were just like, "Oh,

158
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,780
you're kidding me." Yeah, yeah. And she went to jail, she went to prison.

159
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, thank God. Yeah.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,680
That's like the best thing to, like you just, like when someone says some crazy

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,160
shit at you, just like goad them into telling you more, just 'cause it's like

162
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,100
So I want to see how you get to this conclusion.

163
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:33,500
The other day I was out skating and I had this Oprah Winfrey show t-shirt and one of

164
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,100
this dude's friends was like, "Oh, that shirt's sick."

165
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,020
And then the other dude went, "No, Oprah's not valid anymore.

166
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,460
She has a school in Africa where she's selling kids like Jeffrey Epstein."

167
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Is that true?

168
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,460
I don't know.

169
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
He told me.

170
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
You should have at least opened your mind a little bit.

171
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
He told me everything.

172
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,460
I just was like, "No shit.

173
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,960
throw this away. And I just let him just like keep talking about it. I like

174
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,480
barely skated because I just wanted to talk more about it. He was like, yeah,

175
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,960
Oprah's worked, or Oprah worked with Epstein, Oprah was on the flight loans.

176
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,920
I feel like I'm so used to hearing that shit at like a bar or something, if I'm

177
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,080
like with a bunch of people and then a crazy guy starts talking to us. That

178
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,160
happened to me and my dad while I was on vacation. My dad was like, "You wanna

179
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,820
get a beer?" We usually, every time I go out there, we get a beer for a couple

180
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,220
hours and catch up. And we sat down and we were there for about ten minutes and this like

181
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,820
drunk guy walked up to us and he was like eating calamari.

182
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Nice.

183
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,420
And he was like, "Hey, I'm Kenny." We were like, "Oh, what's up, Kenny?" And then he

184
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,180
just started telling us these stories. If they weren't good, we would have asked him

185
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,340
to leave, but he told us this one story about how he got ran out of the last town that he

186
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,260
lived in. He lived in Los Osos in California.

187
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
He's a cowboy.

188
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,700
He's a new age cowboy of sorts. He was like, "Yeah, man, I went on that website next

189
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,460
the door, right? And there was this lady who was fucking complaining. She was

190
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,360
like, 'Who's feeding all these crows peanuts? The peanut-, the crows are, the

191
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,860
crows are dropping peanuts in my backyard, and then my kid, my kid's allergic to

192
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,180
peanuts, so he's coming and eating them.' And I replied and I said, 'Lady, I

193
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,180
wouldn't be so worried about the guy selling the, or giving the crows the

194
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,420
peanuts. I'd be more worried that my kid is eating food off the floor.'

195
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,340
and apparently he got like it's a really small town yeah and apparently people

196
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,700
were like egg his house

197
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,700
it's like so me and my dad talked to my dad for about ten minutes the entire

198
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,740
trip yeah, because this guy is a cooler man. I just liked it more than my dad.

199
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,840
My boss is kind of crazy in a way like he'll come come into the restaurant part

200
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,460
of where I work and I'll just be like did you know that Jim Morrison's dad

201
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,820
worked for the CIA and I'm just like please tell me yeah, give me more when

202
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,860
your boss is you can't say it. You can't be like, I don't care right now.

203
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,960
Well, also I like love it. Like I want him to take time out of my day to tell me

204
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,860
about Jim Morrison being like a CIA son. And I work with Tommy.

205
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,620
Yeah.

206
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,480
Tommy has no time for it.

207
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,680
He's just like, oh cool.

208
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,860
But he likes talking to Tommy so much more than me.

209
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,480
Yeah.

210
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,560
And I'm just like, fuck dude, all I want to do is hear this.

211
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,800
Yeah, you get stuck with the conversation. Yeah. Well, I mean, you want it.

212
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:11,960
Yeah.

213
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,680
I want it. I like getting stuck with it.

214
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
It also kind of means you don't have to work, right?

215
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,180
Yeah.

216
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,880
Because they're more worried about you listening to them than you even working.

217
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,380
Exactly.

218
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,180
Yeah, that's actually a pretty good situation to be in.

219
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,880
It's the best.

220
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,180
Oh yeah, that's like the perfect situation to be in.

221
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah, I used to have this boss, I've talked about him before, but I used to work at a gym

222
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,880
and I had this boss who used to be like a UFC fighter, not a UFC, just an MMA fighter.

223
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,380
Yeah.

224
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,680
And he just had so many concussions, he would like drool all the time.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,080
He would do the same shit where he would come in and he would like tell me that something

226
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
about Bill Clinton.

227
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,600
And I would just be like, "Oh, really?"

228
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Because I didn't have to fold towels for a couple minutes.

229
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
It was pretty nice.

230
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,360
Dude, I fucking whiffed it.

231
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,180
I was supposed to...

232
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,280
I got an interview at that gym, I remember.

233
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Oh, yeah, you did.

234
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Yeah.

235
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
And you're the only...

236
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
The guy...

237
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,800
I was like, "Hey, my buddy needs a job."

238
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
And he was like, "Oh, dude."

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,680
He'll come in, he'll interview, it'll be nothing.

240
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,160
when I did the interview, they asked me my name, my phone number, and then they were

241
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,200
like, "You're hired." But he somehow fucked it up.

242
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,640
Yeah, I don't know how I fucked it up. I was just...

243
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,360
Did you put your phone number in the name area?

244
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,680
I literally, I think I just told the guy, "I just need money, man."

245
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,640
That is so bad to say.

246
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,160
Straight up was like, "Look, I don't really..." Basically, every single time I did job interviews

247
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,640
back then in college, I would always just like,

248
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm going to be completely honest with you. I'm in college. I need money.

249
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,120
Why would you say that to somebody? I don't know. Remember I were interviewed.

250
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,200
I interviewed for an escape room. Oh yeah. And you lost the escape room.

251
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,720
Yeah. I lost the escape room. It was South park's themed too.

252
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,160
And he had a, he had an endorsement from like the only other guy who worked there.

253
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,080
The clue master. Yeah. The clue master himself.

254
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,880
I had an endorsement from him and the lady was like, or person, I don't know their thing,

255
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:15,440
but they were like, "That is the worst interview I've ever had in my whole career."

256
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,720
I mean, to be fair, you do not strike me as a man who could give clues all that well.

257
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,520
No, no, not at all.

258
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,920
I think my ADHD brain couldn't even fucking...

259
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,520
Not my ADHD brain.

260
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,620
I would get distracted by a different clue.

261
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,600
Yeah, you would give them I would give them a clue for the next clue.

262
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,260
I would just be sitting there like, OK, but it's going to it's going to lead

263
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
into the next one.

264
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,180
This clue is going to lead you to the next.

265
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,840
Have you ever done an escape room?

266
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,160
Yeah. Oh, yeah. They're fun.

267
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
Yeah, they are fucking.

268
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,640
I am sick of pretending they're not so much fun.

269
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,080
Did I? We should do one.

270
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,400
I would do one. Let's go.

271
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Let's go after this.

272
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I love escape.

273
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,360
That is so I've never I've never won a single

274
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,080
single one, I've probably done five. I always do the easiest room and I fail.

275
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,280
I've won once. I've done it twice. I'm one and one and one and one.

276
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,960
Yeah, you're bad in 500. That's actually pretty good. Yeah, that's not bad.

277
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:20,400
I did one with my friend's family and it was hard. It was not because it was like six people

278
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,160
being like, we're the smartest people in the world.

279
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,760
Yeah, that's always how it is, man.

280
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,840
We were like, "Fuck, we're so stupid."

281
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,960
But the first time was just like, I went and did a bunch of shit, and then I came back to

282
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,120
my group and they were like, "We're done with our shit."

283
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
And I'm like, "I'm done with my shit.

284
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Are we done?"

285
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
And then...

286
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Was it one...

287
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,640
I always want it to be lock picking, but it's a lot more math and paper.

288
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Yeah, or magnets.

289
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
There's a lot of magnets.

290
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Yeah, the magnets.

291
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,040
I don't like all that, man.

292
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,080
I want to do a safe cracking kind of thing.

293
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Yeah, but that's like...

294
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,000
Not everyone knows how to fucking pick locks is the problem.

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know.

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I want to try. I've never even tried.

297
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think we should do a heist.

298
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A heist is a very good...

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Or a heist escape room?

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah. That'd be sick.

301
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Where they just kind of just...

302
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, so you're going in and you have like a mission.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, that'd be kind of sweet.

304
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I want a full...

305
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, well, hmm.

306
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I watched the escape room

307
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Tournament of Champions movie.

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What is that?

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They made a movie. Have you seen the escape room movies?

310
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,140
Basically saw, but they made a movie where they take all of the best escape

311
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,100
rumors and they put them in one escape room. Interesting. Yeah, it's pretty

312
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,580
interesting. I watched a lot of movies this week. I watched talk to me. Did you

313
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,260
see that? No. The Australian horror movie. Didn't see that one. Is that the

314
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,180
one where they touch the hand? They touch the hand. I've been seeing that

315
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:47,420
in YouTube. They go, "Narr! Don't kill me! Narr! Don't touch me! I want to

316
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,620
live!" Or however they talk. Yeah. But it was kind of interesting hearing a

317
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,260
different accent in a horror movie. You don't hear that too often.

318
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,100
Yeah, the Australians don't really get scared.

319
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,600
No.

320
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,720
They got all those spiders.

321
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,220
Yeah, they have nothing to be afraid of.

322
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,720
Yeah.

323
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,020
Is that true? The spiders and shit? I thought that was fake.

324
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,980
No, that's real.

325
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,700
The spiders that live on the wall or go there at least?

326
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah.

327
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,140
Oh, God.

328
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,620
I think they scare the piss out of me.

329
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,120
Yeah.

330
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,100
If I saw a spider that big, I'd kill myself.

331
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,540
But Australia needs to realize that we don't have big spiders here, but we do have

332
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,580
Bloods and Crips, MS-13, mass shootings.

333
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,320
Yeah.

334
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,940
They don't have any of these problems over in Australia.

335
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,540
They do, but it's all like...

336
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
Oh, dude.

337
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,420
It's all the...

338
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,920
It's Rangas versus Bogans.

339
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Yeah, exactly.

340
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,260
That's the thing, sometimes there's a Bogan Ranga.

341
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,060
And that's okay.

342
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,560
Yeah.

343
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,060
Yeah.

344
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,220
What the hell was that?

345
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,720
What the fuck?

346
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Your phone is talking to you.

347
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,860
Did you?

348
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,760
Your phone's talking back.

349
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
You're supposed to talk into that.

350
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,100
Did you accidentally call someone?

351
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,700
Yeah, I accidentally called my boy, Jack.

352
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,560
[laughing]

353
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,060
Wow.

354
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,420
This is already a legendary podcast appearance from Clay.

355
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:58,020
How the hell did that happen? Jack's a cool guy. Can I plug my friend Jack Barth? He's

356
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
cool. Check him out.

357
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
Jack Barth?

358
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
I think I did a show with him.

359
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
I don't think I know him.

360
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
He's cool. He wears glasses.

361
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,900
I think I did that fucking Nook show with him. I think we were all on that one.

362
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Not all of us.

363
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Yeah, well me and Clay were.

364
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,060
Well, I wasn't invited, but whatever.

365
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:21,620
I got into town last night late and I had a bad experience with a foreign traveler.

366
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,180
I had to change out a tire on my car, like right when I got back, and I had my dog with

367
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,180
me.

368
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,700
And so I was sitting there just fucking struggling.

369
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,340
It sucks so much pretending to be a grown man.

370
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,480
You're like sitting there doing the nuts and all this shit.

371
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,140
And then I hear a guy go like, "Excuse me?"

372
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:43,760
and I turn around and it's this fucking just annoying looking like Eastern European guy

373
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,160
and he's like staring at my dog. And my dog is this big.

374
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Your dog is way bigger.

375
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
He's not big.

376
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
He's really long.

377
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
He's under 40 pounds.

378
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
He's really long though.

379
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
He's under 40 pounds.

380
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,660
Your dog looks like the Night Stalker from New Vegas.

381
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,660
No, he doesn't look like that.

382
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
Yes, he does.

383
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,660
He's fine, but he just looks like a fucking German Shepherd.

384
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,660
He has the same shape and body as the Night Stalker from New Vegas.

385
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,860
it doesn't look like that. He doesn't look he does look like that actually

386
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:16,580
exactly like that okay all right. So pretend that he

387
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,780
teacup

388
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,780
poodle or something okay, but anyway the guy the guy's like looking at my dog and

389
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,300
I'm like and the dog is like halfway on the sidewalk and I have him on a leash.

390
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,220
He can't get any further, and so I say that I'm like walk around. You can walk

391
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,220
around the dog and he looks at me and he looked so sad. He goes

392
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,380
I scared

393
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:47,120
I scared. He said I scared twice and then I had to take my dog into the middle of

394
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,060
the street. So this guy could go back go past me on the sidewalk like my dog is a

395
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,100
bridge troll. Oh my God, and it really put me in the worst mood man. The rest of

396
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,620
the night I was like I scared. I

397
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:02,860
fuck you man. It's a dog yeah. Was he older? No, he's like thirty years old.

398
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,780
And he was, I scared about a dog.

399
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,900
Well yeah, he probably got, what you said he's like Eastern European?

400
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
He's something.

401
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Yeah.

402
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
It's none of my business what he is.

403
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
He's a coward.

404
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,980
What is the most cowardly, what is the most cowardly possible nation?

405
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,920
I don't know what goes on in Eastern Europe.

406
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,140
Maybe they have like a 50 foot dog there that looks just like Phil.

407
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,860
It's possible they have some kind of Cerberus.

408
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,860
Yeah.

409
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,900
A Cerberus might be a real thing over there.

410
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,620
They could have seen him as a Cerberus podling or something.

411
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,740
I really didn't like it though.

412
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740
It really pissed me off.

413
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Yeah.

414
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,500
I was cussing the whole time to myself, but hoping that he would hear it.

415
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Yeah.

416
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Fucking fuck you.

417
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Fucking dude.

418
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I scared.

419
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I scared.

420
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Piss me off, man.

421
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,140
Did you do anything fun in Texas?

422
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,140
Um, no, not really.

423
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,140
No?

424
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,140
I don't.

425
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,340
Dude, they're like, the motto is keep Austin weird, but guess what?

426
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,620
You guys are weird in a different way.

427
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,540
They're weird in kind of a touchy way.

428
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,340
It seems like it was a really cool city like five years ago.

429
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Uh-huh.

430
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
You know?

431
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,460
Like, I mean, we did a show there and it was like fun.

432
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,900
I mean, we went to, but we, I mean, we hung out with...

433
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
We were there for like 24 hours.

434
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Yeah, we were there for 24 hours.

435
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
I was there for two days.

436
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
I was like, oh, maybe I...

437
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,100
But you got to go to the Mecca, man.

438
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I did.

439
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I went to the mothership.

440
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
I went out...

441
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
You went to the comedy mothership.

442
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I stood outside of it.

443
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
How was it?

444
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Oh, you know what?

445
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
I, we, we went there.

446
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
We just stood out in front of it.

447
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
We didn't go in.

448
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Wow.

449
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
But we...

450
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,840
But we were going to the Museum of the Weird.

451
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,900
Wow.

452
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,700
And I saw a mummy.

453
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,540
You saw a mummy.

454
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,200
A real one?

455
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,700
Yep.

456
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,500
I wish that I had more things to say about this trip.

457
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,400
I mean, I just kind of flopped a lot.

458
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,100
Yeah.

459
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah.

460
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,100
I flopped and did great.

461
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,900
I just was like,

462
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,700
I don't like, oh.

463
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,000
I love those weekends.

464
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,500
That was my last weekend in Raleigh, dude.

465
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
You flopped in your hometown?

466
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,500
I've done stand up in North Carolina maybe like 15 times and bombed every single time.

467
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I had fun doing stand up in Raleigh.

468
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Really?

469
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,740
Yeah, I did okay for the first half of my stay.

470
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,460
Did you do the club there?

471
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
No, I did Neptune.

472
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,900
Oh, okay.

473
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,780
I think I get in my head about being in my hometown, man.

474
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,220
Yeah, I suck at Minnesota.

475
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm not good enough for these people.

476
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
There's something about it, man.

477
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
I kind of stink there.

478
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,580
Yeah, I mean, I thought that I would be like that when I went back to Boston.

479
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,080
But it was...

480
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
But you crushed.

481
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,020
I did two nights.

482
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,620
The last night that I was there, I skated all day before.

483
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,720
I was really tired and just a bummer of a set.

484
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,520
My mom and dad were there.

485
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,920
Oh, yeah.

486
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,820
Oh, yeah.

487
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,580
I think that's the first time my dad's ever seen me do stand up.

488
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,180
I went to...

489
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,660
Before this, last time I was in North Carolina, the time before I did stand up in North Carolina,

490
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:05,780
it was me and Gus driving back from L.A. and my buddy organized like a music show where

491
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,940
me and him were going to do stand up at the beginning of it, but nobody came. It was my

492
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:18,140
brother, his girlfriend, and my buddy Chad in the audience. And I was like...

493
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,540
Nobody came for the show, the music stuff after?

494
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,180
I really know. But I just did my set and I was like, that wasn't even, that wasn't

495
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,660
even stand up. I was just talking to people I know. But then Gus went up and

496
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,700
Gus destroyed it.

497
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,380
My brother was like, "Ah!" Losing his mind. It was like the funniest scene I've

498
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,140
ever seen. It made me so mad, dude.

499
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah. Oh, man. That's how it is, dude. It's the worst job in the world. I know.

500
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,860
We have a worse job than maybe like a police officer. I would rather be working

501
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,980
one of the iPhone mines where you are doing World War Z and climbing over people.

502
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,220
Yeah, because it's like you have to sell yourself to people with stand up. You have to be like,

503
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,980
no, trust me, like I'm like I'm not I'm bombing right now because I'm having a bad day. It's

504
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,420
not because I'm it's not because I completely suck at this and I suck as a person. It's

505
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:14,740
like, please help. Please trust me. Yeah, I'm a I'm a I'm a good guy. Yeah. You beckoning

506
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,140
Yeah, you'd have to get them with you and then you have to hold on to that.

507
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,740
Where it's just kind of like, I don't know, being in the mine sounds nice.

508
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,740
Oh man.

509
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,240
Probably sounds like dirty.

510
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,740
I'm born in the wrong, not just generation, the wrong like eon I think.

511
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Yeah.

512
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,660
I should have been, I would have been an amazing like first man type thing.

513
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,860
I would have been an amazing peasant dude.

514
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,740
You would have been, you have a peasant's face.

515
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,340
Oh dude, I would have been so good at eating just like a whole quail.

516
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,780
Like taking a quail by the two bones at the end and just going like...

517
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,300
You would have been an amazing surf.

518
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Oh dude.

519
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Oh my god, if only.

520
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,660
I could plow a fucking field.

521
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,740
I was born with like when they started putting chemicals in the water to make people not

522
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,300
good at concentration and shit.

523
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,700
So now I have to look at my phone all the time.

524
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Yeah.

525
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Yeah.

526
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,460
You can't spend your days eating cheese.

527
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,220
Yeah, eating like mold.

528
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,780
Milk and a cow or whatever.

529
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:17,580
It does suck. As I get older, I'm starting to enjoy nature less and I like looking at

530
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,580
my phone and my computer.

531
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,580
Oh yeah.

532
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,820
More, I thought it would be as I get older, I like these things kind of in the inverse.

533
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,820
But it turns out I was in California on the coast, most beautiful thing I've ever seen,

534
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,780
and I was like, "This sucks so bad. This is so fucking gay. I hate this."

535
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,420
Yeah. I get like that, dude. Like yeah, when we went to the Grand Canyon.

536
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,820
Oh yeah, we went to the Grand Canyon. Me, Cameron, and Pierce are like bawling, crying,

537
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,980
and Patrick is playing Candy Crush. I went, I left the group, I was like walking up and down,

538
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,060
I stood, I think I sat on a cliff. He was like, we were like, oh, Patrick's doing his own thing.

539
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,740
And then what did you, came back and you had news, you saw a guy with, what, a guy with one arm?

540
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:10,540
I saw, no, I just saw like, I just saw like so many, you know what, no, I was actually genuinely

541
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,860
very happy because I saw old people.

542
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,860
I saw like six different old people

543
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,360
taking iPad selfies.

544
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,980
And I was like this.

545
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,200
That's like like I was like,

546
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,860
oh, like I'm watching like these

547
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,780
people have like these people that

548
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,380
don't know how to use like a fucking

549
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
regular phone.

550
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,440
Yeah. Holding up this big thing

551
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
so they can go

552
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,900
with like a big

553
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
ass iPad so they can take selfies.

554
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,940
They look like laptops.

555
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,960
I thought it was adorable. It was

556
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,180
like, yeah, it was like an old

557
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
person holding up their laptop

558
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,860
to take a picture of themselves at the fucking Grand Canyon.

559
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,100
I sat next to an old lady on the flight back. She was very, very nice. Her name's Emily.

560
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,700
And I ended up helping her out. But the reason I helped her out was that she opened up Facebook

561
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,180
and in the Facebook search bar searched, "Can you take the Q train to the Upper East Side?"

562
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,100
I was like, "Let me help you out, sweetheart."

563
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,360
She's Googling stuff on Facebook. That's what they want now.

564
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
They do.

565
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,860
Just make it one thing, man. I'm sick of all these different websites. Give me one single

566
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,940
thing. One big website where I can do basically all that shit. And I'll be good man. I'll

567
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,380
be honest I think they're working on it. Yeah that's what X.com is supposed to be. Oh yeah

568
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,380
that all happened while I was away. Yeah. And buddy that was some crazy shit man. Wait

569
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,980
that's so funny that X.com is also a video game that's all about like strategy. Yeah

570
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,700
true. And aliens as well. Yeah. Yeah some big news came out while I was gone. Aliens

571
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,980
are completely real and Twitter basically changed its entire name. What the hell's wrong with

572
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,740
this world? The world is going to hell in a handbasket. I mean it's seriously fucking

573
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:55,540
crazy. Makes me upset. I got really really scared while I was out in nature that I was

574
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,260
scared that aliens were going to turn off the sun. I'm not kidding, I told my uncle

575
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,700
that and he was like, "Are you kidding?" and I said, "No, I'm actually really scared about

576
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:13,860
that right now. I don't know man. I don't know what they're capable of. You don't know either.

577
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,660
They can make a pill that flies. I mean if that's the only thing that they're doing,

578
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,220
I really don't give a shit. Turning off the sun would be bad news bro. Yeah that would

579
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,220
be so bad. It would get cold as fuck. I like it though. We wouldn't know for a while though,

580
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,860
like 8 years. That the sun was off? Yeah because the speed of light is so... Would it be that

581
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,780
long? Yeah. Eight years really? Or maybe eight minutes. I think it's eight minutes. I think

582
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,020
eight years would be eight light years away. I do not think the sun is that far away. No,

583
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,820
it's pretty close. Wait, one year is one light? I never understood light years. Light year

584
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,700
is how fast it takes, or how long it takes, how far light can travel in a year. How far

585
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,980
the sun travels in a year. How far light from the sun travels. Light from anything. A light

586
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,540
goes the same speed no matter what it is.

587
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,820
See, I took two years of science in high school because that was all that was required of

588
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
me.

589
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,980
You need to start watching Vsauce, Kerzagazakt, and Veritasium on YouTube.

590
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,980
And that's basically all the science education you need.

591
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:23,260
I put all my skill points into other crap like video production, high school video production,

592
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,340
learning how to operate cameras.

593
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,800
You are like a maxed out sliders on one thing kind of character.

594
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,440
And everything else is at 8.

595
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Is that medium?

596
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Yeah.

597
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Yeah.

598
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Well, medium is a little...

599
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
Is in the middle?

600
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
It's a little high.

601
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
No, I would say the low end.

602
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Probably.

603
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,720
If it's going by stat points, I'm probably...

604
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
You're like a rogue.

605
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
Yeah, maybe like an Alyssa Steamer, Jamie Thomas.

606
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,900
Me, I'm like a main.

607
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm like anybody's first account.

608
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,840
They get okay at everything.

609
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,320
You know, good at a couple things but never really, really good.

610
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,480
Yeah, I'm definitely good at drinking a couple beers.

611
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Yeah, you have that maxed out.

612
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,360
Using my computer.

613
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,400
Also maxed out.

614
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,680
Using my phone.

615
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
That one is completely, that one's off the scale.

616
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Off the scale.

617
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,840
That one is like when you, like when Gandhi accidentally becomes like Hitler in Civilization.

618
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,960
Oh yeah.

619
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,360
When Gandhi, like the nuclear war thing.

620
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,840
You mean they accidentally put, they meant to put zero but they put a hundred.

621
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Yeah, where the computer math redid it so it went up to 255.

622
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Yeah, that's, you know, Y2K kind of thing.

623
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,840
That's what happened to me with my phone.

624
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Clay, what are you, do you have a secret skill?

625
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Uh...

626
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Dancing.

627
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Yeah, dancing is kind of the one.

628
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Oh my god, I forgot that you're an amazing dancer.

629
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Yeah, yeah.

630
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Did you do ballet?

631
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Yeah, I did ballet and tap and jazz.

632
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Wow.

633
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
I did like everything.

634
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,000
I have like a video on one of the dance contest websites because I made it into the Hall of

635
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Fame with my buddy.

636
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,880
You made it into the Hall of Fame?

637
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,480
Yeah, we scored so high in our competition.

638
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,320
You're a Hall of Famer?

639
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,840
What can we search to find this video right now?

640
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,040
It's called, I think it's like Hall of Fame Dance Competition.

641
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,920
Hall of Fame Dance Competition.

642
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
Clay Park, should we search that?

643
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,800
No, it won't be my name.

644
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
It'll be a...

645
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
What year?

646
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,280
What was the crew you were running with?

647
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,280
Fuck, dude. I think it was like 2012 or 2013.

648
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
2012 or 2013.

649
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Hall of Fame Dance Competition.

650
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
This is it? Hall of Fame Dance Challenge?

651
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
And then it'll be a...

652
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Yeah, you gotta scroll down and there's a bunch of dates.

653
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
It's gonna be the Minneapolis one.

654
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Okay. Or the... yeah.

655
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Oh, wow.

656
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Is this you? And then if you scroll down a little bit more...

657
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
It's me, Snitches.

658
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
That's me and my buddy.

659
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Wait, we have to see this right now.

660
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Please tell me this is going to work.

661
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Do you have to buy this?

662
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I'm in the red.

663
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
The red shoes?

664
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Yeah.

665
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
That's you?

666
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Yeah.

667
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Oh my god.

668
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Wait, hip hop? Whoa!

669
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,280
What the hell is going on, man?

670
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Whoa!

671
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
[Laughter]

672
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,940
Dude, that's incredible.

673
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Did you guys trade hats?

674
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,280
Oh my God, wait, that was the hat pass.

675
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Yeah, we were stealing our...

676
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
You just passed your hat?

677
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Yeah, we were stealing hats all the time.

678
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:29,880
Dude, this is incredible.

679
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Do you do a backflip?

680
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
No.

681
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,980
I used to be able to go around with one hand on the ground, though.

682
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,060
They traded the hat back.

683
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,700
That is insane. What was your closer? What was your ender?

684
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,860
My ender? I think it's just, I think he jumps over me.

685
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
Oh!

686
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Yeah. And then, yeah, dude, I don't remember. This is 2012.

687
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,740
You lived another life.

688
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
I know.

689
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Yeah, I did.

690
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
That is incredible, man.

691
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,300
Was this a promising career for young Klay?

692
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,060
No, I don't think so. I liked music a lot.

693
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,140
Yeah, you got music out, right? Yeah, just under your name.

694
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,300
Yeah, I think so. I think, yeah.

695
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,900
Oh my god, man. I've dabbled in a lot of

696
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,100
performance stuff. So you have performance maximum

697
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,620
slider on performance? I wouldn't put it max, but I think it's pretty...

698
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,820
That looked pretty maximum to me. That was fucking amazing.

699
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,980
You filled up your special meter. And that kid is definitely dead now, yeah?

700
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,740
No, he's actually a football player.

701
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,180
He's way taller than I am now.

702
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,180
I think he plays in college, actually.

703
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
He's still in college?

704
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
He's a little younger than you.

705
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:49,620
Yeah, he was like two years younger than I was.

706
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,140
I mean, I'm not a Hall of Fame anything.

707
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,700
I'm going to be real with you.

708
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,700
I got in a film festival.

709
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,340
You got in a film festival?

710
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
That's pretty cool.

711
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,820
Yeah, that's the one high school credit I got.

712
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,060
I didn't do anything.

713
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,740
I did nothing for eight years.

714
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,740
I think I spent a lot of time doing stuff when I was young and now I'm old.

715
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,740
I just want to play 2K and then be funny on stage.

716
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,740
I think this was probably the same year that I started doing stand-up as a kid.

717
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
Really?

718
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
Yeah.

719
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,740
And I gotta say, man, I was much worse at stand-up than you were at dance.

720
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Oh, wow.

721
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,740
Yeah, it was pretty... I mean, this speaks more to how good you were, I would say.

722
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
I know.

723
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
It was pretty impressive.

724
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,740
When they gave us the award, we got to do a little speech.

725
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,740
What'd you say?

726
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,740
I thanked my mom, God, my grandpa, Papa John's.

727
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:42,660
There was like a pancake place around the corner

728
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,700
that we went for breakfast.

729
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,540
- You thanked them?

730
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,500
- That was like the best food.

731
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
- Powered you up?

732
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,260
- I just kept going until they took the mic away from me.

733
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,620
- You got played off in your Hall of Fame speech.

734
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,140
You can't play up a Hall of Famer, man.

735
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,740
What the fuck?

736
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,900
That's fucked up.

737
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,300
- Yeah, I was like 13 and I could like see my mom

738
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,300
the audience just like crying laughing. I thought it was so funny.

739
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,300
(laughter)

740
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Jesus Christ, man.

741
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
That's so sick.

742
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,300
But ballet, I feel like ballet was probably more your bag, huh?

743
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Yeah, that was more fun. I think, like once I got into it, I got into it in like high school.

744
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
What was your favorite?

745
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
You can do the point, the thing.

746
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
No, no, no.

747
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Everybody asks me about that.

748
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Men don't do point usually.

749
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
Exactly.

750
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,060
other male dancers that I danced with in ballet asked our teacher that one time

751
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,300
and our teacher was like no. No you don't get the box shoes. That's only if you're

752
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:40,420
gay. You have to be very gay and very skinny to do that. What was your favorite

753
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:50,720
position? Honestly my favorite position is second. That one is fire. Wide stance. Yeah with the open

754
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,320
I don't know anything about ballet at all.

755
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
Yeah, you wouldn't.

756
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,600
Yeah, I don't keep up with that.

757
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Mostly back then, when I was 2012, I kept up with a lot of skateboarding and stuff.

758
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,080
I thought that I was maybe going to become like a shop hero or something, get free boards

759
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,320
from the shop, and then it turns out I wasn't good at skating at all.

760
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,960
When I was 13, I think I was pretty sure I was going to be a famous director at that

761
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
point.

762
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm going to make a sequel to every Christopher Nolan movie, that type of thing.

763
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,240
That would be cool.

764
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,880
I decided not to do it. I decided to go a different route.

765
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:33,480
Did you see this guy? There's this dude, this TikToker, he's got like a million views,

766
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,040
something like that. He's got a pretty big TikTok account. He made this video where he's like,

767
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,760
"I'm going to scab the writer's strike."

768
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,520
What?

769
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,740
He makes this video where he's like saying he's going to scab the sag strike and the

770
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,740
writer's strike.

771
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,740
By doing what?

772
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,440
Because some production company hit him up and then he's like, "Now that all these

773
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,280
writers and actors are striking, this is my moment."

774
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,760
It's a golden opportunity for people not in the field.

775
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,200
And then the first, he makes this video, it's him in a Tommy Boy t-shirt and he says, he's

776
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:18,640
He's like maybe a couple years older than us too, which is like insane. He says, "I'm currently

777
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,840
writing a movie. It's called Tommy's Boy." Tommy's Boy?

778
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,300
And it's a direct sequel to Tommy Boy. I'm writing roles for all of Chris Farley's brothers

779
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,080
and hopefully, if Lord willing, David Spade will be in this as well.

780
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Wow. Wow.

781
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,800
And it's supposed to be about him being, he's like, "My character's going to be named Chris

782
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,160
for obvious reasons.

783
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,960
Wait, what is it?

784
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,440
It's a sequel.

785
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,840
It's a sequel.

786
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,160
Is Tommy boy, Tommy boy,

787
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,000
dead in the movie's boy.

788
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,060
He grew up without a dad because

789
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,120
Tommy died.

790
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,480
That's crazy.

791
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,600
Oh, wait, Tommy's boy, Tommy,

792
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,080
that's his fucking son.

793
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,200
The story of Tommy.

794
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,020
So it's like son of the mask.

795
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,040
Yeah.

796
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh, my God.

797
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,640
He's going to scab

798
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,080
like the strike and everything. Because this movie is getting picked up. Because this movie has to

799
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:20,840
get picked up because he said his agent knows the director of Tommy Boy. Wow. So I don't know.

800
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,120
But it could happen. Honestly, I want this to get made and then like right when like the strike ends,

801
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:32,280
like, oh shit, it's like shut down or something. No, no, no. We want to be at the premiere of this

802
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,440
movie, Patrick. I don't get this confused. I would scab to be in Tommy's Boy. I want to be

803
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,640
be in this movie badly.

804
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,120
I want to be in it so badly.

805
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,760
This dude's got like millions of

806
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,220
fucking views and shit and all the

807
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,960
videos are just him like with like

808
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,880
like TikTok audios and just going

809
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
like.

810
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,580
And that's and he's like, I'm

811
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,360
writing, I'm the next Grits

812
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
partner.

813
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,460
Yeah, he's awesome for

814
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,880
that.

815
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,700
Dude, there's a fucking video

816
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,520
of him talking about the strike

817
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
and he's like,

818
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,680
like.

819
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,760
This this project, he's probably

820
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,360
working on the project that they probably hit him up with is probably nonunion.

821
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,000
And it's probably not like a big production company that's like currently being

822
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,900
like struck and everything.

823
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,120
But like he immediately goes in on the writer's strike and it's like, you're all

824
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
fucking cowards.

825
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,280
We're not working right now.

826
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,280
And he says this like he's on this he's going on this rant and

827
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,360
like in the middle of his rant, he's like.

828
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,920
And it's really telling that the Screen

829
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,460
Actors Guild calls people scabs who

830
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
aren't in the union.

831
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,220
Wow. That's a lot about their

832
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,220
character. Wow.

833
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,760
It's like, dude,

834
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,160
you're just like burning

835
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,720
every fucking bridge you can

836
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
with sag. That is amazing.

837
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
That is incredible.

838
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,400
Tommy's boy is going to be tough.

839
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,160
Oh, yeah. To get figured out.

840
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
I mean, it's going to be.

841
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Logistically, it's a nightmare.

842
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,480
This shit is already certified for

843
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,680
SBS. Oh, yeah.

844
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,520
It's going to be like, like how

845
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,740
fucking every single like old

846
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,780
like indie movie from like 2012 had like a million production companies on it.

847
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,180
Like 12 different fucking logos before the movie starts.

848
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,940
Yeah. One of those.

849
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,580
Yeah.

850
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,020
That family guy cutaway is so goddamn funny when he's sitting in the theater and

851
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,500
it starts with all the production companies. He's like, Ooh,

852
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,180
he like doesn't know what movie he's seeing.

853
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,500
So he's just assuming he starts the movie.

854
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,220
I've been, um, I,

855
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,900
I have been watching a lot of family guy clips recently, man. Family guy,

856
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,580
It's the best. It's so funny.

857
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,880
Yeah. I can't believe that I ever

858
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,220
was like one of the people who was

859
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
like, "Family Guy." It sucks.

860
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,380
Yeah. I thought I was like, "Family

861
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,680
Guy and Vine ruined

862
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,140
TV comedy." Oh, yeah.

863
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,820
It's fun. It's so funny.

864
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,880
Yeah. It's I like watched

865
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,020
the I watched a YouTube essay

866
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,980
where this guy was like talking about

867
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,100
South Park versus Family Guy.

868
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,940
What did he say? Oh, he detailed the

869
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,720
feud? Yeah. He detailed the feud.

870
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,280
And then he also like broke it down

871
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,800
and he was like, "Family Guy can

872
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,020
still be funny.

873
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,740
It's just not as funny as South Park because it doesn't follow the narrative.

874
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,780
The jokes can just be on their own.

875
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,020
I would probably rather watch a current season Family Guy episode than a current season South

876
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,020
Park episode.

877
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Yeah, for sure.

878
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,020
I probably would.

879
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
I like South Park.

880
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,020
I haven't watched in a couple of years.

881
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
I haven't watched the new ones.

882
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
They're pretty solid.

883
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
I played Stick of Truth and then got back into watching it.

884
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,020
That game is amazing.

885
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,020
That game rules.

886
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,020
That game is so, so good.

887
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,020
Fractured But Whole is not good.

888
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,020
I didn't play that one.

889
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,020
It's not good?

890
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,860
- It's not good?

891
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,280
- It's, yeah, I didn't like it as much.

892
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,860
I didn't even finish it, I didn't like it that much.

893
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,820
- Damn.

894
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,460
- They need to make more games.

895
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,540
- Well, that's Obsidian, Obsidian made that game.

896
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,380
- Yeah, this was like a good RPG.

897
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,860
- People that made New Vegas, yeah.

898
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,480
- They need to make more games that just look exactly

899
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,180
like the show or the movie though.

900
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,100
- Yeah. - You know?

901
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,700
- Yeah, that's what was so sick about it.

902
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,820
- It just looks, it might as well be an episode.

903
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,820
- But that's-- - It might be how

904
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,180
they make the show, I don't know.

905
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,020
- But just speaking of like the family guy,

906
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,100
like he's in the video, the Chris Griffin one,

907
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,760
Yeah, it was like, oh, yeah, that was an

908
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,840
actual that was a dream I had because

909
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,140
around the time that I had that dream,

910
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,860
that's when the like the first couple

911
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,460
of fucking like Subway Surfer

912
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,100
like Family Guy video started coming

913
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,900
out. Oh, yeah.

914
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,420
So I had a dream because the night

915
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,220
before I went to bed because I watched

916
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,320
like a full episode on

917
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,340
the surface thing, like I went

918
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,140
to the channel that it was on and

919
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,140
there's a watch.

920
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,640
And then when the clip ended, I would

921
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,820
scroll up and then watched like again.

922
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,860
Wow. Dude, that changed my brain completely. Once those Subway Surfer Family Guy things

923
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:40,820
started coming out, I literally, I think I spent like, I think, yeah, you guys looked

924
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:49,000
at my screen time on an episode and how it was like, today, it was like you woke up at

925
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,660
what time? I was like, oh, I woke up at 9 and then I think we were recording at like

926
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,700
noon. It said that you had been on your phone the entire time since you woke up. Oh my gosh.

927
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,760
that before I got to the office, I was

928
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,460
fucking watching Subway Surfers Family Guy.

929
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,960
Yeah, I think that's I'm perfectly

930
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,200
built for this time period now.

931
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,340
I think you're in your my brain

932
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,880
like was only built for this time.

933
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,820
I mean, I said earlier, like I would

934
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,220
have been an amazing serve only

935
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,840
physically. I think you probably

936
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,760
would have been like still you would

937
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,440
have had like a frog that you touch

938
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,200
its tummy all day or something.

939
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
I just rubbed a frog.

940
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,880
Yeah, you'd have a stick to stem with.

941
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Yeah, exactly. Just scrolling through a stick.

942
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,980
That's probably, if I was like a knight, I'd probably be the guy with the mace

943
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,640
just so I could swing something around.

944
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,840
You would not. If you were a knight, God, that would be first of all.

945
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,280
I'd be dead. I'd be, I'd be.

946
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,740
No, that would have been some funny shit.

947
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,780
You would have hit your own head with the mace, probably

948
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,340
because you didn't realize that it comes back around when you swing it.

949
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,320
And then also you probably would have ridden your horse backwards,

950
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,780
which would have been kind of funny.

951
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,480
No, I would have.

952
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I would have had a great relationship with my horse.

953
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,340
I know. But you would have.

954
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,440
You would have thought that it was like an avatar kind of thing.

955
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,140
No, the horse would be smarter than me, and then the horse would know where to guide me.

956
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,740
You would try to use the frog to take a picture of yourself with the horse's nuts,

957
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,240
and then it would kick you in the head.

958
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,740
Ribbit?

959
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,240
Yeah.

960
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,540
Hey, hey, oh! Ribbit.

961
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,240
[laughter]

962
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,740
Would you use a frog like a game?

963
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,040
[laughter]

964
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,640
That's what, yeah, that's what you would do.

965
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,940
If we transported you back to Monty Python time...

966
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,040
Like Army of Darkness?

967
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
Arnie of Darkne?

968
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,940
Arnie of Darkne.

969
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,340
You would have been walking around taking a photo with a frog.

970
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,840
Yeah, I would have.

971
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
Here, let me turn the flash on, you pull his tongue out.

972
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,440
Frogs probably looked so different back then, think about that.

973
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,340
You think they're like corn, where we've changed them?

974
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,540
You know corn used to be one kernel?

975
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,440
Really?

976
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,840
One whole kernel?

977
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Maybe just a couple.

978
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Yeah, it was probably...

979
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,940
I think it was three or four.

980
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,340
It was like a bean with corn on it.

981
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,540
That was maize.

982
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,040
And what we have now is corn.

983
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,200
Okay, think about it. Isn't maze just Spanish for corn? No, I think it is. I think it's different

984
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,120
Right. I don't think I think corn maze is just called corn corn. Oh

985
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:09,200
Hold the phone way. Hold on. Wait. Can you say that again? Oh, yeah. Our corn maze is just called corn corn

986
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,840
That's good. That's really good.

987
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,940
You have way better sounds than I have on my...

988
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,640
I have like a gunshot and then I have like the Price is Right.

989
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,840
Oh, that's good. We need to add a couple of things.

990
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,340
Yeah. My brother said the Gangnam Style drop.

991
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,640
Ooh, yeah. That is good.

992
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Yeah.

993
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Wait, talk...

994
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,340
But the... Me or... Yeah, you don't know which one.

995
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,340
Oh, what the fuck?

996
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,340
Yep.

997
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
Yo, that's crazy.

998
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Yep. Yep.

999
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Anytime we have a new guest on...

1000
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,180
- Oh, we show them. - Five minutes of the episode.

1001
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
- You have to show it off. - Yeah.

1002
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
- It's fun. - Yeah.

1003
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
- This is, that's so sick. - Yeah.

1004
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,180
- It's pretty amazing, right? - Yeah.

1005
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,180
- Which cable is he? 'Cause there's also...

1006
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,980
- Are you trying to do low?

1007
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,980
- No, there's this, but I don't know which one.

1008
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,980
- Oh, it's on me. - You got reverbed.

1009
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,980
- Uh-oh. I'm used to reverb now.

1010
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,480
I became a musician while I was in California.

1011
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
- You did? Have you heard his music?

1012
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
- No.

1013
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,980
- Juvio, can you pull these out? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1014
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,980
- You're gonna play it? - I did hear you rapping.

1015
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
The raps, yeah.

1016
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,780
Oh, well, no, well, these are different kinds of raps that you might be used to.

1017
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,380
I showed Dan backstage before we went on stage.

1018
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,380
What did he say?

1019
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,780
I mean, we were about to, I think we had like...

1020
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,780
What did he say?

1021
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,780
We had like two minutes.

1022
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,780
And he said?

1023
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,780
He said it sounds good.

1024
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
You're lying.

1025
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,500
He said it sounded really good.

1026
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,660
So, listen, me and my cousin, Matthew, decided to start working on some music together.

1027
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,840
And I'll play both of these, but the second one's just a snippet because we're still working

1028
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,940
on the verses part.

1029
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:49,200
He's like a hook master. He just started walking around singing this song and I was like, "I

1030
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,940
have to jump on this track." But it's this.

1031
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,940
Wait.

1032
00:45:51,940 --> 00:46:02,940
I got a new telephone and it's got your number. I got it from the phone book. I saw you walking

1033
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,940
across the street and that you looked just so awesome.

1034
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,940
My part.

1035
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:32,500
[Music]

1036
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,100
So we came up with that one.

1037
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,060
- That's awesome.

1038
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,380
- But then, so it had been maybe six hours

1039
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,540
since we recorded this.

1040
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,300
- You guys should hop on a track together.

1041
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,220
- Yeah, dude.

1042
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,340
- You wish.

1043
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,180
But then--

1044
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,580
- Yeah, dude, I wanna collab.

1045
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,820
- You fucking wish.

1046
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,420
You have to pay me, I have a feature fee.

1047
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,260
- Yeah, that's fair.

1048
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,540
- It's over $100,000.

1049
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,260
But then, he came up with something even better, man.

1050
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,160
- Uh-huh.

1051
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,000
- And I want you to hear this.

1052
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,540
I want you to pay attention to these lyrics.

1053
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,380
- Okay.

1054
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:15,260
(music)

1055
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:15,760
Wow.

1056
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,260
And then I, this is the beginning of my part.

1057
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,760
(music)

1058
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,260
But yeah.

1059
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:19,760
Nice.

1060
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,260
I made a new friend, I made a new friend.

1061
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,260
He really likes me.

1062
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,260
They're obsessed with my vanilla ice cream.

1063
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,260
What's that song called?

1064
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,260
called? Trace Flamas. Trace Flamas? Because it's actually me, well I didn't include all

1065
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,420
the verses, but it's me, my cousin Matthew, and my cousin Diven. Diven? Yeah, so the three

1066
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,940
of us, he's from Peru. Okay. So if you have anything to say about that, go ahead. They

1067
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:51,100
don't eat koi. They don't, no, they do eat koi. Peruvians eat kui. Yeah, but yeah, I

1068
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,540
didn't ask him about that because I got scared, but I learned, I got scared that he would

1069
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,460
say yeah that's my favorite food. So I didn't ask him about it.

1070
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:06,140
Matthew: I do, there was, by the Popeyes in Bushwick, there was people selling Cuy on

1071
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,140
big swords.

1072
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,140
Ryan: I was talking to Noah about that.

1073
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,140
Noah: Whoa, do you get the sword?

1074
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,140
Matthew: No, you don't get the sword.

1075
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,380
Ryan: That better be, for people who don't know, Cuy is guinea pig and they sell them

1076
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,260
on swords, but they better be slain with the sword. It better be something where they stick

1077
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,460
them and then that's it.

1078
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,460
Matthew: C-U-Y.

1079
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,460
Ryan: C-U-Y?

1080
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:30,460
C-U-Y? Not Clarkson University in Hudson. C-U-Y. Y as in, oh no, it's I. Oh, okay. Yeah, so that's

1081
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:36,120
it. So that's Quee. Yeah, remember, wait, that photo right there, we used to have a Quee

1082
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,260
tote bag. They had a picture of that on it. Yeah, I had a, yeah, well I didn't know, we

1083
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,020
didn't lose it in the flood, we lost it. Why'd they give him a helmet and put a pepper in

1084
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:51,020
his mouth? That actually looks amazing. It looks kind of cute. Yeah, it was a fucking

1085
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,420
guinea pig. Of course it was cute. Yeah, it was cute at one point, but we lost the

1086
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:02,020
cue, the coy tote bag because of the night that I found Moe on the street.

1087
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:08,380
Oh, and he had, um, well I had found Moe and then his brother Tyson chicken and,

1088
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,980
uh, died. Tyson chicken died away. Yeah. And I didn't want to laugh at the name.

1089
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,420
Tyson chicken. I was like, I can't laugh at our boy. I didn't think I was going to

1090
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:24,420
keep him so I gave them like pet finder names. But Moe's original name was The Simpsons.

1091
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:31,880
And then my roommate Neil said I don't want to hear you walk around the house saying Simpsons.

1092
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,020
You should not be naming your animals funny names man.

1093
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:38,820
Well I wasn't going to keep him. And then he was a foster fail.

1094
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,980
That means he becomes nothing, he becomes an object if you're walking around he's the

1095
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,980
Simpsons.

1096
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,860
Yeah I know now he's got a name.

1097
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,780
What's he short for?

1098
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,780
Moe Slizlak.

1099
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,220
So it's still the Simpsons a little bit.

1100
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,220
Kind of.

1101
00:49:53,220 --> 00:50:01,140
But yeah, we thought, so Moe's brother who died pooped on the tote bag because he couldn't

1102
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,180
handle, he had like no bowel muscle or something.

1103
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,620
He was like, that cat was, this is a bummer.

1104
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,620
Why am I talking about this?

1105
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,620
Born to die.

1106
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,620
Born to die.

1107
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
That cat was born to die.

1108
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,140
But coming up on a year of Moe.

1109
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,140
Wow.

1110
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,460
the on the 28th of August. I hate that cat man. You don't hate him. Do you ever call

1111
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:31,100
Moe over by being like, "Hey, Hugh J-ness." Oh yes. And then Moe's like, "That's not,

1112
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:37,940
where am I going?" Is that why you named him Moe? Because that actually happens? I was

1113
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,900
just thinking about like. You were just thinking about that part in the series? Yeah. And I

1114
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,400
I was like, it would be funny to call your cat over, but it wouldn't really work.

1115
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
Yeah, cat wouldn't.

1116
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,780
Well, yeah, he doesn't have a phone.

1117
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,740
I don't I don't like funny dog names, man.

1118
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,620
Cat names.

1119
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,780
You named your dog.

1120
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,360
My dog's name is human name.

1121
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,280
His name is Phil.

1122
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,820
I like that's a normal name.

1123
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,960
Mo is a normal name.

1124
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,540
Also, my brother had a dog, very sweet dog.

1125
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,340
But he named him Cabrón.

1126
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,160
Cabrón?

1127
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,340
Cabrón.

1128
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,120
Like bastard?

1129
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,340
Means bastard.

1130
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,260
Wow, that's tough.

1131
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,000
Or fucker, like piece of shit.

1132
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,920
It means everything.

1133
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
Pretty much every.

1134
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,320
It's just an everything curse word. They figured it out in Spanish. You just need one cuss.

1135
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,880
Yeah. You need one or two.

1136
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,480
And it's all context dependent.

1137
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,720
That's kind of sweet.

1138
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Yeah, you don't need...

1139
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
That's the best way to cuss.

1140
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,320
I think the Chinese do that too.

1141
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,320
Really?

1142
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,480
I think so. That could be wrong.

1143
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,920
I've been back into Xiao Ma videos and I think I want to learn perfect Chinese.

1144
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,080
Him and Rex need to link up.

1145
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:37,960
I think that I could learn any language very easily.

1146
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,400
I've been trying to learn Irish, Gaelic.

1147
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,200
You seem to me like somebody who knows perfect Spanish.

1148
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,200
No, I'm so stupid.

1149
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
Okay.

1150
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
I can't learn very good.

1151
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,200
I've been duolinguing Chinese though.

1152
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
Really?

1153
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,200
You've been trying to learn it?

1154
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,200
Yeah.

1155
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Can you give us a taste?

1156
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Ni hao.

1157
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,200
Fuck you.

1158
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
Fuck you.

1159
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,200
That is what they say.

1160
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Yeah, no shit that's what they say.

1161
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,200
What else?

1162
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
That's the first one.

1163
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
You can say "Zai shen."

1164
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
I've never heard goodbye.

1165
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,200
Yeah.

1166
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,200
"Zai shen."

1167
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,200
And then I'm also a Chinese.

1168
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,760
And then I'm also it's all pronunciation based. I might be fucking it up. Yeah saying something different

1169
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:22,420
That's cool

1170
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,080
Yeah

1171
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:30,120
What else you got? What else I used to be able to count to ten, but I haven't done it. No. Okay, so you're here

1172
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,660
You're not learning Chinese. You're forgetting it. Yeah. Yeah currently I'm forgetting in the

1173
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,200
I gotta get back on the Irish stuff.

1174
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
Don't learn Irish man.

1175
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
It looks cool though.

1176
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,200
That is not a cool language. If you're going to spend the time to learn a language, learn one that you can actually talk to people with.

1177
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,200
I'm learning it. Well yeah, I want to talk to an old Irish person.

1178
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,200
There's nobody who speaks Gaelic that doesn't speak English.

1179
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,200
He wants to be able to tweet on the Irish side of Twitter where everything sounds, like looks wrong.

1180
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
Oh yeah.

1181
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Unless you figure it all out.

1182
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I ne'er want that shit. I hate that shit.

1183
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,940
I was learning it though, and it's just like dude. It's it

1184
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:13,320
Yeah, it was sound like a goblin language honestly. I do they have do a lingo for that. Yeah, I'm learning it unfair

1185
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,440
I guess and bond what's that a man and a woman?

1186
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,040
And what are they doing?

1187
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,500
August and bond there for their fucking

1188
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:30,720
Unfair I guess I'm bond and second and they're fucking it looks like white pet. Yeah, I

1189
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,120
I got shown an amazing white Jamaican rapper recently.

1190
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
Really?

1191
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,120
Who's really good.

1192
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
What's his name?

1193
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,120
I don't remember his name.

1194
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:49,400
Have you seen those videos of Killian Murphy talking and people are saying like holy shit

1195
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,120
the cork accent just sounds like slow Jamaican.

1196
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,120
No.

1197
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,680
Dude it's crazy.

1198
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:02,200
It's like an actual, like, I guess the Irish, like, were, like, the English sent, like, the

1199
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:08,760
Irish to Jamaica, so now, like, the Jamaican accent is, like, it's interlinked with Irish.

1200
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,360
Yeah, Jamaican accent is basically Irish.

1201
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
Oh, yeah.

1202
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,360
Yeah.

1203
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,360
That's so cool.

1204
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,360
I mean, it's definitely, I would rather...

1205
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,960
It might be the only cool thing Irish people ever did.

1206
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,920
No, they did a lot of cool stuff until they invented whiskey.

1207
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,920
Really?

1208
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,560
Yeah, once they invented whiskey, they'd fuck it. My buddy was telling me about that. I

1209
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,520
don't know everything, but there was like a good chunk of years where they were just

1210
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,880
inventing the hell out of stuff.

1211
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,880
Yeah, really?

1212
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,080
Found whiskey and they were like, "We're done."

1213
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:40,320
I learned about an amazing thing that I want to try, which is ether, which used to be a

1214
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,120
big problem in Ireland.

1215
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
Ether?

1216
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,120
Ether.

1217
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
Like from fear and loathing?

1218
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that exact thing. They used to, ether used to be like, they used to

1219
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,280
give it to like kids and stuff.

1220
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,280
It was just you put it in a rag and you smell it?

1221
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,400
It basically ruined all of these countries for like a hundred years because everybody

1222
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
was addicted to ether.

1223
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Is it like poppers?

1224
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Kind of, yeah.

1225
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Yeah, it's like a...

1226
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
It's probably proto-poppers.

1227
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
It's basically...

1228
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Natural poppers.

1229
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,680
I think it is basically like poppers that get you drunk instead of...

1230
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Opening your butthole.

1231
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,120
It's not just that.

1232
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,440
You know, I've done poppers one time and I really put all of my focus, like I kind of

1233
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,560
I meditated on my asshole for like a full minute,

1234
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,960
and it did not feel any more bigger.

1235
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,800
- Maybe you're just--

1236
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,640
- What about a guy who--

1237
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,840
- Maybe you're thinking too much.

1238
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,280
- Takes poppers and then goes to take a shit.

1239
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,320
(laughing)

1240
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,480
- That, I could see that.

1241
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,320
- I did that.

1242
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,360
I've done poppers and then just been like,

1243
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,840
I gotta go, I gotta go shit so bad.

1244
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,200
I didn't realize I ate so much food earlier.

1245
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,040
- Yeah.

1246
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,360
- It helps, honestly.

1247
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,320
- It helps you shit?

1248
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,440
- I believe it.

1249
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,720
- I just, keeping a bottle of fucking Rush in the bathroom.

1250
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:54,040
it. I've been able to shit for like three days. That'd be kind of fun if you kept that like

1251
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,520
next to the matches on the top of the toilet. That would be funny. It's at least nice for

1252
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:04,400
your guests. Yeah. You know? Yeah, but people who... Well, but then yeah, you walk in and

1253
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,600
somebody put a shampoo bottle up their ass and you're like, "Oh, fuck me, I left the

1254
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:15,040
poppers in there." No, I just think that like, because I imagine the poppers buying process

1255
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,040
is you can get them at pretty much any vape shop.

1256
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,040
It's so easy dude.

1257
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,960
But it's got to be more, I would just be scared of the kind of, like you remember the first

1258
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,960
time you bought condoms?

1259
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
Yeah.

1260
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
And you were like, they're going to arrest me.

1261
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,160
Well I was blessed with self-checkout at Walmart.

1262
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
Oh.

1263
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
That's what I was doing.

1264
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
Oh, okay.

1265
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,640
See I had the sweetest old lady in the world.

1266
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,640
Yeah.

1267
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,800
And I would always buy one.

1268
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
I'm going to rail someone.

1269
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,080
I would always buy one other thing.

1270
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,080
Yeah.

1271
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,000
But I think that made it worse because I would buy, I'll buy, oh, this young man's buying

1272
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:53,240
boggle. How's your day going? Oh, very good. The smallest size condom that they have. Put

1273
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,600
it right on top of the boggle. That'll be it for me.

1274
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,080
There was a time in my life where I kept this receipt because I would buy another thing,

1275
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:07,640
and I was, you know, I was like 17. I was like, this will be so funny. And the receipt

1276
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:13,800
I kept was, it's gone now, but it was just condoms, one eye patch.

1277
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,080
Same, like I was like...

1278
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,320
That's a problem, dude.

1279
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,600
Make it look like you're like, "I'm in the same aisle, so I'm just like,

1280
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,100
"Uh..."

1281
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:27,320
That's the fucking problem. If you're buying condoms, lube, anything like

1282
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,680
that, and then you buy anything else with that, they're gonna assume that

1283
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,880
it's all going to sex.

1284
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,380
Yeah.

1285
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:40,000
So I've bought something I bought intimate products and then also dog food

1286
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,900
and dog toys.

1287
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:47,100
I did that a couple months ago and then I left and I was like that's that was

1288
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:52,900
probably really weird for that later. Yeah, I'm buying dog toys, dog food and

1289
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,600
different kind of dog bone. I bought a full bone and then one of the rawhide

1290
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,400
pig ears.

1291
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,400
Like I just that's just not it should be two different transactions. Yeah, the

1292
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,480
last time I bought a condom it was in a bodega and I bought this better been

1293
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,520
years I bought them for a sketch yeah for cave to pull out of his pocket and

1294
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:18,640
have it there so I bought like a Red Bull and the biggest condoms I could find

1295
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:27,920
nice and the guys just like the first time I got condoms though my mom bought

1296
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,420
bought them for me. Oh, that's actually nice. That's not nice. You should not do that. It was bad.

1297
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,420
No, it's weird. It's weird, but it's like... They're just sitting in my room, on my room bed, it's used to.

1298
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,420
Well, it's like, it's nice of your mom to think like, "Oh, my kids fucking..."

1299
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,920
When she bought them, she bought them just because you were going to college?

1300
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,920
I started, I started like hanging out with this girl a lot and my mom was like, "Oh, you're hanging out with this

1301
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,920
girl a lot. I want you to be safe." And I was like, "Okay." Yeah, she didn't want you to have a kid.

1302
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,120
Yeah, because I, dude, I can't have a kid.

1303
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,120
Yeah, me neither.

1304
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,120
I would be a bad dad.

1305
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,160
I'd be a great dad, but I'd be a bad dad.

1306
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
Yeah.

1307
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,160
Why would you be a great weekend dad?

1308
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:12,960
I think you'd be a good, I think you, I could see you as kind of a 50 year old dad.

1309
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,960
Yeah.

1310
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,120
You know, I think the 30s, those are going to be bad, man.

1311
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,120
You think your 20s have been bad.

1312
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,120
You're going to have a bad 30s.

1313
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
Yeah, I don't know.

1314
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,560
I don't know anything.

1315
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,840
I can't, I can't take care of a child.

1316
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,320
I can't take care of myself.

1317
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,880
My mom literally will be like, "I'm so proud of you when I do something adult."

1318
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,320
And I'm 25 and I'm like, "Do you think I'm incapable?"

1319
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,240
And it's like, she does think I'm incapable.

1320
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
That's very sweet.

1321
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,680
Like, I got my ID and she's like, "You did it all by yourself."

1322
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,680
I'm like, "Yeah, I'm an adult."

1323
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,680
You went to the DMV?

1324
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
Yeah, twice.

1325
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,880
In New York, I fucked it up.

1326
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,200
My ID's been expired for like four months.

1327
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,200
That's so cool.

1328
00:59:50,200 --> 01:00:05,200
have

1329
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,240
change mine soon. I've got to go back to New Hampshire then.

1330
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,040
Just get it renewed. Just say, use all the same information.

1331
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:19,400
My ID photo, I'm wondering how long I can keep this going because I had to get my ID

1332
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:27,580
renewed during the peak of lockdown. Got my ID renewed, took them a couple months to even

1333
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:32,240
get the paperwork done. They lost the paperwork, I had to refile it, then I had to go back

1334
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:39,240
again to -- because I forgot to put my address down. Even though I had already fucking filed

1335
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:47,840
it, now my ID photo since I was 18 has been a photo of me the day before I got my state

1336
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,960
issue.

1337
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,040
So you're 17.

1338
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,480
Yeah, the photo that I hand to bartenders is like -- I'll pull it out.

1339
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,480
Mine I have hair and it says I'm 5'11".

1340
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,480
Mine is a mug shot.

1341
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,480
I look like a little boy.

1342
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,480
I said I was 6'1".

1343
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,480
Let me see.

1344
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,480
You said you were 6'1"?

1345
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,480
Are you 6'1"?

1346
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,480
No, I'm only 6 foot tall.

1347
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,480
Oh, okay.

1348
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,160
I cheated two full inches, but they don't measure you, so you can just say whatever

1349
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,160
you want.

1350
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,160
I was honest, too.

1351
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:24,800
You look fucking...you look honestly so good and Cuban in this photo.

1352
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,280
It's fucking crazy.

1353
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,040
You look insanely Cuban.

1354
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:36,040
I put mascara in my mustache in that photo.

1355
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,040
Really?

1356
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,880
Because I was 17, I couldn't grow any facial hair.

1357
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,880
That rules.

1358
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,880
My dad used to do that when he was dating my mom.

1359
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Really?

1360
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
Your mom would come home with a little fucking mascara mustache.

1361
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
Did that work?

1362
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,880
I should try that.

1363
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,680
Before I was born, my dad would fill it in with mascara.

1364
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,920
I thought about doing it.

1365
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,600
Well, you have a decent beard.

1366
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,360
Yeah, I just have like little patches.

1367
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,640
I always was like, oh, I'll get a beard when I'm older.

1368
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,920
My dad has a beard. But then anytime I look at my dad's beard, it's the worst

1369
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,200
fucking beard. I'm never going to grow facial hair.

1370
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,580
I just I'll never be able to do it.

1371
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:09,120
Dude, shaving the mustache is the worst thing I've done.

1372
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,320
You look so crazy.

1373
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,240
You look good right now. This is a nice kind of length.

1374
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,840
Dude, yeah, you grew back real quick.

1375
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,240
Yeah.

1376
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,240
Like faster than I did.

1377
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,600
I'm waiting. So I shaved it on the...

1378
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,080
I have like a timer.

1379
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,760
Like I have it in my like calendar.

1380
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,240
Really? It's organized.

1381
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,680
I'll see how long it's gonna grow.

1382
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,480
Like I took the photo the day that I completely shaved it.

1383
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,640
- You're doing progress pics.

1384
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,820
- Yeah, I'm gonna do like a photo in a month

1385
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,660
and see what happens.

1386
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,800
- We need to give you like a Minoxidil face mask

1387
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,480
and see if we can fill in the rest of your face.

1388
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,320
I think it's possible.

1389
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,460
- Dude, you see up here?

1390
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,300
- That's what I mean.

1391
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,080
You are so close to having a--

1392
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,600
- Full Wolfman face.

1393
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,420
- A 60 or 70% face. - I have like,

1394
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,400
I grow hair right under my eye.

1395
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,240
- Yeah, I know.

1396
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,200
If we put Minoxidil, if you closed your eyes,

1397
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,640
you would grow it on your eyelids.

1398
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,960
It would be so fucked up.

1399
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,560
I could do that like the massager thing.

1400
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:55,860
Yeah.

1401
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,260
Have you seen this dude on Instagram?

1402
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:02,760
He like has completely like pushed his hairline forward just by using like

1403
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,560
rosemary oil and like minoxidil.

1404
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,160
All that shit.

1405
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,460
Oh, rosemary oil, minoxidil, and then like massaging his scalp and shit.

1406
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,660
My stepdad sits under a red light helmet every night.

1407
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,760
And it doesn't work at all.

1408
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,560
But I have a friend who uses rosemary oil.

1409
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,660
He's got a full head of hair, but he's like so nervous.

1410
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:28,040
Yeah, I was not nervous enough when I started losing my hair. I really was like, anytime

1411
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,560
did somebody be like, "Your hair is all fucked up." I'd go, "Yeah, man, it's crazy. It's

1412
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:35,960
always been like this since I was a kid." But it's just not true.

1413
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:40,520
When you had, there's like that photo of you, there's a photo I took of him eating a McChicken.

1414
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,460
It's bad that you remember specific photos where my hair looks bad.

1415
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:49,960
It was a photo I used for an episode recently, which is why I remember it. It was the Grommer

1416
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:55,880
episode. Anyone can look this photo up. That was a year ago? No. Probably close to. That

1417
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:02,760
was a couple months ago. Holy shit, it's August. Yep, it's flying by. Oh fuck it is. Oh my

1418
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,800
god. Tell me how ugly I looked in this photo, go ahead. Your hair looks like the top of

1419
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:16,240
a, maybe like the roots of an onion. You look like a weeble. You look like you would never

1420
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,240
never fall down. So,

1421
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,240
(laughter)

1422
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,240
fuck you, bitch ass. I'm going to take this sticker off.

1423
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1424
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,240
Suck on my balls.

1425
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,240
No, keep the sticker on. I'm sorry that I said that.

1426
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
I don't care.

1427
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,240
I'm sorry I said that. Keep the sticker on.

1428
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,240
Say my dreadlocks look good.

1429
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
You had white dreads.

1430
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,240
I did want, I wanted dreadlocks for so long. Way longer, even past when I knew it wasn't good to have them.

1431
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,240
Yeah.

1432
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:46,240
I really wanted dreadlocks and to listen to Kid Cudi. I wanted that so badly.

1433
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,240
That's K1's white dreadlocks.

1434
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,240
I know, he has what I wanted.

1435
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,240
Yeah.

1436
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:57,240
He's living that life that I just wanted so bad. I had a dream where I was going to move to the Bahamas

1437
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,240
and I was going to have white dreadlocks and I was going to work in a surf shop.

1438
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,240
You can still do it.

1439
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,240
Yeah.

1440
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,240
I believe in you.

1441
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,240
The thing is dreadlocks have to be the easiest hair transplant you can get.

1442
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,240
Yeah.

1443
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,240
Right?

1444
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,240
Adam Duritz, dude.

1445
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,240
Oh, that guy. Those are real.

1446
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,240
Those are real?

1447
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,240
They gotta be real. He's had them for so long.

1448
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,240
No, look him up, because they look crazy now.

1449
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:23,240
He definitely has either a beard transplant or is like wearing a piece of Velcro on his face.

1450
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,240
There's no way he's wearing Velcro on his fucking face.

1451
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,240
Dude.

1452
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,240
What am I looking...

1453
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,240
Look up Adam Duritz counting crows.

1454
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,240
He is like...

1455
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,240
There's no way his facial hair is real.

1456
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:47,880
I want to see this. That's fine. He looks good, man. That's real. You think that's fake?

1457
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,880
Did he get rid of the dreadlocks?

1458
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,880
God, I hope not.

1459
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,520
Well, he's definitely dyeing it.

1460
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,000
I mean, that might be true.

1461
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah. Well, okay. There's no way that those dreadlocks are real.

1462
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,680
How are they not? I mean, they look real to me, man.

1463
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,240
There's no way. That is a wig.

1464
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,240
That is a wig.

1465
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,240
Look at the hairline, that's not a wig.

1466
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,240
That is a wig that he made to look like that.

1467
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,240
You're jealous, bro.

1468
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,240
I'm so jealous.

1469
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,240
You're fucking jealous.

1470
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,240
I could look like this if I tried.

1471
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,240
If I put in the effort.

1472
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,240
You could look like that if you tried.

1473
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,240
Yeah.

1474
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
I mean, I could definitely look like that.

1475
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,240
But the dreadlock.

1476
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,240
He's kind of cool.

1477
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,240
He is cool, man.

1478
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,240
County Crows is probably one of the five best bands ever.

1479
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,240
"Won't you stay and watch the problem, baby?

1480
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,240
Watch the problem, I don't know how, baby."

1481
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,240
That's them.

1482
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,080
- Yeah, I know.

1483
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,480
They did a, Shrek soundtrack is an amazingly underrated album.

1484
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,080
♪ Come on, come on, love a little fan-mer ♪

1485
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:43,920

1486
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,960
- Love a little fan-mer?

1487
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,200
♪ Framlin', Lennon, Sander ♪

1488
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,040

1489
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,080

01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,400

1493
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,440
(sad trombone music)

1494
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,040
- I was singing it correctly.

1495
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,000
- It's none of the lyrics.

1496
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,840
- It was all the lyrics.

1497
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,660
- Didn't get a single, didn't get a single.

1498
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,500
- I said all of them.

1499
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,340
- As a current and future--

1500
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,360
- I said come on, come on.

1501
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,320
Musician man, you did not get any of that shirt right.

1502
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,480
- I'm talking to two musicians today.

1503
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,480
- I got a new friend, they really like me.

1504
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,320
They're obsessed with my vanilla ice cream.

1505
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,460
- I think it's cool that you can remember the lyrics.

1506
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,280
- With the chocolate sauce and the iced tea.

1507
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,180
- 'Cause every time I've ever written a song, I'd never,

1508
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:27,160
I was playing in a band for like two years in high school.

1509
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,480
And we'd go on and I would, different lyrics to,

1510
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,200
music, same thing, but the words.

1511
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,760
- The thing is, live music,

1512
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,720
Nobody's here in a single fucking word you're singing, man.

1513
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,440
Who can just say watermelon, watermelon?

1514
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:39,960
Who cares?

1515
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,480
No one's here and the lyrics at a house show.

1516
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,240
Doesn't matter.

1517
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,840
You think that they got a proper mixer there?

1518
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,720
No fucking hell, no.

1519
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,240
No, but it was funny because I just would hit the same melody,

1520
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,240
but I'd be like...

1521
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,800
That's why I suck at karaoke so bad.

1522
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,280
I don't know what it is.

1523
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,360
I can't remember lyrics to any songs.

1524
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,760
Can you not read fast enough?

1525
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,920
I think it's fine.

1526
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Cause that's my problem with karaoke when I do something like Drake or Eminem.

1527
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,920
Cause I know the words but I'm trying to follow them on the screen.

1528
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,420
Yeah.

1529
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,420
And then I get tripped up.

1530
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,420
Oh, you get tripped up by specific Drake certain words.

1531
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1532
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,420
You gotta stop saying certain things.

1533
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,920
The timing gets screwed up when you can't say that word.

1534
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1535
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,920
Which I, honestly I think they should stop saying it so I can rap along.

1536
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,920
I'm with you. I'm with you.

1537
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,920
That's why I like Christian rappers.

1538
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,920
Yeah.

1539
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:39,960
I went to on my birthday, I ended up at this weird birthday, some guy's like 32nd birthday

1540
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,400
party and it was Barbenheimer themed and I was like there's no way I'm staying here.

1541
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,400
That is awesome.

1542
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,120
On your birthday you went to another birthday?

1543
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,120
By accident yes.

1544
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,040
How was this an accident?

1545
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,000
Someone was like go to this address.

1546
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,400
Oh and you just do whatever.

1547
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,200
I was just kind of following the night.

1548
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:02,000
It was my birthday, I was pretty drunk, I was at an event that had free booze.

1549
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,520
And I was like, "Alright, this is the rhythm of the night!"

1550
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,960
And I'm just going in Ubers and stuff.

1551
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,720
They did Reeboks or Nikes?

1552
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,720
Oh my god.

1553
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:17,880
And then I end up there, I went to one spot that had free beer, to that spot that had

1554
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,840
free beer, and then I was like, "I can't stomach this."

1555
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,480
And then I left and went to the karaoke bar.

1556
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,240
You couldn't stomach how cringe it was.

1557
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,240
I went to a karaoke bar. I hate cringe ass birthdays.

1558
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,240
The 30 second themed birthday party, come on now.

1559
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,240
What is the problem with that? You're 32, don't have a birthday anymore.

1560
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,240
You walk a mile in their shoes, buddy.

1561
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:44,240
Yeah, that's true. When you're 30, we're going to an axe throwing bar.

1562
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:53,240
But we went, me and my girlfriend and Brandon, we went to the karaoke bar in Chinatown.

1563
01:09:53,240 --> 01:10:00,240
and I kept getting the mic handed to me on songs that I don't know.

1564
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,240
(laughter)

1565
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,240
That's a bad feeling.

1566
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,240
And songs I don't know all of the lyrics to. I know the chorus.

1567
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,240
Just make it up.

1568
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,240
No one was, everyone was outside smoking. It was like kind of packed in there.

1569
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,240
Everyone's outside smoking, so no one's hearing when their song is coming up.

1570
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,240
Okay. So you're doing all of them.

1571
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,240
I'm getting, I was getting like every song.

1572
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,240
That's the dream karaoke.

1573
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,240
Yeah, but I don't know the song.

1574
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,640
You got to do a set list.

1575
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,680
But I did get to do Dancing in the Dark.

1576
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,280
Yes.

1577
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,280
And then I had to do Smash Mouth.

1578
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:28,720
Which one?

1579
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,120
All Star?

1580
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:29,720
All Star.

1581
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,560
Oh, that's some funny ass shit.

1582
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,360
But that was fucking epic as hell.

1583
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:33,920
Yeah, that is.

1584
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,120
That would go crazy hard.

1585
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,240
I did go hard as fuck on it.

1586
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:37,720
I believe you.

1587
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,360
That went amazing.

1588
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,040
Did you do Screamo?

1589
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:40,520
No.

1590
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,560
Oh.

1591
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,400
Actually, I did a little bit.

1592
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,840
Yes.

1593
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,480
Because Panic at the Disco went on.

1594
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,520
Not Screamo, though.

1595
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,600
Not Screamo.

1596
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,400
All right, Clay, where can people find you?

1597
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,920
Because I have to go piss so bad.

1598
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,200
Oh, we've been doing this for, I can't tell because it's not recording on here.

1599
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,000
You can find me on Instagram @bitchrespecter and Twitter.

1600
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,840
Continues, ignore him.

1601
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,840
Hand job.

1602
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,960
Yeah, that's easy for people to know.

1603
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,400
H-A-N-F-J-O-B.

1604
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,160
There he is.

1605
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,280
There he is on Instagram.

1606
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
There's his Instagram.

1607
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,800
You should get one of those, you should get one of those link trees or something.

1608
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Look at that handsome ass photo.

1609
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,280
Holy fucking wow.

1610
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,600
You look like a beautiful painter.

1611
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,520
Oh, there's tons of drawings of you.

1612
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,000
Wow.

1613
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,120
Yeah, people like drawing me.

1614
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,160
There's a video of me falling off a chair, like breaking a chair.

1615
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,160
You look purple there.

1616
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,160
It's grimace.

1617
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,160
Whoa. And check out Lunch Enjoyer on Instagram.

1618
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,160
That's some funny shit. Is that Drake?

1619
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,160
Yeah. Oh my god. He stole that photo from me.

1620
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,160
I did steal that photo from him.

1621
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,160
Alright, I have to go pee. Bye. Bye bye.

1622
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,160
Oh my...

1623
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:43,160
So I'm actually, I'm actually

1624
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,160
pretty sure that Rodney went to sleep because right now

1625
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,160
I'm calling him and it's just ringing, ringing and he usually

1626
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,160
declines my calls after one ring.

1627
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:55,740
So I think that he's maybe he thinks his phone was compromised. Yeah, that's a good maybe we should or something. Yeah hit

1628
01:11:55,740 --> 01:12:02,240
Okay, we'll try to call him right now. Yeah, I think it's just gonna ring unfortunately. Oh look at this camera

1629
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:07,680
This is definitely gonna turn him off. Yeah, it's just my computer. He's looking at it

1630
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:11,240
So he didn't get turned off at all when I called him like five times. Yeah, he kept talking to me

1631
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:15,380
I do think I truly do think he's probably probably just have to wake him up. Yeah

1632
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:18,040
Yeah, I think we're gonna keep

1633
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,400
I just call him on his normal cell

1634
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,080
maybe

1635
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,400
If you want to yeah, that's not such a bad idea. Yeah, did Rodney definitely fell asleep

1636
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,280
Yeah, or I think the Illuminati number is compromised. Maybe he knows what?

1637
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:37,380
Right now yeah, I think they're listening in and that's why hang that up hang that up. They're not only listening in

1638
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:45,560
Google Voice

1639
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,400
Illuminati.

1640
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:51,680
OK. OK.

1641
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,520
So when did that become a Google voice

1642
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,520
number?

1643
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,640
OK, so when did that become a Google voice number?

1644
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:03,920
Oh, he's probably got a Google phone.

1645
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,920
I mean, this guy cannot.

1646
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:10,000
Yeah, I think he I think he put his phone

1647
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,840
under his bed.

1648
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,840
Yeah.

1649
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,440
God, that's so disappointing.

1650
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,800
It's horrible.

1651
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,400
All right, well, I'll leave a voicemail if I can. Does Google

1652
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,480
voice even let you do what?

1653
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,100
Here we go.

1654
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,800
You've made a huge mistake.

1655
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:34,000
Okay,

1656
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,200
Pierce, that is what the number one thing you don't want to say

1657
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,000
the Illuminati.

1658
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,200
You said you threatened them. I don't care the Illuminati and

1659
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,200
we're here with you.

1660
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,880
guest on the episode. And you do this? This is messed up. I don't care. I don't even care.

1661
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:57,040
This is completely messed up. I'm not scared of them. I think they're stupid. I honestly

1662
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,560
don't even think this guy's holding it really.

1663
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,900
