00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,160
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,980
(laughing)

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,820
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,660
- Oh, ow.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,560
Ah, ouch.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,820
Ugh, Caleb stop.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,940
- No.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,240
- Ow.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,080
- No.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,440
- Ugh.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,760
- You don't, you better bring that tushy back over here,

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Don't!

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Ouch!

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Ouch!

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Ouch!

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Reacting like Mario when he falls into lava.

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
His butt turns red and you bounce away.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Ouch!

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Ouch!

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Caleb just gave me a purple nurple.

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
Yeah, on your, you know what.

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
On my butt, on your thing.

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Why are you so quiet, Caleb?

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Because my heart is racing.

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
My heart has been beating out of my chest for like

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,120
like a like a it's exciting to have a

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,400
two hours. I didn't realize it was 140 milligrams of caffeine. I thought because it was a tea.

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,800
You're dead. You're fucking dead. I drank that yeah that fucking monster I got this morning

31
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,280
I don't know if it leaked in my bag or not I don't know what happened. Oh yeah it was half empty.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,400
It was half full yeah. I feel like I feel like it was like yeah well like because your bag was like

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,320
not that wet and also it was still like like you left it on the table for a long time and there was

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,640
nothing around it so I feel like it wasn't leaking I feel like it was just like that. Yeah I think it

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,080
it just came half full. Because it was it was... Oh, they must have ran out of monster.

36
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Yeah, they ran out at the factory. It was a sugar-free monster but not a zero

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,240
ultra. And I haven't seen one of those in months. So why is that the thing?

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,040
So you actually think they just ran out halfway through and they're like we're not gonna

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
make a whole nother batch just to fill this fucking can. No, I think maybe they've discontinued

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,320
production of zero sugar monster. And how does that have to do with the half?

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
- What does it have to do with the thing being half-empty?

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
- 'Cause I don't know.

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,080
- Bitch.

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,600
- They discontinued doing it normally

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,560
and now they only do it with mistakes.

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
- They discontinued it.

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,560
- It got too expensive.

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,640
And it's like, you know how they have a bunch of air

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,460
in a chip bag? - It keeps evaporating

50
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,300
in the can.

51
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,840
- Yeah, they just started doing that with drinks now.

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
- Yeah.

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,520
- They're just trying to rip us off.

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
- Maybe the bodega worker--

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,740
- Bodega?

56
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,120
- It wasn't a bodega, it was the worst gas station

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
of all time.

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,880
- That's literally what a bodega is.

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,000
(laughing)

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,080
- That's true, you know what?

61
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
- Yeah.

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,280
What if that guy was like siphoning it out?

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Yeah, you can't--

64
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,720
- Oh yeah, that was that gas station where we walked in.

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,560
- Oh yeah, nothing worked.

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,180
- He was like, "Yeah, it's cash only."

67
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,040
And we bought stuff with cash and the ATM didn't work.

68
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,480
And then I tried to buy gas with cash

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
because the debit card part of it didn't work.

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,560
And he was like, "Yeah, that just doesn't work either."

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,440
And I was like, "Oh, this place sucks."

72
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
And he was like, "Yeah, I know."

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
(laughing)

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,040
"Yeah, I know it sucks."

75
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,960
- This place sucks?

76
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,320
Sucked, he sucked the monster out of the can.

77
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,740
That's why he said he thought you knew.

78
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,140
Maybe all of the drinks in that place are half full.

79
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,840
Yeah, 'cause he keeps drinking all the time.

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,920
That's not a bad move.

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,100
You mean half empty.

82
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,920
Well, let's not even, no.

83
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,320
Sorry, I don't wanna get into philosophy tonight.

84
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,480
On the podcast.

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,420
But I am a Christian.

86
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,320
And Christ always does things half full.

87
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,920
I should just start trying to convert you guys.

88
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,840
Yeah, if you wanna be a real fucking.

89
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,480
I don't want, no, I don't want to have anything to do

90
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
with the church.

91
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,120
- You don't wanna go to heaven, see your mommy and daddy?

92
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
- No.

93
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,000
- Dude, I believe in the spaghetti monster,

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
I'm a Rastafarian.

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,600
(laughing)

96
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
- The only difference between a Pastafarian and Rastafarian

97
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,360
is that Pastafarians think it's flying.

98
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,440
Rastafarians are like, it's just a spaghetti monster.

99
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
- Yeah, and it's coming.

100
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,920
- Yeah, and it's right behind you.

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
(laughing)

102
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,240
- I think the only religion I think I would convert to

103
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,480
is Judaism.

104
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,880
Yeah, I mean that is a funny one to get into.

105
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Just because it would be funny.

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,160
It's funny to get into Judaism because like Jews don't even believe in that shit.

107
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,520
They just do it.

108
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,020
Yeah.

109
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,120
Like it's just one of those things you're just born into and you're like, "Yeah, I guess I'm Jewish."

110
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
You know?

111
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,440
Yeah, which I mean I respect that more than anything in Christianity.

112
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,360
Yeah, I guess it's like Catholics.

113
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,800
Okay, I think that Catholics make like the best art though, like about being like, like being...

114
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,520
Oh, being tortured?

115
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,040
Yeah, yeah, like make like the exorcist and like that shit.

116
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,840
That's like a religion that anybody who is Catholic is just like

117
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,800
miserable. Oh yeah, my whole fucking family is Irish Catholics. Normal fucking

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,440
evangelical, we fucking chop a snake in half, we're done with it. That's it.

119
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,840
That's all we have to do. We don't have to confess anything. And also

120
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,560
compared to Catholics, we're good boys. Yeah. We don't do naughty stuff. The Catholic

121
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,960
Church has done a lot of stuff. Like the most evil thing you can do in an

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,760
evangelical church is be a pastor who's secretly gay. Yeah. That's like evil.

123
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,280
And Catholic church that's like... I don't know if that's just an experience I had

124
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,400
growing up because I did... Whoa.

125
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
An experience I had growing up.

126
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:07,840
My aunt worked at a church and every like priest that came through was like

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,920
clearly just like a gay guy. Yeah. And I just grew up believing that

128
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,600
all priests. I just thought all gay guys were priests. Yeah I thought all priests were gay

129
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,720
guys because they were like closeted and they had to share. I mean it's kind of the reason

130
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,920
all them. A gay priest is like a Dexter or like a Hannibal Lecter where God recruits

131
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:35,080
them to take out all the other gay people. Yeah they know how to stop the monster because

132
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:44,360
it lives in them too. That puff bar sounds crazy in the microphone.

133
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,240
It's like a buzzing sound. I don't get why you're doing puff bars.

134
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,320
Because they're flavored? Is that it? It tastes so good. And I haven't brushed my teeth in two

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,840
months. We've already talked about it but I swear to God there's gonna be

136
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,320
like some study about like Jool and like puff bars ruining your teeth and

137
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,960
And they're gonna use me as the example.

138
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,800
- Yeah.

139
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,640
I have strong teeth.

140
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,480
I don't think I've ever had a cavity.

141
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,080
- My family has terrible teeth.

142
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,760
- My teeth are extremely strong.

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,240
- I think my dad's missing a tooth.

144
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
- My dad, I've never seen my dad brush his teeth,

145
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,480
but he does Listerine like six times a day.

146
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
- Okay, that counts.

147
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,480
- So he's just burning that shit off.

148
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,360
- Oh yeah.

149
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,400
- I also think maybe there's a chemical

150
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,600
that they've been dumping into the water

151
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,280
in my hometown for like 40 years.

152
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
- Frug?

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,360
- No, it's called--

154
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,440
gingivitis. It's called gin X is the name of the chemical. It's a Teflon byproduct

155
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,080
and they've just been done. They only got caught like two years ago and I think it

156
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,760
probably gave me like the strongest teeth ever and like a sane brain cancer.

157
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,680
Yeah, probably I probably I probably honestly beat brain cancer like five

158
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,880
times. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's it's just there's like the the fucking enamel of

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,680
your teeth like growing up like like yeah growing up in your brain and just

160
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:09,140
stabbing the tumors. It came out like right when like the like Flint water

161
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,360
situation started happening. Yeah. Well that's a different thing because at

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,560
least yours gave you superpowers. Well that's a really good point. Yeah. I mean

163
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,760
I may be so good at video games. Yeah. But they just they also don't eat like the

164
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,760
company that they had like some hearing and they were like like what is this and

165
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,480
they were like we we don't know. We don't even know what this is. It's just when we

166
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,980
make Teflon it comes off the side of the like thing and we got to put it

167
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,440
somewhere so we put it in the water. Pretty sick dude. If I was in Flint I

168
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,400
would just drink the water and pretend it's chocolate milk. Yeah I would simply

169
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,700
hold my nose and drink the water how bad can it taste? That's what Obama did. True yeah that is the

170
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,560
funniest shit. Yeah looking back like that that is like just one of the most

171
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,520
like asshole fucking moves. Yeah just dribbling it down your shoulder yeah yeah on your face.

172
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,020
Yeah, oh man, that's the best water ever

173
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,840
Pouring it into the dog's mouth

Yeah, I mean I

177
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,840
Wouldn't drink the Flint water. I'm gonna say it. I

178
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,680
If I was president at that situation that moment, what would you have done? I would have told I would have said

179
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,140
About this crap. I would have played in it. Yeah, I need to get we need to put a Brita filter on it

180
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,780
Why didn't they just put a Brita filter in the water system? Yeah, I would have told them to just move to another state or town

181
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah, I would have told him that before that shit. Yeah, it's so crazy. Did all the fucking people that now that are like

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,520
like cuz Flint was like

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Flint turned Republican or something like that or Flint was like Republican

184
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
everyone's like I don't want to hear you bitching about your water. Enjoy that water.

185
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,340
And then it was... They probably voted Republican because they've lead in their brains.

186
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,180
Right. Yeah. It wasn't it also that like it was red and then like everyone yelled

187
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,260
it like did that and then like the rest of the votes were counted and it turned

188
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:20,380
blue. Oh yeah that too. It's just how fast those people just fucking overreact to be like you're a piece of shit.

189
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,820
deserve every bad thing that happened. Damn you. We're going to send you to

190
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,220
kingdom come. We're going to bore a hole in the center of the United States and

191
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,980
we're gonna put you in the bottom. Yeah I think there is a thing in my hometown

192
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,100
where like people get thyroid cancer at like a crazy high rate. In Flint or your

193
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,060
town? In my town yeah. My town yeah Flint. Your town of Flint? My town of Flint.

194
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,260
North Carolina? Yeah. I don't even know if they stopped but dumping it in

195
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,740
the water that's the other thing yeah cuz I think it's I think it's legal for some

196
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,140
reason it's one of it's one of the things like oh we forgot to make a law

197
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,540
yeah yeah yeah cuz there's so many little things that they forget to make

198
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,060
laws for cuz it's like all the laws were written back when stuff was written on

199
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,500
like yeah there's a law and southern states there's a law in North Carolina

200
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,740
that like the first Sunday of the month you're allowed to take your wife on the

201
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:19,140
porch and beat her up yeah like I don't I was told that as a kid and they were

202
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,540
like they just forgot to repeal this one that and slavery yeah I guess I forgot

203
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,940
about that there are still slaves yeah I completely forgot yeah that's great

204
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,900
wasn't it like in the 90s Mississippi like ratified the 13th Amendment or

205
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,980
something like that well some some state I can't remember some state like just

206
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:47,460
just outlawed slavery as like a punitive thing. You can legally be a slave if

207
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:56,740
you're in jail. You can be a puny little slave. If you're the little slave alive.

208
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:05,460
If you're like Stuart Little, you're a slave. We'll let you be one. If you're

209
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:11,580
sized yeah puny little slave he's not gonna get much done it's the problem no

210
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,940
yeah you think home with it could be hard days work comes out with six beans yeah

211
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,920
he's like I picked all these beans yeah that's all that could fit in my little

212
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,260
car you I mean if you weren't so cute I'd fire you slave go go sleep in your

213
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:34,700
little RC car in your tiny little shed you know kiss thank you you if you owned

214
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:44,060
Stuart Little as a slave you would kiss him? Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm not going to pay him, he's a slave! Come on.

215
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,100
Yeah, that's so, I mean, there's so many laws that shouldn't exist. Drunk driving

216
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,220
laws. Agreed. Yeah. Or at least make the limit like something that nobody, like if

217
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:02,180
you drank that much it would kill you. Mm-hmm. You know? Yeah. Yeah. .08. Yeah, .04.

218
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,520
If you drank .04, that would kill you.

219
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,600
I think it should be based on weight.

220
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,480
And if you're like 600 pounds, you have to-- and also it should be based on beers, not

221
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
alcohol content.

222
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Yep.

223
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,720
So if you drink 30-- like if Pat drank like 15 beers, he's still good.

224
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Yeah.

225
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
But--

226
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,040
Well, that's 'cause I'm very good at--

227
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
It's also-- well, here's the thing.

228
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,560
A cop asks you how many beers you have to have to get really drunk, and then they use that

229
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,280
to base you should have it you should have it like on your phone like you know the

230
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,200
wellness app yeah yeah should you should do like a test the doctor gives you the

231
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,880
test it's it's a but it's a quiz it's a quiz yeah no quiz it's a quiz as soon as

232
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,760
your checkup you can yeah I'm afraid of needles you the pop quizzes him handing

233
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,000
you the questions are the same every time so you can just look up the the multiple

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,360
choice answers online - that's really max it out every time yeah but most of it's

235
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,840
about like what kind of movies you like and then just extrapolate based on that

236
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,840
yeah it's one of those how many episodes of law and order it's like a sleep

237

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm gonna get grandpa fucked up. He's gonna say something inappropriate to my cousin.

328
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm gonna clap behind his ears so he has a flashback.

329
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,100
We're gonna get this party started.

330
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,820
I don't have any war grandpas. All of my grandpas were cowards or had a glass eye.

331
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:31,380
I have a war great uncle. Yeah? Yeah. Does he love it? I'm sure he loved it.

332
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,340
My uncle, I think my uncle went to Iraq. Nice. Just on vacation though. Yeah, exactly his

333
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,380
birthright. I think he was like a medic or something. I don't know anything about that

334
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,780
guy. I would love to be a medic in the army. The thing is, he's a medic in the Air Force.

335
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,500
There's no like, nobody's expecting you to save anybody's life.

336
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,140
So somebody's like, "Medic!"

337
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,980
And then you can just be like, "Oh dude, he's gone."

338
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
I gave him water.

339
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,980
I think the funniest type of kid is the kid who like in middle school or high school wants

340
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,660
to be in the army but he wants to be a medic.

341
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,980
Like that shit is, I found one of my favorite.

342
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,980
I've never encountered him in real life but one of the funniest like posts I've ever seen

343
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,980
online is I was like browsing, I was looking through like the Slipknot subreddit because

344
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,940
that's just like a bunch of like, you know, like seventh graders

345
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,860
Yeah, posting like look at this crazy drawing I made and it's

346
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,140
just like a smiley not inspired thoughts. Yeah, exactly. And

347
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,140
there's one where a guy was like, check out my drawing and he

348
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,100
drew one of the like slipknot members and it just looks like

349
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,140
shit. And it's like on a school worksheet that's like a graphic

350
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,380
organizer for an essay and it has this full name at the top

351
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,580
and then it's like the issue I would like to argue is like for

352
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,100
legalized marijuana and like and it's like it's very clear like

353
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,560
it's very clearly like a sixth or seventh grade level like like paper and

354
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,980
then like the comments. So I was like what like wow great job putting your

355
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,980
full you put your full name on this good luck ever getting a job and then he

356
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,640
responded and he was like I don't ever want to get a job. I am going to go

357
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,380
into the Marines and become a combat medic. Oh my God, I think you need a

358
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,820
gummy bro. Just take this if you don't feel anything take two more just so

359
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,740
like the idea that like an employer is gonna look on the Slipknot subreddit and be like

360
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,300
"this guy wanted to legalize weed in sixth grade"

361
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:23,220
Yeah, uh, sorry buddy, you know, maybe an army medic in Jamaica, but not in America, you

362
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,700
fucking commie.

363
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Yeah.

364
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,300
I can't, the kids that wanted to be in the army when I was in school were like, always

365
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,140
the kids who were like, who just sweat from walking in the hallway.

366
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Yeah.

367
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
Oh yeah?

368
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Skinny kids who sweat.

369
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,020
like bigger kids who swell, yeah skinny kids who sweat too.

370
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,540
Yeah, big old fat guys.

371
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,780
There was like this group, this pair of kids

372
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,380
who wanted to be in the army

373
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,060
and one of them had like,

374
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,100
clearly like his dad was in the army or something.

375
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,180
He was giving him like the army haircut

376
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,420
where it's just like the flat on top

377
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,180
but then he shaves the sides down like with a razor.

378
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,340
And he just looks like--

379
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,000
- Like the bottom of a number two pencil.

380
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,060
- Yeah, exactly.

381
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,980
He just looked weird.

382
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,820
He just had like a weird like flat--

383
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
- The Marine kid at my school was this giant kid

384
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,940
who was he would just go to people and go like I'm gonna kill you yeah there was a

385
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:19,580
rumor that he just locked his mom in a closet his mom started that rumor yeah

386
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:28,220
okay mrs. Johnson and yeah he had like a social worker with a British accent which

387
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,700
is just like that's just such a perfect combo yeah like a giant like marine kid

388
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,780
who's like I'm gonna fucking stab you after school and like all right Greg

389
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,980
like come on come on now and then yeah and then and then that kid like left for

390
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,580
some reason and then that same social worker like I had another kid he was

391
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,080
helping who was just like this like tiny like this is in high school this kid

392
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
looked like he was in like fifth grade.

393
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,580
He was just this tiny autistic kid who was obsessed with trains and whenever a

394
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,980
train there was like a train tracks behind the school and whenever a train

395
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,980
went by he would run to the window and then he would turn around he would say

396
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,380
what type of train it was.

397
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,280
Whoa.

398
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,780
Yeah, so sick dude.

399
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,480
He was the best.

400
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,680
I loved him so much.

401
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,760
He's probably it was he held better. Did he see where grades I he might have I

402
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,600
don't know. I mean I didn't really know those kids are freaks. Do you worked at a

403
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
medical supply store?

404
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,400
God damn sick. That's the coolest kid alive dude.

405
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,880
Yeah and he had like a really high-pitched voice too. I think he

406
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,280
probably was held back the more I think about it. Or skipped grades. Yeah same you

407
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
know what I mean. Yeah.

408
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,720
He was held forward. Yeah he was helped forward. Yeah. Yeah I do remember having

409
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,520
like like my first day of middle school having like a kid who was like eight

410
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,200
years old in our class yeah yeah he was only there for like two weeks and then

411
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,040
his mom pulled him out but he like yeah

412
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:58,000
that's the beginning of of almost famous cuz it's about like the kid and almost

413
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,120
famous is like he skipped three grades or whatever yeah and they're in the shit

414
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,880
it starts with like him in the shower at school with like all the other kids and

415
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,120
they're like you're you don't even have pubes! You don't have pubes man! Look at our pubes!

416
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
You don't have any pubes!

417
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Look at these pubes!

418
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
That's such a funny thing to bully somebody for.

419
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Dude I wish I didn't have pubes now man.

420
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
I would do anything to have no pubes.

421
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Anything.

422
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
You could go get laser surgery.

423
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Except lasers because I'm scared of them.

424
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
So scared.

425
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,580
kid who plays the almost famous kid is named Patrick Fugget. Really? F-U-G-I-T.

426
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,900
Yeah. I'm sure it's pronounced Fugit or something. Yeah. I call him Patrick Fugget.

427
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,740
Patrick, when you talk about him? When I talk about him because he's my

428
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,580
close personal friend. Yeah. That's what I say to Patrick after you go to sleep

429
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:54,040
Caleb. Fugget. Yeah. And I know what you're pointing at. Oh yeah. You. No. It's one of those

430
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,080
I'm not an it. Farting cup things with the slime and you.

431
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,600
Aaron's making me fuck one of those. Aaron's thinking putty. One of those things that are like the it's like a

432
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Chinese finger trap but it's not and it's like goo and it's sparkly. Oh what that

433
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,400
called? It's called the sparkler. It's called a Chinese sparkler. It's endless. I know

434
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,880
what you're talking about. Japanese finger trap. Ooblik? No. No it's it's a it's. If you tried to

435
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,640
fuck oobleck would it go hard or soft on you? I would go hard on it. Yeah, but

436
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,920
that's that's the... If you go hard on it, it will go hard on you. If you punch the

437
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,040
oobleck it's hard. Yeah. What happens if you fuck moonsand? Is it smooth or is it sandy?

438
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:41,320
You probably get a grain in your pee hole. A greedy disagreement.

439
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,960
oddly satisfying grain of sand and pee hole compilation fits perfectly.

440
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:57,280
I wish there was just like one thing in real life that had a cartoon sound

441
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,680
effect like if I got a boner really fast I wish you would just make a "boing"

442
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,360
yeah the put like putting down a glass bottle funny and it goes like "boing" you

443
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,600
know what I mean like yeah I've never heard that or like a or like if you hit

444
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,480
also if you hit like a metal water bottle on like the side of a table.

445
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:13,980
Oh yeah.

446
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,440
That makes me laugh every time.

447
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,400
That's good, yeah.

448
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
You know what else makes me laugh every time?

449
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,840
If you hold a spoon under the faucet and the water goes everywhere.

450
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,720
That always gets me.

451
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,520
That is funny.

452
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,400
You know what makes me, I think it's really stupid, but like car horns just make me laugh.

453
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,160
Like if it's like a quick enough car horn.

454
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:38,280
Especially like a lot of European cars have just like the most sissy horns in the world.

455
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,780
Oh yeah.

456
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,240
Just a short loudish noise is just very funny.

457
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,960
If you're driving a Volkswagen, nobody ever thinks you're mad at them.

458
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,880
It's always just a courtesy honk.

459
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,520
Yeah.

460
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,240
Yeah. It's always just like, "Hey, man, you're wasting your own time here."

461
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,280
Yeah, they're so polite.

462
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,800
That's the problem with the La Cucaracha horn is it just makes people dance.

463
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,280
Exactly.

464
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,800
It's like, "Listen, buddy, if you want me to... My hands are completely off the wheel now."

465
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:08,280
Look, I'm in front of my car doing the Mexican hat dance now that you've played your La Cucaracha

466
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,600
horn.

467
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,360
yeah and you're like by the way guac and chips and you bend over and they eat

468
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,120
out of your super all right let's do this list baby yeah top 10 reasons why people

469
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,920
don't commit suicide by this an awareness of why the suicide guy by

470
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:33,480
Paris and mm it's Paris Hilton yeah all right number one because they don't know

471
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,120
how that's a really good point that's I think that's what's kept me from doing

472
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,600
it up until now you can't figure it out I mean just like what is it I mean yeah

473
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,920
I'd love to trust me but how yeah maybe just like jump really hard yeah what

474
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,800
that's a good point can you kill yourself from running too hard you

475
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,120
probably could probably so easy to kill yourself by doing something yeah could

476
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,480
you rip your own head off? Maybe. That was one of those like those it was either

477
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
like an essay thread or a 4chan thread that I would like got screenshot and I

478
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,080
would read all the time and like as like a 12 year old be like there's like the

479
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,360
coolest ways to commit suicide and it's like like put like glue your hands to

480
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,720
your head and then like get in like a piano wire noose and then jump off a

481
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,480
building so it looks like you ripped your head off like a bunch of shit like

482
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,460
that yeah I can't remember what that was but but that's definitely the coolest

483
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,920
one that is the coolest one I think yeah because it's not who cares if you rip

484

527
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,480

528
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,440
record a bunch of episodes a couple months ago, I just kept trying to fight Patrick. That's true.

529
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,520
And I beat him every time. It's Fight Club, dude. Yeah. Yeah. I got some good hits on you. You did.

530
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,000
I really wasn't happy. Yeah. You were very scared. I hit your arm quite a few times. We kept telling

531
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,600
you to go inside and you were too afraid to go inside. I was. He wouldn't even open the door

532
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Yorkie thought when he turned his back to us that we'd start beating up on him.

533
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
And you were very correct.

534
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Yeah, you were right.

535
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Yeah.

536
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Number two, because they are happy with their life.

537
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
That's a good point.

538
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
I think people still do it.

539
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Yeah.

540
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
You know.

541
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
If they're happy.

542
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
I'm too happy.

543
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm too happy.

544
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
I love things too much.

545
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I've never been sad in my life, so I don't understand true happiness.

546
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
I have nothing to compare it to.

547
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,080
I have to kill myself, the saddest thing of all time, so I can finally understand how happy

548
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
I am.

549
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
I have to do a Squidward suicide.

550
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Don't even fucking start, dude.

551
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,680
I have to make my eyes go real hyper-realistic.

552
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,200
My friend's mom did Squidward suicide.

553
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,720
Who was like the first person you guys knew who like had killed themselves?

554
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,640
I don't think I've known anyone, like nobody I've been close to has died from suicide.

555
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,460
I know of people, yeah, like people at my school and shit, but like no one I like knew

556
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:39,420
None of my friends, like while I was growing up, but I did this lady from my church, she

557
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:45,080
like one day she just like fucking got the kids in the car, drove them to school, went

558
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
home and hung herself.

559
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
My God, dude.

560
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,060
And then there was like, didn't leave a note or anything.

561
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,060
Oh man.

562
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,820
And I was like, you know, his dad was fucking, I don't want to accuse him on the podcast,

563
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,820
but he killed his wife.

564
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,820
Yeah, definitely.

565
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,820
I mean, yeah, it could be.

566
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,340
I mean, yeah, it could be.

567
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,500
There was one of my neighbors growing up,

568
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,260
like my senior year of high school,

569
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,700
we didn't hear from him for like two weeks.

570
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,700
And then I guess he had like gone hiking

571
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,620
and then like it was like, it looked like a hiking accident,

572
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,740
but then they found like a note in his house.

573
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,420
Well, that's the funniest thing though.

574
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,340
His notes said, "I am going hiking.

575
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,620
"I am going to have fun."

576
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,620
I will love the trail.

577
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,060
I love hiking.

578
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,500
The funniest move is every time you go hiking

579
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,460
somewhere that you know there's like bears and like things that can kill you

580
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,700

581
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,740

Something like that. Yeah, just joining in.

608
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:56,400
can't sing in Little John number three because somebody sent a threat to kill

609
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,940
them if they did commit suicide this is kind of a joke and yeah I think this is

610
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,360
kind of just like a prank yeah yeah that wouldn't work on me I'd simply know

611
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,140
River clan rocks comments that's ironic because if they committed suicide they

612
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:15,680
would already be dead you only die twice I don't know do you know who's trying to

613
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,800
riff that comment out as they write it yeah you know straight up I'm not even

614
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,300
thinking right now but maybe you would you could die twice who knows though

615
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:33,360
knows though real yeah I mean P for real - P how to save an idiot's life 101 damn

616
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:40,680
him hey Pat if you kill it if you commit suicide I'll totally kill you yeah maybe

617
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,600
I think that's a bad deal no it's not a deal it's a threat just say yes

618
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,880
no it's like if you if you ever set foot in this town again I'll fucking kill you

619
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,360
you know I don't know if I like that deal what do I get out of that number

620
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,980

00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
I love the weekend so much

645
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Dude he loves eating pussy

646
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,920
And this guy has to be the only man in the world who likes eating pussy.

647
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,120
Stuff is like candy to him.

648
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
Yeah.

649
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,960
What if he has one of those people where his like taste buds are all fucked up so he tastes

650
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,260
like the, you know, an armpit taste of a pussy and he tastes barbecue sauce, you know?

651
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,080
And he's like, "Oh yeah, swag!"

652
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:45,200
And nobody finds out until he starts singing, "And her pussy tastes like ribs!"

653
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,460
(laughter)

654
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,300
- I was like, hold on.

655
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,800
- Pussy's like ribs, I'm like bubble gum, but ribs?

656
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,640
- Yeah.

657
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,480
- Yeah.

658
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,040
- You know those, have you seen those videos of--

659
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,660
- Little pussy tastes like beer.

660
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,120
(laughter)

661
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,880
- People who get like, it's like,

662
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,840
hey I'm COVID positive, so I'm gonna eat

663
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,080
like a bunch of disgusting food.

664
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,960
'Cause like the taste buds are gone.

665
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,160
- Taste buds glee?

666
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,000
- Yeah, you can't taste anything.

667
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,920
- How do you lose your sense of taste and smell?

668
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,240
- For how long?

669
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,080
- For the duration?

670
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,800
Well, then some people say they can't taste for like a month after.

671
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,120
Yeah.

672
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,240
Did the people that you know have that sensation?

673
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,520
I don't, I think so.

674
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,760
Yeah.

675
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,320
It said, they said that everything tastes like salt.

676
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,160
I just eat poop, dude. Fuck it.

677
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,040
Yeah.

678
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,200
Yeah, dude. You can make so much money in one week making videos of you eating poop.

679
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,080
Yeah. People will eat like a whole onion when they have COVID.

680
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,720
Just like, yeah, just like, yeah, you get COVID and you go to the hospital and they're like,

681
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,680
"Oh, so we're also gonna have to pump your stomach from poop."

682
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,480
Yeah.

683
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,160
You're filled with poop. I forgot about that. I didn't realize that COVID makes you lose your

684
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,320
sense of taste. I just thought a fairy blessed me in my sleep. It's a living, dude. Sir,

685
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,840
from the looks of this, your stomach hasn't digested this poop for two weeks and you got

686
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:10,200
COVID last week. I have delicious poop. What can I say? What can I say? I like poop. You want me

687
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,440
me to apologize I want me to apologize for my diet fuck you fuck you I'm going to

688
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,620
the other hospital since I don't animal hospital since I haven't had it now I

689
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,880
don't think I'm gonna get it I think it's probably impossible I think I might

690
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,960
be the only there's gotta be some people who are immune to it I think the cures

691
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,640
in my blood yeah I think they probably need to check cuz I mean there's people

692
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,120
who are immune to like chicken pox and shit yeah not me buddy I had a terrible

693
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,600
time with chicken pox I never got it my face got stuck to a pillow either well

694
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,120
And my friend came over and we watched Click and we both started crying during Click and

695
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,820
I made fun of him for crying, even though I was also crying, but I blamed it on Chicken

696
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Pox.

697
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,880
It's crazy how they would have Chicken Pox parties to get all the kids immune to it.

698
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Crazy those poor kids.

699
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,440
They tried that with COVID and it did not work.

700
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Yeah, it did not.

701
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,760
Remember like the beginning in like March when it first hit the states?

702
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Yeah.

703
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,120
And everyone was like, "Yeah, we're having it."

704
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,600
Like it was a COVID party in Kentucky.

705
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Yeah.

706
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
It was crazy.

707
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Crazy.

708
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Crazy world.

709
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Number five, "Because it is hard to."

710
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Suicide is hard to do.

711
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
That's the song now.

712
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Suicide is hard to do.

713
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Both of these comments are really depressing.

714
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
I'm not going to read either of them.

715
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Really?

716
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Yeah.

717
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
This is a fucking depressing list.

718
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
No, it's reasons people don't commit suicide.

719
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
This is one of the most joyous lists we've done.

720
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Yeah, that's true.

721
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,600
I do want to read these just to myself.

722
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,960
Okay, well we'll give Caleb 10 minutes to read these.

723
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
We'll give Caleb a minute to cry.

724
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Guys, I love you guys.

725
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
(Laughter)

726
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Just taking one look at him and going...

727
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
(Screaming)

728
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Oh, geez.

729
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
He tried to kill himself.

730
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
(Screaming)

731
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
I feel like it can't be that hard.

732
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
What, killing yourself?

733
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
People kill themselves by accident.

734
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
All you have to do, you literally just have to sit in the car.

735
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
That's it.

736
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,920
That's all you have to do. You can literally play Gameboy until you die. Yeah. You know. Yeah.

737
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,120
Yeah. Unless you're really like Michael Phelps, hard time killing himself in the

738
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:19,300
car. Yeah. Hold his breath forever. Oh that's true. Yeah. Because he could swim out of the

739
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:24,000
car. That's right. He can swim out of any situation. Yeah. That's a really good point I'm

740
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,880
making right now. Yeah. So smart. I should have my own podcast just me where I say

741
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,040
smart stuff. Yeah. What would it be called? Caleb's Corner. Caleb's Corner. 2Ks. No

742
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,260
spin zone yeah be called the no because a no bins why is it called the no spin zone

743
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,960
because he doesn't because Bill O'Reilly he doesn't spit anything except his penis

744
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,720
in a dressing room towards his intern's it yeah he says welcome to the spin zone

745
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,920
helicopters is exactly yeah yeah and he did that and that's actually a fact

746
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,140
that's true he did that to me yeah it's funny my grandma every every year she

747
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,860
would give me a new Bill O'Reilly book when I was a kid never arguing with

748
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:07,580
idiots? No, I just hid guns in them. Yeah. Yeah, just fucking cut out the pages.

749
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,380
Yeah. I think I tried to do that. I think I did, actually I did when I was a

750
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,620
freshman in high school, I did try to take my mom's copy of Arguing with

751
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:19,180
Idiots and hollow it out so I could hide my weed in it. By who you said? Glenn Beck.

752
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,940
Glenn Beck, nice. Arguing with Idiots. Well that's a bad choice, she's gonna be reading that every day.

753
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,500
Exactly, yeah. She's gonna have to read it to argue with me. It's funny that Neil in college was

754
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,820
like, you know what would be awesome? I'm gonna make a hollowed out book and hide my weed in it.

755
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

756
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:46,820
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

757
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:53,820
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

758
00:42:53,820 --> 00:43:00,820
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

759
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,180
always fuck it up and they say action figures are dolls. Incorrect dude.

760
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,220
They're simulations. Yeah. They're simulators. They're simulations of the human male form.

761
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,700
Yeah. Okay. I'm learning about my own body through theirs. Yeah. I mean this it's on

762
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,780
the same it's it's the same thing as as if you had like a medical skeleton that

763
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,860
you could learn from. That you could make fight the devil. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

764
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,860
Which is what I always did. Yeah it's like if you had the devil in your skeleton.

765
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,020
Well, that's that's pretty scary. Yeah, I'm afraid of the devil why?

766
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,100
He's got a big red ass

767
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,740
His horns look sharp. Yeah, big bouncy red ass. He's gonna bounce it on me, dude

768
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,920
Yeah, I'm afraid the devil's gonna fart is gonna have a little bit of fire. He's got two giant Super Bowls back there

769
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,380
Yeah, he's gonna he's gonna hit my head with him like a jackhammer

770
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,500
Do you think the devil has a big penis or a small penis?

771
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:54,180
That's small but smart the arrowtail is his penis. It just goes backwards cuz he's the devil. Yeah

772
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:01,300
Everything's backwards on this guy. Yeah. Yeah his legs cuz he's got goat legs. Yeah, so let's go back. We're right and wrong

773
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,520
That's right. That's right

774
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:11,220
I guess that would be my biggest fear with with committing suicide is just knowing you go to hell. Yeah. Yeah

775
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:17,720
You what if what if you go to like what if you get to hang out in the what if you don't go to hell?

776
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,540
That was the funniest thing like growing up like super Christian is anytime someone in our town like killed themselves

777
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,380
like a friend's like parent or whatever my mom be like oh that's so sad

778
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:33,780
especially that they're in hell now yeah yeah yeah that rules yeah there's a

779
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,300
family that's like irreparably broken forever yeah I'm so sorry that your dad

780
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,540

781
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:47,020
went down the highway the hell I'm so sorry you went down I-40 until he got to

782
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:54,160
hell. Oh my god perfect timing. Number seven, because it is a serious sin. Mm-hmm

783
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,680
that's right yeah. I don't know if it is. It's not. No it's actually it's cool.

784
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,880
Yeah it's just you want to get closer to God. Exactly. But you don't get closer. You

785
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,920
do get closer to God. I don't know I don't really know what the biblical

786
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,640
argument for it being a sin is. It's because it's you're supposed to die when

787
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,280
God tells you. What if God is telling you through the radio, "Kill yourself right now, I'm God."

788
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,040
That's true. Yeah. Yeah. It's taking God's will into your own hands. Yeah.

789
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,000
Which you're supposed to-- I know that God-- If somebody gets cancer or somebody gets

790
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,120
anything like that, it's God telling them. It's God's plan. I know God has a plan,

791
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,240
but Shop O' Trap House is telling me to do something completely different.

792
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,960
Yeah, they're sending mixed signals here.

793
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,760
You want me to fucking vote or do you want me to kill myself?

794
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,260
Yeah.

795
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,160
And what do I do when I get the C4 on the bus?

796
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,660
Yeah.

797
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,920
I'm waiting.

798
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,420
Yeah.

799
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,280
Sorry, I'm not going to make it to the party.

800
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,960
I'm waiting till midnight for the new Choppa episode to come out so I get my new instructions.

801
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,440
We're just kidding.

802
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:03,940
Yeah.

803
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,620
We're not.

804
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,560
Number eight.

805
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,560
Wait, one of the comments here says, "I'm baptized and I want to go to heaven, but I would go to hell instead."

806
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,400
That's not... I would just do it. Yeah, I would go to hell. I don't want to, but I would.

807
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,440
The coolest people are in hell, dude. Yeah. The pedophiles, the... Ray Romano. Ray Romano.

808
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,520
All of Caleb's friends' dads. All my friends' dads killed themselves, or had cancer,

809
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,360
got shot in drug deals they're pretty cool dude dad goes to the one who had

810
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,420
cancer here's this is pretty cool he used to eat a potato every day like an

811
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,660
apple yeah yeah a baked potato or like a completely raw he thought it would cure

812
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:55,180
his cancer and he died way faster yeah yeah so growing up a potato then he had

813
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,900
he got potato cancer yeah yeah potato started growing in his brain yeah yeah

814
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,300
The Irish and stuff started growing out.

815
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:07,260
Number eight, because they could listen to some brutal metal songs to let out their anger.

816
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,260
But doesn't the brutal metal tell you to kill yourself?

817
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,260
Yeah.

818
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,100
Isn't that the whole argument about Judas Priest?

819
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,900
Also like, it's definitely, yeah, the kids who want to commit suicide, the people who

820
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,660
want to commit suicide, they're angry.

821
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,660
That's the problem.

822
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,660
They're really mad.

823
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,660
I'm so stinky, man.

824
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,660
I could kill myself.

825
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,660
I'm so angry.

826
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,660
I could, yeah.

827
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,140
I'm so mad I could sit in my car for an hour and leave it running.

828
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,140
Yeah.

829
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:36,020
most angry acts you could ever do. That carne asada took me out. Yeah? Yeah. You just had

830
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:42,120
a yerba mate, brother. I had a yerba mate and I took a nap. Yeah. You had a you're so

831
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:49,340
so gay. Come on. Let's fucking go yeah! You have a weak mind. I do. I've been getting

832
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:55,240
tired a lot recently. I didn't mean that. I've been getting tired a lot recently. I'm

833
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm worried it's cancer.

834
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,680
- You think it's cancer?

835
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,520
- It would be funny if it was.

836
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,680
- Yeah?

837
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,640
- Yeah, just the worst.

838
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,120
- Yeah, it'd be funny if you had cancer.

839
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,440
- It would be very funny to me.

840
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,160
- Maybe get those Patreon numbers up though.

841
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,760
(laughing)

842
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,080
- Oh, oh my God, Patrick, what's that?

843
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,360
- I see it on right now.

844
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,640
- Oh no, my tumor's literally growing.

845
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,320
- Oh, dude, whoa.

846
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,240
- I think the only thing that'll change it,

847
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,440
I mean, let's just say $20,000 a month, right?

848
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,080
I mean, that's how much cancer, here's the problem.

849
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,040
Healthcare in this country. Oh my god fucked. Yeah, but telethons have been going down and we need

850
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,840
Look, the problem is that there's not enough telethons, I think

851
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:39,680
Yeah, I think we could fix health care immediately. We should have a telephone phones

852
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,880
We should just do a instead of a patreon we do a daily telethon. Uh-huh, but the tell us that we don't even do the podcast

853
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,920
Anymore, we just do a telethon every day. Let's just become like megachurch guys. Yeah easy

854
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,520
That guy yeah, he just stood there and laughed that was so sick

855
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,280
I know that the guy's like video media says Joe Biden's president. Ha ha ha

856
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:08,300
He just does that for like two full minutes did whenever pastors got political growing up is so fucking. Oh, yeah

857
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,680
Dude, do you know our pastor would be like be like?

858
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,920
You know what you're talking about TV pastors. No no like in my church

859
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,760
Yeah, be like and the elections coming up this week and just remember

860
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:25,520
I mean the candidates whoever you're choosing to support one of them is you know very possibly a

861
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,940
Vehicle for Satan to move through and the others Mitt Romney, but whichever one you choose to support

862
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,400
I trust that God's helping you make that decision like to fucking swag dude. Yeah, I

863
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,880
Can't imagine being like a an evangelical wanting to vote for a Mormon

864
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,000
Did it was the worst decision they've ever had to make yeah?

865
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,240
Yeah. Because it's like everybody, all evangelicals think Catholics and Mormons

866
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,680
and Jews and anybody who's just a different version of them is going to

867
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,080
hell. Yeah. And so they were like, "We gotta vote for a Mormon." I don't think a Mormon could ever hold

868
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,420
office. No, do you? I think that Mitt Romney has held a lot of offices. I mean the

869
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,400
office of the president. Okay, was that? Because then we would all-- I can't swear.

870
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,800
Yeah, can't swear and we would all have to wear those pajamas and those

871
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,720
underwear yeah make Mormonism the state really would think so yeah be sick if we

872
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:21,520
got a more if we got a Mormon president and he like immediately just kills just

873
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,640
like diverted a bunch of money into NASA and we're like we're gonna find Kolob

874
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,520
yeah we're gonna go to the throne of my first second and third ladies

875
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,760
dude it's crazy how much Mormons hate Native Americans oh yeah that's a pretty

876
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:41,520
that's a black people too dude yeah that's yeah they only recently yeah they

877
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,120
only like in the past like few decades have let black people yeah there's like

878
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,800
old like fit Mormon like educational film strips where it's like they turn

879
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:56,360
like a black person white yeah yeah they say that like black people are like if

880
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,360
you if you sinned in a past life you like reincarnate as a black woman they're

881
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:10,360
They're like Islam where they have like an Ayatollah kind of person who talks to...

882
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,360
No, no, they have like the current president of the Mormon Church supposedly is still getting information from God.

883
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,360
Yeah, and they send all the same sermons to every church. Like they all do the same shit.

884
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,360
It's wild, dude.

885
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,360
Yeah.

886
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Yeah, it's pretty sick.

887
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,360
Mormonism is crazy. It's so sick.

888
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,360
I know they have like a pole or something that's supposed to face a certain place.

889
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,100
So maybe yeah, the North Pole just advanced Islam. Yeah, dude

890
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:39,700
Yeah, and they have that shit where if you die you reincarnate as a planet and all your wives live on you as slaves

891
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,280
Yeah, that's one of their beliefs and the celestial kingdom the

892
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:50,560
Beauty tonight tell you that much. It's really sick dude. Yeah, they have a bunch of planet. They believe in planets. Yeah psychos. Yeah

893
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,520
Such a weird fucking and they're too polite

He was going to hold a victory party in my town but then he didn't.

921
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,320
Mormon Church alone. Dude we were like I was like maybe I was maybe one full month

922
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,840
off of converting to Judaism in high school. I had a Jewish girlfriend who I

923
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,600
would go to a temple with her and I was like, "This fucking rules, dude!" It was like

924
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,200
people were dancing and they're blowing like a fucking horn and shit and I was

925
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:14,080
like, "This is beast!" Yeah. Yeah and then she was a... she was a whore.

926
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:22,720
Which will really... We'll see that. Yeah, so that changed my opinion on that religion forever.

927
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:30,760
I do this weird thing where I let one person decide for the whole group of people.

928
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,920
Number ten because they fear death.

929
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
Oh.

930
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920

00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,920
Number eleven because they are famous.

934
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,920
No famous person has ever killed themself.

935
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
I was thinking of killing myself.

936
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,920
But I was like, nah.

937
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
Nah, man, I'm famous.

938
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,920
I'm fucking famous.

939
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,920
I can fuck anybody I want, dude.

940
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,420
I can go down the street and start fucking.

941
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,420
Fuck this.

942
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,140
I'll just do all these drugs at the same time instead.

943
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,140
Yeah.

944
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,140
Yeah.

945
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,140
That's what they end up doing.

946
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:59,300
And then you end up with like My Man Juice World or My Man Little Peep.

947
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:04,660
Can you imagine just, yeah, jumping off a building and midair being like, "Oh shit,

948
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,660
wait I'm famous."

949
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,660
Oh man.

950
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,140
Because people are recognizing you as you fall.

951
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,140
Yeah, they're pointing out the window.

952
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,940
"Oh shit, that's Jim Morrison!"

953
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,820
It's Eric Clapton's son.

954
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,620
(laughter)

955
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,700
- Why is he killing himself?

956
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,980
He's the most famous kid in the world.

957
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,340
- He's got so much to do.

958
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,180
- He's got so much to live for.

959
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,180
- He has that great song that's being written

960
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,660
about him right now.

961
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,460
- What if Eric Clapton was writing Tears in Heaven?

962
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,000
- Eric Clapton wrote the song and he was like,

963
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,260
oh I need something for this to be about.

964
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,100
- Or he was writing it and then his kid,

965
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,020
like he was writing it on the balcony

966
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,620
and his son like crawled up to him and started like,

967
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,900
he hit like the string on his guitar

968
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,600
and just pushed it out the window.

969
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:54,960
Oh shit, what did I just do? Wait a minute. Or it was like, because his kid was like a

970
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,840
baby and he's slowly crawling from the living room into the window to fall out

971
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,720
and Eric's like, "Oh my god, no, he's gonna fall out the window. I should write a

972
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,520
song about this." He finishes it as he falls out. Eric Clapton was like really stuck on

973
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,960
writing the lyrics for his song my son is alive

974
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:22,860
number 12 because they're stupid I would love to kill myself but I'm just so

975
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,560
goddamn stupid

976
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:31,760
I'm so stinking stupid I can't even kill myself right

977
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,760
I got this bucket on my head I can't get it off

978
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:42,760
number 13 because it may fail.

979
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,760
Yeah, and if it fails, then you're a failure and you'll just want to kill yourself.

980
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,760
Shoot for the moon, even if you fail, you'll land among the stars.

981
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,760
I don't think there's any stars between us and the moon.

982
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
But if you miss, you keep going.

983
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,760
Oh, that's a good point.

984
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,760
So you're not falling short, you're overshooting it.

985
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,760
Shoot for the moon.

986
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,760
You just miss. I didn't say fall short.

987
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,600
Shoot for the moon because if you miss you're gonna just keep going.

988
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,200
If you miss you could maybe go to another planet's moon.

989
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,920
I think that's the scariest, that's the like indicative of how afraid I am of just like being

990
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:23,520
bored is that the scariest way to die to me is like you're in a spacesuit and like you can you

991
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,760
can live for a while but you're just like floating through space forever no books no video games.

992
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,120
For me I think the scariest way to die would be if a Dracula jump out.

993
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:41,540
number these are number 14 days of them are just repeating they don't want to

994
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:47,380
rot in the ground what this are you gonna get cremated cremated maybe yeah

995
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,140
sure I'm gonna get remade it yeah they're gonna make my body new again

996
00:57:51,140 --> 00:58:07,780
yeah you know put you in a new suit I'm gonna get cream pie as your mother's

997
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:13,420
lawyer you have to go through with her every last dying wish so look it says

998
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:18,340
I was of sound mind when yeah so someone's gonna have to cream but I'm not

999
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,580
sand it's one of the kids yeah somebody's gonna have to do it look all right she

1000
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:28,020
was a sound mind around here she was a sound mind and wet ass pussy dude

1001
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:35,940
fucking getting in that bitch she's dead she would just get burned up into ashes

1002
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,580
okay she wouldn't she would but she'd she wanted to be cremated and then

1003
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,740
cream-pied yeah turned into like sort of a like when you huck a loogie into sand

1004
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:49,740
kind of that kind of consistency. Like a ball. This is moon sand. That's how you make moon sand.

1005
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:55,740
You see that there? Every container of moon sand has a mother's soul inside it that makes it stay together.

1006
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,740
You see that kind of lumpy, you see that lumpy? The strongest thing in the world.

1007
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,740
The strongest thing in the world is a dead mother's soul who was cream-pied and then burned to a crisp.

1008
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:09,740
You see that lumpy kind of clay-ish textured mound on the mantle? That's your grandma.

1009
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:14,620
And it's also some of her boyfriend Ricardo. He's in there too quite a bit.

1010
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:21,420
Yeah, you see that, you see that, that crumpled Playboy magazine with gray stains on it?

1011
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,700
Yep, that's your mom.

1012
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,540
That's grandma.

1013
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,780
Number 17, because they are rich.

1014
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,460
If I was rich, I think I would just kill myself in the richest way possible.

1015
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,260
Which is?

1016
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,380
Choking on caviar.

1017
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,220
It's true.

1018
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,820
I would say choking on platinum.

1019
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:44,980
If you're like really rich, you might as well hire a hitman on yourself.

1020
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,660
You could hire a hitman that you have to try and you can spend the rest of your life trying

1021
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,660
to escape him.

1022
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,660
Yeah.

1023
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:57,140
Give him like a billion dollars and then just have him, he'll get you eventually.

1024
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,700
I really hope that there's been a thing in the past where a guy tries to hire two hitmen

1025
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,660
to kill each other and just like watches it play out.

1026
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,260
Like I really hope that's actually happened.

1027
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,260
You know what I mean?

1028
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,980
You're gonna love this movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

1029
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:10,980
Yeah.

1030
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:11,980
I just mean I hope that's happened.

1031
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,620
They had to make a rule in the...

1032
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,140
Well, all the hitmen know each other.

1033
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,140
It's like plumbers.

1034
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,140
Yeah.

1035
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,140
They're all in a union.

1036
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,140
Yeah, exactly.

1037
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,140
They're all in big fucking overalls.

1038
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,140
Local 66 and fucking...

1039
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,140
Yeah.

1040
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,860
I've been a fucking hitman since like '72 or something like that.

1041
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,860
Yeah, I've been doing this for a while.

1042
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:35,780
Do you think there's like hitmen scabs?

1043
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,780
Yeah.

1044
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:41,220

No, the I got I got confronted for wearing

1053
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,860
I think I've talked about this but I got confronted in front of the Freemason building because I was wearing a Krampus sweater and

1054
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:40,740
It was a man who's like very clearly schizophrenic saw the the Krampus shirt free mason thing pointed at me and asked me about

Real shit. Yeah. All right, and finally death is depressing

1059
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,720
sensitivity to suicide I just wasn't aware of. Yeah I've not been depressed once this

1060
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,640

translates to in English? Day of the dead. Yeah which is really sad. Yeah one of the

1064
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,060
saddest days.

1065
