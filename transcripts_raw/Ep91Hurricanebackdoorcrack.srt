You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,000
This is the crazy frog.

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Breakdown.

[HUMMING]

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I just think that he was a phony.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I fucked a crazy frog!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Dun dun dun dun dun!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought he was a phony, then I found out he was just animated.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wait, hold up. Let me go grab my crazy frog.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your crazy frog? We already started recording. You can't leave now.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Alright, Patrick's gone.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh my gosh!

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, let's...

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We need to figure out our exit plan for him.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Because he's been doing this every week.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He's been running and grabbing something.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's had to go to the bathroom and grab some poop out of the toilet.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,780
We need to figure out a way to get him off the podcast permanently.

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,840
We can pretend that he's sick.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,000
We can pretend that he's sick.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,080
Oh Patrick, you're too sick to be on the podcast.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Oh my god, Patrick.

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Oh that is cool.

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
He has a backpack, which no, it's probably not, it probably can't hold anything.

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Wait, no, keep it on.

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm gonna take a picture of you.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,440
It's a stuffed animal that goes on your back that looks like the crazy frog.

32
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
Alright.

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Does it have the weenies?

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,720
They do not have crazy frog, wait.

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,780
There's no penis on him.

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,980
no penis on it they got no penis on the thing they got no what they do to my boy

37
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,100
I have to return this they got no penis on the I have to return this there is no

38
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,060
they do have a they do have a little puck I'm starting to understand where the

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,580
straps on it yeah but oh cuz I okay I think I took that you put a present

40
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,220
inside a crazy frog it used to be that you could I think I did what are you

41
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:57,460
doing to him? I think I did... That's his heart. I took... I did something to this. It doesn't matter.

42
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,980
I had to bring it... Nobody's gonna understand this. Yeah, this doesn't... Yeah, this is so...

43
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,940
this is so impossible to explain visually. There's a... we have a crazy frog here, which looks

44
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,700
life-size to me. Yeah, no, this looks like it would be the height of crazy frog if crazy frog was real.

45
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Well, he doesn't... he rides... he rides an invisible motorcycle. I will say, they made his face

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,740
extremely fucked up. They did fuck the face. That's probably what it was. Yeah, they fucked the

47
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,700
face completely. They fucked the face a bunch of times. They fucked him blue. He became blue.

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,020
But it used to be you could squeeze his hand and then he would do his crazy frog sounds

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,300
but then I had to bring that to class with me because Ben gave it to me. He had to. Well Ben

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,540
gave it to me in the middle of the day and then I was like oh well I have to go to class with this

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,740
and I didn't want like crazy frog noises to happen in the middle of class. Just don't press the hand.

52
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,020
I pulled a wire out of it. He can't help himself from holding hands with him. He pulled the wire.

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
He knew that he wouldn't be able to.

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
He's like companionship.

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,300
Yeah, he was like I have to kill you before I can resist holding your hand.

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,740
Oh my god, you cut his veins.

57
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
I cut crazy frog's.

58
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
You sliced his nerves.

59
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
You cut his main artery, man.

60
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
Crazy frog's thing is broken.

61
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
You cut his main vein.

62
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,020
Yeah, man, I want to bring my friend to class, but I'm afraid he'll talk, so I have to take

63
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,020
out his wires.

64
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
So I had to kill him.

65
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,940
I had to kill my friend so I wouldn't hold his hand.

66
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
Yeah.

67
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
It's true.

68
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,940
And so I could hold his hand and he didn't go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:17,260
It's like the end of American Beauty. He killed him so he wouldn't hold his hand.

70
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,580
I've never seen American Beauty either. At the end the dad, the gay military dad, he

71
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,540
kills Kevin Spacey because he tried to fuck Kevin Spacey and Kevin Spacey was like no

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,220
I'm a pedophile and the guy was like oh but I'm gay and so he killed him because he didn't

73
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
want to feel gay.

74
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,980
- It's the battle of intersectionality.

75
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
- Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,820
- It's the, the, the.

77
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,780
- Yeah, which one?

78
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,580
- The oppression Olympics.

79
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,540
- Yeah, battle of gay.

80
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,940
- Did Kevin Spacey win an Oscar for that movie?

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,020
- I'm pretty sure you won an Oscar for that movie.

82
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,860
- No.

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,020
- For being both characters.

84
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,460
- Yes, in real life.

85
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,780
- Yeah, you were like, this.

86
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,500
All events in this movie are based off

87
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,020
the life of Patrick Doran.

88
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,260
- I was two years old when that movie came out.

89
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,100
- It doesn't matter when it came out.

90
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,940
- I think it was 2001.

91
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,580
I think they time travel to find your story.

92
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,820
I watched this movie, The Return of the Living Dead, the other day and the beginning of the

93
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,220
movie it says, "Everything in this movie is true.

94
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,300
All names of companies and all names of people are real."

95
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
And I just thought that was funny.

96
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
The zombie movie.

97
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,740
Is that the one where the butterflies come to life?

98
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Like the butterflies on the wall?

99
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,740
That's a good movie.

101
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
It's a really good movie.

102
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,100
But I thought it would be funny if they did that.

103
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,180
They're like, "Oh, this would be funny."

104
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,100
And they just get the fucksuit out of them.

105
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,980
I don't think there's any legal recourse for being fooled in a movie.

106
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,700
Yeah, but I'm saying it would be funny if that happened.

107
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,700
It would be funny.

108
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,700
I'll give you that much.

109
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,180
If then the movie had to get destroyed.

110
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
But like what if that?

111
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,180
What if they had to destroy the movie?

112
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,300
Every horror movie I feel like in the past ten years has had a thing at the beginning.

113
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
This is real.

114
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Like the Exorcism of Emily Rose.

115
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,420
Well I feel like based on a true story is different.

116
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,500
They literally they're like...

117
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,820
The events of this are exactly true.

118
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,460
Yeah, they say like all the names of people and all the names of companies are exactly

119
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,660
as they are in real life.

120
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
We should just...

121
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,580
No, they always say they change the names.

122
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,100
Yeah, but they didn't say it.

123
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
what I'm saying. Yeah I know. That's exactly what I'm saying. Now I get what you're saying.

124
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,260
What movie is it that starts and it says like if you have a heart attack don't

125
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,140
watch this movie. No that's Frankenstein. Oh really? They do yeah that is true they do

126
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,300
say that the beginning of Frankenstein. Really? They say this movie isn't for the

127
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,500
faint of... yeah a guy comes out in front of a curtain he's like I have to warn you.

128
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Oh yeah I remember that. You watch that movie with a curtain? Take the curtain off the damn screen.

129
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,020
damn screen fool no there's some movie that's like all all it's like if you I

130
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,180
don't know it doesn't we should upload a copy of Star Wars that has that at the

131
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,980
beginning mm-hmm this is like this is a true story but that's the only change

132
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:47,060
the entire movie yeah and people like is that that wasn't on the yeah George

133
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,360

Anything that she comes in contact with sticks to her and she ruins it.

146
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
In Katamari they make it better.

147
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
We should start a political podcast. Yeah, wait, let's start-

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,060
you can't like open up a tab on your laptop or anything you just have to say everything you

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:18,000
stupid fucking loser. You know what I bet you asked to be player two on GameCube

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,940
because you can't handle the responsibility of player one. Liz Warren's the kind of person who

167
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,100
turns off the GameCube when someone says you're not Native American. She hits the

168
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,260
reset button. Yeah. She hits the reset button. She plays Animal Crossing she

169
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,900
hits the reset button so Resetti will talk to her. I bet you lose on all the

170
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,060
luge maps on Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom because you can't handle the tongue.

171
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:46,700
No. Yeah. I bet she doesn't even like playing Mario. I bet she doesn't even

172
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,740
like playing. Liz Warren, you on Tetris you stack up all the blocks and you

173
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,980
never complete a line. Yeah, on Tetris. That's on Tetris. And that's on Tetris.

174
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,260
Liz Warren, you put on a movie and then you leave halfway through the movie

175
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,980
because you have to go to the bathroom and then you come back and make it and

176
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:11,600
you rewind it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, you bitch. And that's your, then that's your

177
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,180
policy. Joe Biden, you look like a giant ant from the Matrix, the Path of Neo. Joe Biden,

178
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,780
you have black eyes like a, like a, like a duck. Hey, Joe Biden, you look like Plank

179
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,020
from Ed, Edd n Eddy. He does? Yeah. Damn. Still, you look like someone drawing your

180
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:34,260
face on fool. It's true he does. Caleb had one sparkling rosé. I had a sparkling

181
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,540
rosé all day and now I'm going psycho. I'll go off on any candidate. That's right Joe Biden

182
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,340
you're like the you're like Psycho Mantis because you're trying to look into my cartridge.

183
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,500
You're a pedophile. You're searching through kids cartridges looking for your personal game.

184
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,980
You're trying to find the entrance. You're trying to play inside their cartridges you're trying to

185
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,400
blow on their cartridges and reset them if you know what I'm talking about.

186
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,320
Yeah and Amy Klobuchar too.

187
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Yeah.

188
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm not going to talk about her.

189
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
I'll talk about her.

190
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Amy Klobuchar you're like a...

191
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
I have too much respect for her.

192
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
You're like a thwomp.

193
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,760
You're like a bitch playing Cooking Mama and trying to eat the food off the screen.

194
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm serious.

195
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
She's a thwomp.

196
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
She did that.

197
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
She's a thwomp.

198
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Yeah.

199
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Yeah.

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,640
You look like a whole thwomp.

201
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
You look like a thwomp combined with Patrick.

202
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I will not say anything.

203
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I bet your pussy did that.

204
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Your pussy tastes like a mystery flavored dum-dum, you fucking stupid dum-dum bitch.

You think ghosts are real and you look like Slimer.

Yeah, you're trying to slime the country.

210
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Yeah, more like Amy Go-to-the-Butch-ar.

211
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Because she goes and she gets out fucking two pounds of Capicuolo, eats it in her sedan.

212
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,900
(laughter)

213
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,640
- In the parking lot.

214
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,960
(laughter)

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
- It's true.

216
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
- Yeah, Cory Booker.

217
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,280
- More like Cory Booker's show for kids

218
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,480
and he watches the show and he wishes

219
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,040
that he could be the child performer.

220
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,220
- Yeah, you stupid creep bitch.

221
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,840
- Yeah, Cory Booker, you look like a snapping turtle.

222
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,820
- Much respect to Rosario Dawson though.

223
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,380
Archer is an all time show.

224
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,880
- Oh, she's not in Archer.

225
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
- Yes she is.

226
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,920
- She's not in Archer.

227
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,120
- Oh no, that's that other lady.

228
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,520
- That's Aisha Tyler.

229
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,680
- They're the same in my head.

230
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,520
- Clerks 2 was five.

231
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:25,600
yeah he was fine kids saw that movie. I think Clerks 2 is the only Rosario Dawson flick I've seen.

232
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,920
She was in kids have you seen kids? I have not seen kids. The movie's effed up man. Yeah?

233
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,600
That's one of those movies that like someone's older brother shows you. That's like a dance

234
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,840
with the devil type movie. Yeah no that's the dance kids is the dance the immortal technique

235
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,960
dance with the devil adaptation of movies. They should they should do a film adaptation.

236
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
[Laughter]

237
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Oh, Dan's at the table.

238
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
You just go to the Wikipedia page.

239
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
And it's just an hour that the song plays in the background.

240
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
It's like "Trash in the Closet."

241
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Yeah.

242
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
[Laughter]

243
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Yeah, because R. Kelly's in it.

244
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
He's the main guy.

245
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
[Laughter]

246
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah.

247
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
"Kids" is a fine movie, I guess.

248
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
And you know what?

249
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,960
While we're back on political stuff for a second, Bill Gates, you look like Steve Jobs.

250
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Yep.

251
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Hey-o!

252
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Bill Gates, who's--

253
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
And Steve Jobs, you're dead.

254
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,320
Someone, there's someone that does look like Bill Gates and I'm trying to think of it.

255
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
It's someone we know.

256
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320

00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
It's not me.

260
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320

00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:35,020
like like dad who were playing basketball came over and like stretched his legs

290
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:42,060
for him oh but I fucked up a backboard slide I'd like never do that and then

291
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,900
it like went up and it hit my side taint and like you have you have hemispheres

297
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,260
your crotch. That's the crotch? That's the crotch zone. I thought the crotch was the hole.

298
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:21,940
The hole. The crotchet, the hole is the urethra. No. No. I mean the whole W hole.

299
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:30,260
The whole W. The W hole. I got W shaped urethra. So the board went, it missed my nuts by an inch.

300
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:37,140
What could have been dude. I would have thrown up. But I got, I remember. You got thrown up from

301
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,380
getting hit in the fucking balls? I got hit in the side taint and then I got up. Stop saying that.

302
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,940
I got hit in the side tank, got up, walked around and then said I'm going home to somebody,

303
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,380
like somebody I don't know.

304
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,780
Just to make it known, just so you had it on paper.

305
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,020
Yeah.

306
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,100
Hey, where did that guy go? Just got hit in the side tank.

Oh, he went home.

308
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,300
He went home.

309
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,100
Yeah, oh, actually.

310
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,060
After a hit like that, after a catastrophic hit to the side tank, it just makes sense.

311
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,820
You know he got hit in the side tank.

312
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,940
Oh, I would go home too.

Yeah.

314
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,460
Yeah, and I would have told somebody.

315
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,740
Yeah, I would have told somebody.

316
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,300
You have to.

317
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,620
When everybody looks at you because you just hit yourself in the nuts.

318
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
That's maritime law.

319
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
That's maritime law.

320
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
I'm going home.

321
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
I'm going home everybody.

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
I can't do this anymore.

323
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,260
You have to tell them.

324
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,580
Me, I can skate.

325
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,260

328
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,780
I can kick flip with a longboard.

329
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,940
I can grind with a screen door.

330
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,140
I'm extremely good at skateboarding.

331
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,380
You cannot grind with a screen door.

332
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
I could.

333
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
You give me a screen door, I will be on a rail.

334
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,380
You would never do it.

335
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,620
I would probably do it before you did it.

336
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
No you wouldn't.

337
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
I could do a flip on a laser.

338
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,140
I could do a flip on a laser beam. Are you serious? No. I could do it. You could never do a laser beam.

339
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,380
We're gonna have to... I'm gonna put that to the test. Alright, make a laser beam.

340
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,180
Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do the Cameron Olympics. Yeah. Which is like the Special

341
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Olympics. It's all the same stuff. Yeah. But you have to flip on a laser beam too and you're the

342
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,260
only competitor. Okay. And we're gonna video it. Oh, this sounds fun. Yeah, it's gonna be fun. We're

343
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
We're gonna make you dash.

344
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,260
Yes!

345
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
I know you love to dash.

346
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,260
Yes!

347
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
We're gonna make you throw.

348
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,260
Cameron's dash.

349
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
We're gonna make you Cameron's dash.

350
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
I get to throw?

351
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
What can I throw?

352
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Uh, javelin?

353
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Spear?

354
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,260
No.

355
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,260
Uh, what do you want to throw?

356
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,260
I mean, I'll probably throw a ball.

357
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
A frisbee.

358
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
He's gonna throw a ball of crap.

359
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Throw a ball.

360
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
Please don't throw a ball of crap, dude.

361
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
He'll do it.

362
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
He's a psycho.

363
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Well, that, yeah.

364
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,260
He would also, he'll get first place no matter what he does.

365
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:38,060
does because he's not afraid to pick up his his mouth and when he's not afraid

366
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:45,980
to use his mouth like a like a like a like a pooping yeah that's like if it's

367
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,980
like the soft day yeah soft a poop a scooper yeah that's nice here yeah thank

368
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,340
you for using the soft day what kind of what kind of events we want to see in

369
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Cameron Olympics. Yeah, I think Cameron skateboarding I'd have to see.

370
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:10,340
I could probably, with like an hour of practice, I could probably do a really shitty ollie.

371
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,540
Okay. I've never done an ollie in my life. I've gotten close to one before, but I've

372
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,540
never actually done one. I mean, I had a very good day at the skate park yesterday. I'm

373
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:29,220
like really the side thing to hit the side team when home that's even worse

374
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,500
the grown man like kid no yeah I think it was I think he might have told a grown

375
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,560
kid you might have is your thing like if you're at the skate park and you're the

376
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,660
oldest person there does that suck not really no if it's like you tell there

377
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,180
oh yes don't kids anything you move out of the way and they listen whoa yeah

378
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:55,420
it's like God mode. When I was in high school I kicked a kid out of the

379
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,780
skate park. You're still in high school? Yeah. What are you talking about? When I was

380
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,420
16 I kicked a scooter kid out for... A scooter kid? You're still 16? He poured water on

381
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,140
the box and I said we don't... I was like you can't do that. We do not like water boxes.

382
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,540
We do not make boxes wet here at the skate park. I was like what are you trying to ruin it?

383
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah we're all good. And then he got pretty scared. Whoa dude you scared

384
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,460
You scared? I scared a 14 year old at a skate park when I was 16.

385
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,900
Because he made the box wet. I've punched a 7 foot man in the face.

386
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,540
Yeah. Yeah. And also I killed a baby.

387
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,260
Yeah. I'm way tougher than you guys. Whoa, Anthony Jeselnik just walked in.

388
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,780
Whoa, Anthony, that was an awesome. Do another joke. That one was so good.

389
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,340
I don't know anything about Anthony Jeselnik. I've actually raped my mom.

390
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,380
Yeah. And people are like, "Woo! Dude, he's the funniest fucker in the world."

391
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,940
Because women are actually ugly.

392
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,860
Yeah, mass shootings are cool.

393
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,780
And I actually prefer a mass shooting if I'm at a restaurant.

394
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,580
Prefer one.

395
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,900
I go in, they say smoking or not smoking.

396
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,020
I say mass shooting.

397
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,100
I say put me in the mass shooting section.

398
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,600
Yeah.

399
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,060
And Joe Rogan's like, "Man, you're a genius. How do you come up with these fucking fucked up jokes?

400
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,020
You have such a crazy sick mind."

401
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,300
I've actually taken inspiration from Christopher Walken.

402
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,820
He does have a walk-in thing going. I forget about that.

403
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,340
I've seen an interview where he says that Christopher Walken is the

404
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,260
person he bases his like tone of voice.

405
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,100
The one Anthony Jeslinic thing that I really like is his Dane Cook impression.

406
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,220
Yeah, I've never heard of it.

407
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,340
It's so fucking funny.

408
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,780
I think there's some stuff that he says is funny, but it's like most of it is just like...

409
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,180
I mean, he's definitely like a good joke writer.

410
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,300
Yeah, he's a good joke writer. It's just like he's trying to be just like a - he

411
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,540
used to try to be just dirty Demetri Martin.

412
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,380
Oh, and he was dirty.

413
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,300
and we already have one of my favorite comedians, Dirty Dmitri Martin.

414
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,260
Dirty Dmitri. Yeah, I love him. Dirty Dmitri the comedian. He does like, he does a

415
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,260
version of the Aristocrats with a notebook pad. Yeah, and he's like... He draws everything.

416
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,860
Yeah, and then the sun started shitting everywhere. Yeah, and then the sun started

417
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:08,300
shitting and then... And he said, "The Aristocrats." That'd be cool. Yeah. What about Dirty George

418
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:16,940
Carlin. That wouldn't happen. What about clean George Carlin? He says fruit you. That's where you went to

419
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,460
college. Mm-hmm fruit University. Yeah because you're in it you're such a fruit.

420
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:28,380
Yeah. Remember when that was an insult? Yeah. That's like an insult your dad says. Yeah my dad

421
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,020
actually does say yeah he'll be like you're being a real fruit right now. What

422
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,580
are you a fruit? If I get one time I got a lemon drop at the bar in front of my

423
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,540
dad rookie mistake absolutely rookie mistake and he was like pretty fruity

424
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,660
drink he got there you're like yeah I love lemon my dad doesn't outright call

425
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,380
things my dad stopped calling things gay but he does do this thing with his

426
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,820
eyebrows now when you order something that's gay hmm he's like oh you're

427
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,260
getting that mmm for the listeners Patrick shaved his eyebrows off when he

428
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,500
said that I'd started pulling my eyebrows out with a thread shaved his

429
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,540
eyebrows into a picture a tiny picture of a guy fucking another guy. Into a tiny picture of my dad making the face.

430
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,980
yeah he does that with his eyebrows. He did he shaved his eyebrows into two

431
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,980
Hitler eyebrows. Hitler eyebrows. Yeah. That were just little squares. Yeah. I was

432
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,860
watching that whitest kid Hitler rap last night. You wanna try that again?

433
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,100
(mumbling)

434
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:33,580
- Somebody reverse that.

435
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,140
- Yeah, you'll be surprised and shocked.

436
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,980
You're never getting on SNL, buddy.

437
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,140
- And really angry.

438
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,980
- Yeah.

439
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,740
- I wanted to bring up from the Discord.

440
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,980
- Oh, a new person in the lore.

441
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,180
- We were asking, I'm designing like a

442
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,100
Hungry Hamstravaganza shirt and we were asking people in the discord like, "Oh, what characters

443
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,460
from the show should I put on it? What's funny?" And they said that, "I guess there's a discord

444
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,460
created character named Solution that we've never heard of."

445
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,060
We had never heard of Solution. We're still trying to figure out who Solution is.

446
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,060
What Solution? We just wanted to shout out Solution.

447
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:17,100
Solution and the head first walls. Yeah, Solution and the head first walls, something like that.

448
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,620
I tried to ask who Solution was, everyone just said you know.

449
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,740
Yeah they kind of iced us out. It's like we made you.

450
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,860
Yeah. But I want to shout out Solution. I think it's our fault for not paying attention.

451
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,940
Yeah. Yeah that's what it's like if you don't pay attention to your kid.

452
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,460
I'm not going to blame anybody that's at fault for Solution.

453
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,780
Yeah. I'm not mad about it. I think yeah I think Solution is a great addition.

454
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,780
Yeah. I'm welcome. I'm happy to welcome to the roster. Yeah this is our first

455
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,180
This is the first acceptance. This is Solution's acceptance.

456
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,340
They're going to mod Solution into the podcast.

457
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,180
We're patching in Solution soon.

458
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,540
Into all past episodes.

459
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,740
Yeah, so you go back. There will be tons of Solution material.

460
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,220
Just keep your ears out and your eyes out.

461
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,900
Would Solution as an Italian man?

462
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,420
We haven't done our research. I don't feel comfortable just making stuff up.

463
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,540
It's really not our thing.

464
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,580
Yeah, not our place.

465
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,700
We will become educated. Next week, you might hear me doing a funny Solution.

466
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,540
voice saying Solution, ramming my head into a wall and I'll kind of round it out you know.

467
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,620
They'll give us the baton and we'll run with it.

468
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,340
Yeah.

469
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,140
I mean yeah.

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,540
So shout out to I think it was

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,260
Shout out to Solution and only Solution.

472
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,340
Yeah no fuck whoever came up with Solution. Solution was bigger than you.

473
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Solution is we're starting a new podcast called Solution

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,460

Solutio it. Yeah, that'll be his catchphrase. See, again, we're getting too far.

483
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,660
Yeah, I don't want to, yeah.

484
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,420
Whatever, let's just hop on the list.

00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,900
Yeah.

486
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,340
What time are we at?

487
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,180
Right now, we're at the clock.

488
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,980
Oh, damn.

489
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,300
Yeah.

490
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,340
The list today I found pretty quickly, so, but I think it's funny.

491
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,140
I'm doing.

492
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,580
This is on the top 10 signs you have a bad neighbor.

493
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,820
And it's by user New Metal Maniac.

494
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,620
>> Here's a number one sign.

495
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,180
>> Friend in the pod, New Metal Maniac.

496
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,980
>> Number one sign, his name is Patrick and he lives next door to you.

497
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,140
>> I feel like I am a pretty bad neighbor.

498
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
>> Yeah, you definitely are.

499
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,740
>> Yeah.

500
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,460
>> I just, no, I don't do much.

501
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,620
>> I feel like if you just stand in here and you go, yeah!

502
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,060
>> If you had a lawn, dude, I would never want to live next to you.

503
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,620
>> Yeah. >> If you had a backyard,

504
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,540
I can only imagine what you're doing back there, dude.

505
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,900
I do not want to smell Patrick's musty backyard air. You would build a

506
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,700
you'd build a half pipe. Yeah I'd build a mini, if I had a backyard I'd have a mini

507
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,300
ramp in there. And you'd have an above-ground pool that you would not clean. I would not

508
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,660
have an above-ground pool. I hate swimming. You love swimming. You would have it for your...

509
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,940
You hate swimming? No I don't hate swimming but I feel like a pool... Patrick can't swim.

510
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:06,420
I feel like a pool is just scary. I can swim. I don't know. No I had it, there was a pool in

511
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:11,320

514
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,020

515
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,340

516
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,800

517
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,040

519
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,120
was an old couple that was in charge of the pool in the neighborhood yeah your

520
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:55,760
mom and dad no my mom and dad were young just absolutely flaming and Fran Fran

521
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,720
one day did not clean the pool she didn't clean the pool for a week and

522
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,040
then the pool was green one day and it was warm and I was like oh I wonder why

523
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,800
it's warm and then I opened up one of the filters and there's a bunch of dead

524
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:13,600
frogs. So wait, I thought that frog's blood was in the pool and that's why it was green.

525
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,320
To clarify, you saw it was green and you felt it to see if it was warm? I went in.

526
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,640
You went in when it was green? I was swimming in the pool because Fran told us it was fine. And that's

527
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,720
where you got your frog abilities. Yeah, that's when I got my frog abilities. That's when you got a big leap.

528
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,480
That's when you have an extremely long tongue. Uh-huh. Yeah. But yeah, she was like, "Oh, it's fine. I just

529
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,440

548
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Yeah, like in the pantry for like weeks.

550
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
No, they were in the cereal.

551
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Damn.

552
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Yeah, well we were eating--

553
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,820
Do you guys notice my rash?

554
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
Your rash? I did notice your rash.

555
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
I did notice your rash.

556
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,820
I wanted to ask you if it was sexual.

557
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,000
I have a rash because I'm allergic to Prilosec OTC.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,600
I love dude, halo, d-o-d-s-t, that's what you're allergic to.

559
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
If you want the rest of my Prilosec, you can have it.

560
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,640
I don't, is that a dick pill?

561
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
What's that?

562
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
It's a heartburn medication.

563
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,600
You take 14 pills in a week and then...

564
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,880
Oh, I've taken that before.

565
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah, you take 14 and then you don't have heartburn for like four months.

566
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,120
Yeah, I, when I was...

567
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,600
So I'm gonna have, not have heartburn for two months because I only took seven and then

568
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,720
I don't know if that's how that works.

569
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,400
When I was a big fat guy, I would get the most insane heartburn.

570
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Me too.

571
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,120
I would get combination sleep paralysis and heartburn.

572
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,400
So, I would wake up and not be able to move and also be choking on my own vomit.

573
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
And then I died.

574
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Yeah.

575
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Oh my God.

576
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Yeah.

577
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
That's what this list is about.

578
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,200
I died like the girl in Breaking Bad.

579
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,120
The description of this list is by New Middle Maniac.

580
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,780
Do you fear your neighbors or hate them?

581
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,920
This list talks about the signs of having a bad neighbor.

582
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,280
Not necessarily the worst types of people that can be neighbors or the most annoying

583
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:27,000
things overall just the signs the neighbor next door could be bad. Number one they

584
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,200
act like they own the street. That pisses me off. When Mr. Johnson puts up a sign

585
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,040
that says Johnson Boulevard. Yeah yeah. You're like what are you doing? He's like I

586
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,480
own the street. I mean is it? It is my street. You're just acting. Okay. Yeah you're an

587
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,400
actor. You can't be the mayor of the street. You can't. It doesn't

588
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,100
make any sense. You can be the king of the street but you better have a leather

589
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:55,240
jacket and some switchblades yeah street kings yeah and a crown yeah the Latin

590
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,840
kings of the street you can be the Latin kings mm-hmm that's true yeah you can be

591
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,220
the Latin Kings you can I just call him Kings mm-hmm I don't even I call them

592
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,780
the Latin X Kings yeah this the new metal maniac about this one says basically

593
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:17,320
King X basically the vigilantes the ones who like to think the whole street

594
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,840
belongs to them and should follow their rules. I hate when Mr. Johnson makes rules

595
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,040
for the street. I hate when my street has a vigilante. Yeah. Damn, my neighbor's a vigilante.

596
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,720
Oh man, we have the worst vigilante problem on our street. Yeah, we have a serious

597
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,480
vigilante problem. Parablam. Parablam. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Yeah. I tried to

598
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,320
jump back in and I fucked up the fucking landing. Number two, their home smells

599
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,240
awful. Does that mean you can smell it from outside? Yeah, their home has a dust

600
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,200
thing around it like pig pen from Charlie Brown. Yeah, it's got serious stink lines.

601
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,720
Yeah, it's got stink lines. Like flying spaghettis. It's got stink lines in Patra. And I'm not talking monsters.

602
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,080
I know I'm definitely a bad neighbor, but like I feel like I was lucky enough

603
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,560
growing up, because we were definitely bad neighbors, but I was lucky enough to

604
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,880
live next door to my aunt. So it's like I could be as bad of a neighbor as I want.

605
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,880
You could shoot those stink lines right at her damn face. She didn't care. Oh, and believe me, I

606
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,840
did. Yeah we were always bad neighbors growing up. We would have like, it's

607
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,120
because we would like encroach on people's properties. Like one time

608
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,160
there was this huge mud puddle in this in our neighbor's yard. It was like when we

609
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,320
were living like out in the country sort of. There was like a giant mud puddle.

610
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,080
Yeah. That you made with your butt. No I didn't I didn't shit it out with my ass.

611
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,440
You made a mud puddle with your butt. My older brother and his friend duct-taped me and Levi, my younger

612
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,480
brother, to like hand trucks for moving and we just they would, through the mud

613
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,920
they just like played chicken with us and just like smashed us into each other and

614
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,880
then the guy called the police. Wow. Yeah. We uh... what do we have? What do we have?

615
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:00,620
What do we have? We... oh um... there was one time... no I won't say it. Say it. I had

616
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,600
neighbors who would hit the... we lived upstairs and they would hit the floor

617
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,840
the ceiling or floor with their broom. Oh I've been there a million times man. Yeah.

618
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,280
When I lived in 35, there was a fucking, there was like a frat that lived below me,

619
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,800
and they would just like, they would start playing music like four in the morning

620
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,760
through like, it was like they had like an Acura owned by like an idiot that had like a giant

621
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,720
subwoofer in it. Yeah, yeah. It was just blasted. He had an Acura in his apartment? That's what it

622
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,400
sounded like, you know, you know like dumb people who get like, they just get like a 2003 like Acura

623
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,560
with like chipped paint and they put no money into the car and then just buy like $1800

624
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
worth of speakers.

625
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Keep it in the trunk.

626
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,440
Yeah, and then they play like some song where you can't hear anything except just like...

627
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

628
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
It was like those kind of speakers.

629
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah.

630
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah.

631
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And you hit them with a broom?

632
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,240
And I went down and I went hobo with a shotgun on them.

633
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Nice.

634
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
You've seen that movie?

635
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
No.

636
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
It's a good movie.

637
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
But I could guess what happens.

638
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
That's got Ruger Hauer.

639
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,160
Yeah, if you were in it, you'd be called homo with a shotgun.

640
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,160
you were in a call be booger ouchie booger ouchie that's your name if you

00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,480
her laugh I tried to fuck every babysitter that's not that's not the

658
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,160
situation and I did that was she was a she was just like our family was ugly

659
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:50,240
she was ugly you can say it she's she's a family friend so she lived with us for

660
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,920
bit so that's why she had that thing. You should date that girl. No, she's a total family friend.

661
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,240
But she like was watching us, we were being too loud and my aunt called us and I thought

662
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,080
it was my mom on the phone because like she I guess my aunt, my aunt's a fucking bitch

663
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,920
and she... You won't call the family friend ugly. But I'll call my aunt a bitch. You'll

664
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:17,120
call your aunt a fucking bitch. So she called our house and then was like trying to like

665
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,880
she was like put one of them on the phone right now I need to talk to them and then

666
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,760
she gave us the phone and then I answered in a voice like I answered like a cowboy voice

667
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,800
like hi like no cowboy ever sounded like this like the sunset sarsaparilla cowboy from fallout

668
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,840
okay yeah let's see that's how I answered it and she literally I heard I put the phone down

669
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,080
because she hung up I heard the dial tone and within like a second of me being done with the

670
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,520
call my aunt opened our front door and just started screaming at us about how

671
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,880
she had to work the next day she does sound like and I have never I have never

672
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,320
liked her since she did that really yeah she does not respect cowboys she does

673
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,080
not respect the Sunset Sarsaparilla boy I'm at peace with each of my aunts

674
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,120
mmm I find all of them just great people I would if they were uncles different

675
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,760
story if I like my uncles but if my aunts weren't related to me I would hate

676
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,900
them if aunts and uncles had to fight who would win? Uncles win. Why? Here's why, because

677
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,920
uncles will give you a beer and listen to Bob Seger with you. Uncles have

678
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,800
beer, aunts have wine. Mm-hmm and cigarettes. And cigarettes. They have

679
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,860
barefoot Moscato and cigarettes and they smoke them they smoke half of a Misty

680
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,960
and then they throw it out and they drink too much Moscato and then you can

681
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,160
steal their cigarettes right out of their hands during the World Series in

682
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:47,200
2014 yeah I did and and also half of aunts in my experience are from Peru and

683
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,680
they're really small yeah so I feel like that would and it's 10 and it's 10 times

684
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,640
worse when your aunt is your neighbor yeah because they because number three

685
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,760
they steal your mail number three they steal your mail you guys ever have this

686
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,480
issue people what neighbors stealing your mail yeah no I've mostly like lived in

687
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,400
spots where like people can't touch my mail.

688
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,880
And that's a tactical choice. They can't even touch it.

689
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,080
They can't even look at it. Not even if they wanted to.

690
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,400
No, I've never...

691
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,520
I mean by accident before but they would give it back.

692
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,280
I used to do that all the time. I never stole mail. There's this house...

693
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,920
That's a federal offense, bud. I only did that when I was a kid. I didn't give a fuck about the mail.

694
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
I just thought it was...

695
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,680
I was like, I'm breaking a law. I respect the mail too much. We would walk around this

696
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,040
neighborhood called the North...

And scared the shit out of him. It was awesome.

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Yeah. That was probably me too.

758
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
I had a beagle Australian cattle dog mix.

759
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Did not have a pet growing up.

760
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,640
I just had like, we had like outdoor dogs, which is something like people don't really have up here I feel like.

761
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,840
We had like outdoor dogs that were just like,

762
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,600
they weren't even, they weren't even,

763
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,840
like they were beasts.

764
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,680
Like they were, I had no control over them.

765
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,520
- Yeah, my dog feels like a fit.

766
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,680
- They lived in like a cage and we fed them slop.

767
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,520
- Yeah.

768
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,000
- You know, and they were just like,

769
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,040
we just had to, there's no point in having them

770
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,320
except just to like fucking make our neighbors despise us.

771
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,980
- They would just yell all,

773
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,480
the neighbor had like a little kid.

774
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,320
- Oh, yeah.

775
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,600
- And the dogs wanted to fucking eat this kid so bad.

776
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,440
They wanted to rip him to shreds.

777
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,720
- Dogs wanna eat kids.

778
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,880
Yeah, there was when I was a kid, there was a dog that lived like in the house next door

779
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,520
and there was like a little fence around like a chain link fence.

780
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,240
And there was like a big ass dog and whenever I went in the yard to play, it would just

781
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,240
like start freaking out and trying to jump over the fence and it scared the shit out

782
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,360
of me and I stopped going outside for a while.

783
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Dogs are scary.

784
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,400
I was so scared of dogs for most of my life because of that dog.

785
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,200
One of my shitty neighbors like growing up like she was at the same age as me but she

807
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,860
do you know what I'm talking about?

808
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,860
I don't remember that.

809
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,860
You build up rage because the testosterone is stuck in your peice.

810
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Somebody find that scene and send it to Caleb.

811
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,860
No, send it to Cameron.

812
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,860
Caleb loves that scene.

813
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
My military roommate did believe that in community college.

814
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
He believed Disturbia was a real movie?

815
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,860
No, he believed that if you don't jack off you become an alpha male.

816
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,860
It changes your, dude it changes your um

817
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,860
it does change your balance.

818
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,940
hormones. Your balls get too filled up, you get change your center of balance,

819
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,860
lower center of gravity, you can tackle people easy, you're taking to the ground like

820
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,700
vertical leap. Two shots to the fucking head. I will say Muhammad Ali did not have

821
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,660
sex before fights. Yeah. You know, there's something to that.

822
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,860
Listen, if it worked for Muhammad Ali, it'll work for me. That's all I'm

823
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,500
saying. Cash is clay. Catch this clay. Catch this clay. Caleb Clay. I'm remembering a

824
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,640
neighbor that I had that because we had like one of the neighborhoods I lived I

825
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,200
moved I moved like 19 times before I moved to Boston. I just like moved every

826
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,720
year growing up and one of the places we lived-- Because you're 19 years old.

827
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,760
Because I'm 19 years old and one of the places we lived had like a tiny pool in

828
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,320
the middle of the thing and the people who lived there were so crazy about like

829
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,640
like making sure people who were using the pool belonged to the neighborhood.

830
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,760
Yeah, and because like half of it was just like a normal like shitty houses North Carolina neighborhood

831
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,380
But then the other had the back half was like these huge fucking houses. Yeah, it was like a brand new development

832
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,140
They were just like saving or they were sharing the pool with us

833
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,640
Yeah

834
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,440
and so these people like we would go and a lot of times people would like ask us like where we live and stuff and

835
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,380
There's this one guy who would always like kind of look at us when we were in the pool

836
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,580
He lived across the street and one time he came in and he was like

837
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,280
I know you kids don't fucking live in this neighborhood

838
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,920
and I was like yeah I do bitch and I was like 14 and just talked so much shit to

839
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,440
this guy just kept calling him a homo like just was fucking just ribbing him

840
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,640
just like making fun of her looking goofy he I was it was I was just it was

841
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,720
fun because I knew I had it in my back pocket like I live in this neighborhood

842
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,920
yeah and I kept telling him like please call the cops please call the cops he

843
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,800
was like he just like hassled us until I was like all right we're leaving man and

844
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,780
And he's like, "Good, I'm following you home."

845
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,500
And this dude followed us home, back to my house,

846
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,340
and he was like, "Oh, this is your house?"

847
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,440
And I was like, "Yep, it's my house."

848
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,300
And he's like, "Fine, walk in."

849
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,580
And then I walked up to it, and I used my key,

850
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,540
and I walked in, and I was like,

851
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,660
"Come here, man, I want you to meet my parents."

852
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,500
(laughing)

853
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,320
- Nice.

854
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,180
- And then he talked to my mom and dad for a long time,

855
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,700
and he was just like, "Yeah, man,

856
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,780
"I'm like the biggest asshole in the world, aren't I?"

857
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,780
It was so nice.

858
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
That's a good feeling.

859
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,940
It was the best feeling.

860
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:54,860
My aunt's, my other aunt who lived in the neighborhood, she was the person, she was that guy.

861
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,860
She was a guy?

862
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,860
You had an aunt that was a guy?

863
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,860
Yeah, my aunt was that guy.

864
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,980
No, my aunt would like, like if kids like in the neighborhood had their friends over,

865
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,300
she was like, "Yeah, you're only allowed to have like five guests per house."

866
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,740
My aunt was making up fucking rules?

867
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,980
Yeah, she's just making up five guests per house.

868
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,540
Yeah, she didn't even, yeah.

869
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,540
It was fucking stupid.

870
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,540
No, my aunts suck. I hate my aunts.

871
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,540
That rugs, dude.

872
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,540
What the hell?

873
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,540
Five, five, five.

874
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,540
Yeah, no, just some arbitrary rule that she would--

875
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,540
Dude, you cannot have friend groups bigger than three in this neighborhood.

876
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,540
Just some stupid arbitrary rule like that to pull out, like, when she doesn't like a neighbor.

877
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,540
Ah, ah, ah, no laughing on Tuesdays, guys.

878
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,540
You cannot bring sandwiches to the pool.

879
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,540
Sorry, it's what it says.

880
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,540
Yep. It says in my brain. I made a book-- I wrote a book in my mind.

881
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,580
of my brain is that you can't ever make me mad so yeah and yeah look hanging of

882
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,460
having more than five guests that makes me mad I'm seriously getting I'm hulking

883
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,860
out right now even thinking I'm bulking up I'm bulking up to kill you to be the

884
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,300
defender the bouncer of the neighborhood number six they throw too many parties

885
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:03,180
that was also my family yeah I used to live next to this guy I think his name

886
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:09,920
was Asher Roth and he would just throw these fucking buck wild parties. He loved

887
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,180
drinking, he loved women, and he loved college. Yeah yeah he went to the

888
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,980
University of North Carolina next door and he just got in love with college.

889
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,660
This is the description of this one. "This is a weird item and it seems like it

890
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:30,400
doesn't belong here. It makes the neighbors seem very popular but I tend to

891
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,920
avoid parties for good reasons and there could be some shady stuff going on in

892
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,000
them. Shady stuff at the party? They're playing with the pinata. They are having

893
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,600
too many guests in the house. Yeah, they have more than five guests at the pool.

894
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:49,000
I heard that people are taking turns in the bathroom.

895
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,760
They're all using the same bowl for chips. No more than five people in the bathroom at any point. Hey, no more than three chips in a bowl at one time.

896
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:05,800
Hey, one bite per minute. You can chew once per minute. You get three ounces of dip,

897
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:11,320
okay, and I'm measuring it. Yeah, one glass of water per night. Mm-hmm. You get one

898
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,100
glass of water on your bedside table. You get one glass of milk under your bed. One

899
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:25,000
kind of long poop every two days. That's fair. No black pants! Get out! She

900
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,880

903
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,760

906

Yeah, I was a pariah because they would kick the fucking ice cream man out. I don't know

907
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,080
It's all you know that side no soliciting no square cars

No music outdoors. They kicked the good ice cream man out the one who would sell you poppers if you asked him not not like

909
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:14,040

913

914
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:43,240
say there's an ice cream man who sold you fireworks at a loss uh-huh that your mom kicked out of the

915
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,800
the neighbor well yeah he was selling cold food that's a good thing to have no cold

916
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,480

918
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,480

919
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,160
said that he was a drug dealer and a pedophile

920
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,520
well yeah i see yeah and that's another good thing you will know drug dealers or

921
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,460
pedophiles in the neighborhood

922
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,440
yet equal police said can one of their community public five drug dealers

923
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,440
She did not say pedophile.

924
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,720
Sorry, we have five pedophiles already.

925
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,880
I'm going to have to ask you to get out of here.

926
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,640
She didn't say pedophile, she said kid catcher.

927
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:27,760
And then I told all the other kids that the ice cream man was a kid catcher.

928
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,040
But I thought he was your homie.

929
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,040
Now you're switching sides, dude.

930
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,600
Yeah, more like Patrick Tomo.

931
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,520
Well, you get brainwashed as a kid.

932
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,520
Yeah, you got brainwashed.

933
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,520
You're telling me you got brainwashed.

934
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,520
You got brain from that guy, alright.

935
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,160
more like you got brain-freezed by the next one's my favorite one on this list

936
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,980
they live completely alone yeah okay read it go ahead I did it was my

937
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,320
family have to actually say it number seven they live completely alone you may

938
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,120
not think that a neighbor is bad because of this but think about it the neighbor

939
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,240
in question does not have a spouse a kid or a pet and is completely alone

940
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,040
something is amiss with this kind of neighbor if they are alone all the time

941
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,080
What it is is anyone's guess. I think it's normal to be alone. I think it's not normal. It's terrifying and awful.

942
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:17,100
I don't remember if this guy lived alone, but his name was Dick and one day we had our screen door open.

943
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,580
Dick who is alone. Dick who is alone. Alone Dick.

944
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:26,080
And Dick came up to her, we had our screen door open and we were inside playing and we were playing too loud and

945
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,440
Dick came up and said he was gonna call the police on us for disturbing the peace and

946
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,540
I wasn't allowed to have a sleepover that night. And you're like, hey, listen up Dick

947
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,440
I'm gonna disturb your peace if you know what I'm talking about. I would have said you want to talk about peace buddy

948
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,040
You realize we've been in Iraq since 1999?

949
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:47,920
How about we disturb that peace? Dick died like two months later and when my mom told me I was like good

950
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:56,500
He ruined my playdate. I did that with my grandpa when I was a kid. I had like a mean old grandpa

951
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,400
I just like hated him growing up

952
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,940
up and I was maybe like six when he died and like my mom and my grandma they're

953
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,640
both like crying in my house and I went up to him and I was like what the hell

954
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:13,440
are you crying I thought we all hated that guy yeah damn I had great emotional

955
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,400
intelligence as a child oh I had a terror I when my great-aunt Kathy died

956
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,920
we were waiting on the stairs on Easter because she died on East the night

957
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,480
before Easter morning and I was like when do we get candy are we doing like a

958
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,160
moment of silence right now and my uncle Paul freaked the fuck out on me.

959
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,840
He did a Paul flip. Yeah he was living with us at the time.

960
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,600
All my uncles lived with us. Yeah he was living with us. I just want to skip to number nine.

961
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,600
We'll just do number nine as the last one. They play a lot of loud noises from

962
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:53,000
their home. Just monkey noises? Yeah just the intro to Head Like a Hole. Yeah yeah.

963
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah, so they play samples.

964
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Why do you keep playing?

965
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's like white noise.

966
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, stop playing noises.

967
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,560
It's how I sleep.

968
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,560
It's jungle noises.

969
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,760
They play loud jungle noises.

970
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,400
I'm from the jungle.

971
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
I'm a monkey.

972
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,380
I have to - this is like white noise to me.

973
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,380
This is my house.

974
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,380
This is what my house sounds like.

975
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,400
What about a monkey that goes -

976
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
What about a monkey that -

977
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,000
Think about that.

978
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,840
What about a monkey that can spell?

979
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,840
Well, they can do that I'm sure.

980
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,840
Nobody's asked them yet.

981
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,840
The thing is we haven't learned their language.

982
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,840
I'm gonna learn your language pal

983
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,840
if you don't shut the fuck up. I'm sorry.

984
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
Oh, I'm gonna teach you some language.

985
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,840
I'm gonna teach you my personal

986
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,840
love language. F-U-C-K-P-U-S-S-Y

987
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,840
P-U-S-S-Y

988
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
P-U-S-S-Y

989
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,840
C-K

990
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,840
I'm gonna, you know he's coming to Boston.

991
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,840
Pussy C-K. Yeah, Pussy C-K.

992
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,840
That would solve so much

993
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:54,840
if you just came up on stage in a pussy hat and he was like "ah my daughters are old now"

994
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,840
what if he got a pussy installed into his chest like Iron Man?

995
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,840
like Videodrome?

996
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,840
yeah that'd be kind of funny

997
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
and he keeps a gun in it

998
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,840
yeah

999
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,840
yeah see but now that no that would lose people again

1000
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,840
okay but it's a pink gun

1001
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
that's pretty nice

1002
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,840
it's for breast it's pink for breast cancer

1003
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,840
oh breast cancer Susan G Coleman that was perfect

1004
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,840
Susan G Coleman and it's Susan Gary Coleman

1005
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,840
[Laughter]

1006
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,840
[Laughter]

1007
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840
He's behind Save the Tata's

1008
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,840
[Laughter]

1009
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,840
He wasn't even talking about breast cancer

1010
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,840
He just said that one day

1011
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,840
And then everyone was like, "Gary, you fucking genius!"

1012
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,840
"Gary, what was your first name again?"

1013
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,840
"Susan!"

1014
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,840
[Laughter]

1015
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Susan Gary Coleman

1016
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,840
Susan Gary Coleman

1017
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,840
She's in Postal 2

1018
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,840
[Laughter]

1019
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:48,720
that's so weird Gary Coleman is a big plot point of postal to the movie or the game

1020
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,080
the game is there is it a movie - I've only ever played postal - to just run

1021
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,620
around and shoot stuff you put the cat you put the cheats in to get all the

1022
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,700
guns and then you put the cats on the end of the shotgun yeah I've never I've

1023
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:04,300
never just like played it like a game they came out with the sequel to postal

1024
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,680
- it's like postal like apocalypse weekend or something like that like they

1025
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,400
came out with it like recently yeah I think Milo Yiannopoulos does a voice

1026
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:16,280
yeah I'm gonna have to check this out I have it I didn't realize yeah I didn't

1027
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,200
realize I had it when I bought postal - oh damn I was one of the first games I

1028
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,560
ever torrented postal - yeah mmm it's a it's not a bad game that was when I was

1029
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:30,720
like oh you can just pirate any game and don't have any DRM yeah but like

1030
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,240
sometimes like ISPs will hit you I got a sniper elite v2 I got hit for Saints

1031
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,160
- That's not a hit yet because I just downloaded like...

1032
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,480
- They had it on Xbox, I didn't need it.

1033
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,200
- Random shitty old movies and like Digimon and shit.

1034
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
- Stuff that nobody's tracking.

1035
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
- Exactly.

1036
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,200
- Like a 700...

1037
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,120
- Like I'm sure if you download, yeah, like the stuff that just came out, like if I download

1038
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,360
Uncut Gems right now.

1039
00:57:53,360 --> 00:58:00,120
- Yeah, I downloaded like a 700 megabyte file of the abominable Dr. Fibes in middle school

1040
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,280
and my mom like almost lost her shit on me.

1041
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,000
for some reason my mom thought you couldn't get caught downloading music

1042
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,400
but if you downloaded movies on LimeWire that's what got you

1043
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,860
I don't think people got hit with LimeWire as much

1044
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,760
No, you could download any mp3 you want

1045
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,000
That was kind of before they knew how to

1046
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,540
track it. Yeah, we got our final, the nail in the fucking coffin, the thing that we

1047
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:30,080
weren't allowed to torrent anything ever again, like my parents were like we're

1048
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,520
gonna check the computer

1049
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,480
was my little brother downloaded

1050
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,540
tyo cruise dynamite dot mp3 on utorrent

1051
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,540
and that's what got us

1052
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,320
Jesus Christ

1053
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,000
you got all that for tyo cruise?

1054
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,480
no i had such like a good like

1055
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,000
library of torrented shit and it's all gone now

1056
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,240
too because my parents made us delete some of it. I had every like David Bowie

1057
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,080
and Sonic Youth's entire discography

1058
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,960
I fucked up my parents computer which is downloading just full albums.

1059
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,960
Fuck yeah.

1060
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,560
That, like Primus' whole discography, the soundtrack to The Hangover.

1061
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,360
I thought that song, the Primus song, My Name is Mud, I thought it was My Name is Butt for

1062
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,360
so long.

1063
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,360
We've talked about this.

1064
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,360
Oh, okay.

1065
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,360
I just wanted to double check.

1066
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,360
My name is Butt.

1067
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
My name is Butt.

1068
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,920
Not to be confused with that son of a bitch.

1069
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,680
Not to be confused with Mud.

1070
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,680
