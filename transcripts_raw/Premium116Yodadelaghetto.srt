1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Come here, come here, come here, let me see your butt.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,860
(laughing)

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:12,100
(laughing)

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,440
- Do it.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,280
- Do it.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,000
- Go to the hood, I must.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,960
- Say it right over.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,200
- Get holicious, I will.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,960
- He's gonna become get holicious.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,400
- That's from our new movie, Yoda in the Hood.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,200
- I thought you said it was Yoda de la Ghetto.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,120
- Oh yeah, Yoda de la Ghetto.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,200
(laughing)

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,120
Why'd you hit ghetto? Why'd you say ghetto? It's a French film. Yeah. Oh,

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,300
Yoda de la ghetto. Yoda de la ghetto I am. Je suis. What kind of pants you have on Yoda de la ghetto?

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,500
Janko!

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,900
Janko shorts? That'd be cool. Pants on me. Pants on me they are. Pants on me they are.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,100
Janko shorts. Me pants on they. Pants, pants!

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,240
I yeah and then what I said was my big black ass

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,340
I didn't say my big black

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,820
When did I see you never said I don't even do the other way you said you do the Yoda voice you were the

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:20,220
Yoda Yoda's in here Yoda. It's not me. So you didn't say my big grass. I've been here

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,280
It's Yoda's in the room Yoda. How'd you fit your big black ass in this room?

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:36,320
from space car space Royce space Royce is that a nice car does it go to like a

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,280
rolls-royce if it's a rolls-royce but it's space does it even have the stars

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,620
on the top or is it something else yes no it does have the stars you have like

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,280
grass on the top I feel like that would make sense because when you're saying

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,440
yeah I think it makes perfect sense is it wheels or were like jet boosters or

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,140
that was it does it worse for force force. Oh, you said it was a space

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,560
Roy.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,860
Well, that's a different car. That's way, way better. That is

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,660
I love being. I thought you might

33
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,560
so cool.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I miss Yoda. Oh dude, you know, what's great about

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,360
that? What it's Grover to

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,580
can be Grover in the hood. But Grover doesn't. Same voice. Grover would end up in the hood.

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,780
Yeah. He'd probably shoot his cannon too far. He'd bring his cannon to the hood. Yeah, Super

38
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,100
Grover. Yeah. It would be Super Grover first of all. Yeah. He would be in there. And he'd

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,820
end up in the hood. And they would help him out because it's good there. There's a monster

40
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:47,340
at the end of his hood. Yeah, dude Yoda in the hood is very, that's a, I mean if we were

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,500
on Newgrounds in 2003. There has to have been a Sesame Street in the hood. Yes. Yeah. You

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,620
remember Elmo's Got a Gun? That wasn't in the hood though. Yeah it was. No that was

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,340
like we need to talk about Kevin style thing. No no Elmo's Got a Gun cuz the end

44
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,940
of the song is like the I mean it's like. Weird Al didn't do hood humor. It's not

45
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,700
Weird Al. It's wrongly attributed to Weird Al. Yeah it was a radio DJ. Everything's weird.

46
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,460
It was all Weird Al. It's true on LimeWire it was Weird Al. On my mom's iPod it was Weird Al.

47
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,220
That was Weird AI. Yeah. Oh. It's the AI that generates parody songs. So what. It was a

48
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,140
radio host, a radio host did that and then at the end of the song he does like

49
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,100
black voice and is like "You want me to walk through Setsmiss Street without a

50
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,260
bulletproof vest? Forget about it!" Whoa. Yeah dude I remember all the words to that.

51
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,860
Weird Al wouldn't have done that. I listened to that probably when I was like nine years old I heard that more than the Beatles I think.

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,140
The Hood was a frontier that Weird Al would never, no he never pushed. Yeah he's a respectable man.

53
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,060
Maybe that you see they're making a movie about a biopic of Weird Al with

54
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,240
with Daniel Radcliffe playing Weird Al.

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
- The Daniel Radcliffe show.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,060
- And I think they might touch on the hood years.

57
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,900
- Really?

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,260
- Where he says that he'll never do hood stuff

59
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,660
until White and Nerdy,

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,940
because he doesn't want to disrespect that community,

61
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,460
and then White and Nerdy comes along.

62
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,700
- And he gets kind of tempted by the money.

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,540
- Yeah.

64
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,220
- And so he finally goes into the hood

65
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,420
and does ghetto stuff.

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,260
- Yeah.

67
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,100
- Yeah.

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,940
- Yeah.

69
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,580
- We basically, I think we just,

70
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,820
in the last five minutes, did our entire hood era.

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
And I think our hood in Ghetto Era might be over.

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
I think it's good that we stop.

73
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
I think we're done with the hood.

74
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
I think we had 5 minutes.

75
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
I think it's good for like, yeah, at least 5 minutes and then you kind of tread into dangerous waters.

76
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Yeah.

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
And then you sound like an asshole.

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
You think the hood is dangerous waters? Is that what you're saying?

79
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
No, there's no waters in the...

80
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
(laughter)

81
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
See what I mean?

82
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
Look, we hit 6 minutes.

83
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Now we're at 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

84
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
Well, we were doing it 2 minutes before.

85
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
That fell within the purview of hood time.

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
I don't want to see 5.01.

87
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
I don't want to see where Pat takes it at 5.01.

88
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
We've got 15 seconds left, Pat.

89
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
I want a bowl with...

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:07,820
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

91
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
I've got all my hood shit out on every other episode.

92
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
This is your time.

93
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Okay, we're done.

94
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
No more talk about the hood.

95
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,980
about the hood. Whatever you do, don't say anything about Yoda being in the

96
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:29,180
hood or what he would do in the hood or what he would use the force to do in

97
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
the hood or...

98
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,180
Do you think he would...

99
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:43,540
Of course I am. Hold my lightsaber sideways, I do.

100
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,220
no more talk about what Yoda would wear if he was in the hood or how he would

101
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
address people.

102
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,020
He doesn't, does Yoda wear anything?

103
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,860
Yeah, he has a robe.

104
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,860
He wears a Jedi robe.

105
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
A Jedi robe?

106
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
He wears a chain.

107
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
People forget.

108
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,860
He's on this robe.

109
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,980
He's on a chain, but he wears a necklace.

110
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,980
People forget that.

111
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,820
There will be no talk of what Yoda's necklace would have.

112
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,860
Yoda's necklace, well here's what it actually has.

113
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,900
It's like, you know, it's like a, have you seen the Tu Wong Fu?

114
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Huh?

115
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,580
where Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo and Wesley Snipes are drag queens?

116
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
No. No.

117
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
I think it's too unfair.

118
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Sounds really hot.

119
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,140
Too unfair and thank you for, I don't remember, but...

120
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
Thank you for smoking?

121
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,100
I think in that movie one of them has like a turd on a necklace.

122
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Whoa!

123
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,620
But Yoda has his semen in his necklace just in case he wants to make another Yoda.

124
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,660
And there will be no, we will not talk about what it would be like...

125
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,260
He pops out to a woman like a cartridge.

126
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,220
If Yoda was having a child in the hood.

127
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,100
if Yoda was making a baby in the hood or having sex in the hood, we can't talk

128
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,620
about it.

129
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,780
Kayla and I are shaking in our chairs.

130
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,100
There's nothing to be said about the kind of girl that Yoda will be having a

131
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,220
baby with in the hood. Yaddle.

132
00:06:51,220 --> 00:07:00,780
And that's it. Just yaddle. There's no suffix at the end that goes on for a

133
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,220
while. Just yaddle, okay? We're done. We're done with Yoda in the hood. I'm

134
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,620
making an executive decision as one of the executives. Yeah, it's over.

135
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,020
Nobody wants to hear about what kind of hood shit that Yoda was doing.

136
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,060
Nobody wants to hear Yoda's freestyle that he does on the corner of the

137
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,060
street in the hood. Nobody wants to hear that. No, it's not for you.

138
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,060
It's not. Nobody wants to hear... It's not for us. I remember you was

139
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
conflicted. Nobody...

140
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:46,060
(laughter)

141
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Okay.

142
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
Okay. We're done.

143
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,060
I don't think you said it right.

144
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Remember you was conflicted, I do.

145
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
That's better.

146
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Yeah.

147
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,060
But we're done.

148
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,180
What has everyone been up to?

149
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,020
We just got back from Los Angeles.

150
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
It sucked.

151
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
I like it.

152
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
I can't even.

153
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
I actually like LA now.

154
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,540
I like, the first time I ever went there was to film the Patrick Goes to Jollibee and I

155
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,220
slept in the trash.

156
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
That's it, this was a big upgrade for you.

157
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,580
Yeah, I got to sleep, I only slept on the floor one time because I wanted to give your

158
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
brother a couch.

159
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,140
He slept on the floor and my brother, I thought, at one point Pat started snoring so bad that

160
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,860
my brother left the house for two hours at like five in the morning.

161
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
I wish I could have done that.

162
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,260
He went and slept in his car for a little bit.

163
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Yeah.

164
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
It was pretty cool, yeah.

165
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
That's how bad my snoring is.

166
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,980
Your snoring is horrible, dude.

167
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,700
You are one of the worst snorers I've ever seen.

168
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,060
You beat Pete, dude.

169
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,220
You beat my grandpa, yeah.

170
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,340
I really got to get that sleep apnea mask.

171
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,980
My ex would be so scared that I would choke in my sleep.

172
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,300
You sound like you're constantly choking in your sleep.

173
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Do I?

174
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Yeah.

175
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Yeah.

176
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
It's horrible.

177
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
That's not my problem.

178
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,300
If I die, I die.

179
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Damn, he's living on the edge.

180
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Whoa.

181
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Whoa.

182
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,820
If I die in my sleep, at least I'm having like a crazy dream.

183
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,940
Yeah, if I die in my sleep and I don't even know about it, I don't care.

184
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
If it's completely painless.

185
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,340
I'm having a crazy ass dream where I'm having crazy sex.

186
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm getting choked by a bug queen.

187
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,260
You're going to get choked by the bug queen.

188
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,100
I've been having crazy dreams.

189
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Oh yeah?

190
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,340
I had this dream the other night that I was this is a very very like like

191
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,940
revealing dream of the kind of stress that I have in my brain. Most of the

192
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,700
time I had a dream that I was on a plane and the plane started to take off and

193
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,660
it like couldn't finish the take off and it crashed and like exploded and I was

194
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,180
fine like I got out of the plane crash and I walked back to the airport and I

195
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,340
walked out of like the like the like security thing you can't go back into

196
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,620
and then I was talking to somebody. I was like yeah, I was just on a flight

197
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,240
that like crashed like can I get my money back and they were like no after you

198
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,360
leave the airport, you can't come back in to get your money back and I was like

199
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,960
oh no. I had a weird dream last night. So sexual dream. Nah, shut it down. Who

200
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,160
was the victim? Victim? Come on man. Or the other. Who was the, who was your

201
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,040
lucky target? Well here, the whole dream was that I was about to hook up with

202
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,260
friend dresser, but I couldn't because whoopee Goldberg was coming over.

203
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:24,260
We were supposed to have a dinner party. We may have misjudged him. He might be

204
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,280
in the old stinky granny's.

205
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,760
Are you? He might be a tomb raider.

206
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,520
Are you into old stinky? If it makes you stop calling me a

207
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,120
pedophile. The opposite of a cradle snitcher is a tomb raider. You could go

208
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,960
both ways.

209
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,720
It was like nanny friend dress. You're a crypt defiler. I was in the 90s.

210
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,720
You were in the 90s? So I was a baby.

211
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
So yeah, it happened in 97 and I was a baby.

212
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Was she old then too? No. Are you kidding me? Friend dress around the nanny?

213
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I don't know who that is man.

214
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
She goes "haaa" that lady. She laughs like that.

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
What? French Montana?

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
The fuck is that?

217
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,720
You know she'd be sipping the Hennessy.

218
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
She would.

219
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,160
We got into an Uber to Rex's place that was like...

220
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Stop messing with that desk.

221
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Alright.

222
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,760
Alright, if you don't want me to tell.

223
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,400
We got into an Uber that was like this...

224
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,920
Like a 45 minute Uber.

225
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,600
Like with this like 50 year old like cinephile like older black dude.

226
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Yeah.

227
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,200
And he was just telling us about like Scorsese movies and stuff.

228
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,920
Yeah, I recommended Mean Streets to him.

229
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
And he was...

230
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
But he held out until the end that he was...

231
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Whose brother?

232
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh, Cali Swag District.

233
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
He was the guy from Cali Swag District's stepbrother.

234
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,520
- Yeah.

235
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,360
- Wow.

236
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,320
- Or half-brother or something.

237
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,360
And he held that the entire time.

238
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,600
- If I was an Uber driver, I'm leading with that

239
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,780
every time someone comes in.

240
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm playing like, teach me how to doggie in the car

241
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,320
and being like, guess whose stepbrother this is?

242
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,240
Mine.

243
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,640
- That'd be cool if that was your stepbrother.

244
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
- It'd be cool if my parents got divorced

245
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,520
and I had more brothers and sisters.

246
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,600
- You had the entire Cali Swag District and the pack.

247
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,800
I don't want my parents to get divorced, but if that means two Christmases and the present is...

248
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
They can just adopt.

249
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
If you want extra brothers.

250
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,320
More brothers and sisters?

251
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,800
That is the ultimate gift.

252
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,760
Yeah.

253
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,800
The ultimate gift is if you're...

254
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,920
More playtime.

255
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,320
Is if your parents divorce and then your dad marries somebody who has a hot daughter your

256
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,040
same age and then you fall in love with your sister.

257
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,480
No, the ultimate is...

258
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,080
That's one of God's great gifts.

259
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
That's happened to people.

260
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,040
Ultimate is expensive dog.

261
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,160
I heard us. I think it happened when I was home. I heard somebody tell me that

262
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,040
they like. That's actually like one of the leading causes of love in the United States.

263
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,720
Isn't that the plot of Clueless? I heard somebody. That's the plot of a lot of movies. Yeah, many films.

264
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,200
Many films I've consumed. Many a day at the cinema.

265
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,760
Oh, remember we were in Tampa. We walked past that fucking. Oh yeah. When we were in Tampa we were

266
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,480
walking around because we didn't want to take like Ubers places and that's a place

267
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,320
you're not supposed to walk at all, but we literally from our like our city like

268
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,320
a con a lodge. We were walking to a waffle house and we passed by three

269
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,640
different like adult video centers and and I like when I looked up the route to

270
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,520
walk there. I was like oh we're gonna walk by and like an adult adult film

271
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,720
center or whatever and the one that I saw we were gonna walk by we didn't even

272
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,680
walk by that one. We walked by three different ones. There was another one

273
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,920
that we still walked. They still exist in the south because they can afford rent.

274
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,000
yeah, it's crazy. When my friend turned eighteen, he turned eighteen like right

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,760
around Halloween, and so on Halloween he was like dressed up as a ghost and he

276
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,220
like, we were, he was like let's go into the adult, like the adult movie thing,

277
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,720
and I wasn't old enough, but he was like let's go to the adult movie thing. I'll

278
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
run around like a ghost, and so he's going to get come done. Yeah, I mean it

279
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,440
was it was cool. I know yeah, you're just like a in there. It's not a ghost.

280
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,440
It's just a rag. Yeah, I walked in dressed up as a like a sheet ghost, and

281
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,600
there's like a decompression chamber where they have to like check your ID and like let

282
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
you in.

283
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
And so he did that.

284
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
He steam washed you like it's an airlock.

285
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
He did that.

286
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,340
He like gave the guy his ID and then he goes in and he just ran around the video store

287
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,320
like knocking videos off saying boo boo I'm a ghost.

288
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,580
And then he came back out and then we got like a mile down the road and he was like

289
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,660
oh shit I forgot my wallet in there.

290
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,900
So then he had to go back dressed as a ghost still and be like hey I left my wallet on

291
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,100
the ground. Yeah, we also walked by a porno theater. Yeah, a porno movie theater. And

292
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,580
when we saw somebody going in there at like noon. We made a joke. We like saw him

293
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,140
driving by and was like, "Oh, this guy's going to the porno theater." And then he just

294
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:51,020
pulled into the porno theater. I was like, "Wow." Also, in a place as small as... Oh, there was a

295
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,620
like a bar attached to it too. Yeah, well that's... You need the... No, you need the...

296
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,940
It was a bar that had like... It was like an arcade or something. Yeah, it was like an arcade attached to the porno theater.

297
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,460
You need the plausible deny it needs to be porno theater and like yeah

298
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,940
home we're talking about like imagine like going there for the barcade and you're like hanging out and then it like

299
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,680
Whatever like like midnight the movie gets out and like it just fills with like a 50 year

300
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:20,340
Like oh fuck. Oh, I'll walk up to you like I got next they're tapping you on the shoulder. They got sticky fingers

301
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,140
They're walking up to you. They're asking if you can point them to where the water is

302
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,460
You pull my quarters apart like a play game

303
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,620
Yeah, just like imagining the flood of them coming back into the bar. What is

304
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,020
it? Yeah, it would be a flood. Yeah, probably just busting open like the

305
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,060
shining lepping. It sounds like they're walking through a snowstorm.

306
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:51,060
They got their galoshes on. Oh, hell no, not for me. No, no, no nasty. I would.

307
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,980
They probably smell more. I would never smell good. Yeah, probably smells like

308
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,700
Nagasampa. Oh my god, it smells like spring. Is it just for guys who just can't figure

309
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,740
out how to open the Internet Explorer? I think it's guys who are afraid of Internet Explorer.

310
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,380
One thing is probably guys who are married. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Who need somewhere

311
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,140
to go to jack off because they don't know. It's guys who are married. Guys who are married

312
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,180
and got their computer taken away. I mean also like if you're homeless, like not too

313
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,660
many places to hang out in Tampa I think if you're homeless. That's true. Applebee's.

314
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,060
Remember you said that guy sticking in front of Applebee's? Oh yeah, oh he was sticking.

315
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,900
- So he was sticking?

316
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,740
- Oh, he really was.

317
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,560
- Yeah, he was sticking right now?

318
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,180
- He was sticking right then.

319
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,020
- What did he say?

320
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,860
- He was sticking.

321
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,700
- I don't remember, he was just going like

322
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,060
(mimics gun noises)

323
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,180
like right in front of the door.

324
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,020
- He was sticking, sticking.

325
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,500
- He's like, oh, we gotta show him our Vax Carbon IDs.

326
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,740
(laughing)

327
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,620
- Yeah, I think, I guess it's for,

328
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,860
you ever go to a guy's, someone's house?

329
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,980
I went to someone's house recently

330
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,380
and they don't have a lock on the bathroom door.

331
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,660
You're just like, how do you jack off

332
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,900
in this goddamn hellhole bathroom?

333
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,740
- Right.

334
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,580
- You have your fucking, it's like one of those

335
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,040
like stay out of the cone of vision of the teachers,

336
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,640
like flash games, but with your--

337
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,420
- Do you usually just walk around just throwing open,

338
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,180
like kicking down bathroom doors?

339
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
- I go to take shits and pisses.

340
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,360
- You don't knock?

341
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,200
- You don't knock, though?

342
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,040
That's what I'm saying.

343
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,880
- No, you're supposed to knock.

344
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,700
- Why wouldn't you knock?

345
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,920
- No, you're supposed to put a lock on a bathroom door.

346
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,460
- I, my, the lock on my family's bathroom door was broken,

347
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,540
like my entire childhood.

348
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,360
- You still don't have a lock on your door at your parents'

349
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,440
place. - It was your house.

350
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,280
- Yeah, I know.

351
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,360
- He's talking about your parents' house.

352
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:35,360
I went recently to a to a name names. I went to a bowl bop grill okay and they

353
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,780
have a code they have a code for the bathroom door but then lock on it okay

354
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,720
well yeah if it's like a restaurant yeah I asked the lady I was like hey can you

355
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,600
open the door and she's like sure and she goes over and she put punches in the

356
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,040
code and then she opened it like this like presenting it to me and in there

357
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,800
was just a woman taking a shit. Everybody just screamed and then I saw the lady

358
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,200
when she came out. She didn't look happy. No, I can imagine. Yeah. That happened to

359
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,680
me. You ever like think that it, you know, it's worse is a lock that's like not

360
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,880
heavy enough. So when you twist it you think it's locked but it's not. Happened

361
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,400
me at that fucking that breakfast spot that we went to with the big RBG mural.

362
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,840
Oh yeah. You know what sucks even more than that is when there's a lock

363
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,520
but it doesn't like go like you have to like you could there you can tell there's

364
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,720
some trick that you have to like push the door in or pull it or something while

365
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,160
you're in the lock but you have to go to the bathroom so bad you can't just like

366
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,040
hang out yeah the fucking we went to a Korean pool hall that had no door or

367
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,720
toilet oh you know what it was that's sick a guy who worked there sat right

368
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,040
next to the bathroom yeah no they had a door but the door was the door stopper

369
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,360
was drilled in front of the door so it would just stay so there was a door that

370
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,400
said bathroom but you couldn't open the door like it opened up until the door

371
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
stop it was cool I thought it was a very good design the feng shui and that oh

372
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,640
yeah no if you're I mean you're you know it keeps all the girls at that's true

373
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,920
yeah it was a serious unless the guy wants girls to come in so he can just

374
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,360
keep poking his head around the corner yeah being the kind of pervert where you

375
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,760
want to see girls going to the bathroom is so funny yeah Chuck Berry that's just

376
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
that's disgusting no he wanted to go to the bathroom on the girl you put cameras

377
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,060
in his bathroom in his restaurant.

378
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,360
- Yeah, but that's always the funny,

379
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,440
like you're gonna put cameras in the bathroom

380
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,280
so you can see them. - Why do you wanna, yeah.

381
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,740
- Yeah, so you can hear them farting

382
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,760
and see them shooting out poop.

383
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,400
- I mean, guys like poop and farts and piss.

384
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,240
- Maybe you do.

385
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,560
- Maybe you. - I hate pooping and--

386
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,680
- Why are you saying it like that?

387
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,640
- I hate pooping farts and pisses.

388
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
I hate that stinky crap.

389
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
- You like it, don't you?

390
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,640
- Nope, never seen it. - If you did--

391
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
- So I wouldn't know.

392
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,240
- If you did, that would really change our friendship.

393
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,000
if i got shit on all the time yeah if you were like the if you're like uh... like

394
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,380
paul giamatti and that i would i would i was on your list and stuff

395
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,560
i don't like i think it would cast a really negative light on the past like

396
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,760
three years i've known you were talk about pooping yes i thought you were

397
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,360
getting like a couple of times i'm not the whole time now i'm i'm so disgusted

398
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,860
by

399
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,960
who

400
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,360
that's a i i i don't know how to say that he is a it's a so disgusted by poop

401
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,040
Is that why is that not believable?

402
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,160
It's not believable.

403
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,200
The thought of poop is repulsive to me.

404
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,200
You're doing like DreamWorks face when you say it.

405
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,760
No, I'm not.

406
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm not.

407
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,160
My God.

408
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,040
It's disgusting.

409
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,480
You're saying it like Megamind.

410
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,560
Stop saying it like Megamind.

411
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,720
I hate poop with corn in it.

412
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,800
Poop with corn in it.

413
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,240
It's bad.

414
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,360
What about red peppers?

415
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,400
There's not red peppers in poop.

416
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,360
You can get red pepper in poop.

417
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah, I've seen a red pepper in my poop.

418
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah, you can get red pepper.

419
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,600
I was looking at your shit. Actually, I look at my shit every single time. You

420
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,680
guys look at what you just are. Why are you guys looking at your I looked at a

421
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,840
shit that I took yesterday and your shit took. It was like I knew it was

422
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,360
really bad, but I looked at it before I wiped just to get an idea. So I would

423
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,240
cover it with toilet paper so that I like I get a survey of my shit and it

424
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,840
looked like you know when you in a port a potty, how everything just sits on the

425
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,880
top of the water. It was exactly like that. It was completely like rim to rim

426
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,560
just covering the complete toilet. Why are you burping?

427
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,120
What? That is really nasty. It was a heave. It was cool. It looked like there was like a

428
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:20,600
uh, look like there's a brown. You know what it was? I saw a gross video again and it's

429
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,960
like been it's been affecting me. What was the video? I told Cameron about it but

430
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,560
there's like a it was like don't make him talk it's just it's just gross.

431
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,920
It's not funny? Yeah. It was it's funny for the end part of it the end part of

432
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,760
it but most of it is just like a shock value video. Somebody like reposted

433
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,400
something that was like it was like a trailer for like a porno video. Uh-huh.

434
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,680
They're like damn what the fuck is this? Yeah like you know those videos just

435
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,920
come to me. Yeah. And yeah somebody. That's a one way to put it. Yeah. No it's not that.

436
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,960
I have. It's not. It's not the other way around. You don't come to them. It's not

437
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,680
like we have a friend who sends those videos to us. Yeah. But yeah it was

438
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,060
like there is a woman in a glory hole porta potty and there's a poop that

439
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:19,760
falls down. That's funny. It's pretty funny but the video itself because it's like it's shot like

440
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,620
Texas Chainsaw it looks really gross and and then the like the last shot of the

441
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,600
whole trailer is like a whole human head up a woman's ass. Whoa! Uh-huh. Do they do

442
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,920
an inside camera like no like no 27 hours I'm sure I'm sure they get an after shot

443
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,080
but that like literally like you imagine what that feels like for both yeah yeah

444
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,240
that's nice like wearing someone like a helmet do you like hold your breath you'd

445
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:57,920
have to breathe in someone's yeah there's not air in there like a reverse

446
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,380
snorkel that points down?

447
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
It's like having your...

448
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Stop!

449
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
What?

450
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
A snorkel?

451
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
I'm not...

452
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Goddamn it!

453
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
What?

454
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,380
Stop it!

455
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,380
Why are you lurching?

456
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
Why is that making me kind of...

457
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,380
I have such a high tolerance for stuff!

458
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:19,820
I have such a high tolerance for shit, but this is like genuinely affecting me.

459
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,820
It would probably be like having like...

460
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
A snorkel?

461
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Pet, I want you to...

462
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Pet, look at me.

463
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:32,820
I mean it'd probably just be like having like your head in a grocery bag made of pork.

464
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,320
Gross.

465
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,820
Imagine trying to take a breath in like a grocery bag, the lining of the person's asshole like

466
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,820
sucks up to your mouth.

467
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,820
Yeah, well Julie it's your fault that I'm dry heaving, so if you're listening to this,

468
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
don't ever say that.

469
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,060
That's the name of the woman. Yeah, at least you wouldn't be able to see

470
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,260
anything. That's true. You wouldn't know that you were in a person's ass. You

471
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,740
would not be able to see that how much people you were stuck in a balloon up in

472
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:12,980
a butt. Saw style. It's like stuck in a balloon. Yeah, it's like really, really

473
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:20,500
tight down here. It's like you look like the airheads. Did you say wake up in a

474
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,300
butthole sauce. You wake up and it's like yeah.

475
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,700
I can't hear a thing. You're saying yeah, they just die in 30

476
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,700
seconds. Yeah, your goal. Your only goal is get out of the

477
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,500
right. Okay, so you have to feed you would be the person who's

478
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,700
but you're inside laxatives fast enough that they poop out.

479
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,300
You you would probably be the person who woke up with a dead

480
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,400
person's head in your ass. Yeah, and then you have to eat the

481
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,320
you have to eat to poop them out. You have to eat a bunch of prunes. I like prunes give you

482
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,440
enough shitting power to poop out a human head. Yeah you might need to give yourself

483
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,160
any Mediterranean food. True. Yeah. Dude I leave Zatar. Hey freaking Taco Bell. Yeah. Damn. Hey

484
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,600
freaking Taco Bell spicy food. I eat the falafel at Zatar. Great I mean you know no disrespect to

485
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,120
Zatar but I eat the falafel there. It's it comes it goes in smelling the same way it comes out.

486
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,400
I went to Arby's the other day. Oh, jeez. So good.

487
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,040
Nope. The other day when I was leaving town yesterday, grab some.

488
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,600
It would be like being inside an Arby's sandwich.

489
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,560
It would feel exactly like that. Yeah, that's exactly what it would be.

490
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,920
Yeah. Yeah. And in a juice.

491
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,320
Sauces. Yeah. Yeah. Horsey sauce.

492
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
Yeah. Arby's red sauce.

493
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,720
Curly fries. Yep.

494
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,800
Fries hitting you in the eyeball.

495
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,360
Oh, you remember they had the curly fry vodka?

496
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,400
No. Arby's came out with a curly fries vodka.

497
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,600
What does that mean?

498
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,480
That's none of my god damn business.

499
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,040
That sounds atrociously awful.

500
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,040
But I think Arby's comes correct most of the time.

501
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,240
I think Arby's is very strong.

502
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,360
Yeah, no, I think everybody hates Arby's for no reason.

503
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,160
And just get the beef sandwiches.

504
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,360
The sandwiches I think are kind of gross, but I like their fries.

505
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,480
The fries are crazy.

506
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
The sandwiches, and I've eaten a bunch of them.

507
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
I'm not saying they're gross, like I wouldn't eat them.

508
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,880
I just think as fast food sandwiches go, they're not very good.

509
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,240
I'd rather eat something fried.

510
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,280
There's so much more normal than like a McDonald's hamburger.

511
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Yeah, it does.

512
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Yeah, they're more normal.

513
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't go to a fast food place to get like a normal sandwich.

514
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Yeah, the horsey sauce is good.

515
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
I go there and I'm like, I'm healthy.

516
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,800
Horsey sauce is just mayonnaise and horseradish and it's good.

517
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Yeah, exactly.

518
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I like horsey sauce.

519
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Horsey sauce?

520
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:37,440
I've liked horseradish ever since I did a Passover seder one time and they gave me horseradish.

521
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Horseradish and beets?

522
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,680
Yeah, and I said, I literally got up on top of the table at Passover seder.

523
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:50,680
I said these bidders are bussing. You did that like Tom Cruise with Katie Holmes. I said I

524
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:58,640
love this. I love this. I love this. It was cool. I made a sandwich the other day. I bought

525
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,160
a thing of horseradish and beets. Did your older brother ever tell you that Man Witch

526
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,400
had human meat in it? Never. I didn't eat sloppy joes until I was like 15. Speaking of

527
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,760
human meat I got to show you guys my new favorite video. I saw it. Did you see it?

528
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,600
Yeah with the human hand. Yeah did you like it? Let me pull it up. Hold up. This video is so good.

529
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,680
It really grossed me out. Really? The hand part really grossed me out.

530
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,040
It's just like a... I know but it just looks weird. We're talking about a lot of really gross videos

531
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,720
today. And that's what gets... but that's what gets Caleb is the is the hand. Yeah I'm sure Caleb

532
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,440
saw this video. I saw he... I'll watch any dookie shitting pisser vomit movie. Yeah. But I don't

533
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,280
like gore no it's not gore it's not it's just too much no but I don't like gore

534
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,320
that's not really going I hate watching hit by train pack well that's not even

535
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,760
gore that's like it's a firework that's nothing to me and it's not even he

536
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,760
doesn't even get hurt all right here's here's a video called human meat in New

537
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,720
York restaurant you won't believe this where is this new people here that's

538
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,600
right well I'm gonna hold the mic up to a computer speaker but it says it's a

539
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,040
woman green screened into a news studio that says Clearview TV News.

540
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,680
Must be in Clearview, Florida.

541
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Probably.

542
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Must be.

543
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:28,960
I think it's from the big monitor.

544
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
I think you need to turn it up.

545
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
It's up all the way.

546
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,240
All right, well, I'll just say everything she says.

547
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,080
- That's why we've--

548
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,920
- Oy!

549
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,740
Oy!

550
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,520
- There's a human hand flesh New York City.

551
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,720
- Well this is a bus. - See that's gross looking.

552
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,000
- Here, I'll pull it up on my phone,

553
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,840
then I'll be able to actually hold it up to the speaker.

554
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,920
- That's disgusting looking to me.

555
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,000
- No, this is normal.

556
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
- That's not normal.

557
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,320
- That's not a real human hand.

558
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,440
- I know it's not, but it grosses me out to think

559
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,720
that it could be. - Why does it gross you out?

560
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
- 'Cause I don't like meat.

561
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,240
- You like meat. - You don't like,

562
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,080
you like meat.

563
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,120
- Raw meat disgusts me.

564
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,800
- I saw you eat a burger.

565
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,920
- I like the taste of meat,

566
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,360
but raw meat is really gross to me.

567
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Actually, you know what? We went to a burger place.

568
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Here's a video.

569
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
We got a quinoa bowl.

570
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Cannibalism.

571
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,080
dusty a four-star Michelin chief

572
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,080
we are at the top of the food chain and the only meat left to tackle was other humans

573
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,080
we battled long and had to be able to search them into our restaurants

574
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,080
our government finally conceded that we were in the right end of court

575
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,080
just to say that he has been fighting cannibal ordinance laws for over 10 years

576
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
people who ate it in colonial times

577
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
who's eating these people?

578
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
cannibals

579
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
who's doing all this cannibalism?

580
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
the doner party

581
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
what's that?

582
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,080
it's that little musical called cannibal

583
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
the musical written by Trey Clark and Matt Stone

584
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
this is the best part

585
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
I don't think I will

586
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,600
We have to keep meticulous records and there is a lot of paperwork someone has to fill out

587
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,680
before they die and before they can be eaten. We do pay handsomely for body donations though

588
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,200
and the money can be used for anything since funeral expenses become zero when you donate

589
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,040
your body to be eaten. Dossi says that there are plenty of dishes on the menu that do not include

590
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,240
human meat. But those leery of the process should not order at all. According to Dossi,

591
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,440
just like on those packages of candies with allergy warnings that say the machines also

592
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:51,240
are used to make items with nuts, our utensils are also used to cook human meat. So don't

593
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,480
come if you are not down with what we do.

594
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,980
So do not come if you are not down with what we do.

595
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,320
I think that's fair.

596
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
Yeah.

597
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,140
I don't know, like have you ever seen that picture that is like sometime during some famine some

598
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,280
people are like selling their kids meat?

599
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
No.

600
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
It's pretty cool.

601
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,440
Have you ever seen that picture and it's a...

602
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Pretty cool photo.

603
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,360
It's like that baby and it's screaming and it says get to the choppa.

604
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
That is a funny, that one's funny as hell.

605
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
That one's funny as hell.

606
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Have you seen the one that says I like waffles?

607
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,080
It's the same baby but he's not, he's out of his fatigues.

608
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Yeah.

609
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,760
Have you seen the one where it's like good guy Greg?

610
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Yeah.

611
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,080
And it has words on the top and the bottom.

612
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Yeah.

613
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Damn.

614
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,080
I don't think I could eat a person. I don't think I could eat any raw meat ever.

615
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,080
What about sushi?

616
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
I don't...

617
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
You ate sushi. I saw you eat sushi.

618
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
But those are different fun colors.

619
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Yeah, it's true.

620
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I just proved Caleb wrong with logic so hard.

621
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Have you guys ever had liver?

622
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
I've been meaning to.

623
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
It's so weird tasting.

624
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
I've been meaning to eat like a...

625
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
I've been meaning to eat a giant chocolate bar.

626
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Yeah?

627
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,560
made of candy. Where would you even get a face made of candy? Oh my god, you're

628
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,640
putting some crazy ideas in my head. I can't drop the name of the restaurant because I

629
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,580
don't want... I need to be able to get a reservation. That's ice cream stop. It's not

630
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:18,880
JPLix. Okay. Don't ask me to give any more information about this candy factory. I

631
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,080
I mean we need to do a pod trip to Hershey, Illinois.

632
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,220
It's Pennsylvania. Home of the ocean blue. We should just do a series where we get

633
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:40,920
to go to every candy factory in America. Okay. Yeah. We do we say that we're from

634
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,200
The candy tasted good. And the candy was delicious. Years later they produced a

635
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,520
chocolate bar that tasted delicious to me.

636
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,760
(laughing)

637
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,920
- And what do you have to say about reports

638
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,200
that you make one of the best candy bars in the world?

639
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,520
(laughing)

640
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,760
- Doing like, framing it as like a true crime thing.

641
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,600
- Yeah, yeah.

642
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,480
- Be like, a girl, we heard a girl went missing

643
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,800
at the Hershey's factory.

644
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,520
We'll have to taste every kiss

645
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
to make sure none of them have any flesh.

646
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,680
- We sat down with a fat guy to hear

647
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,720
what he thinks about Hershey's chocolate.

648
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,760
- Yeah, basically it's one of my favorite foods.

649
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
(laughing)

650
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,280
- Whoa, that's a long time.

651
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,540
(laughter)

652
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,100
- Interesting.

653
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,220
- And do you have any Hershey's with you now, sir?

654
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,060
- Yes.

655
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,100
- And could I have a bite?

656
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,940
- Yes.

657
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,740
- And would you consider Hershey's chocolate bars

658
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,620
to be brown?

659
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
- Brown.

660
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,300
- Mm.

661
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,740
(laughter)

662
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,300
- Very interesting indeed.

663
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,580
- Back to you, Caleb, with your chocolate bar.

664
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,140
- My name is Chocolate Hershey.

665
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,220
- That's good.

666
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,960
- That's my full name is Chocolate Hershey.

667
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
His name is Chocolate Hershey?

668
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
And he sounds like that?

669
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Sounds like that.

670
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Kind of sounds like post-stroke Cleveland.

671
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
What are you talking about?

672
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
What are you talking about?

673
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
Becoming Meatwad.

674
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
We sat down with Meatwad

675
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
to see if he likes chocolate.

676
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
I love chocolate.

677
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,340
I love chocolate.

678
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,340
Of course I love chocolate.

679
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Damn, I love that shit.

680
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,340
We sat down with Yoda De La Ghetto.

681
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,180
- Yoda de la Ghetto.

682
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,100
(laughing)

683
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,780
- No, we're passing as Yoda.

684
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,260
- We didn't sit down.

685
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,900
- It's just normal Yoda.

686
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,900
- This just in, Yoda de la Ghetto has been shot

687
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,540
outside the urging factory for trying to steal all the candy.

688
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,340
- Why is he, no.

689
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,180
- To feed his family.

690
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,020
- He wasn't trying to steal.

691
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,840
- There we go.

692
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,260
That's what I like to hear.

693
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,060
- And we don't want to hear what his family would be like.

694
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,860
- We don't want like some kind of club style situation.

695
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,980
so yeah, we don't want him to dress up as every member of his family.

696
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:52,060
We don't okay and we don't want to hear and we do not absolutely definitely

697
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,560
one hundred percent do not want to hear about what happened on their road trip

698
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,740
to the Hershey's factory.

699
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:02,060
We don't want ninety minutes of that

700
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:07,820
so that can't make five million dollars at the box office and I would hate that

701
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,460
last and be blacklisted from why Hollywood I don't want to see there yet

702
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:20,060
are we I don't want to see it as the last movie that's the last movie I want

703
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:28,740
to see is there yet are we to know I still want to see yeah yeah I'm gonna go

704
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,900
to the Hershey factory though I think one day well I want to go to Hershey

705
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,180
Park I mean we really should just be going a bunch of different places all

706
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:42,180
the time. Yeah. Man, what if there was a way for us to go to a bunch of different places?

707
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:49,580
I can't get out of my house. The door's locked. There was a cool way for us to go to a million

708
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:56,920
different places. What are you trying to do? What are you doing? Magic carpet. Look behind

709
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,040
you Cameron. No shot. It's not magic. Fuck. Well, all we gotta do is find a genie. A magic

710
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,240
ones in the other room. Fetch. Yeah, he got mixed up. Our magic carpet. This one's

711
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,520
magic you can pee on it don't smell. Not all magic carpets are magic but they

712
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,560
fly. That's just one of them. One time. You can pee on it and I can't smell it. My

713
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,360
girlfriend can. One time my little brother just dropped trow in our, we had a

714
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,320
basement. It was like unfinished, you know, like concrete floor. One time he just

715
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,900
drop trout pissed on the concrete and let it dry.

716
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,740
- Yeah.

717
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,920
- You, didn't you tell me that you were putting nasty water

718
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,260
all over a concrete floor?

719
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,700
- Oh, well I was emptying the dehumidifier in there.

720
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,780
- Your family's obsessed with doing stuff to the floor.

721
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,300
- He loves sleeping on the floor.

722
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,140
- Yeah.

723
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,980
- This is all making sense.

724
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,860
- Did you like, did you have a traumatic experience

725
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,120
when you sleeped on the floor

726
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,780
and your brother peed on you on the floor?

727
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,620
- No.

728
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,460
- Did you have a,

729
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,280
- And it make you wanna sleep on the floor forever?

730
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,060
- I had a traumatic experience with a reclining chair.

731
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,540
- I bet he had like a,

732
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:05,680
I bet he had like a very young, early life sexual experience with a floor where he was like

733
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,360
rubbing his dick against the floor and that's why he's so attached to it.

734
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
Something outside?

735
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
There's some kind of music.

736
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
It's New York, baby.

737
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
It's the music of the street.

738
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,920
And we don't want to hear about Yoda's music of the street.

739
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Ever tell you about the reclining chair incident?

740
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,200
I had when I was five.

741
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Probably.

742
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,280
It's one of those horrible family group chat stories.

743
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Probably.

744
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
- No, I'm--

745
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,960
- He's like, you know what--

746
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,860
- You could kinda hear me and Caleb both go,

747
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,520
"Uh-huh, yeah, uh, uh, don't make this into--

748
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,760
- Is it like scary?

749
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,320
Okay, let me do, let me ask some questions.

750
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Okay, does something scary happen?

751
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,040
- Something scary happen to me.

752
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,000
- Okay, does something crazy happen?

753
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,920
- Yeah.

754
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,840
- Okay, does something funny happen?

755
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,660
- Yeah.

756
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,240
- Does it involve your family?

757
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
If you answered yes to all four of these questions,

758
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
you should not tell the story.

759
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,500
- Really?

760
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,340
- No, tell the story.

761
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,160
- No, tell it.

762
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,160
I can just sum it up. I got my head stuck in a reclining chair when I was five.

763
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,800
This one sounds good. I feel bad now.

764
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,160
How did you get your head stuck?

765
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,200
Okay, go. Just run it.

766
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,640
So I thought there was something under the chair. I thought there was like an action

767
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,160
figure or something. You know like the little toy guns that come with the Star Wars guys?

768
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,080
No, but I can imagine.

769
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,640
So we were always losing those, so I thought I found one. I put my head under to try and get it.

770
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,040
With your mouth?

771
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,800
With my head and my hand under. You know how it's got like that system of

772
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,680
you pull the lever and then the chair goes up. Yeah, they're terrifying. Yeah, so I got my head.

773
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,720
That's like getting caught in like a roller coaster. It's like getting caught in Big

774
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,920
Shane Ray. Yeah, I got my head stuck between the bars somehow. It's like getting sucked into a

775
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,840
lathe. Yeah, I got my head stuck in between it, couldn't get my head out, and I was stuck under

776
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,320
there for probably like 30 minutes trying to like call my mom to get like help, and my little brother

777
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,200
was jumping on the couch. So like every time he would jump, the bars would close in and out on my

778
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,760
like she like whoa and so you were without oxygen to your brain for an

779
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,400
extended period of time no I wasn't without oxygen but my mom for reduced my

780
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,360
mom severely reduced severely reduced oxygen or machinery hitting your head so

781
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,320
there might be some kind of permanent mom freak the fuck out and told me I

782
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,160
could have been decapitated I was like well that would be kind of probably

783
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,080
could have been my dad knew a guy got a decapitated yeah stuck his head out of a

784
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,540
a bus and a tunnel chopped his head off. Your dad did? Yeah, my dad did that and

785
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,840
he died. What happened to me? He just glued his head back on. He was fine.

786
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,480
Yeah, they just stitched it back on. I got decapitated, but my head bounced

787
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,440
back on, so it just stayed on. Yeah, it healed back on. There was a guy who

788
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,300
did, he did like, he watched like, like fucking a thousand decapitations and

789
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,180
just like made notes about like how much the people blinked and shit. I was like,

790
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,620
"That's a pretty cool job." There was a guy? What are you talking about? He's

791
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,300
is a scientist. What does that mean? There was a guy who watched a thousand

792
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,300
decapitations and took notes. He was a scientist. He was a teenager in Illinois.

793
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,780
He was on assignment. I don't understand the premise of this. He was like French

794
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,380
Revolution. He was a scientist. He wanted to study how their heads, what happens

795
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,980
after they- He was in the French Revolution. He was a guy- You are being

796
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,480
unhelpful right now. You know exactly what I'm talking about. He was a scientist

797
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,280
during the French Revolution. See that's what I'm saying. You introduced us by

798
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:22,000
saying there was a guy what his job is he made notes and he said that everybody he

799
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
said that everybody he would tell them like once your head gets chopped off can

800
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,220
you like stick your tongue out or something and then they would it was a

801
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:38,320
she and it was a lead singer of the yeah yes I don't know heads will roll

802
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,840
I know. I don't remember that. Yes, I do. I listened to it earlier. It's old.

803
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,960
It's done. Remember that one? It's over from Project X. It's done.

804
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,760
Your corduroys are folded. So it looks like you have a very wide boner.

805
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,280
Yeah. It's an episode of curb. Is it? Yeah.

806
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,400
It's probably one of the first or second episodes. This is your boner.

807
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,600
This is your episode where you have a boner. Cameron's trying to lick it.

808
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,080
So if it's not your boner, I'll test it with your mouth. Yeah. Don't mind.

809
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,400
If it's not your boner, let me just stick my hands in both your pockets and find the real

810
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
one.

811
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
I have penile excavatum.

812
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
I pushed it in.

813
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
What?

814
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Penile excav-

815
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,680
Oh, because you pull it out like a sword?

816
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,240
If you pull it out, it's carinatum.

817
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,880
Did you know there was a guy who looked at 1,000 boners to see what the science was of

818
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
them?

819
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Yeah, I believe that.

820
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
It was you.

821
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Because I'm a good friend.

822
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
That's why I believe it.

823
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
It wasn't me.

824
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
Yeah, it was me.

825
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,880
That's why you perked up.

826
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,680
I've probably honestly through my life seen I probably yeah, I guess not a

827
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,120
person, but if we kind of pictures and videos, I've seen a thousand. I've

828
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,600
seen a lot of those probably at least

829
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,180
I've probably seen more than that over my whole life. That's nothing. Yeah,

830
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,360
nobody knew like I would be nobody knew what boners were till I came on the

831
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,120
years ago. A hundred fifty years ago, I might be the guy in the world who's

832
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,480
seen the most penises ever. That's you could probably look probably any person

833
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:06,380
in the world right now. If you sent them back, yeah, number one all time guy who

834
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,020
saw the most penises, they probably even know what everybody thought everybody's

835
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,340
penis look like theirs. They don't know about the thing is, though, if you if you

836
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,940
went back in time and and tried to get like a Guinness world record for that or

837
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,260
something, they probably just kill you. Yeah, definitely. Guinness world record

838
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,660
world immediately Guinness world record for like not even they wouldn't even

839
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,980
like ask you like they wouldn't even try to check if you really were they just

840
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,400
claiming to be that they would just immediately kill you.

841
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Yeah, absolutely.

842
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,320
You're like, there was an entire wing of Guinness World Records that was just a honeypot for

843
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,240
people who had seen a lot of penises.

844
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,680
Also, if you are time traveling, I thought you were doing Guinness World Records for

845
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,920
biggest penis back in the 70s.

846
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,880
Because I feel like back in the 70s, biggest penis probably like...

847
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,360
No, that was awesome back then.

848
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
Six inches.

849
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
No, that was pre-microplastic.

850
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
World's biggest penis.

851
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,560
No, yeah, that was back then, the biggest one was like six feet long.

852
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Whoa!

853
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,780
- We didn't have microplastics,

854
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,200
everybody had a huge chalk, man.

855
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,040
- Yeah, that was when--

856
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,380
- We got fucked by Teflon.

857
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,800
- Yeah, I know, you know what?

858
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,140
If Ron Jeremy, that piece of shit, had that hog.

859
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,380
- Ron, yeah.

860
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,400
Ron Jeremy would have been laughed out of the--

861
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,940
- He should have been rolled down a hill in a tire.

862
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,880
- Out of the penis club in caveman times.

863
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,600
- I think that should be one of the terms of his sentence.

864
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,440
- What should?

865
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,860
- Rolled down a hill in a tire.

866
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,160
Because it would be funny to watch--

867
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,200
- That freak would probably like that.

868
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,360
probably probably fuck the tire always rolling down that's a problem him any

869
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,000
punishment I'll just fuck it yeah yeah it's true lethal injection he's gonna

870
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,080
lethally injected into his own mouth you know you suck his own lethal injection

871
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,520
needle he could because it's pretty much this yeah that's that's how he got hired

872
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,980
in the business he always looked like shit - you ever seen like picture of him

873
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,960
young I've seen every single photo of him every photo ever taken around every

874
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,060
my video. I've seen every last one

875
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:03,020
is all sitting in my head. I think they should. I think that the CIA should

876
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,940
hire him as like an executioner, like how they like hire like Nazi scientists

877
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,820
and stuff. True. I just have them kill people. Yeah, I just have them be like

878
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,720
an old fat like this chop people's heads off. It'd be cool. I think that'd be

879
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,660
I think you do really well under like a that was a black hood. Yeah, it's like

880
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,940
if you're like you're about to get your head job purposely didn't say anything

881
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,320
Any last words?

882
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,820
Yeah.

883
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,200
You see his dick in his pants?

884
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,800
Yeah, oh he's so hard too.

885
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
He's hard all the time.

886
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,880
That scene where he gets the fuck shot out of him in Boondock Saints, pretty good.

887
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
In the whole movie, pretty good.

888
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,800
Boondock Saints, oh I think, wait I have my Boondock Saints shirt on.

889
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
Are you wearing it?

890
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
I think so.

891
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Wait maybe I'm-

892
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
You're wearing it because he said that you never wear it.

893
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,800
No, no I wore it yesterday.

894
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,840
Yeah he talked about it in LA, because we were talking about how I have to get rid of so many

895
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,720
clothes and he said that he's like oh yeah no I never wear it it's like I would

896
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,360
wear that shit every fucking day and he's over here just like you dress but

897
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,320
you wear funny stuff on my toe it's just my slipper you like wearing really funny

898
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,640
shirt I don't wear a lot of really funny shirts he's a funny guy yeah yeah he

899
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,360
likes funny shirt it's important I it's important you're saying that to get me

900
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,240
to remove stuff no all your clothes are funny right now

901
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,520
that you have on, but keep 'em on, yeah.

902
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,480
- Yeah, it's important to grow out

903
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,400
of being a funny shirt person.

904
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,720
- Unless you're, I think Patrick, it works for him.

905
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,560
- Yeah, I think--

906
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,120
- 'Cause he has a funny shirt personality.

907
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,960
- Yeah.

908
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,500
(laughing)

909
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,280
- He doesn't want me to kill myself.

910
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,120
- No.

911
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,280
- A funny shirt can come in a lot of different forms, right?

912
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,620
'Cause it can be like a, you know, a snorg tea type thing,

913
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,620
or it can be something ironic that, you know,

914
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,880
like, or whatever, it's not something you really like,

915
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,560
or whatever or it can just be something that looks like what a clown would wear

916
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,200
or it could

917
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:59,040
you should get a shirt. This is I'm chewed. I would do you would literally

918
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,280
he would pay eighty nine ninety nine for a shirt that said I'm chewed with it.

919
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,060
Yeah,

920
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:11,960
he would you would if I think you would probably spend like sixty dollars on a

921
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,240
shirt that had a picture of Mickey Mouse and said, "Chewgy normies back off."

922
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,600
I would pay. I mean, it depends on how old the Mickey Mouse shirt is.

923
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,960
It's one day old.

924
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,640
It's one day old, but it's listed on Depop as being 70 years old.

925
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,480
It's one day old, and Ben Mora put a sticker on it that says, "Chewgy life." Would you

926
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,480
buy it?

927
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,480
Maybe.

928
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,480
Yeah, you would.

929
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Honestly, just to support my friend.

930
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,840
Yeah, that's very sweet of you. I'd probably buy it, too.

931
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,480
I am wearing one of Ben's shirts under this.

932
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,320
I am wearing the Wikipedia editor-in-chief shirt under this shirt.

933
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
So nice.

934
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,960
See, you like shirts.

935
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,020
Yeah, shirts are cool.

936
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,080
I only have like six shirts right now.

937
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,080
They suck.

938
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Every last one of them is terrible.

939
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,440
You can come to my closet.

940
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,880
You can come take some stuff.

941
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,880
I would love to see.

942
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,920
Yeah, I sit here talking shit about funny shirts, but I just only wear just stupid band

943
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,200
shirts and I need to grow out of that pretty soon, I think.

944
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
When are you going to?

945
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,200
You don't have to grow out of it.

946
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,200
I just recently got out.

947
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,400
like in your late 20s and wear just band shirts like I think once I think I have a

948
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,480
few more years left of wearing band shirts and then I just have to be like

949
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,080
it's like an office there is a point where you have to stop caring about swag

950
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:26,720
yeah yeah I think once I'm 28 I gotta stop what's your 28 you got to stop

951
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,320
caring about swag yeah completely literally just have to dress like a

952
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,680
normal guy yeah if you try to dress cool and you're there that old like you

953
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,960
should know I don't know we did well no I think you just devolve it you evolve

954
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,080
the swag into grown man swag? Yeah, you start wearing like shoes made out of

955
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,440
leather and like like that's not swag that's class. Yeah, exactly.

956
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,640
Swag is evolved class or class. So you want to turn your

957
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,300
chuggy swag into normie class? Yeah. Maybe.

958
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,440
Patrick's gonna turn 28 and immediately start dressing like one of like a like

959
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,440
one of those guys that like the people always post that's like a dominator on

960
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,640
tumblr who's like dressed in like do you have you seen those gifts of the guy

961
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,280

962
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,480

963
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:29,280
blue shirt black vest black tie yeah yeah and they like make those tick-tock

964
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,720
videos are like you here now I'm gonna be your worst sexual nightmare my cum is

965
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,720
poisonous. They're also wearing a bowler hat. They're wearing a bowler hat and a filter that gives them fangs and red eyes.

966
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:54,720
And they're just like, it's like a... I have done a lot of thinking about this. I do think no matter what age I am or what tooth I lose, if I lose a tooth I will be getting a gold tooth.

967
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:05,720
Oh me too. Me too, absolutely. I had a silver crown when I was in the third grade. It would look so fucked up if I just like all my chipped teeth I just filled in the blank space with like just a little bit of gold.

968
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,440
Yeah, I'd be fine. I get a diamond in one of my teeth. Yeah, I want to get a computer in my teeth

969
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,580
I think I might get a tooth tattoo. I think I'm gonna get a car stuck in my mouth. Yeah, it's gonna be cool

970
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:19,140
Yeah, if you shave all your teeth down, so it looks like a Lamborghini, you know when you see a guy

971
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,920
The worst line of a Lamborghini like oh, that would be sick. So every time that you close your mouth, yeah

972
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,500
It's like you can eat Lamborghini shaped foods when your mouth is closed

973
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,560
Recently, I've been

974
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:37,520
I'll hold in the wall. That's my superpower. I can eat lamborghini dippers

975
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,960
with my mouth closed.

976
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,960
Sweetest lamborghinis. That's what I've been eating.

977
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,460
Or anything smaller than a lamborghini shaped food.

978
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:45,960
Yeah.

979
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,960
The reason I've been meeting too many...

980
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,960
Like a forked pinto bean.

981
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,460
I can smoke fifty cigarettes through the whole MIT.

982
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:58,260
I've been meeting too many like thirty year olds where like they look, they

983
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,460
dress like blady and then you ask them how old they are and they say they're

984
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,500
like 35. Yeah. And you're like, it's dangerous. That's man. I'm gonna, well,

985
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,460
they look young. They should live, they should live on an Island. If they look,

986
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,180
if they look super young, like if they have like a youthful,

987
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:17,340
it doesn't matter how they look. If they are that old,

988
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,180
that's a problem in their brain. Yeah. What's like, what is lady dress?

989
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,020
They could look, I mean, they could look cool. Like an elf. Dress is like,

990
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,780
yeah. Like a cyber elf. Like a gay, a 33 year old computer soldier.

991
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,340
V-Lone Soldier. I saw V-Lone Soldier at the bowling alley while I was in Wilmington.

992
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,740
Yeah? Yeah, and I saluted him.

993
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,740
It was pretty cool. Dude, the fucking...

994
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,260
the minute I get into V-Lone...

995
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,780
You need to start wearing full V-Lone, bro.

996
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,780
Honestly, that would be so cool. I get really into V-Lone, I get really into Antisocial Social Club.

997
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,940
I get really into... That would be big. What's that third one?

998
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,460
Revenge, the Travis Scott shoes that are just Van's old school...

999
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,900
Walking around with a cacti. With the lightning bolt in the side.

1000
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:05,140
Uh-huh, maybe sick dude. I saw I saw never saw somebody wearing those in my life

1001
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,860
I might have to get a v-loan shirt for the next live show. Yeah. Yeah, you got it, dude

1002
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,220
You got to get the Travis Scott revenge. You know, those are the fucking the who's the Ian Connor?

1003
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:19,060
I'm my fucking rapist guy fully v-loaned up. Yeah, I think I need it. I need to start planning a fit

1004
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,860
Yeah, I already got my window. I think I guess don't spoil it. Oh, well, I don't care

1005
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,620
I don't mean unless you want to what the fit I don't know what it is. Should I get is it?

1006
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,300
- Park, tummy rocker tattoo that says doo-doo.

1007
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,300
- That would be really sick.

1008
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,780
- You should get, well, I mean--

1009
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,260
- Old English, just doo-doo across the belly.

1010
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,860
- Yeah, that would be really tight.

1011
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,220
- That'd be cool.

1012
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,340
- Is it Ian Conner?

1013
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,100
I don't wanna, I said something very crazy just then.

1014
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,940
- What?

1015
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,220
- Ian Conner is the raper.

1016
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,660
- Okay, all right.

1017
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,140
All right, 'cause that name just is like--

1018
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,980
- From Smosh, yeah.

1019
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,460
- Yeah.

1020
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,380
That name literally is like--

1021
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,260
- Anybody's name.

1022
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,380
- Yeah, I know.

1023
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,220
That's like--

1024
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,040
- He needs to be called--

1025
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,880
- That's like you making up a name.

1026
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,040
- That's like a demonious ex trying to make up names.

1027
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,020
- Exactly.

1028
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,100
- Yeah, it's like demonious ex coming up

1029
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,940
with a white person's name.

1030
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,180
- I think I'm coming up on a swag turn.

1031
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,480
- Yeah?

1032
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,000
- I think I'm gonna change my whole swag soon.

1033
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
- I think I'm pivoting towards no swag.

1034
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,640
- I think I might turn into a biker.

1035
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,120
- I think Cameron might be going chewggy.

1036
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,980
- I think I might be going zero swag.

1037
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,820
- Really?

1038
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,640
- Yeah.

1039
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,480
- I feel like there's something to that.

1040
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,080
I think I think it's going to be the next big thing. I've been where I've been

1041
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,180
literally wearing the past two weeks. I'm wearing was so twenty four. I've been

1042
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:38,340
wearing sweat pants and and and Tom and Jerry pull over sweatshirt. If you I

1043
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,160
think I might just wear that forever. If you want full China, though full China

1044
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,280
could be really so okay. The the China thing is so hard. It's so difficult

1045
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,280
because they're really like what it is missing and I know I said this before is

1046
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,080
missing the crucial element that there is no hat that I'm allowed to wear. You

1047
00:52:54,100 --> 00:53:00,020
wear a rice paddy bro just pop it on i did oh actually i could i did see a cool rice patty

1048
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:04,740
hat i didn't buy it because it was really expensive for no reason but like a there was a hat in

1049
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:09,060
chinatown there was like a red baseball cap with like a dragon golden dragon that's perfect and i

1050
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,060
think you know you might have to do you guys want to go to chinatown i'd love to go to chinatown

1051
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,580
yeah i just get full china fits yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna let's go like next week yeah i'll go

1052
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:26,980
I'll go whenever dude. I just finished up my Covid quarantine that I definitely didn't have all along

1053
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,340
and it was just my girlfriend that had it and I never actually had it so I didn't spread it to

1054
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,540
anybody or give it to anyone. I completely beat it. You went to Chuck E. Cheese every day.

1055
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,980
I spread it to thousands and thousands of people.

1056
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,340
I've never worn these socks before. I'm sorry.

1057
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,540
Yeah, no, go ahead. Say what you're going to say.

1058
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,820
- No, talk about your stuff.

1059
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,660
- No, you could get is the--

1060
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,820
- No, what did you never see before on your stock?

1061
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,980
- The RDS.

1062
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,660
- Oh, and when we go to Chinatown,

1063
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,980
we're gonna finally buy a fucking Mahjong set, okay?

1064
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,820
- Oh yeah.

1065
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,100
- 'Cause they have those on sale all over the place.

1066
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,060
- No, you could get, there's this,

1067
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,860
RDS Red Dragon Skateboards, their logo,

1068
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,900
it's like the Red Dragon thing, but it looks like a penis.

1069
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,980
- I'm not wearing anything that's skateboard related.

1070
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,620
- Yeah, you, you're wearing something right now.

1071
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,700
- What?

1072
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,540
- Pants.

1073
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,600
- What?

1074
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,640
- My seed.

1075
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,780
- What? - I nutted on him.

1076
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,940
- You nutted?

1077
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,940
- I nutted on him.

1078
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,780
- You nutted on him?

1079
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,620
- I can't be wearing anything skateboard related.

1080
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,440
- Why not?

1081
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,780
- Not because I don't think skateboarding is cool,

1082
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,460
or whatever.

1083
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,860
No, but if anybody, I can't be a person wearing

1084
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,580
like skater stuff and then people come up to me

1085
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,020
and start talking about skating.

1086
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,860
- I like that.

1087
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,540
That's like, to me that's like the best feeling

1088
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,020
in the world, 'cause then you just go like--

1089
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,380
- Yeah, you could get that hat, the flex hat.

1090
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,620
- Skaters hate when you don't skate and you wear skate gear.

1091
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,460
- Yeah, they--

1092
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,920
It's so funny to be like, I lost it,

1093
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,780
but I had that frog skateboarding beanie.

1094
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,620
- Oh yeah, you lost that?

1095
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,740
- And a couple times I was home, yeah,

1096
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,860
I lost it while I was in Wilmington.

1097
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,340
A couple times I was home, somebody would be like,

1098
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,680
frog skateboarding, I'd be like,

1099
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,920
I don't skate at all, and just smile.

1100
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,040
(laughing)

1101
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,880
I bet they got so mad at that.

1102
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,840
- No, I just can't be, my nightmare is somebody--

1103
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,880
- They think it's FUBU.

1104
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,560
- Yeah, I just can't have people trying to talk to me

1105
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,660
about something like that.

1106
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,240
I don't care, I don't want it,

1107
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,080
I don't want them to talk to me.

1108
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,040
It is funny when like you guys, we run into like my friends who I skate with at a bar and

1109
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,600
then you guys are trapped in the conversation with me and them.

1110
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,880
That happened one time and me and Kim just left.

1111
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,080
No, you guys stood there for like a couple minutes.

1112
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,960
Yeah, and then we left while you guys kept talking.

1113
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,240
Oh yeah, because he was like, "Oh yeah, the fucking owner of this bar did like a nolly

1114
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,280
like a nolly wall ride at the school."

1115
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,360
I swear to God, I thought that was the RZA for like the first 20 minutes you guys were

1116
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,360
talking.

1117
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,360
Really?

1118
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,360
Yeah.

1119
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,360
Damn.

1120
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,960
It is funny how every skateboarder that you hang out with just looks so homeless.

1121
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,960
Yeah.

1122
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,960
His big ass clothes.

1123
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,320
Big ass clothes.

1124
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,820
I was thinking about...

1125
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,820
Little jar that they shit.

1126
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,920
How the Wu-Tang Clan like they form because they all love like martial arts movies or

1127
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,920
whatever and like...

1128
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,680
Well, but two of them love martial arts movies way more than the rest.

1129
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,680
Well, yeah, okay.

1130
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
The rest of them don't give a fuck.

1131
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,080
Yeah, but like you know their whole thing is like oh they're all named after different

1132
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,920
characters from martial arts movies and shit.

1133
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,680
And think about like in like ten years like just what the next Wu-Tang Clan will be like

1134
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,680
themed after.

1135
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:17,460
I was thinking about like like like a Wu-Tang Clan that grew up like watching finger family videos and they're like, yo, that's spider-man

1136
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,920
That's Elsa

1137
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,060
Like sample all the like the like learning colors

1138
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,360
with horses

1139
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,840
Elsa give birth

1140
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:39,020
But I'm trying to figure out what the next like thing when the next Wu-Tang Clan will be that was it was all the fucking

1141
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,840
like all the the hip-hop blogs would be like odd future the next Wu-Tang and they'd be like fuck you were not the new Wu-Tang and

1142
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,920
Then like Haji like mellow hype like had a hook in the song that said we're the new

1143
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:57,520
None of them fucking figure out who was which but Wu-Tang did the right thing if they just like

1144
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,220
Stuck together for so long odd future only lasts like five years. Yeah, it's true

1145
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,400
Then Haji beats knocked up Nelly Furtado. Did he uh-huh do good for that fatty?

1146
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,080
No, you're thinking of a different guy.

1147
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,080
No, it's Jasper. He's in Jackass now.

1148
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,080
Oh, good for that fatty.

1149
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,080
Yeah, good for that fatty.

1150
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,080
Haji Beats is the one...

1151
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,080
Nelly Furtado, the promiscuous girl? She had sex?

1152
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,080
Oh my god.

1153
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,080
Oh my god.

1154
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,080
Haji Beats had that...

1155
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,080
He had the first line of a song.

1156
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,080
I think it's a Wu-Tang sample.

1157
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,080
The first line of his song,

1158
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
his verse was,

1159
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,080
"Eat a cock and cum mayonnaise ham sandwich."

1160
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:42,960
That's disgusting. That's a good line. Didn't Big Sean date that girl from Glee who drowned to death?

1161
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,040
Lee Michelle? No, no, no, not Lee Michelle. What was her name? The other one.

1162
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:53,840
Oh, what's her name? Cori Monteith. Cori Monteith. Yeah. Half the, like most of the cast of Glee is

1163
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,080
dead. There's three of them. Three of them. Six or seven, yeah. The curse of Glee, man.

1164
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:04,160
God's punishment. Yeah, God's punishment for being gay. For making a gay show. He struck them down

1165
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,000
down where they stood. That show is crazy. It is. It's nuts. I never saw it until

1166
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
like this year when I was watching it. It's a good time. I was just like, whoa,

1167
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,600
like this is what people are watching? Like what the fuck is this? People loved

1168
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:22,000
it. People went crazy for it. It's crazy. Yeah. I can't believe that people like

1169
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,400
watched that show and then like, were like, like grew, like tried to like grow

1170
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,240
up and were like, like calling people out on Twitter and stuff. Yeah, those are

1171
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,200
the people who dominate the world now. Yeah. The glee, the glee enjoyers. People

1172
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,440
like yeah like those are like the people who are like woke or whatever yeah it's

1173
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,160
like you want to know it's like what the fuck yeah it's so it's also such a like

1174
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:48,160
2009 idea of what a like diverse cast yeah like it's like a black wheelchair

1175
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,880
yeah well no it's like yeah it's like gay wheelchair to black people who date

1176
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,600
each other to Asian people who date each other like yeah yeah it's for their

1177
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,880
they weren't willing to go to people who will soon kill themselves who did each

1178
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,560
each other. Yeah. Wouldn't a, isn't there an episode where like a student

1179
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:09,160
with down syndrome accidentally becomes a school shooter? Probably. Yeah. Yeah.

1180
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:15,600
There's that show is like insane. I would not. That's like, that's just

1181
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,200
sounds right. Yeah. It's all shit like that. It's crazy dude. I'm conflating

1182
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:25,520
something or maybe it's a different show, but I think a student with down

1183
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,520
syndrome accidentally becomes a shooter.

1184
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,520
Accidentally?

1185
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,840
They have a student with Down syndrome who is essentially the slave of the evil teacher.

1186
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,480
Oh, the Jane Lynch character?

1187
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,480
Yeah.

1188
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
Yeah.

1189
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,480
Why did you say slave?

1190
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
Yeah, slave is a little...

1191
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,480
I said essentially.

1192
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,480
Okay, I guess that covers it.

1193
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
Yeah, no, that's fine.

1194
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,480
I think that passed in any lit class in America.

1195
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,480
It's the show.

1196
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,480
The show made him an essential slave.

1197
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,480
Made her an essential slave.

1198
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,480
That's my thought.

1199
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Slave-ess.

1200
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
Slave-ess.

1201
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,480
Slave-ess.

1202
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,480
Slave-ess.

1203
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Slave-ess.

1204
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Slave-ess.

1205
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,960
(laughing)

1206
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,640
- Yeah dude, that show is--

1207
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,480
- It's nasty.

1208
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
- That was like the first of its kind.

1209
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,440
- Yeah, my mom really liked Glee.

1210
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,040
- Oh dude, my mom.

1211
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,640
That fucking show changed my mom's idea on gay marriage.

1212
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,600
- Oh yeah, Becky Brought a Gun to School

1213
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,800
was the episode there.

1214
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,160
(laughing)

1215
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,200
- What the fuck was wrong with these people, dude?

1216
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,480
- It's nuts.

1217
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,760
- No, I mean, I would probably have killed myself

1218
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,720
if I was on that show.

1219
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,880
Would have made me completely crazy.

1220
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:29,560
She brought her father's gun to school because she was afraid of being out of school after

1221
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,560
graduating.

1222
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,920
That's how they wrote that episode.

1223
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,000
So she was going to keep everyone in school with a gun?

1224
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Yeah.

1225
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,760
I mean, I guess the writers were like, "Well, it doesn't have to make sense."

1226
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,760
It's like, who cares, right?

1227
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,760
Yeah.

1228
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,320
Who's the writer of that show?

1229
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,320
What's his name?

1230
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,320
Quentin Tarantino?

1231
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,320
Yeah, well, Tarantino's the director for it.

1232
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,040
Quentin Tarantino's the guy who does American Horror Story.

1233
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,040
Oh, really?

1234
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,040
What?

1235
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,000
yeah also fucking crazy yeah no it's the what's his name? I forgot his name. That show sucks shit.

1236
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,080
What's his fucking name? I don't remember his name but yeah I know that's yeah Ryan Murphy yeah that's

1237
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,080
the same. He did both of those? That's why they're both like that that's why the same people like

1238
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:12,240
them. That show's that show also is dog shit. That show is committing me so mad. Sarah Paulson's

1239
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,600
married to the mom from Two and a Half Men. I don't know who either of those people are. Sarah

1240
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,560
Paulson's the lady from American Horror Story. In fact Connie Brittney was American Horror Story. And

1241
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,960
who else is in it the people versus OJ she plays the lawyer thing that pisses me

1242
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,760
off most of an American horror story is people try to pull the shit where they're

1243
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,920
like well yeah it sucks now but the first season was actually good yeah turn the

1244
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,280
first episode is like this is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life I think

1245
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,080
it's like it was in a season it's like a ghost story haunted house with like

1246
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,600
everything in it yeah because it has to be 21 episodes yeah every episode it's

1247
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,600
like there's a there's a dead girl in the well yeah there's a there's a ghost

1248
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,800
Is it Ryan Murphy? I thought the person who did American Horror Story also did Nip/Tuck.

1249
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,200
Might have done all three.

1250
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,800
I mean there's probably multiple people who work on TV shows.

1251
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,000
Who did The Office?

1252
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,500
That was Michael Schur.

1253
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,200
That's funny.

1254
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,000
Yeah, that's Michael Schott.

1255
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,400
They have the, on Peacock, I learned on my mom's birthday.

1256
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,600
They have the superfan versions of The Office.

1257
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,400
They have the superfan versions.

1258
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,600
Your mom learned about my peacock on her birthday.

1259
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,200
Yep.

1260
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,600
Alright, episode over.

1261
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,600
No! No!
