I pressed it.

00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm about to go kooky for kooky crisp on you.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Kooky crisp?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,500
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
The thing about learning how to pop and lock.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,500

[POPPING NOISES]

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Wow.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That was pretty good.

14

(Blooper)

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,080
(imitating a fart)

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,260
- That's my bit for the episode,

18
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,760
is I woke up from a nightmare.

19
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,880
- Still in a nightmare, look at this fucking pop and lock.

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,120
(imitating a fart)

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,920
- Yeah, wait, let me try, let me try.

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,760
- Oh, what are you, oh, your bones.

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,060
Your bones are gone.

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,220
(gagging)

25
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,880
It's so hard.

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
- How'd you get that thing that hard?

27
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,600
- Popping and locking it.

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Oh, oh.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
So he pops the boner.

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,800
You put, yeah, and you lock it into place.

31
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Locks in the freshness.

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,560
Yeah, okay, that makes sense to me.

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,080
It's like a ziplock for boners.

34
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,880
See, to me, poppin' lockin' is a beautiful synthesis of hip-hop and robotics.

35
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,400
Poppin' lockin' is less of a dance and more of a lifestyle.

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,840
I went to Boston Dynamics, they taught me how to pop and lock.

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Yeah, I went to Boston Dynamics.

38
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Better than anybody.

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
I went to Bossed Up Dynamics.

40
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Yeah.

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, and I learned how to pop and lock.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And they made me to a robot dog.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, dog.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,960
Yeah, we have the robot dog, and then we have the robot dog.

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
The C in C-3PO now stands for Caleb.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,760
God damn it, you guys.

47
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,160
I had a rough week.

48
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,380
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,380
You have hurt your knee.

50
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Me too.

51
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,520
I had a rough week too.

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,600
I had the most amazing week of my life, but you don't see me complaining.

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I found a treasure chest.

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,800
It's true.

55
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
I have all sorts of rubies.

56
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Can we restart this episode?

57
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,280
No!

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,760
You say that every time.

59
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Yeah, just...

60
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Ugh.

61
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,640
No one's gonna make fun of me.

62
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
If they are, you say that.

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
For what?

64
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,120
No one's gonna make fun of me.

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
For what?

66
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Oh, Pat.

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,720
Pat fucked up another thing on the show.

68
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,680
What do you think you fucked up this time?

69
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
(sigh)

70
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,980
Hey, you know what I was thinking about something?

71
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,480
What?

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,180
So like, C-3PO, but now the C stands for Caleb.

73
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,180
The 3 could be your middle name and P's Pitts.

74
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,180
See, it was actually a great idea, Pat!

75
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,680
And the O is for awesome!

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,180
It was actually such a good idea. Come on, bud.

77
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,480
Come on, buddy. Come on, get yourself out of that there junk you're in.

78
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Just wait back up.

79
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Just pop one arm and lock it.

80
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,120
- Hey, hey, partner, let me see you pop and lock some.

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
- Come on, come on.

82
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,720
- Come on, you know you wanna pop and lock some.

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,560
- Please.

84
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
- Come on, just pop one thing for me

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,880
and lock that sucker in.

86
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,600
- Don't make me tickle you.

87
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,440
- Don't make me pop and lock for you.

88
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,540
- Just I haven't been able to break dance since the injury.

89
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,420
- 'Cause your knee?

90
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,280
- 'Cause of my knee.

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,880
- That's really, and also you hurt the top of your head

92
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,440
so you can't spin anymore.

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,120
really tough yeah the dreidel tip I had

94
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:34,160
man it sucks so much dude just everything about me that was so good at break

95
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,320
dancing just fucking went out the went in the fucking toilet

96
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,720
With a season-ending injury trying to spin on the wet cardboard and it just you just stay completely still

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,320
break dance regularly. Why don't you just buy a new cardboard? You have to break it in.

98
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,760
What do you mean buy a new cardboard? Tell me where would you buy cardboard? You get

99
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,560
cardboard. You fucking moron. You earn it. Idiot. You earn the cardboard. Yeah. I think go out to the

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,480
cardboard store. I don't think so. I think the supreme way to break dance now, the newest most

101
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,800
supremest way. The supreme supreme ex breakdancing. I think is to be on the subway and to use

102
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,320
all of the different poles to spin. Yeah that's pretty good. Yeah what's that called? Subway

103
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,820
spinning. No like the actual like the guys show up. Splinway. No the name of the it's

104
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,280
not called. Acrobatics? No there's a name for it. Jabberwockies. No it's not the Jabberwockies.

105
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,760
crazy ass dancers. I respect the Jabberwockys so much. Me too. Um... Me too. What's the

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,040
fucking thing called? Showtime. Is that what it's called? They get on the train

107
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,940
they say it's like oh it's showtime and they like start like dancing. Really? Yeah.

108
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,280
Usually they say we have a... We're trying to save... We have a ball! And if we don't get to break dance!

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,000
Sometimes they'll say like we have a basketball team we're trying to save or

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,480
some shit. And I'm like, "Just fucking shut up and dance."

111
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,720
Just ask me for the money. Remember last night, last night Cameron and I were going home and

112
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,200
this like homeless guy gets on the train and like he like clearly, like clearly he's like

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,280
very mentally unwell and he was asking, we were the only guys on the train, he was asking

114
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,800
me for like a dollar and I gave him like a dollar. He saw like another dollar fall out

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,360
of my wallet and he was like, "Man, come on, I know you can give me a little bit more."

116
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,600
I was like yeah, he played Patrick. Yeah. Yeah, he didn't say he wasn't he didn't say that he just Patrick gave him a dollar

117
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,380
He's like, okay now another dollar. Yeah, they say no, I was like

118
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,160
You shouldn't have tied up all your dollars and kept him in your sleeve, yeah

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,960
You're the most generous man in the world

120
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
God damn it. Yeah, but then he like explained

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,680
Yeah, I don't ask for money on the train to us. He was also yeah, I paid for some street knowledge. Yeah

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,040
We did I did pay you very unstable on his feet and he crossed through the train cars while I was running and I was like

123
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,520
Oh, we're gonna see this guy die. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't done that yet. I always want to oh, yeah

124
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm sorry do an excuse. Well, that's the thing anytime you see those train doors open

125
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,720
and it's like, "Oh, this is either going to be the greatest breakdancer in the world or

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Davy Jones."

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,560
Yeah, just a pirate.

128
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,620
I've never had a good subway door opening interaction.

129
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Not yet.

130
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
No?

131
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,600
Well, maybe I have and I wasn't paying attention.

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You mean like one of those doors that was never opened and it wasn't like your dad coming

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,040

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,240
you have everybody's height memorized every media you have it's like how I

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,720
remember I knew every rappers religion well it's cuz you should only be laughing

163
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,600
you should only yeah you should only be laughing at a comedian if they're like

164
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Six feet or above. I mean you can't, you don't want to guess up a shortcut.

165
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, you don't want to make them feel good about it.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're just gonna let that...

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I know every rapper's religion because I was worried that they would go to hell.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,800
So I would Google and I would, I remember crying when I found out T-Pain was a Muslim.

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,800
[Laughter]

170
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:06,200
Because I was like, "Noooo, dude! T-Pain! He won't be with me in paradise for eternity! Fuuuuck!"

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
It's true. That's so fucking weird.

172
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,440
That was like the only, and that's like why I got into like using Wikipedia

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
a bunch as a kid. That was like probably my first interaction.

174
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
That's how you got into Wikipedia?

175
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440

We all thought Weird Al was Jewish.

207
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,940
We talked about this before.

208
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940

Because this time I was doing it on purpose. You fucker. Yeah. I was scared of the rapture

219
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,740
because I watched those movies left behind. The raptors? Okay all right. Yes I was scared of,

220
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,020
yeah I was scared of raptors as well I guess but the rapture because. You're scared of raptors and

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,540
and you yet you love Drake hmm what if I just disappeared right now my clothes

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,220
talking about left behind dude oh yeah you left behind was the you guys did you

226
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,940
get scared in 2011 when there's that like May whatever rapture thing I got

227
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,380
scared every time anybody said it was gonna be the rapture yeah I remember I

228
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,900
I remember there was one rapture thing where my dad, who's like super big into eBay, was

229
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,820
like showing me that people were, yeah, that's his thing, was showing me like listings on

230
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,200
eBay where people were selling like, like selling a thing, like a, the service that

231
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,300
when these, when people got raptured, they would like take care of their pets.

232
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Oh yeah.

233
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,340
And I was like, holy shit, dude.

234
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,580
Like, oh no.

235
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,780
I mean, that's.

236
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,740
I thought it was going to happen when I was 13.

237
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,740
It's so fucking funny that like the like main thing of the Rapture that when you

238
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,660
like mention the Rapture everyone knows is yeah you leave your clothes on the

239
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,180
ground. Yeah dude that's to be that's because of left behind yeah cuz it left

240
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,180
behind everybody's clothes are left. What if you go with your clothes? Can I just bring one shirt?

241
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,700
What kind of? It ain't heaven if I can't bring my like best fit 2019 Raptors NBA

242
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,740
championship. I need that. Put me put me up there fucking head to toe.

243
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Yeah.

244
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,140
It would suck if you got raptured but it left your liver or something.

245
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,580
That'd be rough.

246
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:35,540
It would suck if you were walking around town and you saw a green one-piece shoestring bikini

247
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,540
and you were like, "Oh my god, dude.

248
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Borat got raptured and I got left behind.

249
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Fuck, dude."

250
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:50,380
You're just seeing like a mascot suit.

251
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:56,860
like a boat with a ton of like pirate hats on it. Seriously, is he a ghost sheep?

252
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,140
Wait, that doesn't make sense. It's already dead. The fuck? Like one of those like out in

253
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,100
front of like the Verizon store that Android costume is just like on the

254
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,620
ground. Yeah like, oh the fucking Android robot? Come on dude.

255
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,740
Oh yeah, passed out there for a little bit. Hot day. Yeah. It's pretty hot in this

256
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,180
here suit. There used to be when I there when I lived in like Revere there was

257
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,940
There's one near like Malden Center and there's a guy that just always had to like stand in

258
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,300
that suit just like point to a Verizon store.

259
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
That's hard work.

260
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,260
Yeah, no one's going to go, no one is going there for that.

261
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,300
Yeah, that's one job that should be outlawed I think.

262
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,260
I don't think, I think it's completely, I think it's outdated and I think it's torture.

263
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
That's like, that's legal torture.

264
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
That is straight up torture.

265
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,020
There's a guy on my block who has to dress up like the Statue of Liberty and go, "Yo!"

266
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,700
like it's gonna drive first of all it's gonna drive people away from the store

267
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,500
because nobody wants to have to interact with like a giant fuzzy monster in order

268
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,660
to like go in because you can just scream whatever you want in that suit

269
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,020
when nobody's around I saw a lady yelling at the Statue of Liberty guy and

270
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,320
she was like there's because I guess he got too close to her she was like I have

271
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,540
to go see my family later today and you could have possibly given me the

272
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,380
COVID-19 virus do that guy is not getting paid you probably get fucked

273
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,340
with by teens too yeah yeah dude you're dressed up first of all that guy's

274
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,060
dressed like a woman yeah just like a famous woman yeah you know you know a

275
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,060
woman screaming at a symbol of one of the most beautiful women of all time - I

276
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,900
mean one of the most gorgeous sex symbols this country's ever had yeah I

277
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,460
mean think about that that those spikes on her head oh how come women don't have

278
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:43,180
enough like spikes anymore I know dude yeah what's up with that in the 1800s

279
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,020
Just because it was such a Puritan time, they used to booby trap women.

280
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,420
They really did, I'm serious.

281
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,340
They would put little like, kinda invisible like, like wires that if you hit various,

282
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,820
various points, maybe a, maybe a scythe would hit you.

283
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,820
Yeah.

284
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,060
It would fall down, chop your head off.

285
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Exactly.

286
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
You know?

287
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,060
Yeah.

288
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,580
That's what you would do to your daughter as a gift when she turned 18.

289
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Yeah.

290
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,820
It's like the trap in Temple of Doom where you have to like bow a certain way.

291
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Yeah, exactly.

292
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Exactly.

293
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,540
Or her head would fall off and roll at you like a boulder.

294
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,040
Yeah.

295
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
Yeah.

296
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,040
Towards you.

297
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,300
I don't remember Temple of Doom that well.

298
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,900
Is that Temple of Doom or is that the Last Crusade?

299
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,140
Temple of Doom, she eats that weird soup.

300
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,380
Yeah.

301
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,500
And she says, "Um..."

302
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,860
It's like a monkey's brain.

303
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,500
Which is the one...

304
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,580
It might be the Last Crusade.

305
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,300
I don't remember.

306
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,260
I don't think she says that.

307
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,980
She says, "Check, please."

308
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,780
I don't think she says...

309
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,980
Yeah, I think she does.

310
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,140
It is funny that the female character in Temple of Doom,

311
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,020
her only purpose was to be annoying.

312
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,300
Yeah.

313
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,020
It's kind of like you.

314
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,820
I mean I feel like that's also like every character except for Indiana Jones in those movies.

315
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:54,860
I bet that you're so jealous of my poppin' lockin' skills after I fuckin' owned you.

316
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:04,060
You just got nothing to say now, do you?

317
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,560
Yeah.

318
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,980
You know why?

319
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,300
Because you just got poppin' lockin' dominated.

320
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,060
Yep.

321
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Go ahead and cry.

322
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Shut up.

323
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Wait, Pat, can you say something real quick?

324
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,060
Patrick, are you okay?

325
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
Shut up.

326
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,060
Pat, are you okay?

327
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Patrick?

328
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,060
Patrick.

329
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
Patrick.

330
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,060
Patrick?

331
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,060
Pat, Cam, call 911.

332
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Beep boop boop!

333
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
*Bzzzzt*

334
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Here, I just called them with my body.

335
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,060
With my robot body.

336
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
I turned my hands into defibrillators.

337
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
*Muffled* Hello, this is Dino Lord.

338
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
Hey, my friend Patrick's being a bitch. Can you come shoot him in the head?

339
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
*Muffled* Hello, this is Dino Lord.

340
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Can you come put your fire hose in his mouth?

341
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
*Muffled* Hello, this is Dino Lord.

342
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
Press on, blow him up like a big balloon,

343
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
and then use a single needle to pop him

344
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
so that the whole city gets wet?

345
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
*Muffled* Yep.

346
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Oh, what was that thing we were talking about earlier?

347
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,300
say bye. We saw the guy with the hose. Oh yeah, there's a guy with the hose, like a guy hosing

348
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,300
off the sidewalk, going up to a guy who's hosing off the sidewalk going, "STOP! YOU'RE GONNA

349
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:28,100
FLOOD THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD! YOU CAN'T MAKE A RIVER IN THE CITY! IT'S TOO WET! STOP! YOU'RE

350
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:34,900
SCARING ME!" Yeah, 'cause why, like, the guy was just like, "I'M GONNA SLIP!" Yeah, just

351
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,940
Like, there's like, the guy was just hosing off the sidewalk.

352
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,820
Probably, probably somebody fucking yarfed or barfed or ralfed over there.

353
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Oh, that makes sense.

354
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Yeah, popped or locked.

355
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,820
I just thought he was just washing the sidewalk.

356
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Yeah.

357
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,940
I don't know why that was like what I thought was happening, but...

358
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
No.

359
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
Stop!

360
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Now!

361
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,540
You're gonna make our...

362
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,340
Why, why would you build a river here?

363
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
This is no place for a river!

364
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,340
Go to the forest!

365
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,340
Forest

366
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,780
Cars need to go by god

367
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:12,300
These look like boats to you you fucker

368
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,380
Did you like what happened in Katrina oh

369
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,460
I bet you loved Katrina

370
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,140
That was your favorite hurricane, huh?

371
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:34,380
Dude, I forgot I forgot how like bad Hurricane Sandy was here Hurricane Sandy. Yeah, remember that shit

372
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,140
Yeah, dude, they made a whole Louis episode about it. Yeah, it was

373
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,060
Yeah, I once it reaches Louis. That's a that might be the only

374
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,460
That was ever on Louis

375
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,320
So that's got a like pretty bad great like no one really taught like somebody probably died in Hurricane Sandy, right?

376
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,700
Yeah, not the spirit of the new year the people of New York though that will never die will never they are too brave

377
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,420
People who live in New York, they're so brave just for believing here for some reason absolutely you know you know if you want to become brave

378
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,180
Move to New York City. Yeah

379
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,140
Because two bad things happened here in the last a hundred years three three was a third the

380
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,180
defamation of Anthony Weiner

381
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:24,980
True that was actually a huge blow to the to the psyche. Yep. Yeah, I watched that documentary recently the wiener one

382
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,880
I've seen a lot of wiener documentaries, but I think this one was my favorite. Yeah

383
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,500
That way it's so fucking good, dude. I mean he's awesome. He it's so like he should have fucking stopped

384
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,280
so early into that and just not that he should have stopped because he's a he is like a

385
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
Egomaniac. He has no ability to stop.

386
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,180
Yeah, yeah. Oh, he was- he's a complete egomaniac.

387
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,180
He should have been stopped by some check along the way.

388
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,180
Uh-huh.

389
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,180
But he just didn't. And he just-

390
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Yeah. It's crazy.

391
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,180
So fucking funny. Just like the-

392
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,180
He's the man, dude.

393
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,180
The scene of him

394
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
showing his wife,

395
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
him arguing with a guy on TV.

396
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,180
Yeah.

397
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
And he's like, "Isn't this great?"

398
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Yeah.

399
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:19,220
what's her name Huma isn't she like yeah basically Hillary's top Hillary's top

400
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,540
exactly yeah she yeah there was like a like the like towards the end of the

401
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:30,740
movie it's like Hillary's like basically tells her through a magazine like you

403
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,200
like a like a it shows like a picture it shows like a picture of a magazine that

404
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,840
says like I guess Hillary in an interview was like you know I love Huma or

405
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,320
whatever I really don't remember but it's like it was basically the movie

406
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,820
presented it as like Hillary giving Huma an ultimatum like you work on my

407
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,160
campaign or you work on your husband's campaign and then they like I don't

408
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,920
know I think she leaves him at the I don't remember honestly I watched it

409
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,920
like two weeks ago Wow she did leave Anthony Weiner in 2018

410
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,000
yeah I do remember looking at I see it you think he's in jail right now right

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,080
yeah he's in jail for showing his wiener to goddamn much I think he should I think

412
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,800
you sex it off like a 17 year old or something yeah I think that's why I

413
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,800
ended up no he did it Carlos Danger did who's Carlos Danger you don't know about

414
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,720
that no that was like his is like name that he would like is like Carlos Danger

415
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,480
he would say his name was Carlos Danger that's like sounds even more like a

416
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,320
pedophile yeah I mean I guess when your name is wiener you there's only one way

417
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,440
to go and it's up yeah so Carlos is a little no don't call me don't call me

419
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,880
also danger have you seen the wiener documentary oh my god you got to see it

420
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,760
just for the scene of him at like, he's at some like parade. And I think it's like a like,

421
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,880
I don't know, but he it's him on a float, like singing and dancing to reggaeton.

422
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,240
It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Just him like, like, go go is getting hard, dude.

423
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,520
He can see nearest. Yeah, he's like having the time of his goddamn life at this parade. And

424
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,080
everyone's like walking up to him because like it's after the allegations are

425
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,200
already out and everyone's walking up to him like I don't believe a man for him

426
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,360
that was like him it felt it probably felt like him coming out he was like I

427
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:53,120
can finally be myself yeah I'm sex addict yeah did yeah New York has a

428
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,680
pretty bad track record with with politicians having odd penises at this

429
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:07,360
point I would say. The Cuomo stuff that just came out? Yeah. Andrew Cuomo pulled his thing

430
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,520
out in a coronavirus town hall. He coronavirus pulled his thing out and he pulled his thing

431
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,440
out and he said "this is what's gonna cure you New York City, my gross penis, it looks

432
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,080
like ground beef yeah and I had it and I had a gauge earring in the hole yeah

433
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,640
yeah big thick one you can you can put your penis in this one yeah and I won't

434
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,980
be wearing a mask over this he's built exactly like the Dana Carvey show sketch

435
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,760
where Bill Clinton has a bunch of nipples that's like that is like that is

436
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,040
his body that's what he's gonna do for New York he's a bunch of weird little

437
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,040
flaps on an old man. And he's got a hen's ass too, just like the Bill Clinton message.

438
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Yep, he does a big ass fucking hen's ass. I think we should take over politically this

439
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,640
city, maybe. Yeah, I think we could do a Cynthia Nixon-style campaign. I kind of want to run

440
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:12,640
for... As you both know, I took the quiz, I am a Miranda. Oh, that's huge! Yeah, that's

441
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
That's a great start.

442
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,840
If we do take over New York City governor race, I am the Miranda of the group.

443
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,160
I will have to be the Cynthia Nixon type figure.

444
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,600
I took the quiz and it said that I was Hitler, so I don't think I should work in politics.

445
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I think you took the wrong quiz.

446
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,720
No, it was the Sex and the City quiz, but I just...

447
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,360
It was a very specific question.

448
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,920
- There's only one exact order of questions

449
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
you have to answer.

450
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,040
- Yeah, and then you get, fuck dude, Hitler again?

451
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,640
Took the office quiz, took the Buzzfeed food quiz,

452
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,240
took the, I'm gonna Hitler every time, dude.

453
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,720
- You know, they say New York City is the fifth character

454
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,720
in Sex and the City, but the sixth character is Adolf Hitler.

455
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,360
(laughing)

456
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,640
I just need to Cosmos so bad right now.

457
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,880
(laughing)

458
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,120
(laughter)

459
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,840
- I just need to get fucked.

460
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,040
- He's just like horribly green screened in.

461
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,880
- Sex, the city, and Hitler.

462
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,240
- Screw him, let's go downtown.

463
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,680
- Samantha, what are you doing on Staten Island?

464
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,320
- You're dating a bartender?

465
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,880
No honey.

466
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Or Samantha, what are you doing in the firehouse? You cannot go in the firehouse, Samantha.

467
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
I should probably watch Sex and the City.

468
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I've been watching it with my roommates.

469
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Yeah?

470
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Yeah, you guys jack off together to it?

471
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
No, we don't jack off. We watch it for the story.

472
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
There's got to be some nudity in that damn show.

473
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Yeah, there is.

474
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Really? Male or female?

475
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Both.

476
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
You see a guy's butt go into a girl's butt.

477
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Are you serious?

478
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
That's got to be a first of its kind.

479
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,720
Is it real or is it CG?

480
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,160
Who's to say?

481
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,040
You know they use like different camera angles.

482
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,640
It's practical effects and animatronics enhance with CG like Jurassic Park.

483
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Okay.

484
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Yeah.

485
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
All right.

486
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
I get it.

487
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,720
So they have butts that are made of metal and they CG the texture onto it.

488
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,920
So the butts in the foreground are animatronic but the butts in the background are CG.

489
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Yeah.

490
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
As they run.

491
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Yeah.

492
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
It's a John Williams score too.

493
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,020
beautiful it's the new it's the new force awakens one so it sucks so it's

494
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,800
like yeah and there's lightsabers in it too yeah this is all we're still talking

495
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,280
about section the city this is still sex they did it they did a crossover Wow

496
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:59,120
they did a crossover with Star Wars and also um but but versus but I mean you

497
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,600
You would think like a sequel to Kramer vs. Kramer would be.

498
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Yeah.

499
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
You know.

500
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,240
I love that they went the route of setting it in the same universe but completely new

501
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
story.

502
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Yeah.

503
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Yeah.

504
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,720
Kramer vs. Kramer, Kenny vs. Spinney and now Butt vs. Butt.

505
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
Kramer vs. Kramer I've never seen but what is it?

506
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
It's like about a divorce or something?

507
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
I had to guess.

508
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,580
It's about two puppets who are fighting.

509
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,960
It's about a divorce but it's like one of those 70s movies where it's like women are

510
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,480
the most evil people on earth yeah yeah like a graduate yeah yeah that's like a

511
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:40,680
divorce but it's like fucking like Meryl Streep is just like being just insanely

512
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:48,160
evil sick I think unless she's unless she's a good guy at the end we just say

513
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,040
it's about two Muppets in a boxing match what about two Kramers and they're one

514
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,880
upping each other this has probably been done before they're one upping each

515
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,480
other one up and one upping each other at the laugh factory okay all right well I

516
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,280
think they're one of them already won yeah I would say I don't know how much

517
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,160
better you know about Kramer versus Kessler whoo what about that's how we get

518
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:17,880
it to work Raymond versus Kramer and great great creation

519
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Cray-Sean versus Kramer and they both are trying to say the N-word as fast as possible.

520
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,880
That might be the worst movie ever that we just came up with.

521
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Rain Man versus Raymond.

522
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Oh no.

523
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Yeah.

524
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
How am I supposed to know? He's winning so much at the casino.

525
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
1, 2, 3. That's him counting the cards.

526
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Oh god.

527
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,240
Rainman versus Raymond versus Kramer versus

528
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,440
Debra I need you to pick me up at the casino this autistic guy's too good at math

529
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
versus Rayman

530
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
versus Rayman

531
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
who has no neck or arms

532
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
versus Rabbids

533
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,440
versus Mario Kingdom Battle

534
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,440
that's actually that might be a great game

535
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
yeah

536
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
yeah

537
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,440
oh man why haven't the Rabbids collabed with Seinfeld yet?

538
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
it just makes sense

539
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,440
these Rabbids are raving

540
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
let me see hold on

541
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,000
not today. Not today. Not today. You say you're speaking Spanish.

542
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,800
No, I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

543
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,340
It just makes that so

544
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,240
don't they start

545
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:46,840
He would never say that. He would never say that. He would never say Spanish. He doesn't

546
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,520
know Spanish. It just makes sense. No.

547
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:59,920
K is the deal with El Fudo. No I, Torea. No, he would not say any of this crap.

548
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,280
These are like the three Spanish phrases I remember from Spanish class.

549
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,800
Well yeah there's only one guy in the audience who speaks Spanish so you don't need all the

550
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
words and most people understand English.

551
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
You're right.

552
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
So you've got to pepper them in.

553
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Yeah.

554
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,640
I should learn Spanish pretty soon I think.

555
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Yeah.

556
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Yeah.

557
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
I'm planning to learn it tomorrow.

558
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,240
I think about learning Spanish but then I get stressed and I'm like if I learn Spanish

559
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,080
do I start when I speak Spanish do I have to do an accent or do I just talk normal?

560
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Yeah.

561
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,960
Like if I know perfect Spanish will I go into like the bodega and be like "Hola" or will

562
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,560
I say like Ola yeah no that's a big dilemma for a for a it is yeah Feliz

563
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:54,240
cumpleaños a tea somebody cuz I'm like what you would say Feliz Festivus I am

564
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,480
100% saying all of those phrases wrong yeah well again well that's the third

565
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,280
option I either go Spanish accent my accent or Seinfeld accent. Is it what is

566
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,320
it it's años yeah if you say what if you don't say años and you say anos is

567
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,680
anus. I don't know I know that I know that bitch is punta and then point is

568
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,200
punto and that gets pretty confusing in my volleyball games yeah yeah that I

569
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,320
play yeah with with with Latina Latin Americans. I didn't the thing I didn't

570
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,520
about that because when I go to the skate park there's like a huge they can have

571
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,880
like the like a huge volleyball game there oh they go stupid on that yeah

572
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,860
every weekend yeah and tell you what I accidentally like I don't want to be a

573
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,560
bit of a stickler about the rules but in volleyball you cannot hold the ball for

574
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,200
a full three seconds I would just like to pass that on to the volleyball

575
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,280
community at the Maria Hernandez Park in Bushwick you guys listen I get it it's a

576
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,400
It's a tough game.

577
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,720
Not a lot of tall people playing that over there.

578
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Come on man.

579
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,580
Not a lot of spiking going on.

580
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,760
So you can't just sit there holding the ball man.

581
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,120
I mean I get so heated when I walk by thinking about them just carrying that ball.

582
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
Stop!

583
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,900
You're supposed to slap the ball.

584
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Not just.

585
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
These are not regulation size.

586
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
This is not regulation.

587
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,940
I'm going to take down your net.

588
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
That net's coming with me.

589
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,900
You guys are disrespecting this sport.

590
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,180
I'm actually a I'm a volleyball. It's like a bikini. I'm a volleyball

591
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,260
professional. I'll have you know it's like chess where like one of the rules

592
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,580
of chess like the chess foundation or whatever is that you can't disrespect

593
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,500
chess or they'll kick you out. That's how I would bring disrepute upon the

594
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,220
game of chess. I'd go to Union Square to one of those like hustler guys who

595
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,820
plays chess with Taurus, try to get them to disrespect the game and take their

596
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,700
money. Yeah, so that is like the funniest rule. I think dude is a chess

597
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,140
fucking stupid yeah yeah I guess it's kind of stupid you fucker I got your

598
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:07,220
money I I'm Bobby Fisher yeah you've disrespected my game and now I must kill

599
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,660
you and I and I will be destroying you in hand and I will be I will be playing

600
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:17,340
you we're sending you to chest how he comes out on like a big like nightpiece

601
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,180
hello Bobby Fisher I have to kill you he walks towards you and then he turns left

602
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,180
and walks like 10 feet to the side.

603
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
(laughter)

604
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,180
No, he's over here!

605
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
And then he's like, "Wait a second."

606
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,180
And then he turns and walks again, and then he just

607
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
is making L-shapes all over the place trying to get to you.

608
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
Can we go to him?

609
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
This sucks.

610
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
And then he gets up to you and he goes, "My dick, your mouth."

611
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,180
"My dick to your mouth, right now."

612
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,180
And you're trying to walk to him, but you can only move--

613
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,180
Just get off the fucking horse, Bobby!

614
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
You can only move diagonally.

615
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,180
Just get off of it!

616
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,340
thing and it makes me worse than a lot of other crap I have to do I'm sorry what

617
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,980
did he do Bobby Fischer is like a psycho right like the chess master yeah yeah

618
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,060
yeah you got to be psycho you got it I mean you have to be cut there it's like

619
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,900
Michael Jordan yeah yeah but you're like what did he like would like mentally

620
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,700
fuck with like his opponents yeah like he wouldn't show like apparently he would

621
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,740
apparently he was so psycho when he would get nervous you'd imagine them naked

622
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,260
it yeah you know chess is a psycho game because it's for nerds but it's also

623
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,020
it's for the kind of nerds that don't like games with like dragons and yeah

624
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,540
it's for nerds like it's like our yeah exactly it's a yeah it's like killing

625
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,980
people in D&D but I hate my imagination yeah yeah I wish it was just a bunch of

626
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:44,260
like horses and yeah exactly white guys I wish I could slay pawns yeah yeah the

627
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,720
scariest thing about chess to me probably like is that I don't know how to play

628
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,380
yeah I don't know probably man while you were slaying pawns I was out slaying

629
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:59,640
poon I'll tell you what. Damn dude if Bobby was here right now he would kill me

630
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,400
he would kill you for disrespecting the game of chess. I'll never join a chess tournament.

631
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,600
You know we if any of us ever enter a chess tournament somebody could just clip that

632
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,800
last couple of minutes yeah and just play it on a I mean that's that's how that's

633
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,640
how people should be playing like high-level chess is just like yeah do

634
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,440
like hire a private investigator record everything they say like wait for them

635
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,920
to say like I don't want to play chess tomorrow I'm too tired I don't mean I

636
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,120
can't it that'll be the evolution of chess is that eventually in a hundred

637
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,760
years it was a game of intelligence yeah like like intelligence gathering where

638
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,640
you'll have to get. I like that you do that there's like there's like a referee. Yeah.

639
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,440
You could show that too. You have to get opposition research on your opponent.

640
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,760
The games are never played. It's just about who can argue better than the

641
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,160
person disrespecting you. This would be like the XFL for chess I think. The XFL for

642
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,280
chess would be sick. Yeah. Like the pieces like the cooler pieces like instead

643
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,080
like instead of the pawn it's the soldier. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So. Oh. Pacific soldiers.

644
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Yeah, instead of the king, the emperor.

645
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Mm-hmm.

646
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
The dark emperor.

647
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
George W. Bush is the king.

648
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Maybe the XFL for chess is you get to like, you own different, like, novelty chess games.

649
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,080
And then like, you have like the Star Wars one, you have like the Harry Potter one, you

650
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
have like all the fucking ones.

651
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
And then you just like mix.

652
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
You can mix and match.

653
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
You can build your team.

654
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Mix and match, yeah.

655
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Build a team.

656
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
It's like Warhammer.

657
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Yeah.

658
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Yeah.

659
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Out of the chess pieces from other chess games.

660
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,080
That's the thing, there's no regulation on the size of those chess boards, I think.

661
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Yeah, there's no rule that says I can't bring my 3,000 foot by 3,000 foot chess board to the tournament.

662
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Exactly. Still has the standard square size, too.

663
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,080
When I unfold it, nobody else can fit in the room and I win the tournament by default.

664
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,080
True, yeah. Ah, it appears we're at a bit of an impasse here.

665
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Well, I mean, I'm down to play. I know this board like the back of my hand.

666
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Yeah, I'm bringing my maze board.

667
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,840
board yeah but you might be but you might be lost so your pawn is clipping through

668
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:10,200
the chessboard you turned on no clip here's what you're making as many moves

669
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,120
as you you're making another way to metagame it is you you put you coat each

670
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,040
piece in poison right and then you you you train in a new one just like poison

671
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,680
damage true yeah yeah get some DOT on there no you train an immunity to the

672
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,640
poison. Yeah, you took me out but you also took poison damage. You use like an Amazon

673
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,600
frog with a poison coating. You take that off and put it on each and every piece

674
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,880
and then you train an immunity by taking a little bit by touching a little bit on

675
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,560
your penis every day. The first time you try to train immunity you just die. Yeah

676
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,200
and then you lose the game so that's that maybe is the future of chess. Chess

677
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,560
mate. Chess mate. They really fucked up by not calling it chess mate when you win.

678
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,760
That's a very good point. Yeah and then right before Chessmate, chess.

679
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,800
You're in chess you better do something. You might be in Chessmate pretty soon.

680
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah. Checkmate. It was originally chess played. Yeah. Because that's what you say when you

681
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,200
finish the game. And then well before that it was a guy who wasn't friendly enough. He had just

682
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,920
invented chess and he called it Chessmate. Yeah. And before that it was probably nothing

683
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,720
because the game didn't exist before that. Yeah it was checkers before that. Yeah.

684
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,440
- Yeah, checkers mate.

685
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,080
- Checkers mate.

686
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,960
- There's a lot of, there was like a pizza place

687
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,320
in my hometown called Checkmate Pizza.

688
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,840
- Really, was it kind of the intellectual

689
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,760
hot spot of New Hampshire?

690
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,880
- Why would you name your pizza place after chess?

691
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,840
- You wanna become smart and you wanna

692
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,160
attract a smart clientele, you know?

693
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,000
- Yeah.

694
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,120
- You want people who can read the menu.

695
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,200
Know how to read the menu.

696
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,240
- Yeah, I guess it's a good name for a pizza place,

697
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,160
but like, you know what's a better name for a chess store?

698
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,560
- Yeah. - That's true.

699
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,100
- Checkmate Pizza. - You could never call

700
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,300
a chess store-- - What's a better name

701
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,840
for a chess store? (laughs)

702
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,160
- You could never call a chess store Domino's.

703
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,240
- It's a chess supply store called Checkmate Pizza.

704
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,440
- Maybe it was a knockoff of Domino's.

705
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,400
- Oh. - Oh shit.

706
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,560
That's exactly what it was.

707
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,260
- That's actually pretty smart.

708
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,280
- God damn it. - Those guys do play chess.

709
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,120
They're playing chess with Domino's.

710
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
Domino's.

711
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
They're playing fucking 3D chess with Domino's.

712
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,400
Oh my god, dude.

713
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
They're in Domino's fucking head right now.

714
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,960
Holy shit, well they're out of business now.

715
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,280
I guess no one else fucking picked up on that.

716
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
ChessMate.

717
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,520
Yeah, I think maybe Checkmate is a little too far from Domino's for that one.

718
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Yeah.

719
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Call it like...

720
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Mahjong Pizza.

721
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Yeah.

722
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Chinese Checkers Pizza.

723
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
It might be good too.

724
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Is that what it's...

725
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,000
Chinese Checkers, is that what it's still called?

726
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Chinese Checkers?

727
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah.

728
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You think they maybe changed it?

729
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,320
I think there is another name for it, but I don't remember what it...

730
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
I think, yeah.

731
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
I think check.

732
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I thought Chinese food was so cool.

733
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Did they change Chinese food to something more PC maybe?

734
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,320
What? Yeah, wait. I know there's another name for...

735
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,320
It is not Mancala. That's a different game.

736
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
No, that's a completely different game.

737
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Mancala is fun though.

738
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Yeah.

739
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
It's one of the only games with holes in it.

740
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Sternholme.

741
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Oh, that's a cooler name.

742
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Sternholme, commonly known as Chinese Checkers, US and Canadian spelling,

743
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,320
or Chinese CheckWars, UK spelling.

744
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,760
Is it strategy board game of German origin?

745
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh, so that's probably why they're

746
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,560
That's probably why it's called Chinese checkers. They just made it up so

747
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:26,120
they could sell it. Yeah, those German bastards. Those fucking Nazis. I hate them.

748
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah.

749
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,600
They knew, they jumped on the Chinese bandwagon. They made their checkers

750
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,000
non-German. It should have been German checkers, dude.

751
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,160
What are these guys doing? Well, then it would be confusing. It is funny, yeah, German people made it

752
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:45,400
And it's shaped like a Star of David. Yeah, just just was mixing a lot of stuff here. Uh-huh. Yeah, what was it?

753
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,860
What's the year of origin? Let's see. It's a scary question

754
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:59,400
1892 okay dodge don't blow. Yeah, I mean we I don't know why I feel like we would have been in trouble for figuring that out

755
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:06,240
Honestly, I feel like we would have gotten in a little bit of trouble for that, huh? Yeah, so that's a relief I

756
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,280
I don't even remember how to play Chinese. I don't think I ever knew how to play it. I

757
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,680
just thought the board and like little marble things were really cool. I was like, it's

758
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,120
like one of those things where it's like, damn, this is like, this is probably the coolest

759
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,960
game ever because of how many colors and designs there are. Yeah. Like it's like when you get

760
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,720
one of those like, like fancy nerd board games as a kid, but you never like actually learn

761
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,400
how to play it. And you're just like, like, damn, this game has three decks of cards.

762
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,600
You know what was always the game that I never ever played right was a mousetrap.

763
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,100
Yeah, of course.

764
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
Yeah.

765
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,320
When you buy a mousetrap you just do the mousetrap.

766
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Why would you ever...

767
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,760
I'm trying to catch a real mouse over here.

768
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,960
I want to move a piece around the board too.

769
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Dude.

770
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Yeah, I never understood mousetrap.

771
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,000
I want to wait for 30 minutes before I get to use the mousetrap.

772
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, what the fuck?

773
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,720
How stupid is that, dude?

774
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,840
I remember I bought mousetrap at a yard sale and they had the board but not the trap stuff

775
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
in it.

776
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:10,360
that sucks. You're just playing sorry. You ever play, you guys ever play like rummy? Yeah,

777
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,400
I love gin rummy. I had a gin rummy phase for a while. Oh yeah, my family, we had a huge,

778
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,680
I forget how to play it every time, so I have to relearn how to play rummy. But then when

779
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,160
I get into it, I'm like, "Duh, fuck you. I'm the best rummy player there's ever been."

780
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,000
You guys ever play pitch? No. That's a fun one. What is that? It's a card game. Explain

781
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,400
I don't remember how to play it. Okay. It's a trick taking game. You guys ever play NERTS?

782
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,800
No. You guys ever play tag?

783
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,520
There was Rummy Cube too, which was like a yeah. Yeah, I I had a

784
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,040
We had these like things I think they were called electives

785
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,760
They were either called electives or some other bullshit in fourth and fifth grade

786
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,880
and I never got to pick mine because of I

787
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,440
Just knew I didn't if you didn't do your homework or if you had like a below a C or something

788
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,440
you would not get your first pick in those.

789
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,960
And I got like, I had to do board game club in fourth grade.

790
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,040
- I did board game club.

791
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,240
- But it was like different things,

792
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,600
where it was like for a couple weeks,

793
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,700
it was like, oh, you could go learn this.

794
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,160
So I had to do board game club,

795
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,680
and then fifth grade I wanted to be in the AV club thing.

796
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,880
But they got rid of that,

797
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,820
so then I had to pick like three,

798
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,780
you would pick three,

799
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,380
and then depending on how your grades were

800
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,260
or if the class got filled up.

801
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,540
- Yeah.

802
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
We never had an AV club at my school,

803
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,940
which was so fucked up.

804
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,940
Got robbed of so much nostalgia, so much stranger things.

805
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,140
- So many cool cameras and shit.

806
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,980
- Fourth grade I played Rummikub.

807
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,660
- So many fun projectors to look at.

808
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,300
- And then fifth grade, because my grades were bad,

809
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,180
I put design your room club,

810
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,140
which was like, it was like a thing,

811
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,660
like a that was like my third choice but I got it and I was like this is actually

812
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,700
kind of sick. My first choice. And it just taught me how to do interior design and

813
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,660
then I made like we had to make a shoebox diorama of what we wanted our

814
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,820
room to look like. Is that why you have such a beautiful room right now? Mm-hmm.

815
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,180
It's so gorgeous when I walk in there. Yeah, because I learned how to do

816
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:21,420
interior design in fifth grade and I've never left a fifth graders interior design.

817
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,020
We had that activity in like math class where it was like a geometry thing where

818
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,220
like you have to like measure the area like we did it so yeah yeah the area was

819
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,420
too yeah but it's everyone's just like yep and here's the bedroom here's the

820
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:37,900
bathroom and then here's the 5,000 foot by 5,000 foot amusement park room like

821
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,660
literally every person in the class was like I have an idea that nobody else is

822
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,220
gonna have which is I'm gonna make the biggest room ever and it's gonna have a

823
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,460
roller coaster dude I need I need to make enough money that I can build a house I

824
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,220
remember there was I need to build some kind of fucked up there was one weird

825
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,220
kid who wanted to put a secret window into the bathroom.

826
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,480
(laughter)

827
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,920
- And he just told everybody?

828
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,420
He was like, when I built this house.

829
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,220
- He was like, sixth grade, yeah.

830
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,020
I just remembered that he wanted to have a room

831
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,900
that was like, it was like all glass

832
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,700
that you could see out of but couldn't see into.

833
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,540
- It was a qu--

834
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,680
- That's early for that, too.

835
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,520
- Yeah, it's real early, dude.

836
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,860
- Sixth grade, that's trouble.

837
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,420
- Dude, there's a record store in my hometown

838
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,400
where the owner got in trouble for putting cameras in the bathroom.

839
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,520
Chuck Berry's record store.

840
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,060
But his excuse was he was like, "Yeah, what if somebody goes in there and steals and puts

841
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,120
a record in their shirt?

842
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,080
What if someone puts a record in their ass or their vagina?"

843
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,960
"Hey, what if my toilet gets clogged?

844
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,600
Do you ever think about that, judge?"

845
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,000
"We want to put up a sign for the wanted man who clogged my damn toilet."

846
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,280
"That'd be bad news, dude."

847
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
"All right, fine.

848
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
We'll compromise.

849
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,240
the cameras in but I'll put cameras in my office and monitors in the bathroom so

850
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,040
we can see each other we know yeah yeah there's a connection yeah create a Skype

851
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:02,260
call between a computer in the bathroom this is a big TV screen that's just his

852
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,720
face just not blinking I hope you're not trying to steal anything in here and I

853
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,120
a normal shit or piss I hope you don't overuse the toilet paper because we would

854
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:23,560
we do take inventory it's one where one lie one ply no folding oh no folding

855
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:33,040
yeah that's a dude one ply toilet paper and if you use the if you use the the

856
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,560
hand dryers you have to blow some air back into the they're like an air

857
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,480
mattress you have to you don't get free air yeah I put a straw in them you have

858
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,240
to fill them back up no I was just thinking about maybe this is like very

859
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:53,040
stupid where's that air coming from intake it intakes the air and blows it

860
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,440
out you know like a vacuum opposite of a vacuum okay really angry guy behind it

861
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,880
well the older the older the older looking ones I don't know why I got this

862
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,880
into my head but I thought that maybe they had to like put like a you know

863
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,240
like how it's like a house will have like a vacuum sometimes built into the house

864
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,280
uh central back yeah central back i thought it was like one of those

865
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,200
situations where they would put like a central air maybe i mean i don't know i'm

866
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,040
i assume it just says like a vent on the bottom but i've never like

867
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,840
really put my face up close to a public bathroom

868
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,080
hand dryer really you've never put your mouth on it no i did that once

869
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,760
i've never done that i made your mouth blow blow blow my face back guys look

870
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,960
I can make my tongue is licking the inside of the one you say that I did

871
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
used to play that game.

872
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
Did you yeah?

873
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,160
I would draw I would I would pad my tongue down with my shirt dry if I

874
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,360
get it really really dry.

875
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,760
It is funny because then you can get it to like stick to your face.

876
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,160
Yeah, yeah, and I'm like damn.

877
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,960
I got damn a lizard in my house.

878
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:58,560
Fuck look how dehydrated I can get you know, I can make rocks in my

879
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,160
wiener.

880
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,160
My body can make rocks.

881
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,860
What can you do?

882
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,260
You rocking with me?

883
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,180
I thought that a hand dryer would blow my face back like a leaf blower.

884
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,380
Yeah, if a good one can.

885
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,020
Yeah, and I put my face up to that thing and just got hot air on my mouth.

886
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,740
Yeah, doesn't feel good.

887
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,740
His walkout looking like Freddy Krueger.

888
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,740
Yeah.

889
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,740
It's gross.

890
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,940
It was probably the grossest thing I've ever done.

891
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,980
Because immediately it was at a place.

892
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,860
You fingered my wall.

893
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:29,860
That's fine.

894
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,420
I'm making love to your house, baby.

895
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,540
That's not love dude, nothing lovely about a finger.

896
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,580
I mean that's part of living in New York, is it's like you know.

897
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,620
You can't, you can never, fingering is never romantic.

898
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,140
Fingering is always just like necessity.

899
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,140
Nothing lovely about a finger.

900
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,620
It's like eating a hot dog.

901
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,620
Yeah, yeah.

902
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,020
What do you mean eating a hot dog is romantic?

903
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,500
Eating like a hot dog out of a cart.

904
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,700
It's like yeah, I have two dollars, like I don't have time for something more involved

905
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,980
in this, I can't sit down at a restaurant.

906
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,660
That's basically what fingering is, you realize that?

907
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,240
Fingering is hot dogs.

908
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,940
is at 100% hot dogs yeah but but normal sex is hamburger that's hamburger that's

909
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:13,120
a sit-down hamburger that's five guys and and then the back door that's got to be

910
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:20,180
some dessert because it's just too damn sweet chocolate pudding that's gotta be

911
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:27,980
like poop pudding yeah almost yeah you know and then oral sex that's brushing

912
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,980
your teeth that's like yeah that's probably like brushing your teeth and

913
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,400
To me, sex is all filing your taxes.

914
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,400
Really?

915
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,180
You might have some sort of mental issue then.

916
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,180
Yeah?

917
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,180
Yeah.

918
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,700
You might be allergic to sex like a Weezer song.

919
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,260
That's true, I might be.

920
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,420
I think I'm working on a kidney stone right now.

921
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,060
Maybe even a kidney geode is being created in my body right now due to all the red thunder

922
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,060
I'm drinking.

923
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,860
I would love to make a kidney coin.

924
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,860
Yeah.

925
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,340
Did you say a kidney bitcoin?

926
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,340
A kidney coin.

927
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,340
Kidney corn? Coin?

928
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,340
Kidney corn.

929
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,340
Sounds pretty damn good actually.

930
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,340
[Burps]

931
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,340
Can we pause and pee real quick?

932
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,340
Yeah. Nice.

933
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,340
Ready to fall in love.

934
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,340
Okay, I just got powered up by a shit that I took.

935
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,340
Oh, I'm ready to fall in love all over again.

936
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,340
Dana just texted me, apparently on her way to work

937
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,340
a bird pooped on her head and she started crying.

938
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,340
Aww.

939
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,340
You guys are supposed to laugh at her.

940
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,340
That sucks. And then she tripped and she broke all her teeth.

941
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:35,980
teeth that's right that's right yeah yep she got hit back and forth by buses

942
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:40,140
going opposite directions on the street and just got like ping-pong like a

943
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,020
similar like in Sin City yeah exactly she's got hit back and forth for like a

944
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,020
couple hours and then Elijah would came out with these long sharp fingernails and

945
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:53,060
he yeah he's wearing shiny anime glasses and he kidnapped her and then city hey

946
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,260
buddy you tell my damn wife right now I'm talking about Elijah would oh cool

947
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,300
That's actually pretty cool. Yeah I'd be honored if Elijah Wood would kidnap my

948
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,940
wife. You guys remember Elijah Woods character in Sin City right? Yeah. He's

949
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,900
like the serial killer who was like a pet wolf and like I was like I was

950
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,940
arguing with people online because I was like I thought that he was supposed to

951
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,300
be like a wolf man because he has like claws and he has like a pet wolf and he

952
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,500
eats people. Yeah. Everyone's like no he's just like a serial killer and I was

953
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,780
like no he's clearly supposed to be like something because he also like move he

954
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,300
like dashes super fast and she runs like a dog and then I looked up and it was

955
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,660
like Frank Miller has said that everyone in Sin City is human except for Kevin

956
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:38,980
who is a demon. Just demon? Yeah he was a demon. Frank Miller's a he's a he's a guy

957
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:43,060
huh? He's a freak. He's quite the freak. I don't know much about him but I do know that he

958
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:49,140
like cast magic on women or something right? Yeah. He wanted to make

959
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,020
Batman fight the Taliban and they wouldn't let him. Was that him? That's

960
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:57,620
hilarious. That's sick. He wanted to make a comic called...

961
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,700
I want to double check. It's called Batman vs. Taliban. It was

962
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,620
called Holy Terror Batman. Sick. And then they wouldn't let him make it so

963
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,740
he just made a book. Yeah he just made something that doesn't have...

964
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,700
has a Batman ripoff in it called Holy Terror. They didn't want Batman to get

965
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,900
involved. They didn't want Batman to get political. They didn't want a Batman Jihad.

966
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,380
Batman likes terrorism. That was one thing in the DC Universe.

967
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,060
He probably does like terrorism, doesn't he?

968
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,340
Yeah, because he gets to fight it.

969
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,140
True.

970
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,700
I mean, you know, when your whole industry is fighting crime, you start to love it.

971
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,740
Yeah, I guess you're right.

972
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:35,060
Terror is what made him into Batman, his terror of bats.

973
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,580
You know, Batman is a terrorist.

974
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,580
Yeah, in a way, I would say.

975
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,900
Terrorists.

976
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,380
Terror rich.

977
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,380
Wow.

978
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,380
Can we just let-

979
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:52,260
You know we watched that freestyle video and now I'm just trying to spit bars off my dome.

980
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,860
We need to have a freestyle workshop.

981
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,220
I'm trying to get spit on my dome.

982
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,460
Patrick, ball sack.

983
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,700
My ball sack, I just took a crap.

984
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,860
I got shit on my sack.

985
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,460
Wipe back on my ass.

986
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:22,740
shit on my crack. Broke my back. Trying to wipe. I tried to bend over and wipe. Broke

987
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:35,580
my back. Bend over back. With my sack. Stuck up my ass. Yeah. I broke my back. Smoking crack.

988
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,160
Straight drop from the top.

989
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,120
Nope, you just, you just,

990
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,120
hop on, pop.

991
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,380
- Give me one.

992
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,040
- Christmas.

993
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:52,300
- I just celebrated my favorite holiday, Christmas.

994
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,520
Buying presents is of my family business.

995
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,360
- Yes.

996
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,720
- Blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib.

997
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,560
- That works?

998
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,480
- And I just, I opened my stocking on Christmas.

999
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,820
My wish list for Christmas was my family business.

1000
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,300
My family business was writing my wish list.

1001
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,100
Buying presents.

1002
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,100
Presents for my...

1003
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,100
Uh huh.

1004
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,100
(farting noises)

1005
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
Fuck.

1006
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,300
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

1007
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,860
Your rhymes are so fire you made Caleb pop and lock.

1008
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,860
Damn.

1009
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,860
Dude, I think I got...

1010
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,860
Wait, guys.

1011
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,620
I think I got locked in one position.

1012
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,020
I can't pop anymore.

1013
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,340
I think I ran out of hydraulic juice.

1014
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,000
Hit the reset button.

1015
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,320
it's on the back of my head. Did you guys play Animal Crossing on GameCube?

1016
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,680
Do you have a paper clip? Animal Crossing? No, I was a boy growing up.

1017
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,760
You can be a boy in that game. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't know.

1018
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,240
I made my town, my first town name, because you have to use like a whole memory card for

1019
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:57,520
that. I remember I made a town called, because I thought, my neighbor said Gonads, and in

1020
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:04,160
my head I misheard him. I thought he said Gones. And he's like, Gones means nuts. So

1021
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,280
I named my town Gones and my mom was like what why did you name it that I was like

1022
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:16,520
don't worry I I named my my hit Mon Lee on my Pokemon

1023
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:22,880
whatever fire red I named him kick-ass when I was eight and because I guess

1024
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,800
fucking yeah cuz he kicks ass and then my mom was like hey you should show me

1025
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,920
your Pokemon game and I deleted my save file it was like I ain't fucking I don't

1026
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
want that smoke.

1027
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,280
But um, the reason I brought up Animal Crossing, you guys ever fucked up in like Reset and then

1028
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,760
that Resetti guy shows up?

1029
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,240
I never played Animal Crossing.

1030
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,880
How many times do I have to tell you, we were raised boys.

1031
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
Yeah.

1032
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Well, I don't know.

1033
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,520
I wasn't raised as some fucking girl, okay?

1034
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,400
I was raised as a boy.

1035
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,640
I ate ground beef every meal.

1036
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,000
That was a good, the Resetti song?

1037
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I was allowed to piss in the sink.

1038
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You know what I'm saying?

1039
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,500
You understand?

1040
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,700
I love interior design and catching bugs!

1041
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,500
Yeah, wait, you did take an interior design class and then you played Animal Crossing?

1042
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,300
It's true.

1043
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,000
Nice, dude.

1044
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,600
Hey, did you guys ever play Barbie Dress-Up growing up?

1045
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,100
I did.

1046
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,200
Yeah, I bet you did, girl.

1047
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,800
Yeah, on Game Boy.

1048
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,500
And as an adult, you sit with all your roommates watching Sex and the City?

1049
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,600
Uh-huh.

1050
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,300
I'm putting the puzzle pieces together right now.

1051
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,400
I think you could have, in fact, been a woman this whole time.

1052
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Which is fine, you know?

1053
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:36,800
I've had a bad attitude all day because I've been PMSing.

1054
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
So maybe.

1055
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,360
Patrick mood sour.

1056
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,680
Yeah, that's right.

1057
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,680
That's right.

1058
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,080
Dude, I feel like there has to be, the scientists have to discover.

1059
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,160
A pill that makes it so your period doesn't happen?

1060
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,280
No, they have to discover like a male PMS thing that goes on.

1061
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,280
Men have mixed PMS.

1062
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,280
Yeah, there's times of the month where I'm like, I'm just a nasty little bitch right now.

1063
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,000
You know? I need an excuse, but it can't be like, my ass hurts.

1064
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,500
Yeah.

1065
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,360
You know? I need a chemical excuse.

1066
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,600
I lost my video game.

1067
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need something where I can every month, I have like a week.

1068
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,360
Well, for men, what that is, is withdrawal.

1069
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,800
From Will Ferrell movies.

1070
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,300

Yeah, sorry.

1086
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,640
That's what happens when a group of guys don't watch a goddamn Will Ferrell comedy from 2004.

Sorry, I didn't even really get a chance to watch the blooper reels either, so I'm not

1096
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,200
first time hanging out with this guy who uh we ended up being very close friends his name was

1097
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:47,240
was Will Ferrell but he like he like talked a lot during the movie and I got

1098
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,300
so mad during Anchorman 2 yeah because he was like look he's singing about a

1099
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:57,280
shark. He's like you fucking I'm gonna kill you. He was my best friend for years.

1100
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:03,760
Yeah. Yeah. Noah? No. You don't know this guy? Being a movie talker is awesome. I

1101
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,240
love being a movie talker. Yeah. I like pissing people off. Yeah I know it's also

1102
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,260
It's a funny thing for people to get mad at cuz yeah, especially if they've seen the movie before yeah

1103
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:19,040
It's like who gives a fuck. I'm a really bad movie talker, but I also get mad when people talk

1104
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,780
Yeah, the worst the worst guy. I forget what movie it was

1105
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:30,680
It was some like weird action movie that I think James McAvoy was in or it was just I don't remember

1106
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:37,740
I have to fucking wanted what movie it was wanted might have been no definitely wasn't wanted

1107
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,620
It was some PG-13 action movie from like 2008. I'll have to look that up.

1108
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:46,580
But it was like me and like a group of my friends. The McAvoy ultimatum.

1109
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,860
That's a really good one. Like it was a bunch of kids at the movie theater

1110
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,100
and then we found there's like a group of like

1111
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:57,140
high schoolers in front of us and then we thought it would be funny to just piss them off the whole time.

1112
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:03,100
So we were just like like like literally just like making it just the worst movie experience.

1113
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,440
Yeah. Yeah. For these high schoolers. Yeah. And like I was singing at one point.

1114
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,400
(laughing)

1115
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,060
♪ McAvoy, oh McAvoy ♪

1116
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,000

- Jesus of Suburbia part four.

1120
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,280

01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,240
"Were you just singing?"

1122
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,440
And I was like, "No, I have no idea what you're talking about."

1123
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,280
- No, dude.

1124
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,680
- They must have got the rights for that song for the movie.

1125
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,520

- It's part of the movie, dude.

1127
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,200
- I remember when I saw Hereditary in the theater

1128
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,400
for the first time, there were a bunch of high schoolers

1129
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,040
in the theater, and you know how the trailer

1130
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,840
for that movie. Like it was like they may look like the little girl was creepy

1131
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,560
and like it had a bunch of like yeah, that was the thing in the trailer. So

1132
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,720
like the entire movie they were sitting in like the front and just like going

1133
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,600
like to each other and like laughing like and then they were like doing that

1134
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,840
literally just for like the whole movie and then the like the this the scene in

1135
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,920
the car don't spoil it. This the beheading scene came on and they're just

1136
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,140
dead. So for the rest of the movie

1137
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,880
That was a weird movie. That was the first time I went to see like a horror movie in

1138
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,260
theaters and everybody just laughed the entire time. It was so bizarre.

1139
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:17,200
Yeah, you went to the twisted theater. Yeah, I must have gone to an evil theater

1140
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,260
because people thought that crap was funny. That was maybe one of the

1141
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,840
most fun movies to see in theaters because you could

1142
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,440
tell which people were seeing it for the first time. Yeah.

1143
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,320
Yeah, it's so fun to just hear it like here an entire crowd just go like oh

1144
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,460
Rewind that and change it yeah

1145
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:42,960
Yeah, I think I've talked about this before but like a like just an activity that we would do in middle school was

1146
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,840
Try to get kicked out of the movies. Yeah, like it's fun. Yeah. Yeah, so we would go see bad

1147
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,280
We go jack each other up you go see bad

1148
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,080
Blow each other is fuck each other in the movies me and my friends as a joke and then like yeah

1149
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:01,400
You get kicked out and then you wait in the lobby for your friends to come back. Yeah, so we got kicked out of like

1150
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,880
