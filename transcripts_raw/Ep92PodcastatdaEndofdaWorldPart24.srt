1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,160
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,000
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,820
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,280
- All right, and we're back in the mix.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
- Look at that, that's how good we are at this.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,040
Don't eat the shit.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,120
- Yeah, what the fuck is your problem, dude?

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,040
You're so stupid.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,300
- Is that the Chipotle that gave you food poisoning?

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,140
- No.

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,040
(laughing)

14
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,800
- Going back ever more.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,640
He saved it.

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:38,120
back for seconds. That would be so fucking funny dude. I can't waste it. I can't put it past you.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,880
I wish that I could put it past you. I'm unable to. What gave you food poisoning?

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,880
I think, so I have two theories. Okay. I did get Taco Bell in New Hampshire.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,720
All right. And I also the next day got a pizza from Veggie Crust. Veggie Crust is good. I got

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,040
got a different pizza that I don't normally get.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,880
I picked it up, it was kinda cold when I opened the box.

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,920
It was a Gobi Manchur.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,640
Thinking about it right now makes me wanna puke,

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,360
so maybe that is the thing that gave me food poisoning.

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,040
- Yeah, the mind is what detects it.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,880
- The mind is a powerful tool.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,320
- And when was this Chipotle from?

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
- This is from yesterday.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,640
- Before or after you had food poisoning?

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,040
- Yesterday you had food poisoning,

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,360
and you were like, I'm gonna go to Chipotle.

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,600
(laughing)

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,860
(laughing)

34
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,400
- Lunatic.

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,480
- Oh, I just got done shitting water in applesauce

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,560
for fucking 24 hours.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm gonna go get Chipotle.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,080
- I needed rice, I needed protein.

39
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,680
I've not eaten all day.

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,600
I was done with all of the symptoms.

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,960
So, I decided I needed to treat myself.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,200
- You're a monster.

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,520
- I'm not a monster.

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,960
- You should be put in a cage like a dog.

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Oh yeah, something I, we already recorded one episode, this is the second in this marathon

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,880
streak. I forgot to mention on the first one, we're back to shitty microphones now because

47
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,400
my school where I rented the good mics from closed, so I'm sorry but the audio quality

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,320
on these is going to be worse. It probably will be worse for the foreseeable future because

49
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,400
I don't think we can afford buying nice microphones.

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,440
I think if we save up a couple Patreon checks, that should be a priority.

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Yeah, but I mean, I need to live.

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,720
Or if we do enough begging online right now and say...

53
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,800
Sure, Cameron does too. Okay, so...

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,560
I'll be fine. Don't let him.

55
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,120
No, no, no, no, no.

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,240
That guy, Shay Serrano, he keeps giving out $250 to people.

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,440
Send it to us, man.

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,240
Mm-hmm. Shay Serrano and then Stavros from Stavros Halkias said he's gonna do it too.

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,760
He's gonna give us $250?

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,240
If we get Shay Serrano and Stavros Halkias to give us $250...

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,440
That's $500.

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,920
$500. That's at least one microphone.

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,800
That's cash money.

64
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,080
Yeah, no, but we are going through a rough time right now. Patrick, unemployed as he's always been.

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,400
Cameron got canned. I got canned from one of my jobs. So if you want the first, this is the second

66
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,160
part of an episode. If you want the first part, you should sub to the Patreon. Let's continue what

67
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,640
we were talking about before. Kangaroos. Yeah. We're talking about kangaroos punching. I was

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,080
talking about that video that's... is your cat hitting a speed bag in the other room?

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,160
What is that fucking sound? He can hear... I put him in the other room because I'm

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,580
trying to eat and Sphynx cats are notoriously very bad at trying to steal

71
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,400
your food. They're very bad at it so he has to put them away. They're very like any

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,440
Egyptian. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that's him trying to get out of the bedroom. It's

73
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,440
such a funny noise. Yeah I should probably just put this away and let him out. Yeah

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,940
you well yeah why should you start eating immediately when we started recording I

75
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,740
don't know I'm very hungry right now you can finish eating yeah I would love to

76
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,940
eat a kangaroos pouch all right now you can tell your story yeah is the cat

77
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,100
getting is that getting picked up on the probably not I don't know are you asking

78
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,980
me cuz you you know you chewing into the microphone that's true yeah that video

79
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,620
with the kangaroo where the guy the kangaroo like puts the dog in a headlock

80
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,860
yeah yeah and then the guy like pulls up yeah punches him in the face. That video rocks.

81
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,020
The funny here's what I was thinking about that video so much yesterday

82
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,980
because the the kangaroo is in complete shock right when he gets punched he he

83
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,780
like he stumbles back and then just looks at him yeah and the reason is the

84
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:38,540
kangaroo he only understands kicking. Somebody he gets kicked in the face with

85
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,540
the hand. Yeah, he's like so confused and that opened up a new world for him.

86
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,140
It was just like it was a mind bug that was making me go crazy yesterday.

87
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,440
You know, you know, it's I was watching a shit ton of kangaroo videos recently.

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,340
Do you know they can stand on their tails?

89
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,540
That's how they kick is they literally their tails support their weight and

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,340
they do that in Spyro 3. Fucking insane.

91
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,840
They use it like if you watch them hopping they use their tail like in the

92
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
back. They're like a tripod.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,340
They like balance on their tail and move their feet forward. Sheila does that

94
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,240
in Spyro 3.

95
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,840
Yeah, you do that in your mom's bedroom.

96
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,400
Kangaroos are close enough to humans that I feel like there is a different universe where

97
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
humans evolved from kangaroos.

98
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
Yeah, they're like horse rabbits.

99
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
They're like horse rabbit chimps.

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,600
Yeah, Australians evolved from kangaroos.

101
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah, they did.

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Yeah.

103
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
That's why they talk like that.

104
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Just eat your fucking chipotle.

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Yeah.

106
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,600
I saw a bunch, there's a bunch of videos of kangaroos trying to jump through glass doors

107
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,480
are big windows because they can't like to see the reflection and they're trying

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,400
to like fight it so they just jump and it's like smash into it and the people

109
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,880
just have to go up and be like go away stop stop go it cuz I'll just break the

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,400
windows if they if you let them it's such a yeah and I love that they're like

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,520
despised in Australia yeah like everybody they kill them not even cuz I

112
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,000
want they make burgers down there it's a pretty good meat imagine looking at a

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,200
kangaroo though and being like I'm gonna turn that shit into a burger yeah I'm

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm gonna put ketchup on you.

115
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,800
- Yeah. - Yeah.

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,520
- Have you seen that video of the deer

117
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,920
running through the salon?

118
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,240
- I think so.

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,440
- It's like a deer, it's like some security cam footage.

120
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,920
- Yeah, no, I did see it.

121
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,080
- I was watching that, Dom sent it to me

122
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,080
while we were playing Jackbox with the Discord.

123
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,640
Shout out to the Discord. - Oh yeah, people go

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,720
- Yeah, we're all locked inside.

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,600

127
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440

One of the baddest of communication. There was a QAnon guy who was

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,140
like, "I can't believe it! I saw this earlier today! They shut down Xbox Live!"

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,220
Patrick so you can let the cat out. Yeah, the cat is going crazy.

167
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Jesus fucking Christ.

168
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
Oh shit, they gotta eat in ten minutes too.

169
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,220
They have to eat in ten minutes? Oh god. Or else what?

170
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
This is a disaster. This is horrible.

171
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
Cats have to eat in ten minutes.

172
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
I don't know what we're gonna do.

173
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Probably feed them. Jesus Christ.

174
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Every time Patrick stands up his fucking microphone falls.

175
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,220
I don't know how he does it. That's because Patrick's body acts like the heavy thing on the block.

176
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
on the block at a lake.

177
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,300
No, it's a, the microphone is in orbit of him, so he stands up and walks away and it tries

178
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
to follow him.

179
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,460
It's a leaf sword.

180
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
It shoots out of orbit.

181
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

182
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,460
Yeah, and there he goes.

183
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,620
Anyway, yeah, I need to be, I'm going to watch a lot of kangaroo videos over the next couple

184
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,620
of days.

185
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
Yeah.

186
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
I think I might learn everything about them.

187
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Yeah.

188
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Yeah.

189
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
No.

190
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,060
Get this, there is a movie.

191
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,100
No.

192
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:58,140
Anthony Anderson okay from scary movie and a kangaroo what mm-hmm what's it

193
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,780

194
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,460
hop kangaroo mm-hmm named kangaroo jack he's on there's kangaroo jack is only in

195
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,900
that movie for 10 minutes that's not true like jaws dude yeah if they show

196
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:20,140
for too long it looks fake. Exactly yeah or you lose the fear.

197
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:27,620
I think they did do a kangaroo jack cut like a horror movie.

198
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Yeah like like the Shining one. I remember those. Those are great.

199
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,740
Now you know why I put them in the other room. Yeah I already knew why you

200
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,900
put them in the other room. They're just psychopaths.

201
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,300
They're walking on the table. It's funny that in like two weeks you're gonna be eating them.

202
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,260
Yeah. Yeah. Like you are, I hope you know that's where we're at. I would never eat Yoda.

203
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,500
They kind of look like rotisserie chickens. Oh they look like, yeah, they look like chickens.

204
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Yeah, you will. I would never eat Yoda though, that's my boy. I don't know.

205
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,780
Yeah, you guys will be. Depends on how he's. He's in the trash. Oh, fucking god damn it.

206
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,460
Why do we record? Why does he throw down the microphone? I don't know.

207
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,140
Wash your hands.

208
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:26,540
I know you didn't consider it. And you're not considering that nobody can hear you right now

209
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:37,900
either. God damn you Patrick. Just hurry up, just walk over here. Get your cat.

210
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Okay, let's start the list.

211
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,900
We're really, no, we're not gonna, the list is, I don't think the list is long enough.

212
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
We should, it's not long enough?

213
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Banter more.

214
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,900
I love banter, dude.

215
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Banter more.

216
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
Oh my god, the cats are eating the chips.

217
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,900
This is the worst day of my life, dude.

218
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
I hate your cats.

219
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
I hate everything about this place.

220
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Look at the poop on his ass, dude.

221
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
He's shitting on the couch.

222
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
He's got poop all over him.

223
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
He's covered in poop.

224
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
He's not covered in poop.

225
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,980
in poop. You would see it if he was covered in poop. You can't see it?

226
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,100
This is the kind of poop only cool people can see.

227
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,300
Whoa. Yeah, like that's my sixth sense. Patrick's killing the cat by

228
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,300
wrapping the light cord around the neck. I hate them so much. Why? Why do you think?

229
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,620
They're making this a disaster. They're fine. They're doing cat stuff. I hate them.

230
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,580
Oh shit, it's in ten minutes that thing is gonna feed them. I know.

236
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:06,360
it's over it's all over. Yoda has figured out how to push the feeder so that food

237
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,720
comes out and they open the door so now so now he's back now he's back yeah now

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,120
yeah yeah. God I just despise them more than anything. Why? Why do you? Because they ruin

240
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,280
everything. They don't ruin everything. They ruin everything. They do not ruin everything.

241
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,160
- It's head-butting the food machine.

242
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,960
- It's unbelievable how shitty they are.

243
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,800
- They are not shitty at all.

244
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
- They're terrible, dude.

245
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,760

246
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,720
- I wish that you had a baby.

247
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,920
- They are babies.

248
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,720
- I know, there's way worse than a baby.

249
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,200
Yeah, you don't even get a diaper.

250
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,320
- No, you don't even get to look at the diaper

251
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,460
when you change it.

252
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,760
You gotta stop saying that about them.

253
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
- You should make them wear diapers.

254
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
- You should have diapers for them.

255
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh, there he goes.

256
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,080

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,060
Walking by my apartment and just just shouting. I don't know what's going on

327
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:45,000
But there's just people outside like I've heard so many more so much more fight on John said that he's noticed an uptick in crazies

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,660
Yeah, I think it's just because there's less

329
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:54,800
Normals, yeah, yeah, you know, I think also this is the time for the crazies to really go crazy. That's true

330
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,240
this is the time people who normally you would walk by and wouldn't be

331
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,240
talking to themselves this is when they will be talking to themselves. Give it two weeks it's gonna be the purge man.

332
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. And that's why you're gonna die Patrick. No I'll be fine. Because I'll be at home, I'll have a shotgun aimed at the door, my house is gonna be set up with

333
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I can go to my house. I'm gonna have marbles on the staircase and hot tar and a nail and one of the. And a spider. I'll be fine. I'll go to my home in New Hampshire, I'll go to my parents house. I'm gonna go absolutely home alone on these fools.

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,720
I have a pellet gun. A pellet gun? And there's a real gun there too. Nice. It's in a safe.

335
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:36,280
I haven't found it yet. I haven't found it yet. I'm gonna find my gun. I'll just sit outside

336
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,640
with the pellet gun and I'll practice. You're gonna sit outside on a peloton? Yeah. Pat,

337
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,960
you should start riding a peloton. I might. I know someone who has one. I'm gonna start

338
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,000
rowing. I have a rowing machine in my room that I don't use very often. It'd be funny

339
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,640
if I like came back and you were just super buff. I don't have anything else to

340
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,480
do. Just get strong. Cameron's gonna get prison whipped. I probably will get strong. I'm just gonna try to. I'm gonna

341
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,240
say I'm gonna get strong. I'm gonna do it for two days then I'm just gonna stop.

342
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,640
You should just get extremely strong. I would love to. That would be so cool. But just huge arms.

343
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,560
Nothing different. Just like huge red arms. I'm worried I'm just gonna get fatter. Yeah. I mean

344
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,520
you just gotta start. You just have to do, the thing is yeah. Just like jump a bunch. I'm

345
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm basically, nothing for me is changing other than I can't go outside.

346
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Yeah, that's true.

347
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,120
Literally, I've been doing this, I've been prepared more than anyone.

348
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,740
I know what I'm doing here.

349
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,680
All you do is you just kind of sit in here and then you get up and go to--

350
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, give us Patrick's quarantine tips.

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What do you do?

352
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You sit at home, you go to 7-Eleven a little bit.

353
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,120
You wake up, when do you wake up?

354
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
You wake up 2 a.m.

355
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
2 a.m.?

356
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,120
You stay up till 10 in the morning, you fall back asleep.

357
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,200
Wait, so when did you go to sleep to wake up at 2 a.m.?

358
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,680
I'm not I haven't gotten there yet. No you started at waking up at 2 a.m.

359
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,360
So what time did you go to sleep to wake up? I'm getting there.

360
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,400
Okay all right wake up at 2 a.m. You wake up at 2 a.m.

361
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,080
you stay up till 10 a.m. you fall back asleep

362
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,320
till 3 a.m. What? Till 3? It's already 24 hours. Yeah you already went to 3 p.m.

363
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,480
Okay. You get dinner, you get lunch which--

364
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
You wait in that order, dinner and then lunch.

365
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,520
You get lunch, which is breakfast.

366
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Lunch is breakfast.

367
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,320
What time are you eating lunch/breakfast?

368
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
That's at 4.

369
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
4am or pm?

370
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
4pm.

371
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Okay.

372
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,560
And then you go to bed at 2am.

373
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
What do you, what else?

374
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,760
So you wake up, you eat one meal and then you go to bed when you wake up.

375
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
At the same time.

376
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Mmhmm.

377
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,680
And so that's the ubermensch sleep cycle.

378
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,000
If you can't understand this system, you're gonna die.

379
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay.

380
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Alright.

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,380
That's all I'm saying.

382
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,380
I'll die.

383
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,380
I'll die, yeah.

384
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,380
I don't want to try and understand that.

385
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
Yeah, that makes absolutely no sense.

386
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,380
That's too difficult.

387
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
Yeah.

388
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,600
Time is a-- Patrick understands better than anybody that time is a construct and he just

389
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,160
exists outside of it.

390
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
He's not worried about it.

391
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,400
You sleep 30 minutes of every hour.

392
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Yeah.

393
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Yeah.

394
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah.

395
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
That's 12 hours, baby.

396
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
None of it makes sense.

397
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,280
When I was-- at some point in high school, I was just like homeschooled and like I was

398
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:16,400
going crazy and just like I decided to try the the the uber minch sleep cycle yeah

399
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,740
where you sleep like you sleep 90 minutes every five hours yeah and yeah I was

400
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,860
like one of the worst weeks of my entire life I was like going I was so sleep

401
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,580

you should can teach them the flush yeah there's no he doesn't he doesn't poop in

405
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,380

406
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,380
that's gonna shovel it into his mouth Patrick comes back his poop all over his

407
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,820

Yeah, and then you were like, "These things can handle a sada."

485
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,880
I didn't get a sada, I got chicken.

486
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,200
side of there is like $9. I don't know. I think it's all the same. Chicken's like $8.

487
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,280
What are you talking about? It's not all the same price as Chipotle. It isn't but...

488
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:29,880
$7.50 for chicken, $7.50 for veggies, $8 for carnitas, $8.50 for steak, $8.50 for

489
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,960
barbacoa, $9.50 for carne asada. $9.50? Mm-hmm. That's too expensive. Yeah.

490
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,520
Yeah. Yeah. I got it like twice. It's pretty good though. It was good. Oh no,

491
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,360
it's $7.50 for sofritas too. What about the weirdest Chipotle flavors? Yeah.

492
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,200
Vanilla. Vanilla would be, any ice cream flavor would be a terrible Chipotle flavor.

493
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,120
But what if it's like a fried ice cream at Chipotle? What is that? And you get a churro.

494
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,760
What? I'm saying like like something you put on a rice bowl. Yeah. We can put ice

495
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:11,280
cream on the bowl. Ice cream does go in bowls I guess. Yeah, no rice. Yeah what about a rice

496
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,840
flavor of ice cream? I'm sure that exists in Japan. I've had it. Why would it exist in Japan?

497
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Probably in Taiwan. Yeah, why would it be in Japan? Yeah, why would they have it in Japan?

498

513
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,640
is like it's so just like something that you see so much that you're just like desensitized to it.

514
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,080
Yeah. You don't even really like that guy probably did never thought about that. He was just like

516
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
Yeah. The cat is on my hand.

517
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,840
No he doesn't. Caleb hit the cat. Stop hitting my cat. I'm not hitting him, I'm petting him.

518
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,600
Stop that. If I was hitting him he'd walk away.

519
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,200
He walked away. He just walked away because you were hitting him. I wasn't hitting him.

520
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,920
You were hitting him. You were absolutely hitting him. No. I don't hit cats. He's doing domestic abuse.

521
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,240
No. Yeah. And it's not even your own domestic, that's what's so fucked up about it. Yeah he just shit.

522
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah, of course he smells like shit.

523
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
Alright, weirdest ice cream flavors.

524
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,760
Number one, Horse Flesh.

525
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,840
That's pretty weird.

526
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,240
That's no different than bacon ice cream in my eyes.

527
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
That's like Taco Bell.

528
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,280
Yeah, Taco Bell actually has Horse Flesh ice cream.

529
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,400
Do they have ice cream there?

530
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,120
Uh, yeah, they do.

531
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
They should.

532
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,640
Yeah, they should have a horchata ice cream.

533
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
I'd eat that shit.

534
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
Yeah, Taco Bell horchata.

535
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,200
They should have horchata at Taco Bell.

536
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,560
They should have cheeseburgers at Taco Bell.

537
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
And pizza!

538
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,960
And video games!

539
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,680
oh my god and free drinks and a girlfriend yeah that you can rent out

542
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,040
mm-hmm if you want you should be able to hop behind the kitchen I can start

543
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,800
working the Taco Bell in downtown crossing 15 bucks an hour

544
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,400
for a baseline employee.

545
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Dude, I would pay them to be able to use that sour cream cock gun that they use.

546
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,680
That thing is fucking sick.

547
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm going to fill that with pee and use it into the toilet.

548
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,160
They shoot the beans and the cheese and the sour cream out of a fucking piping gun.

549
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,400
I wish I could go to Taco Bell right now.

550
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,520
You could.

551
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,320
I would say that's a huge danger zone right now.

552
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,320
go in a hazmat suit it's fine. I mean walking into a Taco Bell in a hazmat suit. Spray everything.

553
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,800
Yeah. Spray the person in front of you in their face like pepper spray. Yeah. The top comments.

554
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,920
You know we were making fun of that guy on the bus to New York but. That guy did deserve

555
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,040
to be made fun of. At that point in time yes. There was a guy dressed like he was in Fallout.

556
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,600
Yeah he was wearing like a gas mask. He was wearing a gas mask. There's no difference to

557
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,640
that versus just wearing like a mask. He's wearing a gas mask and a Kanye West

558
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,480
graduation hat. Yeah. No that guy absolutely deserved to be made fun of.

559
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:24,320
Yeah. He's one of our patrons. Yeah. Yeah. The number of top

560
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,200
comment on horse flesh is "Ew oh my god what would incline somebody so that they

561
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,440
would eat horse flesh?" Obviously some people can't spell or else they wouldn't

562
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,960
eat it. I'll tell you what would incline me. Ice cream. Yeah. I don't care what flavor it

563
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,960
is. As long as it's ice. As long as it's ice cream. I'm only eating horse flesh because

564
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,320
I can't spell. I thought this said delicious snack. Yeah, I thought it said horse. It was

565
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,960
a bucket full of just like red disgusting. I thought it said horchata. I thought it said

566
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,680
horse fresh. Yeah. And I was like, mmm, fresh. I thought it said candy. I just can't spell

567
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,360
at all. I don't even, I thought it was just a drawing. I thought it was a really bad drawing

568
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
that didn't look like anything, but it was words.

569
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,400
I just saw ice cream. I recognize ice cream.

570
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,840
With just little pieces of raw meat in it. I thought it said delicious, so I ate it.

571
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,240
I thought it said red delicious, apple flavored.

572
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,680
Somebody says, "What in the heck are the people putting in food now?"

573
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,080
Somebody says, "And this, my dear mortals," wait, Pat, reread this. This is your comment.

574
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,760
And this, my dear mortals, is when all hope of the human race regaining their dignity and sanity was lost.

575
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,320
That's what it was. It was saying horse, horse flesh.

576
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,480
We should have Lloyd on. I would love to have Lloyd on, dude.

577
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,980
Yeah.

578
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,960
Yeah?

579
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,800
Yeah, he's a man. He would, he's, he would, he definitely knows this website.

580
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,200
I would bet he's ranked in the Spongebob characters on here before or something.

581
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,420
Yeah.

582
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,040
You poor horsies.

583
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,560
Imagine this is someone's favorite ice cream dot dot dot.

584
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Yuck.

585
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,240
I'm getting so mad imagining this is someone's favorite ice cream.

586
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,340
This is your favorite ice cream?

587
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,920
What would the guy look like whose favorite ice cream this was?

588
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,440
Probably look exactly like Patrick.

589
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,280
Yeah, probably me with a hat.

590
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,360
Yeah, he's not wearing shoes at the ice cream place.

591
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,160
A cowboy hat.

592
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,960
It's Patrick with no shoes and a cowboy hat.

593
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
I think I'm going to pick up that.

594
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
We can make that happen.

595
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,680
I think we make that happen pretty quick. I'm gonna pick up a signature hat. I think

596
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm gonna shave my head and just have a SIG hat. Back away from me. Why?

597
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,040
Because you definitely have the virus. I don't. You've been coughing. So? You've been

598
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,360
coughing. I've been coughing because I've been quitting vaping. Okay that's... I don't

599
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,760
know. I still don't want you coughing around me. That's what I would make up to.

600
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,760
I just got a Bands in Town artist alert. Ariel Pink sent me a message. Patrick just

601
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,000
got an alert that he has the virus on his phone. His phone said we

602
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,760
detected your connection. Patrick will die from it. No. And we will live

603
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,060
and we will carry on. I don't think I'll die from it. I think you'll get, I think

604
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:11,680
you will lose your legs. That's just from the diabetes. Yeah but you'll go to the

605
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,980
hospital because of the virus and they'll say you have it but you're

606
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,320
probably gonna be fine but while you're here we should get rid of these. You do

607
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,660
have diabetes in your labor and you just have you you have giant swollen purple

608
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:30,880
like rescue hero legs and you're like no I don't have diabetes I think I don't

609
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,820
know how this person I think it might have been my mom's grandpa huh but he

610
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,920
did get his leg removed somebody in my family I don't know who it was someone

611
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,560
in my mom's side of the family got their leg removed and then every year at

612
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,380
Christmas, like after they passed away, they would fill up the leg, like the

613
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,360
plastic leg, they would fill it up with like Christmas wreaths and they

614
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,820
would make us take pictures with the leg. Oh my god. Holy shit dude. Yeah. I thought

615
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:08,380
you're gonna say they filled it up with eggnog. No. No there's pictures of me like

616

621
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,720

635
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,680
true. Doesn't matter what kind of food it is. That's why you have such stinky shit.

636
00:36:51,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Somebody comments on poop and says, "Now I can't stop laughing." And says, "What? Is

637
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,000
this an actual thing?" Yeah, I would again refer you to that episode of Nathan

638
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,240
Well that's frozen yogurt so that one doesn't have anything to do with this.

639
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,480
Yeah I guess you're right. Here's a weird ice cream flavor.

640
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,000
Well we got a...

641
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,800
What?

642
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,040
What is it?

643
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay well here's mine.

644
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,080
Yeah.

645
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,400
Okay.

646
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,200
Charlie bit my finger flavored.

647
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,120
Oh my god. So does it taste like...

648
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,440
It tastes like...

649
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,240
Charlie's finger.

650
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,520
No yeah it tastes exactly like Charlie's finger. Charlie's finger flavored ice cream.

651
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,080
Just like kind of salty. It has a booger on it.

652
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,480
Yeah.

653
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,040
Yeah.

654
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,680
Oh boogers.

655
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,120
And it makes you laugh.

656
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,400
No not Charlie's finger.

657
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,280
No boogers is...

658
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,120
So if boogers isn't on this list, this is a bad list.

659
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,320
The top comment here is another Patrick comment.

660
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,440
This is a comment Patrick left on his philosophy alt.

661
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,320
I don't know why any of these are on the weirdest ice cream flavors.

662
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,960
I find them to be quite tasteful, especially human flesh.

663
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,440
We got a badass freaking Hannibal Jekyll or Hector over here.

664
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,960
Alright, alright Anthony Cheslinick.

665
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,800
Hannibal Jekyll over here.

666
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,280
The dark philosopher.

667
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,840
I like this comment also what drugs you use when making this list poop dude what

673
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,560
That motherfucking movie. The part where they make Paula Abdul sit on a person.

674
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah. It's so funny.

675
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,640
It's true.

676
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,680
Yeah. Anyway.

677
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,200
You can watch-

678
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,600
Why are you cracking onto the microphone? What are you doing?

679
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm cracking my hand.

680
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,600
Why are you doing it on the microphone?

681
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,840
We got the electrical on. We're getting too much heat.

682
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,160
Yeah.

683
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,120
I just heard it in my headphones.

684
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,560
We're trying to kill my cats and shit.

685
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,600
We're trying to eat his cats. We're telling him that he sucks.

686
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,200
That's not even good.

687
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,840
What's not good?

688
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,560
I love my cats. You can't say that you're gonna eat them.

689
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,040
You love the cats.

690
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,400
I have said it so many times.

691
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
You can't say it.

692
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,960
What are you going to do?

693
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm going to get upset about it and then I'm not going to say anything and then I'm just

694
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,760
going to be upset every time that you say it.

695
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
About eating a cat?

696
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Yeah.

697
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
Okay.

698
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
That's fine with me.

699
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,480
Yeah, dude, if you say that I'll get so quietly mad at you.

700
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,800
If you say that I'll get upset and you'll never know.

701
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,360
You diabolical, you have a female brain, Pat.

702
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,000
Here's a comment from TrollsFan536.

703
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,800
says one time my brother said chocolate ice cream is poop. One time my brother said

704
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,380
chocolate ice cream is poop and I threw up. Do you guys think, do you guys subscribe to the idea

705
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,300
that two girls one cup it's just chocolate ice cream that they put up there?

706
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,680
You think it's real poop? No I saw the butt. Yeah but they shoot it up

707
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,600
there with like a piping bag. Nah. You don't think so? No. I think it is. It looked

708
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,320
like poop. He's right chocolate ice cream looks like poop. Chocolate ice cream

709
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,320
doesn't look at it I think it's too melty and no it's too green in that video to be

710
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,640
ice cream but I have never had a poop this man doesn't matter I ring in your

711
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,720
question is just whether it's real poop or not I don't think it has to be yeah

712
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,280
it could be icing or something I just mean I think that poop you like when I

713
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,960
poop I think that they when they went into that dust I mean closer to dust and

714
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,320
that shit when they went into that video there's no way that they could have

715
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,920
known exactly what okay maybe the poop was gonna look like maybe the because

716
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,780
sometimes I poop and it's like it's like a million little strings of crap you got

717
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,560
a problem you gotta go to the night you have a play-doh spaghetti yeah it's what

718
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,360
it looks like some Caleb yeah no cuz you have a thing of plastic stuck in your

719
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,440
butt

720
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,960
I have a triangle yeah shape poop sometime yeah he has a you got a salt

721
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,320
check your lid stuck in your asshole I don't know I just think I think that they

722
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,320
they had no idea what it was gonna come out like and it came out perfect I mean

723
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,040
that's a that's a picture-perfect poop nah yeah it looks good man good enough

724
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:13,800
to eat I will consider I will consider that they did poop into the cup and then

725
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,040
because there is a cut so I do think that maybe they pooped into the cut and

726
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,520
then changed it to ice cream they they examine the there's no one part where

727
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,200
she's opening up the asshole and licking the poop out.

728
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,520
- Okay, I forgot about that part.

729
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,360
- Yeah.

730
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,720
- So, no, it's definitely not ice cream.

731
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,080
- I think that you could,

732
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,520
I think I could recreate that video with zero poop.

733
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,360
- Do it.

734
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,180
- I think you could.

735
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,000
- That is the podcast about Liz challenge.

736
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,840
When you're in self-isolation.

737
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,600
- I'm gonna blast Patrick with an enema.

738
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,440
- No.

739
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,280
- Yeah, I'd blast Patrick with an enema.

740
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,800
- No, no, no, you said you would recreate it.

741
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,280
You gotta recreate it on your own, buddy.

742
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,760
- It's two girls!

743
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,600

744
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,420
- Yeah, it's two girls, it's perfect.

745
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,260
You guys can recreate it.

746
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,160
- You, me, and Patrick.

747
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,580

750
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,680
You can be in the video.

751
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
No.

752
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
It'll just be your ass, okay?

00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
They won't show your face.

754
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,200
It will just be your ass with a tattoo of your name on it.

755
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
I've got a hemorrhoid problem, I can't be in this video.

782
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
because your parents would comb in your mouth.

783
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
No, I went to a barber shop.

784
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
Beautiful hair.

785
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
Your dad would comb and he'd comb in your mouth.

786
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
No, he just couldn't have beautiful hair.

787
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,560
My dad taught me how to make a harmonica out of a comb and tissue paper.

788
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Oh yeah, me too man.

789
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
That's a classic.

790
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
That's a white trash classic move.

791
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,560
Actually, no, Gordon from Sesame Street taught me that.

792
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,560
I can't credit my dad for that.

793
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
That was like science fair for me.

794
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Yeah.

795
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
Yeah, my dad would just be like,

796
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,400
of like a bunch of things you can make with duct tape and I would just make like

797
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,360
wallets and shit yeah I had a duct tape wallet for a long time

798
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,720
my dad still makes duct tape wallets. They're sick dude.

799
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:41,880
Fucking, this boss. Lame. Dude I could make a trifold duct tape wallet. You'd make a triforce dude.

Yeah I can make a triforce duct tape. Yeah yeah no you couldn't no you

801
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,680

802
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,740
I'm not retarded. I would eat cotton candy all the time growing up and I would shit

803
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:07,180
blue shit and but then I would be like mom I think I think I'm an alien.

804
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:13,260
You ever have purple cow ice cream? Maybe. Stop making shit up. No it's a good flavor.

805
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,660
It's raspberry dark chocolate. Is that from Lizzie's or something? They have it at

806
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,220
different places I think it was like a Hershey's flavor yeah did you guys eat

807
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,300
because it's a really good you guys eat like hoodie cups growing up or whatever

808
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,820
the hoodsies yeah yeah we that's not a thing that we don't have hood milk yeah

809
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,780
that's like a local thing so weird everybody's brands are yeah yeah aren't

00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,700
brand yeah that's true like we have like oakhurst and hood yeah yeah

811
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,420
okhurst weirds me out because they put an acorn on there and that should not be

812
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,700
be on normal milk. You should only put it on nut milks. Acorn milk. Exactly.

813
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,700
Acorn milk you can milk it like a nipple though. Yeah. It looks like a

814
00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:00,940
breast. Yeah it does look like a humongous breast. A big wooden breast that a pirate woman would have.

815
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:08,420
A pirate woman with two giant acorn breasts. Yeah. Oh my gosh she's so beautiful.

816
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,620
A comment on Viagra says I fell out of my chair and died of laughter thinking

817
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:17,820
about Viagra ice cream. Yeah and then he landed on his rock-hard penis. Yeah and snapped it

818
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:24,500
in half. Yeah. Who is this? Xolthar? From Big. Xerathor. What are you saying? Says tastes

819
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:30,500
good. Xerathor. Number four is blood. That disgusts me. The very thought of this makes

820
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,320
me want to brush my pants. This run of four comments is really good. I kind of want to

821
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,440
try this for a weird reason. When I was a kid I tried my blood one day and I kind of

822
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,740
I found out what vampires like about it and the last one I like blood and I'm

823
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,660

You ever do you have a vampire kid at your school? Absolutely yeah, yeah, man,

Jeffrey D. Marry D. Mar. So is this vampires favorite ice cream flavor and

828
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,680

And that's facts, B.

850
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,780
The next one is cabbage.

851
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,180
Cabbage flavored, I'd eat it.

852
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,180
I love cabbage.

853
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,180
I love cabbage.

854
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,180
Cabbage is pretty good.

855
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,380
I like that cabbage, when you leave it out, it smells like shit.

856
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,380
That is so fun.

857
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,460
It's such a funny vegetable.

858
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,500
Vegetables have various, like onions, they have the stick.

859
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Oh, kale?

860
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Kale smells like a dumpster.

861
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
Yeah.

862
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,460
You leave kale out, it smells like that dumpster out there.

863
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,540
From what I understand, that's like a defense mechanism that they have when they're being

864
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,040
like, like that's why onions make you cry.

865
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,460
Well, that's because you're breaking the cells.

866
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,040
Yeah, but it's like part of, it's that, it developed as like basically a defense mechanism.

867
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,340
That's why you have to cut it while it's attached like the root part.

868
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,780
And like cabbage, if it starts to get too warm or whatever, it just starts to smell

869
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,780
like dog shit.

870
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,140
Yeah, it's like Irish people boil it.

871
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,140
Yeah.

872
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,140
Because they love the smell.

873
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,780
Because they love that smell, dude.

874
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:51,300
Every corned beef and cabbage though, that's a combo that can't be beat.

875
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,300
You're so stupid.

876
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,300
We're talking about ice cream.

877
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:58,380
Did you guys get every ice cream place nearby emailed me and said, "We now have e-gift cards."

878
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,380
Like the exact same email.

879
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,380
What?

880
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,380
Why do you have so many ice cream places?

881
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,380
I don't know.

882
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,380
Why do they have your email?

883
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,380
I don't know.

884
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,860
It was like two or three, I think.

885
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,860
But it was like the same global ice cream.

886
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,180
You signed up for the Global Ice Cream Registry.

887
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,060
It was so weird because I don't know how.

888
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,940
Oh, you know, I bet I logged onto their Wi-Fi before.

889
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,940
That's probably what it is.

890
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,940
Oh.

891
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,220
- No, no, you were at an ice cream shop long enough

892
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,620
that you logged onto their wifi?

893
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,460
- Yeah.

894
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,780
- Cameron went to ice cream--

895
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,860
- You a baby for real, bro.

896
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,460
- Cameron went to icecream.com and put in his email.

897
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,780
(laughing)

898
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,380
- Stay up to date on the newest flavors.

899
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,220
- Cameron went to Moose Tracks.

900
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,420
- I like the newest flavors.

901
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,940
- MooseTracks.org.

902
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,780
- Yeah.

903
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,040
- Because he wanted to find out all the places

904
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,880
that had Moose Tracks.

905
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,420
Is that a local ice cream?

906
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,380
- Moose Tracks, I think that's a thing.

907
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,860
- No, I think that's just a flavor of ice cream.

908
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,700
- Yeah, no, that's like--

909
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,540
- I thought that was local to like New England.

910
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,420
or I thought it was like a New Hampshire flavor

911
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,040
'cause of all the mousse.

912
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,900
- No, I think it's just a thing.

913
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,380
- What about chocolate?

914
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,500
- Yeah, chocolate's a Texas thing.

915
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,340
- Yeah.

916
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,540
- No.

917
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,640
- What about Rocky Road?

918
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,940
That's only from that one Rocky Road.

919
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,140
- Okay, I feel like Rocky Road is what people,

920
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,980
like I thought for a long time

921
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,780
that Rocky Road was like a West Coast version of Moose Tracks.

922
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,340
- No, two different ice creams.

923
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,180
- Really?

924
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,020
What's in Rocky Road?

925
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,100
- Rocky Road is, wait, what's Moose Tracks?

926
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,740
Moose tracks is like peanut butter and like chocolate. Yeah, no, rocky road is like

927
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,700
chocolate ice cream with like vanilla like almost like

928
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,900
Like cream stuff in it and then like pecans or something filled with cream

929
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:34,560
It's like a there's a nut in it you pump cream into only knew about rocky road because of the weird out song

930
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,460
Is an owl so there's an owl song

931
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:44,820
Wait, I want to get to the next one is really good. I want to get to it. Next number six is breast milk

933
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,180
- Well yeah, the comments say,

934
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,620
this flavor actually exists.

935
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,380
I would love to try this one day.

936
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,820
(laughing)

937
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,380
- From what I understand, it tastes like stinky shit.

938
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,300
- I really like this comment that says,

939
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,140
"What?

940
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,040
"That's crazy.

941
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,300
"The only people who like it is babies."

942
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,460
(laughing)

943
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,780
- Babies is capitalized.

944
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,620
- Yeah, and spelled B-A-B-Y-S.

945
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,460
- Babies.

946
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,260
- I wonder what breast milk tastes like.

947
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,900
I almost tasted it before.

948
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,020
- No, you tasted it before,

949
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,520

950
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:21,520
my friend tried it on france

951
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,940
at a state fair in wisconsin come get your ice cream made from breast milk from our

952
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,000
cows turns out he was saying fresh milk

953
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,720
i do understand that there is

954
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:35,840
that they do sell breast milk and breast milk ice cream i just wonder

955
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,860
how it is harvested and like how much of these women being paid is it like a

956
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,080
donation thing i think maybe they're making it

957
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,280
for their baby

958
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,680
no but yeah but what is the process like do they like put their their hat on from

959
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,560
the walk out the door with a suitcase and walk into like a factory and get

960
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:02,200
plugged up like a cow no they put their boob in the freezer they put they put

961
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,720
their boob and there's two holes cut into the freezer and they just have to

962
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,320
go and stand in it for a while in it for like an hour and then it freezes all the

963
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,200
breast milk and then they just kind of squish it like they squish it out like a

964
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:17,320
soft-serve machine. That's not a bad idea. Again it's a small hole so you got to

965
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,720
wait a long time. Yeah it takes so long. Half of it's already melted by the

966
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,400
time you're done. Yeah see I just don't I just am interested in the logistics of

967
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,280
oh my god Vice should do a video about that. Yeah. That would crush. It's like I'll do it.

968
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,160
These women are changing the breast milk ice cream industry. You know what if somebody has to be the

969
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:43,160
journalist who goes around to all the breast milk places and watches, I'll do it.

970
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:48,160
No you won't. I'll go and I'll watch all the breasts. No you won't. Yeah I will. All the hot

971
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,760
mommies. That's what's so hot about a pregnant woman is it's like a third boob.

972
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:01,280
It's like a third giant boob. A third boob with a guy in it. Oh my god. The only thing better than a

973
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,320
normal boob without a guy is a third one with no nipple and a hole instead and a

974
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:11,320
guy's inside yeah yeah guys inside the other ones and we just didn't know

975
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:16,480
little guys oh my god and when you and breast milk is there this is something

976
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,680
for their come and it's two milkmen yeah and they're pouring out a glass they're

977
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,400
pouring their come out of a glass into the tip it's not even come it's just no

978
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,200
it is man it's milk they get from the milkman factory how does it get into the

979
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,240
So yeah, how does it get into the girl?

980
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
Think about it.

981
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,920
When you make milk, the girls make milk because the guy made milk into the girl.

982
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,920
No, they get a shipment.

983
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,920
The same milk comes up and out of the breast.

984
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,000
They get a shipment every week from the magic school bus, which goes inside of the girls.

985
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,300
Which drops off the milkman, yeah, and he pours the milk out into the kid.

986
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,520
We have come up with one of what could be...

987
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,660
This is the system.

988
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,880
This could be a great Disney ride.

989
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,880
This would be the great system.

990
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,520
This is the new Pixar movie.

991
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,520
Yeah.

992
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,320
John Lasseter, you weird pervert. I know you want to jump on this right away.

993
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,840
Yeah, I would like to go into the Magic School Bus. Actually, I want to go into a cool Magic

994
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:15,280
School Bus style Ferrari and go and check out Ms. Frizzle's flaps down there. You know what

995
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,480
I mean? I want to drive around them like a Formula One track just over and over again,

996
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,280
you know? And then I want to get air on her giant clit.

997
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:32,440
I want to jump it like the Grand Canyon. I want to jump her pussy like the Grand Canyon

998
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,840
in the Magic School Bus.

999
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Do a flip.

1000
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Yeah.

1001
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,560
Oh no, I fell in. Oh no.

1002
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,520
You have to get me with your fingers. If you can catch me.

1003
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,720
And then I'm running around her vagina as she tries to catch me with her pinky.

1004
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
Yeah, that's disgusting.

1005
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,280
And she kills you by accident.

1006
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,560
Yeah, and that kid, I'm Arnold right now.

1007
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
That's who I am.

1008
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
You're what, the one who isn't fun?

1009
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
You are home, dude.

1010
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,560
I'm the lizard.

1011
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,880
Arnold says we should have stayed home today.

1012
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,880
You are home.

1013
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,880
You can't be Arnold.

1014
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,880
Pick a different one.

1015
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,880
Be seen.

1016
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,880
Patrick is Carlos.

1017
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,880
Mencia.

1018
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,880
Yeah.

1019
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,880
Do-da-da.

1020
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,880
Remember that, when he would say that?

1021
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,880
Do-da-da.

1022
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,880
He would say do-da-da.

1023
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,880
Do-da-da.

1024
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,880
Remember the do-da-da song?

1025
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,320
Oh, I remember every single case.

1026
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,160
If you are a D, please don't marry a D. Follow the genetics and you'll see.

1027
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,840
kids will be D to D's. Oh my god what a genius dude. That's so smart. Yeah he's

1028
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,760
smart he's a smart guy dude. Yeah. Carlos Mencil. Yeah he's so smart he his brain

1029
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,120
just couldn't think. What was his real name like Chuck? His name was Ned Arnell.

1030
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:45,320
Ned Arnell. Whoa. Ned. That's awesome. I know I know so much about Carlos Mencil. He was my favorite comedian when I was 9.

1031
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:50,240
The video where Joe Rogan goes on stage at the Comedy Store. That video broke my heart. He's so funny. That video broke my

1032
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,160
- Have you seen that? - When I was 11 years old?

1033
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,360
- Carlos Mencia was on stage and Joe Rogan,

1034
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,040
in the middle of a show at the Comedy Store,

1035
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,240
goes on stage because Carlos stole the joke.

1036
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,160
And he's like, "You stole this joke!

1037
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,020
"Like you stole this joke from a guy in the audience

1038
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,860
"right over there!"

1039
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,400
And Carlos is just like, "You're a loser, man!

1040
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,880
"Everybody in the audience loves me, bro!"

1041
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,480
And then like two weeks later his show got canceled.

1042
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,320
- Yeah.

1043
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,140
- Dude, that video--

1044
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,640
- I remember the radio interview thing where he steals,

1045
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,600
he, you know what I'm talking about?

1046
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,600
the Bill Cosby bit? No, I don't know.

1047
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
Oh no, that was in a WTF episode?

1048
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
Where he like makes everything up?

1049
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,600
No, there's a video where he calls into something

1050
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
and he says a joke

1051
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
and then he hangs up and the person

1052
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
on the radio show or whatever is like, "That was my joke."

1053
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,600
[laughter]

1054
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Maybe it wasn't Carl, there was some joke

1055
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
one some joke stealing comedian who did that.

1056
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
I'm pretty sure it was him. His episode of WTF

1057
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
he goes on the first episode

1058
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
and just tells like a bunch of lies

1059
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,600
about like not stealing jokes

1060
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:53,400
because Mark Maron asked him about it and then Mark Maron released another

1061
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,520
episode like a week later that was like the guy who used to open for Carlos

1062
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,360
Mencia who there and they just talked the entire time about how he's like a

1063
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,480
pathological liar yeah and just like can't tell the truth and like is this

1064
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,640
stole like jokes from him the entire time he was opening for him and then

1065
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:15,000
Carlos Mencia comes on again and he's like yeah man I stole all the jokes it's
