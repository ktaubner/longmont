1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey guys, it's Cameron.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,360
So Patrick and Caleb are away this weekend and I guess that means that it's time for

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,520
me to do a solo episode.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,280
And I wasn't really sure what to do with this.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,920
I was thinking about it a lot and then I realized that I actually had some old stuff recorded

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,880
that I might be able to put out now.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:41,160
During 2021, I actually was keeping kind of an audio diary where I would record an audio

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,880
entry of what I did that day every few days.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,160
And I got a good amount of those lined up and kept in a folder on my computer.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,940
So I thought maybe now that the oppression of Patrick and Caleb is gone from my life

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,800
for a short period of time, I could just put some of those out and who knows if they'll

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
even be interesting.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,880
But anyway, here it goes.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,440
Cameron's Diary.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,400
January 1st.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
Wow.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,920
A brand new year.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,720
fresh new blank parchment for me to scrawl my beautiful life upon.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,880
The entirety of 2021 is before me and I for one could not be happier.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:43,160
2020 was a bit weird as I'm sure that you are aware but I'm ready to take control and

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,160
make 2021 the best year ever.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,760
But to do that, I'm going to have to make some beautiful New Year's resolutions, and I think

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,920
that my very first resolution will be to start an audio diary.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,080
Look at that.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,640
Number one, done.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Perfect.

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,200
This is really easy.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,760
Number two resolution is going to be a little bit harder for me to achieve.

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,440
Resolution number two is stop declaring war on people.

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,200
I need to learn to deal with my feelings in a mature way, and if I'm angry at the cashier

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,240
at the store or my mailman or a member of my family, I need to stop writing declarations

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:33,720
of war and presenting them to them and telling them that I'm going to destroy them.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,540
Resolution #3, which is one that I failed in 2020 and am thus trying again in 2021, is

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,660
to keep it real.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,960
And Resolution #4, my fourth and final resolution, will be to live my life to the fullest.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm going to take as many vacations as I can, I'm going to eat as much delicious food as

37
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:01,300
I can, and I am not going to let anything stop me from enjoying my life and living dangerously

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,900
like an action movie star.

39
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,020
January 6th.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,500
Well, it seems like my resolutions aren't going well because my first vacation was a complete

41
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,260
bust.

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,860
I took the absolute worst guided tour of the Capitol building today.

43
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,180
It was a complete farce.

44
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,980
There was people running everywhere.

45
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,740
I don't know how they expected us to hear a single detail of the information.

46
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,800
I think a person even fell asleep at one point during the tour because of the lack of information

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,620
that was being taught.

48
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,860
And in addition to that, when I tried to ask for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's autograph,

49
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,860
she maced me in the eyes and I had to write her name down in my bitch book, which is a

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,940
list of everybody in the world that I think is bitches.

51
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,380
But because I had freaking mace in my eyes, I couldn't write well and I accidentally wrote

52
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,260
down Alito Ocoxoconus, which isn't even a real person, so now my bitch book is ruined

53
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,020
and I had to throw it in the trash.

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,740
January 10th.

55
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,740
Resolution number 4 is still giving me a lot of trouble.

56
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,980
I was trying to live dangerously and I ate 5 full bags of county fair caramel corn and

57
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:29,020
And I am suffering my first tummy ache of the year and folks it's really, really, really

58
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,580
bad and I'm thinking that I might just want to have three resolutions this year at this

59
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
point.

60
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,280
But I'm not the kind of guy who gives up on resolutions and I think that to remove resolution

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,460
four would also be a violation of resolution three at keeping it real.

62
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,620
So I'm going to persist forward and probably try to eat another bag of County Fair caramel

63
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,540
corn tonight.

64
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,700
january fifteenth uh... squirrel

65
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,120
got into the house today i think through the window i leave open in case fairies

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,020
are real and i had a hell of a time

67
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,520
trying to hunt that bugger down uh... i was trying to find my pellet gun

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,720
to shoot at it uh... but unfortunately i couldn't find a gun and could only find

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,820
the pellets

70
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,340
so is running around my living room when i was

71
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,440
throwing pellets at it with my hands 'cause i gotta say i got a pretty

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,580
mean fastball and and

73
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,140
little league as a kid so i i i have to imagine that throwing pellets would

74
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,980
would be similar turns out it wasn't at all the pellets were bouncing everywhere

75
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,340
and i ended up throwing a

76
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,140
throwing out so many of them that

77
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,020
when i gave up and tried to walk to the kitchen to pour myself a drink of water

78
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,140
i slipped and my head went through the coffee table and i was stuck upside down

79
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,100
in that position for about three hours

80
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,300
uh... i couldn't find the squirrel so i have to assume that it went back out

81
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,180
probably through the window in the basement that I leave open in case gnomes are real.

82
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
January 27th.

83
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,460
After about a week of looking I finally found my pellet gun but I used up all the pellets

84
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,300
by throwing them at that squirrel.

85
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,180
So it's pretty much useless to me now.

86
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,180
I was walking out back to throw out the pellet gun and the recycling, I assume it's gotta

87
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,580
be recyclable, when I thought about how strange it would look to my neighbors if they saw me

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,460
throwing away a gun in the bin behind my house.

89
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,240
So I thought better of it and brought the gun back inside and put it under one of my couch

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,300
cushions in case any more pellets crossed my path.

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,540
But then I was thinking about how it must have looked even stranger if any neighbors

92
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:39,140
were looking at me to see me carrying a gun out to the recycling bin and then decide not

93
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,600
to throw it out and bring it back inside.

94
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,940
So I dialed up my neighbors one by one on the phone and told them all that if they saw me

95
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,760
doing anything today they were dreaming.

96
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,000
February 3rd.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,480
Well, I'm not happy to report that today I did break my second resolution of no more

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,440
declaring wars on people.

99
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,280
Yes, my mailman did that thing I hate again of when he drops the lid of the mailbox very

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,560
loudly after he puts the envelopes into it, and I just about lost my shit and I pulled

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,240
out a piece of printer paper and a sharpie and I wrote "Declaration of War" and then

102
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,260
a bunch of squiggles that looked like fine print and I marched my ass outside and I handed

103
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,160
him that sheet of paper and told him I was declaring war on him and he said "Again?"

104
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
and I said "Yes, again."

105
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,100
And he said "I thought you said you were turning over a new leaf."

106
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,440
And I said "Well I was but I turned it back over the other way."

107
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,000
And he said "I know by now that this whole war thing is a fluke, you're just a freak.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,760
not actually gonna declare any real kind of war on me and I said just you wait mister

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,920
and I went back inside and I got the pellet gun and I showed it to him and I said this

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,780
is my war gun I'm a soldier of war and I don't think he liked that very much because he pretty

111
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,320
much just left without saying anything.

112
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,200
I really think I should have recycled that pellet gun when I originally meant to so I

113
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,880
might do that tomorrow.

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
February 10th.

115
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,640
Well, a few days ago I went to put the pellet gun in the recycling bin and then I thought

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,920
about how strange it would look if the neighbors saw me throwing it away.

117
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,880
So I brought it back inside and put it under the couch cushion.

118
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,360
But then I thought about how strange it would be for the neighbors to see me try to throw

119
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,320
it away and then think better of it and bring it back inside.

120
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,960
So I was about to call my neighbors and explain that they were dreaming when I realized that

121
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,580
I had already done all this before and forgotten.

122
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,300
So instead I spent a few days practicing pellet gun tricks like spinning it around and shooting

123
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,020
it out of my sleeve like Travis the Pickle does in one of my favorite movies Taxi Driver.

124
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,180
And I think I'm pretty much ready for if the mailman ever decides to deliver mail here

125
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,180
again.

126
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,020
I'm gonna scare the shit out of him and I have the perfect plan.

127
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,580
February 14th.

128
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,540
Well, the mailman took my gun.

129
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,900
Here's how it happened.

130
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,700
Basically I had a plan where I knew that the mailman would have to come to my house today

131
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,540
because it's February 14th, Valentine's Day, and I always get a really thoughtful Valentine's

132
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,380
card from Stinky Steve, the prison inmate I used to be pen pals with a few years ago.

133
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,500
He always writes the nicest things and he puts it in a cute little card, the kind that

134
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,580
plays a song when you open it.

135
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:42,580
and the year before that he got one of those cards where you can record your own audio message

136
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,580
and he sang an original song of his own composition called "I Hate Being In Jail"

137
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,580
anyway when I saw the mailman walking up with a bright hot pink envelope I knew it was my time to shine

138
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,580
I ran outside holding the pellet gun loaded with frozen peas of course

139
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,260
and I pointed it directly at his forehead and I said

140
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,460
"Do you feel lucky mailman? Go ahead, give me my mail

141
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,220
and make my day too." And he just pretty much took away the gun

142
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,860
he said he knew it was fake all along and that if it wasn't I would be in

143
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,500
big big trouble and me and Stinky Steve would be having a different kind of

144
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,820
Valentine's Day together

145
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,980
and I didn't know what that meant but I thought that was really nice

146
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,580
so we hugged it out and I think I'm going back to my no more war resolution

147
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,500
because hugging my mailman is a lot nicer than brandishing a gun at him.

148
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,380
At least until he bangs the lid of the mailbox too loud again.

149
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,460
February 28th. Met a really cool guy at the grocery store today.

150
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,380
He was wearing a bright red double-breasted suit and had extremely

151
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,180
pronounced canine teeth.

152
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,380
He approached me after the checkout person turned me away for being five

153
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,420
dollars short on my groceries.

154
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,820
They said I was taking too long to decide which cereal box to put back so I had to

155
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,260
put everything back.

156
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,100
I think that's fucking bullshit!

157
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,020
But anyway, this guy came up to me and he said he noticed my predicament and he could spot

158
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,340
me the five dollars.

159
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,780
I said, "Sure, what's the catch?"

160
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,900
He said, "No catch," and smiled in a really big and cool way.

161
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,160
Then he took out a giant scroll and a quill and he asked me to sign my full name on it.

162
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,740
He said all I had to do was pay him back the five dollars by the end of the month or I

163
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,060
I would owe him my soul or something like that.

164
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,580
I'm not sure if he said soul or something else.

165
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
Can't remember.

166
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:39,140
Anyway, I knew I had about 3 days to scrounge up the $5 to pay this guy back, so I smiled

167
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,740
and nodded and I wrote my name down on the dotted line.

168
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,700
The man licked his lips and handed me a $5 bill that was red instead of green, and then

169
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,980
I think he vanished in a giant puff of smoke, though it could have been a trick of the fluorescent

170
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,700
lighting or a highly developed special effect.

171
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,980
With the $5 bill in hand, I was ready to buy all my groceries.

172
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,700
It hadn't really mattered that much to me that I couldn't afford the groceries since

173
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,940
it was just cereal, but the extra $5 was worth it to see how angry the checkout cashier looked

174
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,300
when she saw me get back in line.

175
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,780
2021 is shaping up to be low-key dope AF.

176
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:25,420
March 5th, been feeling strangely empty lately.

177
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,020
March 14th, today is pie day.

178
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,980
I don't go in for all that math shit, so to me, today is a food holiday.

179
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,220
I decided to celebrate by going out to one of my favorite restaurants for dessert.

180
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,980
Once I was seated, I could tell the waiter was giving me the stink eye, probably because

181
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,140
I hadn't showered in a while and I smelled pretty stink eye.

182
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,800
I said "hey man, what the hell are you looking at?" and then called him "Bub" which is one

183
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,140
of the most cutting insults you can call a grown man.

184
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:03,180
Well, one thing led to another and I soon found myself not eating pie like I had wanted

185
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,540
but instead washing dishes in the back of the restaurant.

186
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,540
Not because I owed money for a meal or anything, but just because I felt really bad for calling

187
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,340
the waiter "Bub".

188
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,940
March 17th, that's right baby, it's St. Patrick's Day.

189
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,220
And I'm recording this one in the morning because you know what happens during the day

190
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,460
and night of St. Patrick's Day.

191
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,140
That's right, I shouldn't even have to say it.

192
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,500
Tonight for St. Patrick's Day I'm heading out and I'm drinking myself so silly that

193
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,580
I can't walk, speak, or breathe unassisted.

194
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,160
But we all know what goes down before you head to the bar on St. Patty's Day.

195
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,640
That's right, you gotta pregame, baby.

196
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,020
And I love to pregame before going to the bar by drinking a bunch of beers at my house.

197
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,460
But I also like to do my own special thing, where before the pregame, I will pregame that

198
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,940
by eating lots of pretzels to make sure that I have food in my stomach before I drink a

199
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,260
lot of beers.

200
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,380
The issue with that is that pretzels can often dry me out.

201
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:09,900
So I like to pregame my pretzel pregame by drinking a whole lot of water, also at my

202
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
house.

203
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,180
But, the thing about the water pregame is I usually like to add a little postgame after

204
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,600
the water pregame but before the pretzel pregame where I go to the bathroom because the water

205
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,420
makes me need to pee really bad.

206
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,860
The order of all the pregames can be very confusing.

207
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,580
Sometimes I'll accidentally do pretzel pee water or beer water pee pretzel or pretzel

208
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,940
pretzel pretzel and it's very difficult to get it all right before I head out to the

209
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,580
the bar and that's why a few years ago I hired those contractors to come in and paint a big

210
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:50,580
flow chart on the wall of my bedroom that I get to use once a year and today's finally

211
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,860
the exciting day I get to look at it.

212
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,500
That's just the magic of old Saint Patty.

213
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,220
March 20th, today's the Vernal Equinox so in the spirit of the pagans I sacrificed a

214
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,900
few Hershey bars to my stomach.

215
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Yum!

216
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:13,060
I also took a nice walk and ate several other pieces of good food as well.

217
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,040
It's lucky that the length of day and night are exactly equal today because I had such

218
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,800
a great day that I'd like to just dream it all over again tonight and if the night were

219
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,940
any shorter or longer it would fit unevenly into my dream.

220
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
March 26th.

221
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,060
Saw some kind of specter last night.

222
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,480
It was billowing down the street outside of my bedroom window and it looked exactly like

223
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,420
a grocery bag, but I knew better.

224
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,420
I was terrified and quaking under my covers, but then I remembered my resolutions and decided

225
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,660
to take life by the horns, so I went to call the police, but unfortunately I realized I

226
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,900
could only remember the first three numbers of the police's phone number.

227
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,780
912.

228
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:05,880
In such a scary situation, my forgetfulness shook me to my core, so I decided I need to

229
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,140
study up.

230
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,140
I put on my jacket and walked all the way to the library.

231
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,460
It was then that I realized it was 1am and the library was closed.

232
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,640
However would I get in and study their phone books?

233
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,140
I started to break in, but then the police pulled up.

234
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:28,060
I told them I saw a specter and they were kind enough to take me home for a small fee

235
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,340
of two hundred and fifty dollars

236
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,160
man i'd love the police

237
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,040
april first

238
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,780

had you going pretty good there didn't i future self listening back to these

251
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,100
entries

252
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,840
april fourth

253
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,040
easter

254
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,640
time to dig my costume out of the closet

255
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,640
for my annual gig as Easter Bunny who gets tied to a chair by archetypal father figure

256
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,760
character. I'm not exactly sure why they want me to do this every year, but the kids at

257
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,640
the institute for manipulating the mentally disturbed into serial killers sure seem to

258
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,760
enjoy the show. Big paycheck, 20 bucks.

259
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,700
April 11th, stepped on a banana peel today, went flying and got some insane air, grazed

260
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,520
my knees on the concrete too.

261
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,700
When I stood up, in front of me, there was another banana peel, but next to it, there

262
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,160
was also an orange peel.

263
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,300
Confronted with this Matrix Morpheus style choice, I realized that I didn't want to go

264
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:17,480
flying through the air again, so I took a big step forward onto the orange peel.

265
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,200
Turns out, orange peels are about 100 times as slippery as banana peels.

266
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,920
I skidded for about a mile before I came to a stop.

267
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,620
You wouldn't think an orange peel would be slippery because they don't show it in cartoons

268
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,280
like they do with bananas, but apparently when you step on it, you just go crazy.

269
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,440
I puzzled about the philosophy of my choice for a while, because it seemed to be between

270
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,360
stepping on a banana peel and going flying and grazing my knees, or stepping on an orange

271
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,220
peel and skidding a mile forward.

272
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,940
I couldn't figure out which one I had been supposed to choose, but then I realized, the

273
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,660
correct choice was to just stand there and never take a step again.

274
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,920
The only winning move is not to play.

275
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,900
April 22nd, apparently today is Earth Day.

276
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,700
Uh, isn't every day Earth Day?

277
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,320
Shat my pants today and everyone could smell.

278
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,600
April 30th, the end of an era.

279
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,280
What era you ask?

280
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
April.

281
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,160
Can't wait for May, very excited for 4/20.

282
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,560
Just counted the months in my head and realized I missed 4/20.

283
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Guess I'll be smoking a bunch of weed on 5/20 for the 17th year in a row.

284
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,920
May 4th, made an unpleasant discovery today.

285
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Turns out today on Star Wars Day, people say, "May the 4th be with you."

286
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,760
I always thought they were saying, "May the Force be with you," like from Star Wars, and

287
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,640
I thought today's date was called May 4th, but it turns out it's actually called May

288
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
4th.

289
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,680
I guess that makes sense because I can't think of another month that has a 4th, but I do

290
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,060
think today should be called May 4th because otherwise the quote doesn't make any sense.

291
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:13,540
So I've decided to write to my local representative in government, whoever that may be, to change

292
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,500
the name of today's date to May 4th.

293
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,300
I am taking out my ballpoint pen and I am writing a letter on my finest stationery.

294
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,540
A sticky note with a drawing of a stick figure getting fucked in the bottom right corner

295
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,380
from an old flipbook I made last week.

296
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,660
May 5th.

297
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,700
The disappointing revelations just keep coming.

298
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,500
Turns out, today is called May 5th, not Cinco de Mayo.

299
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,980
I wrote another letter to my representative on another sticky note, and then I wrote about

300
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,220
a hundred more letters, cause I really wanted to get to the bottom of the stack of sticky

301
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,820
notes and see the stick figure in the flip book climaxing.

302
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,380
May 9th.

303
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,860
Today is Mother's Day.

304
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,500
I went to the grocery store and I bought a really nice bouquet of flowers, and I put

305
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,740
it on the windowsill in my kitchen.

306
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,500
Then I took a picture of it and sent it to my mom, and also sent her a request to play

307
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,740
C battle over iMessage.

308
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,900
I hope she likes it.

309
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,500
May 20th.

310
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:24,060
Today is my back up 4/20 day that I always use to smoke weed when I forget about 4/20.

311
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,500
And man, I am hella high right now.

312
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,460
I can't stop thinking about some crazy ass weed shit.

313
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,740
For example, something I decided about a minute ago was what if a table had three legs.

314
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,920
I was laughing my ass off at how random and weird that thought was.

315
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,860
Then I thought about what if a chair had three legs.

316
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,900
I freaked out and I was slapping my knee from laughing so hard from being so high.

317
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,340
Then I thought about what if a table had two legs and if a chair also had two legs.

318
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,940
I was laughing so hard I damn near peed myself.

319
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,880
Then I did pee myself cause I couldn't stop laughing thinking about a chair and table

320
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,600
with two legs each.

321
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,120
Then I had a crazy ass high thought.

322
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,980
What if a table had two legs and a chair also had two legs and you combine them together

323
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,000
and it kinda made a really long chair with four legs.

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,260
That scared me.

325
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,240
There would be no more laughs today because I had a giant panic attack.

326
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,100
May 24th.

327
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,780
I was craving some freakin' coffee this morning,

328
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,640
so I headed to Starbucks,

329
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,160
where I witnessed a master at work.

330
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,040
I was waiting to get my drink,

331
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,240
and this guy headed up to the register to order.

332
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,640
He ordered just a plain tap water,

333
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,600
and when they asked him his name,

334
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,820
he pulled out his iPad and showed them a webpage

335
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,980
called List of Every Name.

336
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,500
After that, he just walked over to the pickup counter

337
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,280
took every drink and put them in a big garbage bag.

338
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,780
He stood there for like 15 minutes and kept doing it.

339
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,380
Every drink that would get made and put on the counter, he'd pick it up and put it in

340
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,700
his garbage bag.

341
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,700
And there was nothing anybody could do about it, because they all had his name on it.

342
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,840
After he had been doing this for a while, he took the bag outside to the parking lot

343
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,480
and unlocked his car.

344
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,180
He popped the trunk and took out a giant straw.

345
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,140
Then he started drinking all the drinks out of the bag with the giant straw.

346
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,780
I bet it tasted disgusting, but the sweet taste of a con well pulled had to have overpowered

347
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
that.

348
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,700
I saw the manager of the Starbucks print out a picture of him and put it up behind the

349
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,460
counter so they knew to keep him out of the place.

350
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,300
Man, I'd love to have my picture up in that hall of fame behind the counter someday.

351
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,780
Right between Aaron "Through" Zydarius the garbage bag genius and Marvin the bathroom

352
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,540
masturbator.

353
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,740
June 1st, it sure is starting to get warm outside.

354
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,460
I sweat through my shorts and then I sweat through my underpants.

355
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,860
Then I realized I was wearing my underpants outside of my shorts.

356
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,100
I can't believe I was doing this all year and nobody said anything to me.

357
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,000
June 7th, was out walking around the mall parking lot picking grass out of the parking

358
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,680
lot islands and throwing it in people's hair all day when I got really thirsty.

359
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,640
I headed to the vending machine to score a cool bottle of water when I realized I hadn't

360
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
brought my coins with me.

361
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
Drew up a plan for how to steal a bottle of water from the vending machine on the back

362
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,680
of a bald guy's head and then he turned out to be a mannequin.

363
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:40,560
So the first step of my plan, defend self from angry bald guy, was unneeded.

364
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,960
to the vending machine to enact my plan. I figured it must detect quarters on a weight

365
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,840
based system. So I reached into my pocket and pulled out enough sand to roughly equal the

366
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,400
weight of a quarter. Started funneling the sand into the coin slot of the vending machine,

367
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,320
but nothing happened except for the people behind me in line getting very very angry.

368
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,620
Turns out I should not have crossed out the first step of my plan after all. A very thirsty

369
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,140
The bald guy hit me with his belt.

370
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,860
June somethingth.

371
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,980
Forgot what day it is today.

372
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,900
Gonna have to get back to you on this one.

373
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,660
June 24th.

374
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,820
The last entry was on June 15th.

375
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:31,500
Well, anyway, I was looking out the window today and I saw a bunch of kids playing outside.

376
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,840
It reminded me of my childhood.

377
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,540
My favorite game to play with my friends was hide and seek.

378
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,300
We were all really good at hiding, so we decided to invent a new version of the game called

379
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
"Hide".

380
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,700
It was like hide and seek, but there was no seeker.

381
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,220
We would all just hide for very long periods of time.

382
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,620
It ended up being pretty lucky that we invented this new game, because a few months later,

383
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,780
creepy old Mr. Henderson invented his own new game, "Seek".

384
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:09,340
June 31st, halfway through the year and I can't fucking do this anymore.

385
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,820
I have not been living according to my resolutions.

386
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:21,020
Yeah, sure, I started an audio diary, that one was easy and it basically didn't count.

387
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,020
But I already declared war on someone in the very first month, which I wasn't supposed

388
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:32,760
to do, and I'm not certain, but I don't think I kept it very real either.

389
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,360
Also I've barely done anything cool this year at all.

390
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,820
I only took one vacation and I've just been sitting around and going to the grocery store

391
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,080
and other stores.

392
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,700
I'm not seizing life by the horns at all or living it to its fullest.

393
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,880
This is fucked up.

394
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm not appreciating my life one bit and that needs to change today.

395
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
That's right.

396
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:02,000
Earlier today I went to a back alley and I talked to a mysterious man and yes I bought

397
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,840
a bomb a time bomb to be exact and I right now am drilling into my wall and I am putting

398
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:18,340
the bomb into my wall where it will tick unseen by me but I will know it's there and I will

399
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:26,480
know it is counting down the seconds until it explodes when will it explode why exactly

400
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,720
six months from now on New Year's Eve, the end of the year, the specter of impending doom

401
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,440
will force me to live my life as it should be lived.

402
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,200
I should appreciate every day like it could be my last.

403
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,440
With the knowledge that I am going to die with certainty if I don't turn off this bomb

404
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,080
by the end of the year, I will seize life by the horns and I will live every day like

405
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,640
it could be my last.

406
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,400
Yup, I'm jigsawing myself.

407
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,600
I know this is extreme, but this is the only way I can think of to really get myself to

408
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,960
enjoy my life and push me to my limit.

409
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,160
July 1st.

410
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,000
Hit my head pretty hard last night.

411
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,920
Can't remember a single thing I did all day yesterday.

412
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,440
All I can remember is I was looking for a Cheeto on the floor of the living room and I must

413
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,380
have hit my head on the coffee table when I stood back up.

414
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,240
Not sure why I was looking for a Cheeto, because I haven't bought Cheetos in years, but I figure

415
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,600
I must have been thinking maybe there's one on the ground left over from a few years ago.

416
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,940
Either way, just gonna sit inside today, hearing strange noises coming from the walls, but

417
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,900
pretty sure it's just my imagination, or my neighbors listening to a ticking clock over

418
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,240
their Bluetooth speakers.

419
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,720
July 4th.

420
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,600
Wow, today's my birthday, one of the most exciting days of the year.

421
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,520

great. July 5th. Oh my stomach. July 6th. Oh. July 7th. Ow. July 8th. Oh. July 9th. Oh.

450
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
July 10th.

451
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Ow.

452
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,880
July 11th.

453
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,600
Ow, my stomach still hurts.

454
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,080
July 12th.

455
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Ow.

456
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,600
July 13th.

457
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Ow.

458

July 14th.

Ow.

460
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
July 15th.

461
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,880
*weird noises*

462
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
July 16th

463
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,880
*weird noises*

464
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
July 17th

465
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Feeling a lot better today

466
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
July 18th

467
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Ate too much popcorn

468
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,880
*weird noises*

469
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
August 1st

470
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Some weird stuff happened to me last night

471
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,880
I walked to 7-11 to harass the cashier

472
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,280
and when I was done I accidentally went out a door different than the one I

473
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,580
usually go out of

474
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,200
and instead of walking the half mile home I accidentally walks 27 miles directly

475
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,440
into the wilderness

476
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,700
I had no idea where I was and it was pretty dark

477
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,020
and I was pretty scared but then I came across some farmland

478
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,300
a strange farmer in tattered clothing

479
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,000
beckoned me to the farmhouse so I walked over

480
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He opened the barn door and I followed him in.

481
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,800
I sat down with him in there and asked if I could spend the night

482
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,800
in his barn because I was lost and afraid. He said I was welcome to sleep there on

483
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,840
a bale of hay

484
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,440
but I might not want to after I heard his dark secret.

485
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,960
I was already kind of lying down on the hay and I was very excited because it

486
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,240
was very comfortable.

487
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,400
In fact, since last night I've been looking into getting my bed replaced

488
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,600
with a bale of hay.

489
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm trying to keep the bed frame though, because I'm worried about destroying the habitat of whatever could be living under my bed.

490
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Anyway, I asked the farmer what his dark secret was, and he looked at me with a brooding expression and told me he was a pedophile.

491
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:09,600
I said, "Wow, yeah, you're right. I mean, I'm not a child or anything, but knowing that, I definitely don't want to stay in your barn, sir. I'm very sorry."

492
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,000
He said, "That's understandable. My farming partner left me for the same reason.

493
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
His name was Steve Jobs, and I always wondered what happened to him.

494
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,900
I told him, 'I think Steve Jobs is dead.'

495
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,100
And he said, 'I knew that lousy fuck would never amount to anything.'

496
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,400
I said, 'Anyway, sir, why are your clothes tattered?

497
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,200
Does that have anything to do with you being a pedophile?'

498
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,600
And he said, 'No, I'm actually also a werewolf.'

499
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,800
And I said, 'Oh, jeez, is tonight a full moon?'

500
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,520
And he said, "No, it's only a half moon, so I won't transform into a werewolf tonight.

501
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Don't worry."

502
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:50,320
I said, "Well, I won't worry about that, but I kind of wish that it was a full moon tonight.

503
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,000
You might be the only werewolf I've ever encountered that's actually less evil during a full moon."

504
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,600
And then I thought about it for a second, and I asked, "Are you still a pedophile when

505
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,720
you're a werewolf?"

506
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,100
He shrugged and said, "Beats me."

507
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,760
So I decided against staying in the farmer's barn, and I ended up calling an Uber home.

508
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,080
My Uber driver's name was Babatope and his fun fact on his profile page was that he loved

509
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,520
to dance in public.

510
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,480
I tipped him a big smile.

511
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,080
August 8th.

512
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,780
Played the worst video game of all time today.

513
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,040
It was called Super Mario Bros.

514
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,880
Basically, in this boring ass game, you play as a little question mark block that doesn't

515
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,440
move at all, and you essentially just sit there, and then this little red guy comes

516
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,440
and jumps under you and turns you brown.

517
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,360
So boring.

518
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,320
I prefer this game called Sonic the Hedgehog.

519
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,440
Basically you play as this timer at the top of the screen that ticks down from 10 minutes

520
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,800
to 0 and once it gets to 0 I think you win.

521
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,060
It's extremely fun because you also get to look at a still image of a blue hedgehog standing

522
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,460
in place while you play.

523
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,040
August 11th.

524
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,460
I went to the circus today and I was expecting to have a really good time, but something

525
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,280
terrible happened.

526
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,160
During the performance, I started to feel lightheaded because of how many animals I could see, so

527
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,400
I went outside of the tent to get some fresh air.

528
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,240
As I was pacing around, I noticed a big carrot in the ground.

529
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,840
I thought getting some food in my stomach could be pretty good for me, so I went and pulled

530
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,200
it out of the ground.

531
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,000
I realized that it wasn't a carrot, but actually one of the steaks holding up the circus tent.

532
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,080
I realized this too late though, as I had already pulled up 12 more.

533
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:43,060
The tent collapsed, and its fabric blanketed everyone inside, suffocating several elephants

534
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,920
and several lions.

535
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,240
The police showed up on the scene and were trying to figure out who did it.

536
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,360
They almost nabbed me, but they ended up booking this guy who I guess was there to protest the

537
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,440
use of animals in the circus.

538
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
I thought he might have been an animal rights guy or something, but it turned out he was

539
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,640
protesting the use of animals because of how much he hated animals.

540
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,900
The police ended up picking him up because he was wearing a shirt that said "I hate elephants

541
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
and lions."

542
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,680
I felt pretty guilty about the wrong guy taking the fall when I got home, and I thought about

543
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,440
turning myself in, but I realized that if I did, they'd probably make me give the stakes

544
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,380
back and I had already used them to hang up a painting I bought off Etsy, a beautifully

545
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,620
detailed map of Hogsmeade from the Harry Potter books, the town where I had grown up in my

546
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,700
story where I was the son of Ron Weasley and Ron Weasley's wife.

547
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,580
August 21st.

548
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,780
Fell into a bucket of neon paint on the way to the park today.

549
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,500
Decided to make the most of it and stand in the middle of a four way intersection and

550
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,740
pretend to be a crossing guard.

551
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,100
Was able to cause about 17 accidents before somebody said, "Hey, that's not a crossing

552
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,000
guard, he's just covered in neon paint."

553
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,660
Not quite a personal best, but I'll take it.

554
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,660
When I finally got to the park, nobody would look me in the eye, because I screamed at

555
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,780
this guy's dog there yesterday.

556
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,720
August 25th.

557
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,780
Got stuck under my weighted blanket again today.

558
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,660
That's what I call my down comforter, because of all those heavy feathers inside of it.

559
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:19,480
Ended up escaping by biting a hole in the cover of the comforter and sucking out the

560
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,420
feathers like snake venom and spitting them out onto the floor.

561
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,500
Allergies are going crazy today and I'm not sure whether it's from the feathers or the

562
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,120
bales of hay that I replaced my bed, couch, and chairs with.

563
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,800
The bales of hay are nice, but they have a little more give than I'm used to and aren't

564
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,520
giving me the back support that I need when I lie down, so I'm thinking of replacing them

565
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
with huge granite slabs.

566
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,280
September 4th.

567
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,100
Ugh, back to school day.

568
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,600
This is the worst time of the year.

569
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,940
my son out of his box and drove him to school and dropped him off.

570
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,000
And then all these other parents were trying to introduce themselves to me on the schoolyard.

571
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,980
And it's like, "Will you guys shut up?

572
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,880
I don't see why we should have to be on a first name basis with each other if we're only seeing

573
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,400
each other once a year anyway.

574
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,160
Just leave me alone."

575
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,400
Then I drove back home and my freaking wife was yelling at me all day once I got back.

576
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,000
She's such a bitch, almost as much of a bitch as Alito Ocoxoconus.

577
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,120
Man, I worked hard today.

578
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,480
I deserve a vacation.

579
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,440
September 11th.

580
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,920
I feel like there's something about today that I'm supposed to know, but I can't remember.

581
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,800
I've been racking my brain all day, but I can't think of a single thing.

582
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,020
I mean, if it was a holiday, I'm sure I'd remember.

583
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,160
Or maybe it's just some other kind of special day.

584
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,880
Did something happen today?

585
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,640
I seriously can't remember.

586
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm just sitting here and it hurts my brain how hard I'm thinking trying to remember what

587
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
happened today.

588
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Oh well, if I can't think of it, it must not have been very important.

589
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,840
September 19th.

590
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,460
Arrrrr, it be talk like a pirate day, matey.

591
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,240
One of my favorite holidays.

592
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,240
I don't even need to check the calendar to remember this one, matey.

593
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:23,600
Only a landlubber would forget talk like a pirate day.

594
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
September 25th.

595
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,160
Couldn't sleep last night because of how excited I was about today.

596
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,200
September 25th, it's ghost hunting day.

597
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,680
I picked up the cake that I ordered from the bakery for today and then I hung my head and

598
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,240
spent a moment of silence before I ate it remembering all the people who were turned

599
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,680
into ghosts.

600
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,160
And the ghost hunters that have been lost in the line of duty.

601
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,840
Today has got to be one of the most important days of September.

602
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,480
September 28th.

603
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,520
I realized I was wrong about National Ghost Hunting Day being one of the most important

604
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,480
days in September.

605
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,480
It's actually today, September 28th, World Rabies Day.

606
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,040
Today is a day to remember and honor the victims of the rabies disease, which has a 99.9% mortality

607
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,160
rate.

608
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,040
What a tragic day.

609
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,440
Everybody should remember this day and should never forget the events that have transpired

610
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,620
on September 28th when we remember those that we lost to having too much foam in their mouths.

611
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,480
October 2nd.

612
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,800
Had to go buy a new mirror today.

613
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,160
The one in my bedroom is broken.

614
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,500
It keeps showing a horned demon behind me over my shoulder and then when I turn around, it's

615
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,220
not even there.

616
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,420
Went to Home Depot to pick up a new mirror and when the attendant guy was helping me

617
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,620
me get it down from the shelf, he dropped it and it shattered all over the ground.

618
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,420
He freaked out, saying he couldn't handle that much bad luck.

619
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,500
I said, "Don't worry, man.

620
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,700
It's only one year of bad luck."

621
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,900
He said, "No, if you break a mirror, it's seven years of bad luck."

622
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,140
I said, "No, look right here."

623
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:10,420
And I pulled out my pocket-sized copy of "A Dog's Guide to Bad Luck Curses" and showed

624
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,480
him it said, "If you break a mirror, it's one year of bad luck."

625
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,000
He said, "I'm not talking about dog years, I'm talking about human years."

626
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,360
I said, "How the hell was I supposed to know we were talking about human years?"

627
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,280
October 11th.

628
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Today is Columbus Day.

629
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,960
Although I guess now, due to certain PC culture developments, people are saying it should

630
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,760
actually be called Indigenous Peoples Day because Columbus was actually indigenous or

631
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,280
something like that.

632
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,480
I don't really keep up with the conflict, and I'm not sure which side I'm supposed to take,

633
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,160
so I've been calling it "Everybody Just Stop Fighting and Hug It Out Day," which hasn't

634
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,420
made anybody mad out of the two homeless people that I told it to so far.

635
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,880
October 23rd.

636
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,760
Realized I don't know what I'm dressing up as for Halloween, so had to have a brainstorm

637
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,160
session.

638
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,920
Having a really hard time settling on something.

639
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,920
I have to strike a balance between scary and fun because I don't want to scare people too

640
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,780
bad, but I also want to be at least a little scary because, you know, it's Halloween.

641
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,000
First idea was a spider and I decided that was too scary.

642
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,080
Then my second idea was a caterpillar.

643
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,420
I thought that wasn't scary enough.

644
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,140
So I've been sitting here all day rubbing my temples trying to think of what's the exact

645
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:41,420
scariness level between a spider and a caterpillar and I couldn't think of anything.

646
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,220
Just realized just now, it's probably a bumblebee.

647
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,620
Going to dress as a bumblebee for Halloween.

648
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,780
Gonna have to go costume shopping.

649
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:56,500
October 27th, went shopping for some parts of my bumblebee costume today.

650
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,740
Bought a bright yellow outfit with the intention to paint black stripes onto it when I got

651
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,740
home.

652
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,700
yellow outfit in the store before I walked home to take it for a test run, but then one

653
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,580
of the guys whose accident I caused when I was covered in neon paint walked into the

654
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,860
store and he saw me wearing a yellow outfit and tackled me because he thought I was on

655
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,420
my way to cause more accidents as a fake crossing guard.

656
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,820
I tried to explain myself but he hit me in the face pretty hard so I couldn't speak for

657
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,740
a good 15 minutes.

658
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,900
Ended up returning the yellow outfit and buying a black outfit instead with the intention to

659
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,900
paint yellow stripes onto it when I got home.

660
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,860
But I didn't wear it out of the store just in case anybody thought I was an evil shadow.

661
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:43,000
Was looking for a headband with antennas on it but couldn't find them at the store so

662
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,100
I ended up having to settle for buying two wizard hats that I would wear on my head and

663
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,540
hope that they look like antennas.

664
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,700
Couldn't find a stinger either so I bought a third wizard hat to wear on my butt as a

665
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,220
stinger.

666
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,620
going to try to use some other wizard hats to make it look like I had six legs, but thought

667
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:06,380
better of it and decided to amend my costume to be a four-legged bumblebee.

668
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:11,660
October 31st, the scariest day of the year, Halloween.

669
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,860
Wish my neighbors would turn down their creepy ambient sound effects.

670
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:23,460
They're really boring this year, they just sound like this.

671
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,220
I really prefer those ambient Halloween soundscapes that are like clanking chains and wailing

672
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,060
ghosts, but that's neither here nor there.

673
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,220
Scared the shit out of some trick or treaters tonight with my bumblebee costume.

674
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,440
They got so scared they started laughing, like in a movie when somebody almost gets

675
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,940
hit by a car and they're so scared that the adrenaline causes them to laugh maniacally.

676
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,540
Didn't give out any candy to the trick or treaters this year.

677
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,980
really feel like digging any out of my candy shoebox. That stuff's all for me. Instead

678
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,240
I handed out little slips of paper that said "Imagine the delicious taste of a decadent

679
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,780
candy bar." Most of the kids didn't like that very much, but I could tell a few of the losers

680
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,460
thought it was delightfully postmodern.

681
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:17,060
November 3rd. It's starting to get cold out. I decided to take a nice long walk today before

682
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,240
winter really sets in.

683
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,200
After wandering around the park for a while, I went through a strange tunnel and found

684
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,080
myself before an immense castle.

685
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:32,640
A giant door was set into the wall there, guarded by two identical twins.

686
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,200
I walked up to them and said, "What's up?"

687
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,720
The first twin said, "We're the identical twin guards."

688
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,800
The second guard said, "Yes, we're twins, and we finish each other's sentences."

689
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,200
And then the first guard said, "Period."

690
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,880
I said, "Can I go inside this castle?

691
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,640
It looks pretty cool."

692
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,120
And the first one said, "You're going to have to solve our puzzle first.

693
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,440
You see, I am the brother who always tells the truth."

694
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,200
And the second guard said, "And I am the one who always does dares."

695
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,720
I said, "Well, okay, I dare you to let me into the castle."

696
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,360
And the second one said, "Damn."

697
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,360
And he opened the door for me.

698
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:25,140
And as I walked in, I turned to the first one and said, "Also, who do you have a crush

699
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,140
on?"

700
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:31,200
And he blushed and said, "I don't want to play anymore," and ran into the woods and hid behind

701
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,280
a tree.

702
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,280
I wandered around the inside of the castle for a while, but it was pretty boring, all

703
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,560
old and stone and stuff.

704
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,580
Eventually I came to the huge throne room.

705
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,320
It was beautiful.

706
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:51,400
There was a giant golden chair, and sitting in it was an old withered king, dressed in

707
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,320
shimmering robes and golden chain mail with an ornate crown atop his head.

708
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,640
He outstretched a gnarled hand towards me and beckoned me forward.

709
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,680
I approached the throne and knelt before him.

710
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,000
I accidentally knelt directly into a puddle, but I thought that if I stood up he might kill

711
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,620
me, so I had a really wet knee for the rest of the day.

712
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,240
In a quivering, reedy voice, the king told me he was king of the park and he had been

713
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,180
for almost 200 years, but now he was getting old and he needed an heir.

714
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:31,200
He told me I was the first worthy individual who passed the first two tests.

715
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,640
The first one was to even find the castle in the first place and the second was to bypass

716
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,080
the fearsome twin guards who guarded the door.

717
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:46,120
I asked what the third test was and he said I had to pull a sword from a stone.

718
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:52,280
He gestured to his right and I looked and there it was, a massive broadsword protruding

719
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,200
from a big rough boulder.

720
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,100
I said well here goes nothing and grabbed the hilt of the sword.

721
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,100
With as much strength as possible, I pulled the hilt toward me, but I forgot to brace

722
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,820
my foot on the rock because I was still kneeling and instead of pulling the sword out of the

723
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:16,460
stone, I ended up picking up the rock with the sword and then it flew out of my hands

724
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,020
like a golf club and knocked the king's head off.

725
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,560
So now I'm king of the park.

726
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,220
I brought the crown home and put it on top of my DVD player in the storage room in my

727
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,060
my attic.

728
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:37,780
November 8th, just realized why Stephanie Myers named her vampire series Twilight.

729
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:44,820
It's because of the similarity between the words crepuscular and corpuscular.

730
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:50,500
Crepuscular meaning of resembling or relating to Twilight, with corpuscular meaning of or

731
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,820
relating to a blood cell.

732
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,660
Very clever, Stephanie.

733
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:00,720
I love noticing little easter eggs like this, like when I realize that ATM machines have

734
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,460
an option to check balance so that technicians can come in and make sure that thieves aren't

735
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,100
able to tip them over.

736
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,420
November 11th, Veterans Day.

737
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:18,820
Today is a day to honor those who have fought in wars and defended our country.

738
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:24,660
A lot of people will dedicate this day to their great uncle maybe, or their grandfather, who

739
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,540
usually fought in one war, two at most.

740
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:34,160
But I know somebody who deserves this day way more than any of those losers.

741
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:41,100
My mailman has fought in over 50 wars against me, and now that we're in a period of truce,

742
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,260
I think it's time that I honor him.

743
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:50,020
So I went to the post office a few days ago to send myself a letter to make sure that

744
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,780
I'd see him today.

745
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:57,380
When he walked up to the house, he saw me holding something behind my back and he said, "That

746
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,540
better not be another lasso."

747
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,140
I said, "No, don't worry Mr. Mailman, this is for you."

748
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,380
And I showed him what was behind my back.

749
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,980
It was a bouquet of flowers that I presented to him.

750
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:15,880
He said, "These flowers are old and dead and dry and horrible."

751
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,740
And I said, "Well yeah, of course.

752
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,860
I bought them on May 9th, Mother's Day.

753
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,020
So of course they're gonna be all fucked up by now.

754
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,060
I can show you a really nice picture I took of them on the day that I bought them."

755
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,500
And then I took out my phone to look through my text conversation with my mom to find the

756
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:39,300
picture of the flowers that I sent her, but I forgot that I delete my text conversation

757
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,340
with my mom every single morning.

758
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:47,760
Not to hide how many times I've lost at C-Battle in a row, of course, but rather just to save

759
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,260
some space on my phone for my all-important apps.

760
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:58,140
Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, McDonald's, Planet Fitness, Duolingo.

761
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,020
These are some of my favorites.

762
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:05,540
My mailman put his hands on my shoulders and said, "Son, I'm gonna be real with you.

763
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,020
I know we've had our differences in the past, but if the post office doesn't approve my

764
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,820
route change this time around, I'm going to fucking blow my brains out.

765
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,260
And when he said that, it affected me really deeply.

766
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:25,180
So I want to dedicate this audio diary entry to raising awareness for the lack of mental

767
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,580
health resources available to veterans in our country.

768
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,420
Veterans die every day because of no good reason, just because they're sad or something

769
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,620
I guess and because they have no therapist to tell them listen man

770
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:43,420
If you're gonna do it at least wait until after Christmas so your family can have fun

771
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,780
November 25th

772
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:52,100
Thanksgiving I know you're probably expecting me to be saying I'm super full right now

773
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,580
But I actually didn't get to eat anything today. Here's what happened

774
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:01,700
I headed over to my uncle's house to meet up with my whole family for Thanksgiving

775
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:08,420
It was my job there to cook the turkey, and I have to say I did a great job.

776
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:15,100
I cooked a gigantic 50 pound turkey and basted it with delicious juices and I added all the

777
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,140
seasonings and other ingredients that you're supposed to add when you cook a turkey for

778
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,700
Thanksgiving.

779
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:27,380
But then, as I walked from my uncle's kitchen, through my uncle's exhibit room, into my uncle's

780
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:33,860
dining room, I ended up tripping on a replica halberd that was lying on the floor and the

781
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:39,160
entire turkey flew off of the plate and flew into my uncle's piranha tank where it was

782
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,180
skeletonized in 5 seconds flat.

783
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:47,280
I put the bones on the plate and kept going into the dining room and tried to pretend

784
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,220
that I didn't notice anything had happened so I wouldn't have to tell anybody it was

785
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,700
my fault, you know, like when you throw up on the rug.

786
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,680
But everyone noticed and my uncle started yelling at me.

787
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,620
My family said it was my fault that there would be no turkey on Thanksgiving, and who

788
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,660
knows, maybe they were right.

789
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:12,300
My uncle got out his mind control wand, which was a stick that he had conditioned and trained

790
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:18,260
me as a child to obey any command while it was pointed at me, kind of like a dog or rat

791
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,900
in an experiment.

792
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:26,100
Well he pointed that wand right at me and said go the hell home so I had no choice.

793
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,780
But that wasn't all, as I was walking out the door he pointed at me again and said have

794
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,560
a bad Thanksgiving.

795
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,060
I thought that was a little over the top but what could I do.

796
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,180
Now I'm sitting here crying and it's all his fault.

797
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,260
November 26th, Black Friday.

798
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:51,500
to go out on the hunt for deals today for Christmas shopping but the spell that my uncle cast

799
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,300
on me still hadn't worn off so I couldn't leave the house.

800
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:02,980
Ended up shopping in my own pantry for Christmas gifts and things got a little aggressive toward

801
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:07,060
the end and I broke my nose.

802
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:11,800
December 1st, a meteoroid landed in my house today.

803
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,720
It smashed in through my wall, leaving a hole like in Looney Tunes when Bugs Bunny smashes

804
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,500
through the wall, except this hole was meteoroid shaped instead of Bugs Bunny shaped.

805
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,400
It hit me right in the face and knocked my nose back into alignment, so I was pretty happy

806
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,540
at first, but then I saw a mysterious green vapor rising from its surface and I thought,

807
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,620
this has to be bad news.

808
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:42,380
In order to protect everyone in my neighborhood from possible contamination from outer space

809
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:51,960
fumes, I took a deep breath and inhaled every last drop of the green vapor, like bong water.

810
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,400
I felt a strange tingling sensation spread from my lungs through the rest of my body,

811
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,200
and then I heard a booming voice in my head.

812
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:06,920
That said, your DNA and every aspect of your brain has been completely scanned.

813
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,280
Through rapid yet careful analysis of your body, we have now ascertained every strength

814
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:18,780
and weakness of the entire human race, and we will use this to subjugate you in the future.

815
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,280
Don't bother trying to fight back or warn anybody, because we have now cataloged every

816
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,800
weapon that your brain is possible of conceiving of, and none of them shall prosper against

817
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,840
us.

818
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,800
And with that, all of the green vapor flew out of my nose, like bong water, and went back

819
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,440
into the meteoroid, which hovered, and flew back out through my wall, leaving a second

820
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,160
non-Bugs Bunny shaped hole.

821
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,920
December 15th.

822
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,640
Embarrassing day today.

823
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:58,320
So I somehow accidentally signed up for a newsletter called "Brain Tumor Fan Club".

824
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:03,160
I guess it's a newsletter for people who are a fan of brain tumors.

825
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,280
I really don't want that kind of thing on my phone, so I've been trying to unsubscribe

826
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,320
from it, but every time I do, it says "Thank you for unsubscribing.

827
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,520
Please allow up to 3 years while we update your email preferences."

828
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:24,080
This wouldn't be too much of an issue, but a while ago I accidentally turned on that

829
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:31,440
setting for weird guys on my iPhone where whenever I get a notification my flashlight flashes

830
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,140
on and off a bunch of times and the phone makes a loud noise.

831
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,360
And it's been doing that whenever I get the email.

832
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,920
And for whatever reason in the past few days the Brain Tumor Fan Club has really ramped

833
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,640
up their correspondence.

834
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,120
I used to only get like one email every two weeks but I've been getting like ten or twenty

835
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
a day.

836
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,560
Anyway, earlier today I was riding the bus and my phone started doing the flashlight

837
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:03,080
thing and the person next to me on the bus, of course their eye was drawn to the flashlight,

838
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:08,280
they looked over at my phone and they saw I received an email that said it was from

839
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:13,840
Brain Tumor Fan Club and the subject line said, "If you are receiving this email, that

840
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,700
means you think brain tumors are awesome."

841
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,480
The guy next to me said, "What the fuck man?

842
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,440
during a club called the Brain Tumor Fan Club, and the entire bus started to get really mad

843
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,440
at me.

844
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,000
I was freaking out and I didn't know what to do.

845
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,120
So I got up and walked toward the front of the bus to get off, but right then I received

846
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:38,000
a second email from Brain Tumor Fan Club and it caused my flashlight to go on and off rapidly

847
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,200
again which I guess gave the bus driver a seizure or something because his limbs all

848
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,880
crumpled up and he started foaming at the mouth and the bus swerved off the road and

849
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,920
plunge deep into a snowbank.

850
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,400
After a few minutes of being trapped in the snow, one by one, the bus passengers started

851
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,800
getting rescued by drab looking women who were probably mentally disturbed, like at the beginning

852
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,680
of "Misery" by Stephen King.

853
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,080
The number of passengers in the bus dwindled as more and more got rescued, and eventually

854
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,860
it was only me left.

855
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:15,420
A woman wearing a vest and a plaid flannel pulled me out of the snowbank and looked me

856
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,840
into my eyes.

857
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,120
She said, "Are you writing a book?"

858
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,900
I said, "No."

859
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,800
She said, "What about making a movie?"

860
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,400
I said, "Also no, though I feel like I might like to someday.

861
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,720
I have a lot of stories trapped in this brain of mine."

862
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,360
And her eyes lit up and she said, "I can work with that.

863
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,200
I think we can make a misery situation out of this yet.

864
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,840
What's your preferred method of telling a narrative?"

865
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,520
And I said, "Well, I'm actually a podcaster."

866
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,320
And she shoved me back into the snow, and I had to stay and wait in there for 4 hours

867
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,120
until I was rescued by a passing dogsled musher.

868
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,960
December 24th, Christmas Eve.

869
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,280
I can't sleep.

870
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,560
I'm too excited.

871
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,280
I just need to see what Santa brought me.

872
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,520
I forgot to get a tree this year, so I'm hoping that he understands the visual language of

873
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,880
me putting out a potted flower on a stool in the place where I would normally put my

874
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,080
tree.

875
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,720
When I was trying to sleep earlier, I could have sworn I heard the reindeer walking across

876
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,720
my roof.

877
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,560
Well, it actually sounded more like they were walking through my walls, and instead of reindeers,

878
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,640
it sounded a little bit like a clock.

879
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,040
I'm so excited!

880
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,160
December 25th, Christmas morning.

881
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,200
That fat fuck Santa didn't come through again.

882
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,820
I didn't receive a single present.

883
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:42,500
You might think it's because of the whole potted flower thing, but that fucking loser hasn't

884
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,660
broughten me a single gift since I moved out of my moms house.

885
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:51,420
Thought it might be because maybe he still has my address listed as my moms address so

886
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,980
I called my mom to see if he left any gifts there for me.

887
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,700
She said "come on" and hung up.

888
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,720
I'm pissed the fuck off.

889
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,860
I bet she opened my damn presents and now is pretending that Santa didn't bring any there.

890
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,520
I bet her and Santa are in cahoots.

891
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:13,100
I would say this is the worst Christmas ever, but it actually comes in third place, after

892
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,640
the Christmas where I had a near death experience and the Christmas where I had two near death

893
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,120
experiences.

894
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,880
December 31st, New Years Eve.

895
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,960
Well, it's almost midnight and I'm just sitting here reflecting on the year I've had.

896
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,900
You know, even though the only resolution I really kept was keeping this audio diary,

897
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,940
I'm kinda happy with how the year turned out.

898
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:45,460
Even if I didn't necessarily live my life to its fullest, I still had a good time.

899
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:50,380
Maybe it's not about taking life by the horns, or going on vacation, or eating too much delicious

900
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,420
food.

901
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:57,220
Maybe it's just about hanging out and being an asshole to service workers and just chilling

902
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,220
out.

903
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,780
I feel like I've reached an epiphany today.

904
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:05,020
2021 may not have been perfect, but it was a good year.

905
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,340
Oh no, I'm missing the countdown.

906
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:12,520
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

907
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,020
HAPP-
