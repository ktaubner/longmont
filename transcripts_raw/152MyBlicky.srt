00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,160
- All along.

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,120
- Do you guys think that when we were--

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
- Why'd you just look at the back of your hand like that?

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,720
- He wrote it down.

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,240
- No, I don't write down my ideas.

57
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,520
- He wrote it down in Morse code.

58
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
- He wrote it down in Morse code.

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,080
- Yeah, those dots, those are Morse code dots.

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
- I do not.

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,840
Guys, if you're saying that I write down all my ideas

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,760
for the podcast and none of it is extemporaneous improv,

63
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
you're extemporaneous oh my god I can see that on the other I can see that written

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,920
on his watch no I didn't write down that sentence and I didn't write down the

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:06,440
sentence I'm saying right now just in case of an emergency you wrote that down

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,000
- no I didn't write that down you did wrong down but yeah do you guys think

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,680
that maybe when we were like little kids we would have been friends like that we

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,600
are now or do you think we would have probably hated each other cuz I just saw

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,080
I saw a picture of you, your Slack picture,

70
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,360
and I was like, I think me and this guy

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,840
might have been, probably would have been

72
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,000
really good friends and then maybe had a weird

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,440
kind of sleepover sexual interaction and ruin it.

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,360
- Yeah, my senior photos, those are the only thing

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,560
close to professional headshots that I have.

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,200
- Those are the only thing close to perfection.

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna use those

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,120
if I get booked on standup shows.

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,960
- Those are your headshots?

80
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
- Those are my headshots I'm gonna use,

81
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,080
'cause I took those at the mall

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:54,080
like the place where you like take your baby to get a picture of the baby done.

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,320
It wasn't called Baby Picture Mall, but it was something like that.

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,160
It was similar to Baby Picture Mall, but there's a lot of really good photos of me at 17, just

85
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,040
like very confused as to what the photographer wants me to do because there's like a baby

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
block behind me.

87
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,640
Why don't you just play with the baby block?

88
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
it's a baby block is it just a block

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,440
it's like a block that has letters on it. Is that like a thing somebody else would know about?

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,720
am i in the dark here? A baby block?

91
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,920
yeah, because there's adult blocks. It has like an A

92
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,720
yeah, oh, an alphabet block. No, but sometimes it has numbers on the other side. Or like a picture of babies.

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,640
It's a baby block. It's like if it says the letter B, then you know who he was talking about.

94
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,200
I genuinely thought that it was some kind of... You're being an asshole.

95
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
You're being a fucking asshole for no fucking reason.

96
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,520
it was like a of photo thing

97
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,800
but there's a new put the baby on or something no it's a baby block it's

98
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,720
not going to play with the baby i don't know if they can't play with those

99
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
blocks i wasn't my brain space was a good thing that you play with it was a

100
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
great process it would be a dick

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,040
no i'm running everything i was asking a question you're being a day to be a

102
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
decade

103
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,000
no being as i was a question of i was

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,040
if anybody else knew the baby block was there if i was the one who didn't know

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
and clearly everyone else knows what it is.

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,680
- He's still on this.

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
- Fucking ass, you're the one who's still on this.

108
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,360
- Ass hat.

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,180
- You're talking.

110
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,020
- Dickhead.

111
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,860
- No.

112
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,680
- Shitter.

113
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
- No, I was, I asked a person

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,120
a perfectly reasonable thing about maybe a baby block

115
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,600
as a set piece at a mall.

116
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
- You're being a cunt.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
You're being a cunt hole.

118
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,760
- Guys, no I'm not.

119
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,080
- You're being an asshole cunt.

120
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,560
- No, I was just curious if a baby block--

121
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
- You're being a fucking ass,

122
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,800
you're being an asshole cunt fucker.

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
- Maybe it's like a pedestal that a baby--

124
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,240
- You're a pedestal.

125
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
- Maybe you guys all go lower.

126
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,920
- Huh?

127
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:50,400

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040

(laughing)

160
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,880
- I don't like Homer C.K.

161
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,040
That's a, I mean, those are two legends of comedy

162
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
that I still wanna insult.

163
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,400
- You wanna keep them separate from each other.

164
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,400
- This, I swear to God, this Coke Dream World,

165
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm trying to, since I've been on Adderall,

166
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,520
I've been trying to cut back on all caffeine

167
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,320
'cause it's not good for your heart.

168
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,400
And so I've been drinking just plain soda

169
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
'cause it only has like a little bit of caffeine.

170
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm weaning myself off.

171
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
This tastes exactly--

172
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,880
- He's weaning himself off right now.

173
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,200
- This tastes like hoisin sauce.

174
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,040
- It's like Homer C.K.

175
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
fucking waning yourself off.

176
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,400
This tastes like hoisin.

177
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,900
Hoisin?

178
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,400
Hoisin?

179
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,900
Like...

180
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm sorry I don't have enough money to go shop at a global grocery store world market like you.

181
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,900
There is a...

182
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,900
I know what hoisin sauce is.

183
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,900
There is a supermarket next to the bodega and you could have gotten there and got me a diet coke.

184
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Do I look like I'm made of fucking feet and I can walk everywhere for...

185
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,900
I wish you were made of feet and I could massage every single one of them.

186
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,400
Oh my god.

187
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,900
You wouldn't.

188
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,400
I would.

189
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
If I was like one of those bucky balls...

190
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,900
Yeah.

191
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,400
No.

192
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,900
Uh huh.

193
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,400
Just with feet? You wouldn't do that.

194
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,240
that go in and put a friend with a color on my penis don't you dare I know I what

195
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,760
is it I know I know what I know I've heard it before I can't call the picture

196
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,940
in my brain what is it you're screaming like an asshole at me right now tell me

197
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,800
what it is right now this is workplace of Regina right John you hear about this

198
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,520
there you guys are keeping a secret from me like what I'm gonna I'm gonna pick it

199
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,160
at you I'm gonna use you mentally you are being rude to me so I'm gonna

200
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,520
physically is it what is it does it have spikes yeah it's a spike that you give

201
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,680
to a kid it's a slight ball it's like the top of a mace yeah there's balls that

202
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,920
look like that that's a toy you don't know you don't know what you don't know

203
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,840
what a buckyball is either no what the fuck is a buckyball fuck you I think he

204
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,200
made it up I was just a toy I made up okay I feel like a buckyball before I

205
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,280
think it's the one that goes like this

206
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,400
buckyball but then that doesn't make sense for the visual yeah what are you

207
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,400
because the visual of you made that's why I was on the spikes yeah the visual of

208
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,800
you made no it never mind it's those little magnetic balls what is it to

209
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
these

210
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:58,240
these are buckyballs. That makes absolutely no sense at all. Yeah, that makes complete zero sense. They're buckyballs. Completely zero sense.

211
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,000
You look just like a buckyball. Oh wait, see I'm thinking of this when it's all put

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:18,920
to

213
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,140
had a friend link but clear right now. Friend link is different from knowing everything

214
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,360
all the time. Plus my hat is, I don't know where to put my hat. On your head. But then

215
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,980
I can't think as well when I have a hat on my head. Yeah you can't. I can think pretty

216
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,620
well. I think worse when I have a band of tight stuff around my head. I keep uh. To

217
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,860
nothing? Then why would I even wear the hat? Is there a red line on my forehead? Yeah but

218
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,180
I thought it was a tattoo or a birthmark. I keep, I don't know what it is, every hat

219
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,020
is too small for me now. I think I know exactly what it is that makes every hat

220
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,180
too small for you. Yeah I think it's your head. I think it's the size of your head.

221
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:03,620
Last night I fell asleep watching a vampire in Brooklyn and my

222
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,180
cat was in my like armpit while I was sleeping and I guess

223
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,020
my roommate came home I guess I must have rolled over in my sleep because my

224
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,820
roommate came home to Moe just in my armpit going "WAAA" just trying to get away

225
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,620
well you trapped killed you I almost rolled over and killed Moe yeah holy shit

226
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,620
goddamn that would have been we need a link up Moe and Phil that would never

227
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,740
work Phil Moe Phil Moe and we need to Phil Moe in the city of dope

228
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,740
wait why would that never work? nothing here but chips and soda

229
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,980
Nicky Nicky because it's a cat and a dog we found out that Phil's not even a

230
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,940
German Shepherd he's a he's a Belgian Malinois what is that? it's like a

231
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,540
a cousin to a German Shepherd but it's not the same thing. It's basically the same thing.

232
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,460
Yeah basically but we found out we found out... Did you do a DNA test on him? No but we

233
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,940
just looked at him and we were like he's not a German Shepherd he's a Malinois. You thought he must be a cousin?

234
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,740
A lot of people, Malinois get mistaken for German Shepherd

235
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,500
often but they have a different... Maybe because they're the fucking same breed. No they have a

236
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,860
different coat it's basically any time you see a German Shepherd with short hair you're

237
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,620
like oh that's a... Couldn't the short hair also be from some other type of dog?

238
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,820
in his lineage. There are four types of dogs. Yeah. Gug. Speak on it. There are four types

239
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,500
of dogs. Let's hear it. Run through them. It doesn't matter what breed they are. List

240
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:27,880
them then, asshat. Go. Big. Dickhead. You're being a dickhead to me. Dickhead. No. Dickhead's

241
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,980
not a breed of dog. Dickhead is a type of dog. I know what the next breed is. It's Caleb.

242
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:39,740
Caleb yeah I'm a dog yeah that's all four of them those three do you think I could

243
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,540
be mistaken for a dog I think that's the last animal you would be mistaken the

244
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,540
dog the dog community in my neighborhood could be mistaken for an egg yeah or a

245
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,620
Sphinx cat the dog community my neighbor is being shook right now a sphinx cat

246
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,620
with Down Syndrome. Down Syndrome? Yeah, a cat with Down Syndrome. Yeah, they can. Have

247
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,340
you seen that picture of the tiger with Down Syndrome? No, because I don't sit around saying

248
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,340
oh let me look up Down Syndrome animal. I didn't look it up. It's on one of those like

249
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,860
super fact or whatever. It's not a super fact. Ultra facts dot com. I don't think it has

250
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,100
Down Syndrome. I think, I feel like if an animal. Because Down Syndrome is named after

251
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,420
a guy who had Down Syndrome. Exactly. There's no cat named Down. I feel like that tiger,

252
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,820
that's the first case of like like downs in a in a tiger I feel like whatever that

253
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,500
Tigers name is what you name it after like it's like when they have like like

254
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,760
have you ever seen like a video of like a cat with like schizophrenia or something

255
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,380
I've never seen schizophrenia yeah he's cat so that's cats so free that's a

256
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,920
crazy cats are crazy so crazy and they gotta look at any any disease for an

257
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,100
animal that has a human analogous you have to change the name and I like it

258
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,800
cute. Analog. Snopes is uh... I don't care. Snopes lists... See he's been a dick. I've

259
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,100
made this mistake before. This guy's a human fucking... He's a walking talking Vox

260
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,720
explainer video. So Snopes says is this a tiger with Down syndrome and

261
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,420
Snopes says mixture so I'm right. Yeah a mixture of your cum and a cat's cum.

262
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,580
Yeah that's how the tiger was made. You gave it to... you passed it down. It doesn't have

263
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,940
Down syndrome. It's Napoleon Dynamite's favorite animal. Is Napoleon Dynamite... we were

264
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,780
talk about this the other day, Napoleon Dynamite can't have held up right? It's

265
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,660
got to be bad. Oh no it's so good I watched it. No it's definitely still good.

266
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,460
Really? I don't know why you said we were talking, I said it's still good and you

267
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,700
were just like. No we were talking about Napoleon Dynamite and I'm just saying my thing is I

268
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,740
think that it's probably bad. He tried to make me say that Napoleon Dynamite. It's definitely

269
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,700
good I think it's one of the best ones from that era probably. But just him just going like

270
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,700
"Caw da faw da wah bop bop" It just looks nice and it has a nice thing going on. I don't care I don't even see

271
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm only listening propaganda. You're only listening to it. Yeah, that's true. I guess I didn't think maybe you a question would be

272
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,720
It is Napoleon dynamite hold up if you'd are only listening audio wise if you're only

273
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,140
Listening. Yeah, I mean maybe not because I'd be like I'd be like this is so boring

274
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:15,500
Seen a single person in like a fucking vote for Pedro t-shirt or something. I think it's like we should bring it back

275
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
It's died down. Yeah, you know what?

276
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,700
Napoleon Dynamite for Halloween.

277
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,420
It's probably right at that level where you probably could bring back a vote for

278
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,380
Pedro. Like, like Angelina Jolie could wear a vote for Pedro thing and people

279
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,620
would be like, "Oh my God."

280
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,580
She's too big now.

281
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,460
If Channing Tatum wore a vote for Pedro t-shirt, I'd be wearing one.

282
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,740
You'd be wearing one right now.

283
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,620
I think a vote for Pedro shirt, though, I feel like for some reason in my brain,

284
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,100
if I see something, like a lot of other stuff, if I saw someone wearing it, I'd be

285
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,380
like, "Oh, it's like, it's a joke. It's a fucking old t-shirt." But vote for Pedro,

286
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,700
be like oh they like Napoleon Dynamite I'd still just think it was a some but what

287
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,380
if it's a hot hoe and you say well Napoleon Dynamite, shout out Pedro. She goes what what are you talking about?

288
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,660
This is about my councilman. Yeah yeah. This is about Pedro Gutierrez. In New York City that's actually a

289
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,420
possibility to vote for a Pedro. When I was growing up in North Carolina we it

290
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,860
said vote for Pedro we just thought it was the funniest thing ever. It was like when

291
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,020
are you ever gonna see Pedro on a ballot but these days it actually is and I think

292
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,800
You can see Pedro on most ballots now. Mm-hmm yeah most ballots you can vote for

293
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,240
Pedro. And in most ballets. Yeah male dancers. Yeah there's plenty of male

294
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,740
dancers. Growing up in a... Which used to, when we were growing up, not a male

295
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,540
dancer in sight right? They would do the, they'd have to put a mustache on

296
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,060
somebody do the nutcracker. Growing up in New England the only Pedro we cared

297
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,180
about until Napoleon Dynamite was 45. And when I was growing up in Bristol.

298
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,660
45 Donald Trump. Oh my god. Mm-hmm. You have a choice if you want to vote.

299
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,580
Which 45? Which 45 are you going to vote for? If you're from Boston you have two 45s to pick from.

300
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:56,620
Yeah. Pedro or Donald Trump. We had a 45 caliber bullet. Yeah. We'd pass around in

301
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,420
school. That's sad that there's guns in schools nowadays. Well we were taught how to use guns in school.

302
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,700
It's just the bullets. It's fine when it's just the bullets. There's no guns.

303
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,780
you get in trouble for bringing a bullet to school? Not if it's wrapped around your neck and it was

304
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,940
your grandpa's. Call up the teacher. Let's ask her. There's a kid who got in trouble for having a gun in my

305
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,340
school. Yeah there's a same with same with my school. There's a kid like said. But I never saw

306
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:25,220
the gun I just always assumed it was like a cool new gun. It was probably like a grandpa like

307
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,340
like Pirates of the Caribbean gun. Yeah. And that you know. What are you gonna do with that?

308
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,140
I remember my friend was friends with the kid who brought the gun to school and he

309
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:41,060
claimed that it fell into his backpack. That's possible. Yeah. It either fell into

310
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,900
his backpack or he left it in his backpack. If he lives in a gun store with high

311
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,460
shells and he's knocking into them all the time. Or if he lives in like Pee-wee's

312
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,060
Playhouse. Yeah. It's like a giant conveyor belt. It's like there's toast on it and cereal.

313
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
and then also a gun, yeah.

314
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,860
You're thinking of his house from his big adventure, not his playhouse.

315
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Yeah, I am.

316
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
It doesn't matter.

317
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,420
The point is, you right now are being a dick.

318
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
I'm not being a dick.

319
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
I'm just a peewee historian.

320
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
Because you understood exactly what I meant.

321
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,060

Holy shit, that was actually fucking...

325
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,660
I think he's innocent for what he did in that movie theater.

326
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,180
He's definitely innocent.

327
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,900
He was at a porno theater.

328
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
What are you supposed to do?

329
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900

337
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,260
movie theater because we're both watching the same fucking episode of TV. Which also

338
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,780
brings up the question like you ever see like one of those pornos where it's

339
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,460
like a lot of men in one room and one lady you imagine the smell. The smell of

340
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,460
a bukkake porno is what you're trying to talk about now? When we were just talking

341
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,260
about Pee-wee. Only Pee-wee, we're talking about how he's innocent, he was fucking he was

342
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,940
persecuted because he was gay. Well imagine he's watching that video. Huh? Imagine that's the video he's

343
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:29,820
watching okay screen so you want to smell a vision kind of scratch and yeah a

344
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,620
bunch of them are just like like but body musk but and the last one at the

345
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,620
end of the bukaku it's like 16 guys it just says like do not scratch at one

346
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:49,620
time and is everyone in the theater faints it's just one person's like an

347
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,700
episode of Spongebob? Yeah. What's the name of Pee-wee's guy? Paul

348
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,900
Rubens. Paul Rubens, yeah he was multiple times the LAPD tried to get him

349
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,380
on bullshit. Yeah, because he was gay, he was a gay guy in the 90s so they tried to like...

350
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,180
same with George Michael. George Michael was set up. What happened to George

351
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,980
Michael? He went to buy marijuana from from his uncle Job. Yeah. Yeah and

352
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,500
then he was set up and he got in trouble with his dad, Michael.

353
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,760
And then the guy's arm fell off. Yeah. Yeah, really? Yeah, it was a whole setup. Yeah, I had never even heard of this

354
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:29,640
You know, it's all filmed. It was a documentary Eddie Murphy Eddie Murphy got fucking they got him for they were like

355
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,500
It's they got him for just having a good time. Yeah, Eddie Murphy was why you going to jail because you're using

356
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,140
Prostitutes since when is that illegal? I think the big deal about that was that the prostitute was trained

357
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,380
Yeah, but like that's what I mean

358
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,620
that's why the only reason they got that he got in trouble and he stopped doing

359
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,760
stand-up we lost some of the greatest fucking most homophobic jokes of all time

360
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,740
he probably could have written yeah right and he and they threw it away and they

361
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,000
threw away one of them but then he made that album could have been the third in

362
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,500
the trilogy could have been fucking fucking that album which is I think more

363
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,340
there's a lot of a little bit more could have been a full trilogy I was singing

364
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:18,740
the other day. If you could ask Bob Marley one question, what would it be?

365
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,620
You want to smoke this? Damn, that's a good one. Mine would probably be like, what

366
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,940
does music mean to you? Yeah, I would probably be like, how can I

367
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,980
succeed in life and how can I get $100 and what's the secret of

368
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,060
life and how what's the secret of happiness and how can I be as successful

369
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,880
as you probably probably song answering all those questions yeah yeah I wrote a

370
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,260
scary story oh it's Halloween yeah it's Halloween to bring in a Bob Marley

371
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,900
ghost-ass yeah fucka yeah yeah he's in he's in the big island in the sky uh-huh

372
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:02,620
yeah the big Halloween castle in the sky no it's downstairs there's one I don't

373
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,660
know definitely he did smoke I think he's still stuck in purgatory cuz he has to

374
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:15,560
atone for all the weed that's true true I think that's maybe maybe but he also a

375
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,620
lot of people like limbo it's part of his religion

376
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:30,060
No, I don't think that's true. I don't think they do limbo in in reggae.

377
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:36,520
Okay, this is a story, a scary story I wrote for October for you guys and it's a

378
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,500
little, it's I just want to warn you beforehand, it's very psychological.

379
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,300
Should I go ahead and start chattering my teeth? Yeah, it's well, so that's the thing

380
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,660
is it's kind of nails that I can bite on. There's a bunch of nails over there. Yeah.

381
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,540
Yeah, we're not building anything. No, human nails.

382
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,900
Oh, well, there's no building happening here. This is more of a psychological type of...

383
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,340
It's like a head trip. It's very... It's heady, you know, it's high concept.

384
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,180
I'm into trip. So, it might take a minute to get it.

385
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,900
Right. It might even take a day or two to get it.

386
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm already so scared I bit my tongue right there.

387
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,140
So, it hasn't even started yet. I haven't even told you the title of the story.

388
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm already scared. My little brother bit right through his tongue.

389
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,620
scary. My little brother, he was riding-- I'm afraid of doing that. My neighbor had this

390
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,340
like big scooter. It had like BMX tires on it and he fell over on it and had his

391
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,560
tongue out or something. Did he like chop it off? He bit the impact of his-- the bottom

392
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,420
of his jaw like he had to get like stitches in his tongue and he like bit

393
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,100
through until like the final layer of his tongue. I drank a really-- So think about that

394
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,580
when you hear Cameron's story. Okay my story is not about that. Okay but think

395
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,580
about the mental pain that a six-year-old boy went through.

396
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,580
Right, there's no six-year-old boys in my story.

397
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,580
Which is what Cameron's story is about, Cameron, go.

398
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,580
It's not about that. I haven't even revealed the title yet.

399
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I just got a dope-ass text from my stepdad.

400
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
Yeah?

401
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Love you, bud.

402
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,580
That's nice.

403
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
That's sweet.

404
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,580
That's pretty nice. Not really the vibe we're going for here with this current moment right now.

405
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,580
Yeah, but I need a little palate cleanser.

406
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
You should have done that when the story was done.

407
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Yeah, the pre-palate cleanser. Before dinner meant.

408
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
Yeah.

409
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
It's an aperitif.

410
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Yeah, okay. So the title reveal.

411
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
Dad Perall Spritz.

412
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
Step Dad Perall Spritz.

413
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Step Dad Perall Spritz.

414
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
Dad Perall Steps.

415
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,580
That's what I just said.

416
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
Tall glass.

417
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
This story is called

418
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
Psychological Horror.

419
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
What's so funny?

420
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
It's a scary name.

421
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
You are telling a scary story

422
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
to somebody who finds

423
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,980
to terror. Listen, you might, you okay, you might, you might, you might find, you might

424
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,060
find zombies, monsters, vampires amusing. Believe me, there's, there's very few of those

425
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,740
in this story. This is, this is, I don't know if you've ever seen a thriller by Mr. Hitchcock.

426
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,540
Who's a Hitchcock-y? David Hitchcock. A new nightmare from David Hitchcock? Yeah. Wow.

427
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,500
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I stepped on one of the things. That's okay. But so I'm just gonna, I'm gonna,

428
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,420
I'm gonna I'm gonna get into this here. Okay, bro, and it starts like a dark fairy tale from the mind of Guillermo del Toro. Okay

429
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,620
Once upon a time Wow now the Guillermo del Toro parts over

430
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,780
a woman lived in a house all alone and

431
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:30,300
She left the house every day to go to work or to do errands or activities if it was the weekend or a holiday like Halloween

432
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,060
But the one place she never left was her mind her psychology

433
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,020
Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

434
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,880
Or did it?

435
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,760
Maybe it was all just in her head.

436
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Her tortured, twisted head.

437
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,340
The doorbell rang again like the tortured cries of a man screaming for help from his

438
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,100
friend named Ding Dong.

439
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,260
His friend in this analogy is not Asian.

440
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
He's white.

441
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,540
Named Ding Dong.

442
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,200
Did it really ring this time?

443
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,100
Maybe it did ring this time, but the first time was all in her head.

444
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,980
She decided to answer the door.

445
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,980
The decision tortured her.

446
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,380
If she went to the door and nobody was there, it would mean that the doorbell ringing was

447
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,940
in her head both times, which would mean she was insane, or that someone rang it and ran

448
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,860
away, which is scary too.

449
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,420
And to be insane is the greatest horror of all.

450
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,580
But if someone was there, then one of the doorbell rings at least could have still been

451
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,420
in her head, so she might even still be insane.

452
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,540
But then she went and answered the door, and it was a terrifying clown drenched in blood.

453
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,220
Or was it?

454
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,160
Maybe it was just her kindly old neighbor and her twistedly traumatized mind was hallucinating

455
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
him as evil.

456
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,700
Her mom and dad were evil to her as a kid by the way.

457
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,660
She was traumatized.

458
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,580
Should she shoot and kill this clown?

459
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,040
What if the clown was real but she was hallucinating the blood onto him?

460
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,780
Or he could be a normal non-evil clown and she was hallucinating that he was terrifyingly

461
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,140
evil but maybe also the blood was still real and it was blood from his food or something.

462
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,060
Maybe she was so insane that she believed food has blood.

463
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,220
Maybe I'm so insane that I believe that.

464
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,220
That's a fourth wheel break.

465
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,720
Oh my god, he broke the fourth wheel right in front of us.

466
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,900
So she used her service weapon to shoot the clown.

467
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,560
She was a police officer, by the way, this is a plot twist.

468
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,720
Or maybe she just believed she was.

469
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,340
Maybe she was actually a clown and a police officer just shot her and she hallucinated

470
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,860
that it was opposite day.

471
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,980
Could her tortured mind conceive of such evil?

472
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,060
What darkness doth the human mind contain?

473
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,740
What sordid sickness can fester in the folds of one's fetid brain?

474
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,860
Since the dawn of time, we have killed our neighbors with rocks.

475
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,820
We have slain our compatriots with bone clubs and pointed sticks and AK-47s.

476
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,300
We are all clowns.

477
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,540
We are all policemen, at least in the dark universe of our minds.

478
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,940
Is not the imagination more terrifying than a thousand vampires and zombies put together?

479
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,060
The woman went to jail that day and she got sent to outer space, one trillion miles from

480
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
anything.

481
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,300
Floating in the void with no external stimuli whatsoever, she heard a doorbell.

482
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,940
Yes, she was insane.

483
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,140
And actually, she was in the shower all along, and she was a supermodel.

484
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,700
And there's no such thing as clowns.

485
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Credits roll.

00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,820
such thing as a clown cut to new title logo the clown Wars coming 2023 Halloween

499
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,020
it you could also do another post-credit scene where maybe the woman sitting at a

500
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,380
she's sitting at a bar right uh-huh sit in a bar and she and she slides the

501
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:50,260
entire stool up her butt yeah and blood and shit goes everywhere yeah

502
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,060
I actually had that in an early draft, but my editor said to cut it.

503
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,820
And then Tony Stark walks in and he says, "I need you. I need your butt on my team of

504
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:10,260
fuckers. I need that. I need my head in your butt." And she'd go, "Okay, but now, butt

505
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,940
head." 2024. Butt head.

506
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,820
head yeah I still that fucking that's chilling that video the lady with the

507
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,780
head inside of her butt I think that's a guy I think I don't think women have

508
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,980
butts like that I think I think about that all the time bummed I think about

509
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,700
that that was like a year ago I talked about that on the podcast to the day

510
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:38,180
yeah you're gonna go terrifying oh my god huh remember that video yeah I do

511
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,580
remember that one Julie sent you were doing some you were saying remember it

512
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,660
insane stuff to me at the time of just people getting suction cupped into the floor and shit.

513
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Oh yeah.

514
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
That guy just gets...

515
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
You would always hold up your phone.

516
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,660
You would always suction bag and just put in the ground.

517
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Yeah, you would show us...

518
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,340
That one is really good.

519
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
That honestly scared me.

520
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,900
But you would just show us videos of a guy like tying his penis into a sailor's knot and

521
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,700
then we'd talk to you the next day and you'd be like, "Yeah, I'm not doing so well.

522
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,820
I'm still really torn up about that penis video."

523
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
No, it was only the...

524
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,140
I'd be like, "Just stop watching the videos."

525
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
It was only the one...

526
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
of the soul for this section.

527
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
- The butt, the butt head one.

528
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
- That happened multiple times.

529
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
I won't say what some of the videos were,

530
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,860
but I know it happened at least three times.

531
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,740
- The butt head one was the one that stopped it.

532
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,500
'Cause I was like, the human soul is depraved.

533
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
- Yeah.

534
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
- The human soul is completely depraved.

535
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,140
- It's just so funny to feel badly a day later,

536
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,140
'cause you saw an account called like, butt head sucker.

537
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,140
- Yeah, watch that butt thing, huh?

538
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
- You were like, oh, I think I should watch this.

539
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
- Butt head sucker.

540
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,260
- I think you should look at every single thing

541
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,140
this person has ever posted, because it's weird.

542
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
- Yeah.

543
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,820
- Yeah, I don't like weird stuff like that.

544
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,740
- I'm basically like an anthropologist.

545
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,580
- I do like psycho--

546
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,580
- For weird stuff.

547
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,940
- Anthropologist, huh?

548
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,380
I do like, you know what I learned?

549
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,780
I'd never heard the term uptalk until this week.

550
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,980
- What's uptalk?

551
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,980
- Nothing much, what's up with you?

552
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,460
- Yeah, okay.

553
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,300
- What's uptalk?

554
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,140
What's uptalk, bro?

555
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,100
- It's when people talk like this.

556
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,940
- Oh, yeah, okay, yeah.

557
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,340
- And I didn't know there was a word for that,

558
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,300
but yeah, I just--

559
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
- Or what's the one where you do--

560
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,380
- It's like new, it's only come out

561
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,780
in the last like 15 years.

562
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,620
People didn't talk like that before that.

563
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,420
for that yeah it's like a new is it the same as when someone when someone ends

564
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,780
everything like a question I don't want to be well that like an example of that

565

talk like that girls have vocal fry now it's not vocal fry it's different it's

572
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,260
a it's your inflection you ever know a girl and you talk to her and you there's

573
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,180
normal voice and then you see her talk to another girl and she starts going

574
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,220
(mimics a bird)

575
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,980
- Vocal fry, I'd rather have some,

576
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,220
I'd rather have a Coke and fries

577
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,660
with my chicken than my burger.

578
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,580
- I agree, 'cause I don't wanna talk like,

579
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,820
I just don't wanna talk in any kind of weird way.

580
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,400
You know, I try to eliminate all kinds

581
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,620
of weird accents in my life.

582
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,540
- Diet Coke and fries.

583
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,100
- That sounds pretty good because you're balancing

584
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,540
one with the other, right?

585
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,580
Now if they made a diet fry, I'm getting a full fat Coke.

586
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,420
- They make a diet fry, it's a sweet potato fry.

587
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,860
- What the fuck are you talking about, bud?

588
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,700
That's the same fucking shit.

589
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,460
- I'd rather be a total spy.

590
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,300
- Yeah, I'd rather be a--

591
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,460
exactly against Ukraine I'd rather be a turtle guy I'd rather be a scrotal pie

592
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:42,020
there's a pie I'd rather have a scrotal eye yeah I can see the inside of my

593
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,260
pants I don't know what they look like in there I'm seeing the outside of my

594
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,980
pants all day I'm going yeah yeah that's probably about the same color Wow

595
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,900
they're dark botanist a botanist I want to try that would you ever would you be

596
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,620
a dark botanist who maybe does like all Venus flytraps and those things of the

597
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:01,160
sort I would get those those like black are those desert roses I don't know the

598
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,700
like the ones that look like a like a sarlacc thing I saw them in Oakland I

599
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,380
don't know I don't know what you're talking about a black desert black flower

600
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,860
and it like our legs like us it looks like a worm with like a big desert rose

601
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,660
is a song by sting that's maybe the inspiration a desert rose looks mostly

602
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:29,740
just like a flower. A saguaro? A cactus? It's not a saguaro I think. I'll search

603
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,900
flower that looks like sarlacc. That's what you said right? It looks like a

604
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:40,540
sarlacc? Okay well what I'm seeing here is a bunch of pictures of sarlaccs. What

605
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,760
is this damn flower? Sarlacc pit. I want to take a large black shit. Yeah yeah

606
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,500
pretty much that's just in the sarlacc's mouth. No he wouldn't even notice. He

607
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:57,420
would like that. The sarlac is an old old thing. It's been there a long time.

608
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,280
You know it takes even longer for the sarlac to

609
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,700
digest a human. Uh-huh, why's that? You get tortured in their body for millions of

610
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,500
years. By psychic energy or something. It keeps you alive. It like keeps you alive so that it can suck your

611
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:19,440
energy out. The sarlac pit is crazy. Also they blow up into cum. But a lot of

612
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,160
people talk the thing is it's so old a lot of people talk say mean things about

613
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,960
the Sarlaac Pit it looks like shit it's fucking stupid and it just rolls off its

614
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,140
back yeah it barely even notice like rolls into its mouth rolls into its

615
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,240
crack because it's kind of is it the whole the name of the animal is just the

616
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,280
Sarlaac yeah but it's so is it I thought the Sarlaac was just the planet was

617
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,600
Sarlaac and Tatooine is the planet. Sarlaac is what we got Neil deGrasse

618
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,360
fucking Tyson over here talking about these planets. Buddy, I don't speak

619
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,640
English please. Yeah and look he's doing that you kind of do look like

620
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,840
White Nails to Grass Tyson. The more I look at you, you kind of have the exact...

621
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,620
Oh my god dude. You have the exact kind of like shadow. I should be him for

622
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,060
Halloween then. Yeah, white definitely. It's gotta be white though. Yeah you can't do

623
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,300
that okay I guess that's a good idea not but dress up like him mustache yeah isn't

624
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,700
it do you think it's worse you have a mustache it's do you think it's worse if

625
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,820
you are a white person dressing up like a black character and you he's a character

626
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,100
he's a black guy hey you'll aggress Tyson meet him on the street you're my

627
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,620
favorite black character he's a character in conversation that man has

628
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:45,860
some quips yeah and that's what I meant but like dressing up like a like a

629
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:53,780
black character or like just a normal black guy no I'm not any specific

630
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,340
character guy I'm just a normal black guy do you think it's it's where it's

631
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,740
not it's not racist or a problem because I'm just a normal black guy you think I'm

632
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:08,740
not doing make it fun of anybody. It's worse if you do blackface or you remain white and you have it like a perfect afro wig.

633
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,860
You remain steadfast and white. Perfect afro. I don't think that I what do you mean which

634
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,540
one's worse? You're saying like... Because it's like you because then you're being

635
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,420
very meticulous. I think it depends on who you are I guess. Yeah. You know if you're

636
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,460
being well do you think also maybe maybe you yeah. That's probably pretty bad. You could so you're

637
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,600
dressing up you're doing blackface for Halloween. Yeah. Okay and somebody says

638
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,580
that's racist. Well you're not doing, you're not doing blackface. Okay this is my scenario. Okay. And my

639
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,980
scenario you are doing blackface. This is my scenario. Well you're quiet in this scenario.

640
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:51,100
This is my Arsenio. This is what I'm trying to do. And somebody tries to get you in trouble. Okay. Yeah. And you say well.

641
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:56,380
And SJW basically. Yeah and you're like well it's okay because I'm not, I'm not, I'm not

642
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,260
dressed as a you don't understand I'm not making fun of a black person it's this

643
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,460
is me as as black that's what the costume is okay me if I was black you know I'd

644
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,100
say all these are probably pretty gonna be a pretty big problem yeah yeah it's

645
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,580
like when I guess it depends if you it depends maybe what where what kind of if

646
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,340
you're doing it in a place where nobody has nobody can see you or knows who you

647
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,900
are no one knows you don't speak sing like in like on the moon or Mars or

648
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,460
Venus yeah you're in the middle of like the Grand Canyon there's no one around a

649
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,460
park rangers. The people of the Grand Canyon are looking down with binoculars. That's a

650
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,660
white black guy down there. That's a guy doing blackface in the middle of the Grand Canyon.

651
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:41,660
For nobody. I guess if you're doing it for somebody. If you're not doing it for anybody.

652
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,220
If it's just for yourself. Well that's true about most things right? As long as nobody's

653
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,740
getting hurt and you're just doing it by yourself it's probably fine right? Maybe you're singing

654
00:36:52,740 --> 00:37:00,340
on the car okay so it's like like say I was gonna be blade for Halloween uh-huh

655
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:06,180
not they're not not not which boy you gotta go Wade that's bladey it's blade

656
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,900
I would say bladey let's pronounce play that's why I asked what can walk in

657
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,540
voxel buddy I asked which one it's an important question one of them is black

658
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:23,540
and one of them is a white elf. There is a clear... I'm clarifying! You knew what you were talking about.

659
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,700
We've never asked any joking questions before. That's a good point.

660
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,820
We'll keep it to real serious questions. He's getting heated right now.

661
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,260
He's getting heated. You're like worse than Tucker Carlson.

662
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:40,100
Oh my god, wait. He is cooler than a motherfucker. You're a fucker, Carlson.

663
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,740
Damn. I'm so intimidated by this cool look.

664
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,660
Whoa. That's less, you look more like your,

665
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,260
you look like, you look like the, no longer the

666
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,700
um, the saxophone player from the Muppet band, but you

667
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,940
look like Sergeant Floyd Pepper now. The main guy.

668
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,540
That's a bit of Muppet history. That's his name.

669
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,180
Moving on. Okay, so if, if someone, if it's a white guy,

670
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,180
It's a white guy dressing up like Blade for Halloween.

671
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,340
But which Blade?

672
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,140
Is it worse if he...

673
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,060
uh... don't do that. Don't do that.

674
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,980
Okay. I had to fix something. We're not fixing anything, there's nothing built here.

675
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,180
It's just a table. Is it worse if he wears the like, if he's just like Blade

676
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,840
and he's still white but he has an afro wig

677
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,120
like Blade's hair?

678
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,420
does this is a good thing to do is make a little later in the afternoon

679
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,260
it is like a i don't think it would have been after a while

680
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,080
uh...

681
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,920
it's not a good idea

682
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,520
like i have a lot of the other side of the pro i'm thinking of seventies blade

683
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,280
is it worse if the white person okay

684
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,820
is it worse of a white person mimics

685
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,280
uh... black hair

686
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,520
i don't think i'm going to tell you

687
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,040
yeah yeah i guess i'm asking the is this a kind of thing you just sit around

688
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,540
around think about all day. How much you can get away with?

689
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
Can I just do the hair?

690
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,540
You come to me and Cam and you're like, "Is this okay? You guys think this is okay?"

691
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,540
So I'm gonna be Blade. Should I leave the afro at home?

692
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,040
I won't do the skin or anything. I'm not gonna do a voice, but can I do the afro?

693
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,040
The question itself just got more racist as I progressed.

694
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,040
And I didn't mean for that.

695
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Of course not.

696
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
And I will have a no jab of apology.

697
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,820
cannot dress up as Blade the rapper because he's Scandinavian and that's

698
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:42,140
racist to do that in any context. That's obvious. Yeah. That's racist. Yeah. I didn't know he was a Euro. I thought he was Asian. I think he is.

699
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:50,640
Can you be, but then the other question is can you as a white person dress up as like a black person for Halloween?

700
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:59,440
I don't think so. No. I mean I guess. Like if a character in a movie. What about, okay what if like.

701
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
How many times are you going to rephrase this question?

702
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
The point of Halloween is to be evil I guess.

703
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
We have to get to the bottom of this issue.

704
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
What if you're dressing up as a white character but making them black for the costume?

705
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Okay, wait.

706
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
What if you dress up just as a white character?

707
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Perfect, perfect, perfect, uh...

708
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Can you dress up as a character?

709
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Perfect question.

710
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Is it okay to dress up as something you're not on Halloween?

711
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
You are four white guys and you want to be the Ghostbusters.

712
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Okay.

713
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
You just gotta invent a new Ghostbuster.

714
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Yeah, I think that's a costume for three white guys and one black guy.

715
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,320
white guys and one black guy yeah or or you got to cut the white guy you say but

716
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,720
there's not a fourth you can be you can be stay puffed you can also I know they

717
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,520
resolve that issue in Ghostbusters - when Rick Moranis puts on the suit at the end

718
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,080
yeah you could be Rick yeah I guess I guess that answers that yeah but then

719
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,680
people will immediately assume like this is the science episode I'm doing yeah

720
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,920
Patrick's a race science corner I don't know why I'm a racial this is yes I'm

721
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,420
very racial today it's not my bag very racial on October 31st very racial but

722
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,100
it's not your bag it's not my bag what's your normal bag you feel like I've

723
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,760
changed a little bit mentally Patrick I'm a little more racial that I've taken

724
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,800
I've started taking Adderall and now I'm thinking too much about things Patrick

725
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,200
took our took our advice to heart about not dressing in blackface for Halloween

726
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,520
and he's the Halloween show he's gonna be dressed as the brown Eminem yeah yeah

727
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,980
- Yeah, which is, that's okay.

728
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,820
You can be a brown M&M.

729
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,640
- Yeah.

730
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,480
- 'Cause that's an M&M, that's not, you know.

731
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,320
- I didn't do blackface for Halloween.

732
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,820
- But you can't be a brown version of M&M.

733
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,660
- No one ever said you did.

734
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,480
- That's a bad move.

735
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,760
- You're asking a bunch of questions about it.

736
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,020
- You can't dress up like M&M but brown though.

737
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,860
(laughing)

738
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,840
- That's, all of a sudden, that's really bad.

739
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,880
- Yeah, that's probably maybe one of the worst,

740
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,160
is to take a, to, to, yeah.

741
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,000
- That's bad.

742
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,120
- That's really bad.

743
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,960
- Especially M&M of all things.

744
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,560
- It's not that the other stuff isn't bad.

745
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,800
- Yeah, but that could be--

746
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,080
- But that's a--

747
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,920
- Let's just say people might get the wrong idea.

748
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,600
- That implies a deeper sickness of character.

749
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,440
- Exactly, yeah.

750
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,640
- In your heart.

751
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,080
- You could dress up as a sick character.

752
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,920
- I'm still on that question in my mind.

753
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,760
- Can we just talk about something else?

754
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,580
- I gotta think about something else.

755
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,420
- Can we just talk about--

756
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,080
- 'Cause this is like a moral quandary that I--

757
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,160
- It's a quandary?

758
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,600
- It's a quandary.

759
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,460
Something has changed in me mentally,

760
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,600
and I'm scared. - It's a dilemma.

761
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,720
- Yeah, I'm just kinda scared of the new you.

762
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,560
- Yeah. - Yeah.

763
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,400
- Yeah, I really am.

764
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,200
- I've been philosophizing too much.

765
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,720
- Yeah? - Yeah.

766
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,040
and i turn this whole episode into and into an ethics class

767
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,320
and ethics classes what you're talking about

768
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,000
reasons

769
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,740
yeah it's just not really i don't think that's really our corner

770
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:29,040
no no i think we talk about poopy and we do poop and diarrhea

771
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,480
our corner is not we don't do any racial stuff

772
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,440
okay we'll segue out of we're gonna segue out of

773
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,320
we're gonna segue out of

774
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,280
out of racial stuff

775
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
and into pooping stuff

776
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,500
yet how can you dresses poop in a way that's okay yeah

777
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,780
uh... as this is a little bit of a here's a little bit of a little bit of skin just

778
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,680
full terry where turd outfit like a paper sheet or doubt on how i'm good

779
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,040
what do you want to be diarrhea for halloween

780
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,980
then i think how do you do it

781
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,880
can you be liquid your face is corn

782
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,980
you people liquid and you have to answer this year home i guess if you're hydro

783
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,200
man

784
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,480
no you're dire yourself you know i was diarrhea man that we really did not see

785
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,200
actually now that I think about it. So do you get... How do I do? I guess if I were

786
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,640
going for creativity I might get a big clear garbage bag. This year for Halloween I'm going

787
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,400
for creativity. You know some people do their dumb creative costumes where they say I'm an

788
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,000
Instagram feed or something. There's a lot of stuff like that. I feel like that's an accepted

789
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,120
type of Halloween costume. I would take a big clear plastic garbage bag or something and I would

790
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,280
fill it with brown diarrhea and I would be inside the bag and have arm and arm

791
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,640
and leg. So you get like a suit like an inflatable sumo suit. No, but my arms and

792
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,240
legs come out. It's just a bag that's only around my torso. You suspend yourself in the diarrhea like David

793
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,040
Blaine. Yeah. And you just kind of sit there suspended. Right. Well that's more of a magic trick.

794
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,640
Well, if I have infinite budget then I will just develop a kind of CGI that works in

795
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,280
real life. That's true. And you have exactly Heidi Klum's budget. She has

796
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,800
probably enough money to make her own CGI. I thought you were doing some real life CGI.

797
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,200
Heidi Klum's buh. I was getting pretty excited. Yeah. That would be really good for making

798
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,720
diaries. That is seals. Dude, imagine the amount of diarrhea I could make for my costume.

799
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,240
Unless they're divorced. I don't remember. That's the other thing on my costume. At the night my

800
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,680
plastic bag would start empty and I would keep diarrhea-ing into it over the course

801
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,680
and i don't know if i mean

802
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,040
you can get a_c_l_ or a firefighter leave i thought believe it

803
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,440
i believe that i can't i'm conflating blade was all

804
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,560
on that one

805
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,320
uh... no i feel like this is maybe not the road you want to go down here

806
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,640
yet right now that i have a lot of black person to think about i was thinking of

807
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,800
luke cage

808
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,880
i don't even know that i don't know what he i know i know who he is i don't know

809
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
what he looks like. He's a superhero.

810
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Oh, well I guess that's...

811
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
That would be funny though, just a guy here.

812
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Just a guy with an afro. Oh no, I was thinking that.

813
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880
Cause you don't...

814
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,880
I'll type Luke Cage in right now.

815
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Luke Cage 70's.

816
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,880
Why is everyone in the 70's had an afro?

817
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,880
My dad had an afro.

818
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
Maybe Blade did.

819
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,880
So I'm seeing Luke Cage

820
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880
as bald.

821
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,880
Okay, now I'm typing in 70's.

822
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,880
Okay, he has a...

823
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,120
I wouldn't say like a full big afro, but this is acceptable, I think.

824
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,600
I think you saved yourself.

825
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Yeah.

826
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Oh, no, wait.

827
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
Here's Blade with an afro.

828
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Yeah, he had one.

829
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
But we're thinking of movie Blade.

830
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,240
Yeah, I'm thinking of him, and you know what?

831
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,360
I was thinking of movie Blade, too.

832
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,400
Yeah, you just eventually just had an afro on.

833
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,480
I just like went completely racial.

834
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,680
Yeah, just blacked out and just went...

835
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
Hey, don't say that.

836
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,320
Well, that's what you you blacked out like you went and that see again. You're taking everything racially. Yeah, I know

837
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
It's I have it on my brain. Yeah

838
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,700
This freaking pill that I'm taking is making me

839
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:03,080
Crazy, I think this is my Roseanne Barr arc Roseanne

840
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:08,480
I'm taking a pill and I've gone racial did she take pills she took an ambient and went racial as hell

841
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,680
Yeah, what you don't remember that she tweeted. She's I don't remember what you tweeted

842
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,460
something very

843
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,000
Ambien? Well, that's what she said. She said she was on Ambien and she was

844
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,320
trying to make fun of a senator and said that she looked like Planet of the Apes.

845
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,880
Oh God. Yeah. She said Ambien did that? Doesn't Ambien make you fall asleep? Yeah.

846
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,000
But then it also makes people on Reddit make funny random posts. The like

847
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,080
come down of Ambien or like the the come up. Yeah, which one is it? Like once you're getting

848
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,080
really tired. Yeah. You get racial. You get loopy. Oh, so she's saying I just am so

849
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,080
confused. It was me being random. But isn't she also like, she's been racist for like 30

850
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,320
years. It is also funny to take the thing where it's like everyone just

851
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,720
every like month you'll see a post it's about like I did this while I was on

852
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,600
Ambien and it's like I nailed a cookie to the wall or something. It's like yeah

853
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,720
that happened to me too and I got so racist. Yeah it's just mostly it's a

854
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,880
random pill right? For her she was like no. My randomness is racialness. I guess

855
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,720
that's true about Roseanne Barr. Have you ever seen the video of Roseanne Barr

856
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,040
singing the national anthem at a baseball game and she just like yeah one of the

857
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,800
worst voices I've ever heard. She sings it bad on purpose and she gets booed. Sounds like she didn't have

858
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,480
Roseanne Barr's. Holy shit that's well she didn't rap nobody raps in the national anthem.

859
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,320
Well if somebody raps in the national anthem that'd be on. I don't want to hear what Roseanne Barr would say in a rap.

860
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:41,200
Yeah exactly. And I know what she would say. Okay go Pat do it. Okay she would say

861
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,480
My name's Roseanne and I'm here to say...

862
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,000
No, she wouldn't say that. She wouldn't say that, definitely not.

863
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,200
She's a comedian, she wants to have a TV career.

864
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,200
Yeah, that's true. Well, her TV career was ruined.

865
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,200
By?

866
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,200
They killed her off of that show.

867
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,200
John Goodman.

868
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Yeah, they killed her off of the new Roseanne.

869
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,200
That's so fucking crazy.

870
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,200
I'm so mad at John Goodman for stealing that fucking show from her.

871
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
And then it was called, what was it called after that?

872
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,200
It was called Connors.

873
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Whatever the family name was, it was called this thing.

874
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200
And then it was on for like five years.

875
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,840
years yeah and it just kept going it's like it's her name it was named after her

876
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,120
yeah bro didn't it was anybody watching a show at that I was watching every

877
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,760
fucking episode I feel like I maybe have never met someone in my life who watched

878
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,360
Roseanne I've seen a lot of episodes Roseanne the old Roseanne was very

879
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,560
popular yeah yeah and everyone watched it yeah people and was it when was it

880
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:34,640
from 89 to 9 and the thing she got kicked off of was that like a reboot or

881
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,200
something? Yes. Okay. Yeah, that was a reboot. Let me see how close I was.

882
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,440
'89-'97? Yeah. That's a pretty big range. Late '80s makes sense. I think that was old

883
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:53,360
Norm's first writing job. Really? Yeah. Wow. '88. Okay. And it lasted for, holy fuck.

884
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:59,740
'97? May 20th, 1997. Holy shit. Wow. Dude, only a couple months after the war. Look at what

885
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,040
this Adderall has done to me. You've always been like that. Yeah, you always

886
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,400
- You always know all the dates for every show.

887
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,320
You just don't know like traffic laws and stuff.

888
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,160
- That's true.

889
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,520
- Yeah, so maybe that'll change.

890
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,360
- Maybe.

891
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,180
- Do you think we could get you behind--

892
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,520
- You know, I do know traffic laws

893
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,440
'cause I've passed my written driver's test three times.

894
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,360
- All right, let me give you some scenarios.

895
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,800
- I've never passed the driving portion.

896
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,000
- Let me give you some scenarios then.

897
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,480
You pull up at a light.

898
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,320
- All right, this is my driving test.

899
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
- Yeah, you pull up at a light, right?

900
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,160
- Go--

901
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,200
- Right, he said right.

902
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,680
No, we're not trying to do a trick question.

903
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,560
You pull up at a light, right?

904
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,400
- Turn right, 100,000 hours.

905
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
He said it again, that means it is a turn right going 60.

906
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,160
No, you turn, you pull up at a light.

907
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
Left.

908
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
Right?

909
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
And then you have a...

910
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
But I pull up.

911
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,160
No, okay.

912
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
He's with me.

913
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,160
Okay, so there's an op, right?

914
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,640
You pull up, okay, here's a traffic light question.

915
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,240
You pull up at a red light, right?

916
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,800
You see an op pull up at a car right next to you.

917
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,000
Are you reaching for your blicky or are you getting snatched?

918
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Blicky.

919
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,120
I think he's a blicky.

920
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,640
You reach for the blicky, that's right.

921
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,200
And you pull that fire on him.

922
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
You put five in his head.

923
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Okay.

924
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,520
Can you ask me some real traffic questions, not this stuff that you're making up?

925
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,000
That's actually, that was, that is on the test.

926
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Is that a DMV now? Nowadays, yeah.

927
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Because of gun violence.

928
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Chicago?

929
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
No, it's everywhere.

930
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
In the whole world, even beyond America.

931
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
The whole world, there's ops and blickies.

932
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Even beyond America and the planet.

933
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Different countries.

934
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Is that, is uh...

935
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Indonesia.

936
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Is op, that's...

937
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Stands for op olympia.

938
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Where's uh...

939
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Stands for OOPA OOPA.

940
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It stands for operator...

941
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Blicky originates from...

942
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Blicky originates from...

943
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,800
He originates from rap genius.

944
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,560
Op is actually, it's short for operator and it's a reference to Marble Hornets.

945
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,840
Slenderman, because Slenderman was their enemy.

946
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,440
Shout out Marble Hornets.

947
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
I'm trying to think.

948
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
I can see that.

949
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,240
There's just like some, oh there was something I learned the other day, because my TikTok

950
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:58,200
algorithm thinks that I was born in New York, so it's all these videos that are like, people

951
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,000
being like, oh man, the streets in New York are getting so bad.

952
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,960
That sounded like a brag. The TikTok algorithm thinks I was

953
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,160
born in New York.

954
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,400
No, but this, oh, it was a video where somebody said, I don't

955
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,600
know where I'm going with this.

956
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,400
You wanted to say this.

957
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,520
No, I really don't know where I'm going.

958
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,720
The etymology of...

959
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,560
The etymology of a word.

960
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,800
Of blicky, that's what you're trying to figure out?

961
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,520
You know what? First time I ever heard the word blicky was in

962
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,320
that 6ix9ine song. Okay, so that's good. So I think the Blicky

963
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:37,320
originates in Bushwick. Wow! Blicky actually is from the 1700s.

964
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,680
That's what the Union soldiers used to call their guns. Yeah, the

965
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:48,200
old muskets we used to call them "Blickeys". Oh, I've got a Blickey for ya!

966
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,640
You know the rappers in the UK don't have guns? Yeah, they have knives.

967
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,560
They have knives. And machetes. They're not allowed to use a gun.

968
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,840
Yeah, I guess shootings with a gun in the UK is completely fucking illegal.

969
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,440
It's crazy that people get each other with machetes over there.

970
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,440
It's crazy dude.

971
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,440
It's so scary.

972
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,280
That's scarier than a mass shooting.

973
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,520
How much harder is it to be also just like a gang member who has to kill somebody and

974
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,360
you get paid to do a hit.

975
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,040
You have to look him right in the eyes and you have to fucking stab him with a pocket

976
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,680
knife because it can't be over three inches.

977
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,520
You have to go kill the op, right?

978
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,340
Make sure you get him when he's lying on the bed

979
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,000
with his girlfriend, and make sure you get him

980
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,160
with an arrow and you stick it from the bottom of the bed

981
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,120
up and it goes through both of them.

982
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,200
And then also when the other one is walking on his hands,

983
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,160
you should cut him with the machete down through his legs

984
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,280
and cut him completely in half.

985
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,120
- Dude, there's a bunch of the rap songs over there

986
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,480
that talk about how you have to get a,

987
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,800
like when you get a gun, you have to go--

988
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,120
- I need a license for my knife.

989
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,520
- If you wanna get a gun, you have to go buy it

990
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,920
from like a farmer, and it's like fucking,

991
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,160
I don't like pipes and shit.

992
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,360
And so like anytime, like when people get caught with guns

993
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,420
in the UK, it's always just like the most fucked up gun

994
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,260
of all time.

995
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,080
- Yeah.

996
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,560
- And they didn't even kill the guy.

997
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,400
- Like a zip gun.

998
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,240
- Yeah, pretty much.

999
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,060
- They used to have--

1000
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,080
- It was used for like scaring away like a bird.

1001
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,720
- Yeah, they used to have a tutorial on YouTube

1002
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,560
on how to make a zip gun.

1003
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,400
- What's a zip gun?

1004
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,720
- Like a little like PVC pipe gun.

1005
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,800
- It works once and most of the time it explodes.

1006
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,800
- Yeah.

1007
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,800
I remember watching that where a kid took a bolt from a deadbolt.

1008
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Do you think they're using potato cannons over the UK?

1009
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Oh, absolutely!

1010
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Air spray in the back of a BSC pipe.

1011
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,800
"I got my arm pulled up in traffic!"

1012
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:42,800
Dude, when you start your car and you see the baking soda volcano start to bubble in the backseat.

1013
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
It's fucking over, bro.

1014
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,800
In Northern Ireland, a potato gun, was that an Armalite?

1015
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,000
Mm-hmm the east side slider say hello

1016
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:04,200
On the op and I've got I've got a little I've got a little red capsule

1017
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,800
Yeah, and I throw it into his cup of water and grows into a giant

1018
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,800
What you gotta do is you gotta find the chair that the opposite said all the time

1019
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,860
It's it's so one did in what is what is a bet suspected to be gang violence today in a Bristol classroom

1020
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,200
I

1021
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,480
Can remember dies of complete and I just I just killed by sitting on a whoopee cushion

1022
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,340
I just killed my ops pet bug with an air Zuka

1023
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:35,440
Gang members slip on banana peels all over the London streets tonight

1024
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:43,640
in a massive hit two people dead of largest gang hit in UK history must be weird in the UK like they

1025
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:50,400
I've never thought about like, maybe they're all drinking Guinness while they're doing

1026
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,400
this too.

1027
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,400
I don't fucking know.

1028
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
What the fuck?

1029
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Dude, I've checked out.

1030
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
I don't fucking know.

1031
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
What?

1032
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Oh my god.

1033
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
That was crazy.

1034
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
I'm too worried about being racial now.

1035
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
You're too worried about being racial?

1036
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Yeah, I think I said too much stuff.

1037
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Now you have racial regret.

1038
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
Yeah.

1039
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Yeah, I don't think that you were all that racial, so it's probably fine.

1040
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Yeah.

1041
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Yeah.

1042
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,400
I think I said too much stuff.

1043
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,400
I think I said too much stuff.

1044
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Yeah.

1045
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,400
I think I said too much stuff.

1046
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Yeah.

1047
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
I think I said too much stuff.

1048
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
Yeah.

1049
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,840
i think i've said some things but if you want we can make maybe the episode

1050
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,640
we could bleep out it we could maybe

1051
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,000
i think we could maybe bleep out every time you said the word black so it's not

1052
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,880
racial so nobody knows but just leave everything just leave everything

1053
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,520
surrounding and just bleep out the word black so just everyone knows you weren't

1054
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,960
being racist great idea i think we'll do that how did that

1055
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,240
conversation started because you guys said i look like white neil degrasse

1056
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,240
tyson you do kind of you know when you did the pose i think i think if someone

1057
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,160
traced that pose it would look pretty similar to the

1058
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,120
the rage comic. You just have a similar head shape and you have a nice little

1059
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,400
it's mostly it's the face where you can make a Neil deGrasse Tyson kind of face.

1060
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:55,100
Yeah and you have a mustache too. It rocked your world to be called a white

1061
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:00,480
Neil deGrasse. Wow yeah. Maybe one day I'll be as smart as him as a scientist. I would love to be Neil deGrasse's white son.

1062
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,920
He's a fucking genius. Yeah yeah. Can you imagine being his white son? Oh my god.

1063
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,460
Making him proud but a little more proud. Remember that Key and Peele sketch about him?

1064
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,820
No, no, I remember this one where they're like

1065
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:18,420
Remember the one where a a rock you

1066
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:24,100
Hmm a a wrong the substitute and you guys have some funny names

1067
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,100
You're my crazy student a a Ron and it's all about the crazy student. You're my crazy fucking student

1068
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,580
And then he gives them the bird. Yeah flicks in the bird

1069
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:36,320
No, he's a crazy bird on fucking and he says their names and he says like

1070
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:44,580
preening what preening hey no and i'm the crazy substitute is there someone here

1071
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,060

00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,300
pob yeah yeah and it's pronounced poob

1073
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,300
yep yeah it's actually blablian

1074
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,860
it's blablian it's blablian

1075
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,380
we should do our own versions of a lot of the pnpl skits

1076
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,820
turd hucking it's called turd hucking

1077
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,820
yeah and it's actually a sport that i'm named after

1078
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:13,980
Oh, it's funny. Yeah. Do you guys think you could ever be a teacher? Would all the kids

1079
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,900
names be too freaky these days? Yeah, hey, is there someone in here named Feather? Are

1080
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:25,660
you kidding? One kid makes fun of my shoes one day, I'd kill myself in the bathroom.

1081
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:29,340
I kill myself. You have to be an actual... And on the wall I write his name and I say

1082
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:36,340
it's your fault. You have to be kind of a psycho to be a teacher, I think. I feel like

1083
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:41,980
That's it. I feel like most other jobs where you like help people you at least get like paid kind of good. Yeah

1084
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,980
Yeah, and that one it's nothing you were

1085
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,180
Horrible you have to they don't pay you you don't you have a horrible like life

1086
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,900
basically

1087
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:55,220
Have you ever thought about how many how many of your teachers you look up like you have the yearbook at home?

1088
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,860
You're looking through like oh, yeah, that's mrs. Whatever. Mm-hmm. How many of them have like this smile?

1089
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,940
Yeah, they do have that smile. They have that wide

1090
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,700
- That three year old boy, you tell him to smile

1091
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,900
and he's just like, "Ah."

1092
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,980
- That apple stare.

1093
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,420
- Yeah, that's right.

1094
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,900
- That fucking apple stare.

1095
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,740
- That apple stare those teachers give you.

1096
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,640
- That wormed apple stare.

1097
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,060
When you ask for your grade and all she gives you

1098
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,180
is that wormed apple stare right back at you.

1099
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,500
- Wormed apple stare.

1100
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,580
- That's fucking awful, dude.

1101
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,860
- Think about how many, if you don't have that smile,

1102
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,980
you can't be a teacher.

1103
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,380
- Yeah, we should try to poison our teachers.

1104
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,220
- You know what it is?

1105
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,040
You know what it is?

1106
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,040
That, I think instinctively you see that as a child

1107
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,900
and it's like, okay, this teacher could kill me.

1108
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,740
- I feel like I would get--

1109
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,500
- This is like a primal thing.

1110
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,980
I immediately view my teacher as a threat and I must obey.

1111
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,900
- I would become a teacher just so I could be

1112
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,220
on the front lines of mass shooting,

1113
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,180
like detection and elimination.

1114
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,420
'Cause I do think that if,

1115
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,020
it's because I feel I would get,

1116
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,820
I'd have psychological profiles in my notebook

1117
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,340
of every single kid, right?

1118
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,860
One kid's getting a little too close

1119
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,820
to a kind of Lanza style. - Kids are going crazy nowadays.

1120
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:06,260
And I would either put him down prematurely,

1121
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,060
right, like before a dog has really bad cancer,

1122
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,740
it's like you gotta do something about this, right?

1123
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,660
I'm not chopping the legs off, I'm putting him down.

1124
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,420
- Yeah, you just put stuff in his lunch food.

1125
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,940
- Yeah, or honestly, if I know that he's gonna do it

1126
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,620
even years from now, it's like, bro,

1127
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,300
just fucking plant something on him

1128
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,340
and report it to the guidance counselor.

1129
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,100
He's gonna be in juvie, right?

1130
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,460
- Definitely. - He can't do shit in juvie.

1131
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,900
And then by the time he's an adult,

1132
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,920
not my problem anymore.

1133
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,900
If he wants to go shoot up a fucking Ruby Tuesday,

1134
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,900
that's on the manager that Tuesday.

1135
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,740
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1136
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,580
- You know, that's not on me.

1137
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,900
- And there's a lot of Ruby, there's a lot of--

1138
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,220
- I'm about protecting my kids.

1139
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,260
- There's a lot of defense forces on Ruby Tuesday.

1140
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,500
- I'm about to say something crazy out of pocket.

1141
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,580
- Word. - Okay.

1142
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,900
- Okay. - Something crazy.

1143
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,740
- Do it.

1144
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,160
- But I feel like with these teachers,

1145
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,020
all the apples they're eating,

1146
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,540
you cut open their head, there'd be a worm in there.

1147
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,660
- A worm running them like inside out.

1148
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,740
- Yeah, or just a worm in their brain like an apple worm.

1149
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,780
- Like a-- - Well, who likes apples the most?

1150
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,380
- Probably a teacher. - Probably a teacher.

1151
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,540
- A horse, so maybe that's what's behind

1152
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,740
all these teachers' attitudes.

1153
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,420
Maybe that's where their smile is from.

1154
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,300
- And they be kicking those things back.

1155
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,500
I had a teacher who had a horse's ass.

1156
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,820
- Yeah? - Yeah, big fucking legs.

1157
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,640
- I had a teacher who also had a--

1158
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,460
- I saw a lady's tail flapping in the breeze

1159
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,300
the other day. - Ass like a horse.

1160
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,120
- You ever hear a guy say that?

1161
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:12,960
- But she had a thyroid problem.

1162
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,140
- She had a ass like a horse and a guy does this.

1163
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,980
- Oh, she had a ass like a fucking horse.

1164
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,740
- It's like, why you wanna fuck a horse, bud?

1165
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,700
- On a human.

1166
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,500
- Yeah. (laughing)

1167
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,060
- Well, yeah, a horse's ass would be hot.

1168
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,700
- It's not like it's a horse then.

1169
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,660
- And she could, you know, it's two for one

1170
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,540
'cause then, you know, normally you're having sex

1171
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,980
and there's all these flies right above your penis.

1172
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,500
He's swatting 'em away with her tail.

1173
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,460
- Yeah, the other, well then, you know,

1174
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,700
they also don't know how to hold their penis.

1175
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,540
- Well, like, listen, here's what--

1176
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,060
- Yeah, and they're stupid, too.

1177
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:40,900
- Here's what I'll say.

1178
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,820
If you saw a horse with a human ass,

1179
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,420
you wouldn't fuck it 'cause that's a horse.

1180
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,260
- Of course, yeah. - Exactly.

1181
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,820
- So if a woman has a horse ass,

1182
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,980
you could still fuck her 'cause that's a human.

1183
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,060
- That's easy, that's an easy hookup for you.

1184
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,660
- Yeah, that's instant.

1185
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,300
- Yeah, it fucking fits in perfectly.

1186
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,140
- Yeah.

1187
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:56,980
- Or no, it doesn't fit in perfectly.

1188
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,980
I know, and what you said--

1189
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,180
Don't you feel like you wouldn't be enough for a woman with a horse's ass, because those

1190
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,340
horse cocks are so big?

1191
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,740
I'd use a machine.

1192
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,740
Extenderer.

1193
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,980
Oh, you wouldn't try--

1194
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,060
They do make those.

1195
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,580
You can get like a penis extension.

1196
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,100
I have one with a drill on it.

1197
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,100
Yeah.

1198
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,260
Yeah, who hasn't looked into making one?

1199
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:16,380
I've looked into it, and it always looks like the hole for the penis is too small, because

1200
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,980
I-- trust me, my thing is wide, but it's short.

1201
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:20,980
Mm-hmm.

1202
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,980
Stubby.

1203
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,980
Yeah.

1204
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,980
It looks like I--

1205
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,980
My thing looks like Walton Goggins.

1206
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,220
Yeah, my thing looks like Shrek's thumb. It's green too.

1207
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:29,720
But don't you want...

1208
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,220
And I don't think that'll fit in a...

1209
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:35,220
But you're like, your penis is like an octopus. It can fit through a thing the size of a dime.

1210
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,220
Yeah, you can squish it.

1211
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,220
But you have to put it in like hard.

1212
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,220
Well, that's why, that's the point of the penis biggerers is because...

1213
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,720
You don't even have to be hard.

1214
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,220
You're like burning, or not, you're like tearing your penis muscles so that they grow bigger and stronger.

1215
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,220
It's like working out.

1216
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,720
Yeah, it's like working out, bud.

1217
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,720
I don't know.

1218
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,720
Work your ball or your dong out.

1219
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,220
I don't think it's like working out at all because it's like...

1220
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:57,540
like exactly like we're close to working out no yeah because it's more it's it's

1221
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:02,660
like the it's more like wearing a fake bicep I think it's like when spongebob

1222
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,220
gets those big arms yeah anchor arms yeah that's this that's what you're doing for

1223
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:10,500
your penis I don't think so I think you guys are talking about two different

1224
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,620
things yeah I think you're talking I think Caleb's talking about joking I'm

1225
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:17,060
talking about joking no I'm talking I think any me and Patrick we're talking

1226
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,260
like a bionic arm or d-

1227
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,100
- Oh no.

1228
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:19,940
- It's like a hollowed out-

1229
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,780
- Oh no.

1230
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,600
- It's like a hollowed out penis.

1231
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,440
- Oh no.

1232
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,940
- No, I'm talking about jelking.

1233
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,780
- I know, but we're not talking about that.

1234
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,600
- It's a hollowed out penis.

1235
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,700
- Oh, okay, I'm understanding.

1236
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,540
So how are you gonna trick-

1237
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,420
- It's a hollowed out plastic penis.

1238
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,420
- It's not about tricking.

1239
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,260
- Oh, it's just like a-

1240
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,180
- It's just a machine.

1241
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,060
- But it doesn't, then you don't get to fucking nut cum.

1242
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,300
- It's just a simple machine.

1243
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,900
- You get to nut, but it's inside of a plastic toy.

1244
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,740
- Yeah, inside, so on the outside,

1245
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,460
it looks like a transformer's finger.

1246
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,460
It's a finger.

1247
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,460
It's got a lot of these ones.

1248
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,000
It looks like Optimus Prime's sword on the outside.

1249
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,060
On the inside, it feels and looks exactly like a fleshy organ.

1250
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,060
Fudge.

1251
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,140
Do they have one that just kills the woman while you're fucking her?

1252
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,820
It looks exactly like fudge.

1253
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,100
Fudgy, fleshy, modge podge.

1254
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,220
But is there one where you put it into the woman and it just instantly kills her?

1255
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,220
Yeah, and it's real.

1256
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,220
What?

1257
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,220
A thing that you put on her?

1258
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,220
It's the one that we're talking about.

1259
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:10,940
There are some people in those videos where it's like the people are putting their heads

1260
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,940
up their asses.

1261
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,780
- Yeah.

1262
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,500
- There's people who put like the really long ones,

1263
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,720
like it's like they're really snaking out like a pipe.

1264
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,660
- Yeah, I don't understand all that.

1265
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,700
- And it's just a plastic penis that's going

1266
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,340
all the way in their belly.

1267
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,500
- It's hitting the roof of your mouth.

1268
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,340
- Yeah.

1269
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,860
- Go buy a Halloween show ticket.

1270
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:34,220
We're gonna be wearing those live.

1271
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,500
Like we said, I mean we said it before,

1272
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,980
lots of cool people, Sarah Squirm, Pierce Campion.

1273
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:40,820
- Eric Rayhill.

1274
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:45,820
Eric Rayhill, Jack Bensinger, we got a whole squad on there.

1275
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,820

Tim Allen.

1277
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,820
Crazy video, you seriously cannot miss it.

1278
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,820
Come in costume, bring a pillowcase for candy.

1279
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,820
Gotta have my candy, yeah yeah.

1280
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:59,820
I hope this episode didn't make you feel any less spanky.

1281
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,820
And I'm stopping the recording.
