1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
The year is 2012.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,840
We're in a musty courtroom in Palo Alto, San Francisco, where the trial of the century

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,840
is taking place.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,560
I think I'm kissing my twin.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,800
You see the bailiff, who barks, "All rise for Judge Sullivan!"

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Everyone stands up.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,680
There's a stout frog.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,220
waddles his way to the judges podium.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,060
I don't know what it's called.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,400
I thought about it for a second.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,840
- You don't need to stand up.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,920
Don't worry. It's all good.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,380
So thank you. Thank you.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,220
You can sit.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,660
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,180
to begin the trial of the three-way trial,

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,200
the first ever in American history

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,100
over the creation of the website Diaper Talk.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,900
A website allegedly created by Mark Zuckerberg.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,540
- Not really allegedly created by me.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,380
- Oh yeah.

22
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,460
- It actually was created by me.

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,220
- We'll see about that, won't we?

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,600
- All right, quiet in the court.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,440
Thank you.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,020
Mr. Zuckerberg, I don't remember,

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,020
I didn't look up anything about how courts work.

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,780
Mr. Zuckerberg, how do you plead?

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,240
(laughing)

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,900
- I plead as the owner, operator, sole founder

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,540
and creator of DiaperTalk.com.

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,580
- The guilty owner and co-founder and creator.

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,380
- The not guilty owner, co-founder, founder, not co-founder.

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,660
- Not guilty of creating the website.

35
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,060
- The owner, I plead guilty of creating the website,

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,620
your honor. - Guilty to stealing money.

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,460
- I plead. - From the real creator

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,880
of the website. - I plead, shut up!

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,980
- Okay, order, order.

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,340
All right, the jury, you heard that.

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,860
So in this very unorthodox kind of court here

42
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,440
where we have Mr. Zuckerberg,

43
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,740
who is being accused of stealing the property

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,940
and of not giving credit to Mr. Eduardo Saverin,

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,140
his former business partner,

46
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,140
and of stealing the original idea from

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,460
- The Finger Bros.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,260
The Finger Bros. Twins.

49
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,220
- From the Finger Bros. Twins.

50
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,980
Underwear conversation.

51
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
You said underwear.

52
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,980
Underwear?

53
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,980
You said underwear also.

54
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,980
Do I read this intro? I wrote the whole intro.

55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,980
Well, we'll do that in a second.

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,980
So before we begin this three-way unorthodox trial,

57
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,980
I need each of you to choose your lawyers.

58
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,980
From who?

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Three lawyers walk out in front.

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Okay.

61
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,980
So to do this first, I need everyone to roll a d20.

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:03:01,460
me. Who got the highest? I got a 17. I got a plane around. I got a six. What'd you get?

63
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,700
Yeah, I changed it from a nine. I got a two. Okay. I saw you turn it. I thought I just wanted

64
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:13,580
to hear you say it. Okay. Mr. Saverin, you get the first pick of lawyer. You have a Southern

65
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,580
lawyer, a New York style lawyer.

66
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,280
What does that mean?

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,140
He's New York style.

68
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,540
I like the sound of that.

69
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,020
Like a bake.

70
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,340
I'll give you more descriptions.

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,060
Would you say that the New York style lawyer is the best one?

72
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,540
No, not necessarily.

73
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,700
And then, and then there's a girl lawyer.

74
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,420
You can go.

75
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,780
Yeah.

76
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,260
That's the, what do you, so there's Southern lawyer.

77
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,180
That's the sort of friendly, persuasive, insightful, maybe too forthright for his

78
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,980
own good though, all around very solid.

79
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,300
Well, due to my personal experience of having to doing an internship in

80
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,200
New York based on my character or my own history, which I know about.

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
I think I would have to go with the New York lawyer.

82
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,920
Nasty, direct and intimidating.

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,560
Great arguments.

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,880
Great arguments.

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,280
Raises your ceiling, but not your floor.

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,880
Wait, what?

87
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,640
The most friendly.

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,080
I forget you rolled this.

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,400
That's right.

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Yeah.

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,160
And then there's the girl lawyer.

92
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
She will cry.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,680
She will use her feminine wiles, but do we still need this music?

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,820
But you can't like execute that sort of her problem.

95
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,320
They each have specialties.

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
You chose the New York lawyer, though.

97
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,420
Yeah.

98
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,420
All right, but we're going to win this case.

99
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,720
Let me tell you it's going to be one to bada bing bada, but he's

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
still my friend, but he's still my friend.

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,420
That's good, too.

102
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,920
Okay.

103
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:36,220
Bada buddy is still my friend.

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,520
Bada bing bada, but he's still my friend.

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,640
Okay, now we'll go clockwise from here. Well, I mean, that's how the roles were.

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,680
Oh, it was. Yeah.

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,720
So we go. I guess I'm choosing a bang. What was your finger?

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,320
And I think that we will go with the southern lawyer.

109
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Well, I'm quite familiar with the tops of I am a rooster. I need you to not be

110
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,560
frightened by that. But I know you're your accent. You're poor. Well,

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,260
I know I'm just from a region of the country where we talk a

112
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,160
certain way.

113
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
Ah, oh dear.

114
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,660
That was my other twin.

115
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,160
That was my twin who got he got scared because he was on his

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,760
phone.

117
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,860
Now he's looking up.

118
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,560
Well, I'm going to need you to pay attention.

119
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,060
So we are so we can win this.

120
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,660
Oh, you're going to keep that's a feather.

121
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,560
That is really that is really the kind of Saudi big thing.

122
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,460
Yeah, you're doing good.

123
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,360
It's really good.

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,760
And then I'm afraid you will have to have the girl lawyer.

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,040
It's actually kind of just like the movie.

126
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Mrs. Zuckerberg.

127
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,040
Is it Rashida Jones?

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,480
It is Rashida Jones.

129
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,920
Oh yeah.

130
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,160
Whoa, whoa.

131
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,640
And holy shit.

132
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,200
Hello Rashida.

133
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
I did not know you had that impression in you.

134
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,280
Well, Mark, looks like we're going to be working together.

135
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,920
OK.

136
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,880
She does this face.

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,840
Yeah.

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,320
Yep, you're so awesome.

139
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,520
So excited to work with you.

140
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,800
Really looking forward to working with you.

141
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,120
The truth is, a fucking aunt could do your job.

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,600
Because this fucking case is so clear cut.

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,880
I can't believe I'm wasting my time here.

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,880
- And now, so you guys can do your opening statements

145
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,000
or you can have your lawyers do it.

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
You can kind of decide.

147
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
- I think that I will probably draw a circle

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,900
while my lawyer does my opening statement.

149
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,680
- Ladies and gentlemen, okay, also first,

150
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,760
the rules by the way.

151
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,680
So we're going to be doing a retelling of that's not really a

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
circle. It looks like more like a heart. Yeah, that's like a lump.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,520
Then I'll try again. We're going to be doing a... That's a butt.

154
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,360
So we're going to be doing a retelling of... Your circle's got a,

155
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,600
like a turn. Your circle's more like a beat or a turn up. Why do you put a point on your circle?

156
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,680
We're going to be doing the retelling. I don't know why he does it.

157
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,840
It looks like a speech bubble. We're going to be doing a retelling of...

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
Why can't you draw a circle? Stop. That's an oval.

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
Well, now you got a little face. You know what you were doing there. You got a face there.

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
It looks like a face. Yeah.

161
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,840
We're going to be doing a retelling of

162
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,520
the events leading up to today.

163
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,880
And after each sort of juncture of

164
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
those events,

165
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,760
we're going to have sort of I can't

166
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,400
fucking win.

167
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,700
There's a circle right there that you

168
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,720
could be tracing the whole time.

169
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Depending on how you perform in

170
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,960
these past events, we're

171
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,560
then going to roll dice.

172
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,920
This is you know, this is

173
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,120
more disrespectful than usual.

174
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,400
All right, teacher.

175
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,240
He's in character.

176
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Teacher. He is.

177
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,480
He actually is a character in that sense.

178
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,440
No, so just very quickly, we're just

179
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,240
going to retell the whole story, very similar to the movie.

180
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,280
But each time that we reach an end point of the story,

181
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,200
it's going to be one of you getting called to the stand.

182
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,780
Your lawyer is going to interview you.

183
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,920
We're going to go back, flashback to that time.

184
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,880
Then another lawyer is going to cross-examine you,

185
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,760
one of the two other lawyers.

186
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,880
And then depending on how you performed in the past,

187
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,520
depending on a role from your lawyer and the bonus role

188
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,960
you will get based on your past performance, you will try to win over the jury.

189
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Okay.

190
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,920
And after all of those, we'll sort of tally up the winners and losers and see who...

191
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,640
Just throw a beer at Pat.

192
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Come on, man.

193
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,440
I better not have spilled it.

194
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
Okay, enough with the music.

195
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm bringing the music back as many times as possible.

196
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,920
Perfect. Yeah, keep it up.

197
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,440
All right.

198
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,840
So because you won first, Mr.

199
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Saverin,

200
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,000
we're going to start with your

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
New York lawyers.

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,740
We'll start with you. But first,

203
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,720
let's have all your opening

204
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,340
statements. So you start, Mr.

205
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Saverin.

206
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,420
Honestly, I can't even believe

207
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,440
that I'm here doing

208
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
this because it

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,200
seems like I shouldn't have to be.

210
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,120
But because I am, I guess all I want to say is that Mark is still my best friend.

211
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,560
And I almost broke the monitor.

212
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,800
You almost broke the monitor.

213
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,520
That's not even something you would do.

214
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:12,760
Yeah.

215
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,560
Zuck wouldn't do it.

216
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,400
You're you're wait until like 45 minutes in.

217
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,240
You have to be playing.

218
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,360
You have to be playing a wimp.

219
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,760
They make him do his opening statement first.

220
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,200
Yeah.

222
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,920
He has to do his opening statement.

223
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,960
You do your opening statement first.

224
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,240
You do it first.

225
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
Here's that attention you ordered, buddy.

226
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,240
Yeah.

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,160
Ooh.

228
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,360
I actually hate attention.

229
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,280
From the movie.

230
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,640
Fatality.

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
Now he's opening statement

232
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
bitch

233
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,700
liar

234
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,300
two fat twins.

235
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,900
These are the people that I see in front of me today.

236
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
The bitch is your lawyer.

237
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,300
You

238
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,900
you should I should have let you kill yourself in freshman year

239
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
when I caught you in the bathroom

240
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,000
trying to overdose on Tums

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
you

242
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,260
Yeah. Keep rowing. You're really, really good at that. The business stuff is not

243
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,860
for you. It's almost it's honestly funny as fuck that two twins were so good at

244
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,420
rowing.

245
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,580
Well, one of us is right handed and I'm left handed.

246
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,300
My twin is right handed and I'm left handed. Is that true? Yeah.

247
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,260
See like this is crazy. What's your name? The Finger Bros. No, what's your

248
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,980
first name?

249
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,780
what the one I'm talking to right now. What's your first name? Your first name

250
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,680
figure? My name is the finger bros twins. So we've got do we have like sort of a

251
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,740
hive mind situation? No. So what then what's your name? The other one that I

252
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,380
wasn't talking to just now. What's your first name? It's hot and whoa,

253
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,420
it's fuk you and

254
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,860
well, I'm hun. This is

255
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,360
whoa

256
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,960
anyway. It's crazy that you were so genetically blessed and so good at one

257
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,100
thing, and then you decided that you wanted to make websites instead of do

258
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,940
that. I love web. I love web 2.0.

259
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,700
Yeah, I mean that's yeah, I'm sure you do anyway. This whole thing is bullshit

260
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,380
your honor. Yeah, you just said yeah, it's over. That's not you should address

261
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,460
the jury, really jury. This whole thing is bullshit. Hello. I think thank you. I

262
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,220
think that I will soon be proven to be guilty of starting the website and not

263
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,540
guilty of stealing the website from

264
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,820
my Hispanic friend over here,

265
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,580
who is Hispanic, by the way. I mean, this is what Cameron thinks a Hispanic guy

266
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,260
looks like. He dressed up like this

267
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,440
for those listening. I'm actually Jewish, by the way, look up Eduardo Saverin from

268
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,460
from the social network. He wears exactly. I know it's a perfect cost twins.

269
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,720
You don't need to look them up. Everyone knows that they look like you don't

270
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,540
look like the Winklevoss twins. Hello.

271
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,940
All right, all right. Anyway, that's the end of my state. Thank you. I'm going to

272
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,580
try this circle thing. I'm going to give it another. Yeah, it's sort of confusing,

273
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,300
but I think we got it. I missed us.

274
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:29,120
he's a frog. He rivets come on. It's he kind of those lack

275
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,920
mid a mid sentence ribbit

276
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,780
see the southern rooster like full shame.

277
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,800
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

278
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,020
Basically, I just can't even believe that we're here having this trial.

279
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:57,500
And honestly, Mark is still basically my best friend in the world, even though

280
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,820
he's trying to fucking steal all my stuff.

281
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,060
And I love him so much.

282
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,700
And honestly, I think he only made this billions of dollars website because he

283
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,540
was jealous of me and my internship and my friends that I had.

284
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,620
So I think the jury will see that Mark, he did not make the site and he did not

285
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,100
make any of the money rightfully.

286
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,620
And actually it was me, the guy who paid a thousand dollars worth of server time

287
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,740
who should get 50% of the company.

288
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,640
Yeah.

289
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,420
The jury nods.

290
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,140
They're like, God, that sounds good.

291
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,420
That's it.

292
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,620
It sounds like it makes sense.

293
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,540
Um, all right.

294
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,260
And Mr.

295
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,620
Mr.

296
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,980
And you have to put my name in the logo.

297
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,460
I'm whoa.

298
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
Hello.

299
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Whoa.

300
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Hello.

301
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
You're opening statement to the jury.

302
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Okay.

303
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,460
An introduction to yourself.

304
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,720
Hello.

305
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,260
We are the Finger Bros Twins and we love social media.

306
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,500
From an early age we were completely enamored with website design.

307
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,340
By the age of 13 we had already purchased the website twinks.com.

308
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,700
A portmanteau of the two words that we love the most, twins and links.

309
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,820
Within a year, we had already sold the domain to an investor named Sean Cody.

310
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,980
We were raised in Westport, Connecticut, in a house bought by our two twin fathers.

311
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,060
I know you were wondering how we have twin fathers, but it's actually quite simple.

312
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,220
Our twin fathers split asexually in 1981, and then they had sex with our one mom who

313
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,640
gave birth to us 12 months later.

314
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,540
Our summers were spent learning how to row crew at Camp Two Creeks, an adult summer camp

315
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,480
exclusively made for twins to learn about twin culture.

316
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,420
But while we were there, we discovered something so incredible.

317
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,180
Our love of diapers.

318
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,760
Our love of diapers later merged with our love of website design, which inspired us to create

319
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,800
our magnum opus, abltwinks.com, a website for diaper lovers who are twins that also

320
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,040
love links.

321
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,420
We had our website, but we didn't know how to create it, so we hired Mark Zuckerberg to

322
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,440
design it, which he then stole.

323
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Okay.

324
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Hello.

325
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,480
Okay, hello, a little bit of an admission there, but we'll just

326
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,640
gloss over admission of what nothing. So I caught it and

327
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,880
Rashida definitely did. I did because she's an ace attorney.

328
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:23,120
What? Yeah, I'm pretty good at what I do. Hello. Okay, so let's

329
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,280
all that was all very thank you everybody. Mr. Zuckerberg, would

330
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,240
you please go to the stand? Oh, wait, hold on. Yeah. Would you

331
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm going to go to the call on you to the stand. Nope, I'm not moving. You

332
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,680
have to bring the stand to me. Can I go to the stand?

333
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,040
Just once, how let's bring the stand or you have to pick me up and bring me

334
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,040
over to the stand because I'm not moving. I'll pick him up. Mark aren't

335
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,000
the finger bros brothers such dweebs. Remember how we used to laugh about

336
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,200
this kind of stuff finger bros brothers. Can you pick up mark and put him on

337
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,840
the stand? Absolutely okay. Let's pick him up. You pick him up with your left

338
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
and I'll pick him up with my right hand.

339
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Okay.

340
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Roll arm.

341
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
That's Nat 20.

342
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,880
You just like, you toss him in the air and he floats down and slots into the stand.

343
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Much better.

344
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Okay, what do you want to ask me?

345
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,880
And by the way, Eduardo, we're not friends. Stop talking to me like that, please.

346
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Okay, Mark. It's me, Rashida, again.

347
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Hello.

348
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,880
So, I want to ask you about your time back at Emerson University.

349
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Bleep it.

350
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,880
The best school in Boston.

351
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Yeah, whatever.

352
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
What about it?

353
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Let's take us back to that day when you first came up with the idea of Diaper Talk.

354
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,920
talk. And so we're going to flash back now to you're on a date with a girl.

355
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,440
And I'm sitting one table over in a disguise.

356
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,360
Disguise is another girl.

357
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:16,760
And no, that's perfect. Yeah, yeah, hit it. And you're just this is going to be a series

358
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:34,440
is

359
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,640
Why are you talking to me like that?

360
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,400
We've been dating for four months.

361
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,660
Slut says what?

362
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,880
I can't do this anymore, Mark.

363
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Can't do what?

364
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,220
Be a slutty bitch?

365
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,500
I'm breaking up with you.

366
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,620
And also you're dumb.

367
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,520
Roll a constitution saving throw.

368
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,680
Which circle is that?

369
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,180
Sorry, roll heart.

370
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,400
On the other side of the page.

371
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,240
Yeah.

372
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,360
Four, and then with my heart, it's four.

373
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Um, you feel so upset by this break.

374
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,360
As much, as upset as Mark Zuckerberg in this iteration can feel.

375
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,360
It's starting to hurt your confidence.

376
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
I think I might be hungry or something.

377
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Yeah, well, why don't you go get yourself something to eat then?

378
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
I think you will get me something to eat.

379
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Behind her is a jock and he says, "Hello."

380
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,360
"Hey."

381
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,360
"Ahh! Ahh! Get away!"

382
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
"Is this guy bothering you?"

383
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:55,360
"Yes! She's bothering me! Get away! Ahh! Don't hurt me!"

384
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,040
And he takes the girl and he walks away.

385
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,240
Eduardo, you're watching all this?

386
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Yeah.

387
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Yeah.

388
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Are you there?

389
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
I go like this.

390
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Mark.

391
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:17,600
Eduardo, as the jock leaves, another strapping, handsome young man comes up to you and gives

392
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,040
you a card.

393
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,640
It's a foil Charizard card.

394
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
You've been tapped to join the Charizard Club.

395
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,920
The most exclusive club in Emerson University.

396
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I jizz in my pants.

397
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
(Laughter)

398
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
(Laughter)

399
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
(Laughter)

400
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
(Laughter)

401
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
(Laughter)

402
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
(Laughter)

403
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
(Laughter)

404
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
(Laughter)

405
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
(Laughter)

406
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
(Laughter)

407
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,460
Oh, man.

408
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,060
Wait, what's that smell?

409
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,060
He knows my smell.

410
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,060
It smells like Eduardo's fucking jizz in this bar.

411
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,060
So we go back to the courtroom.

412
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,060
And after Eduardo jizzed his pants.

413
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
Yes, I did smell it.

414
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:17,060
(laughter)

415
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:23,700
You went back to your dorm room and you started to make a website.

416
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,980
What... and it was sort of a mean prank, some would say.

417
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,100
I took photos of my ex-girlfriend, then ex-girlfriend,

418
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,380
previously my girlfriend, then ex-girlfriend.

419
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Cool.

420
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,500
Yeah.

421
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,340
And I used...

422
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,380
I used Photoshop to put her in different photos of diapers that I found.

423
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,980
Backgroundless PNGs, are you familiar?

424
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
Or is that too over your head?

425
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
Um, I got it, yeah.

426
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Okay.

427
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,980
I put her in diapers and I posted them on a website called...

428
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,980
The... The Diaper Talk.

429
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,980
And some would say you... So, allegedly, and this is true,

430
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,300
truly this is recorded in the Emerson Gazette that you sent these links out to thousands

431
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,900
of different students to rate which diaper looked best on her.

432
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:30,140
I did. Yes, I had Huggies, pull-ups, kind of custom diapers that I found with pictures

433
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,540
of Batman on them.

434
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,340
Now I want to draw attention to this to the jury. This is somebody who was already thinking

435
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,420
about diapers even back then. Okay?

436
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,340
I was thinking of diapers way before that. I was thinking about diapers when I was like

437
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,740
7, 8 or 9 years old. You weren't thinking about diapers, you were wearing them Eduardo.

438
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,820
There's a difference. Objection your honor! What does this have to do with anything? I

439
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,220
don't know what objection means so I'm gonna... you guys just stop talking. I'm wearing the

440
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
diaper now.

441
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,900
Just one of you?

442
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
As am I.

443
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
Overruled.

444
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Sorry.

445
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
What?

446
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,300
I was delayed reaction to my own sentence.

447
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:22,460
So now when you made this website, what was going through your mind, Mr. Zuckerberg?

448
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,100
I was imagining what kind of foods she was eating and what the poop would look like inside

449
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,060
the diapers if she was eating corn and peanuts or if she had a healthy diet and it's going

450
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,100
to be firm, thick brown logs.

451
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,700
Jerry, this sounds like somebody who is incredibly interested in the world of diapers.

452
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:48,760
Somebody who, even in their darkest moments, were still choosing to invest in building

453
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,940
something related to diapers.

454
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,100
While the accusing parties here, they're just sort of along for the ride.

455
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah. So you did fail being able to sustain yourself for the

456
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,960
breakup like you were upset by. I took some damage didn't I? You didn't take damage.

457
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,140
You're only going to be able to add a d4 to this next roll against the jury.

458
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:20,780
I'll reroll it. That would have been nice for you. It's CeeLo rules. As soon

459
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,020
as a die stops. It didn't stop. It didn't stop. I picked it up but it looked like

460
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,120
I was going to stop on 20.

461
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,460
So now I roll a d4?

462
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,460
Yeah.

463
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,380
Oh, my God, wait, you rolled a 12.

464
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,820
There's 12 people in a jury.

465
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,900
Holy shit.

466
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,140
This might be a unanimous decision.

467
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,780
So now, Eduardo,

468
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,100
your lawyer goes

469
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,220
up to talk to Zuck.

470
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,220
All right.

471
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,140
Sorry, I'm also a frog.

472
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,640
you

473
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,280
am so mark. Do I look like I got

474
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,220
yes, like you look like a I think I picked the wrong

475
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:15,780
this is on the record. Do I look like I like to get the ladies like

476
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:27,760
is a lady. Do I look like I like to get fucked? Yes. All right, shit. So I was trying to set

477
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,340
you up for something, but you're way too on top of it. I know I'm very smart. No objection,

478
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,680
your honor. He clearly doesn't look like he likes to get fucked. His hair's all messy and

479
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:43,200
his pants are halfway down his body. He looks like he fucks. So you can't tell just from

480
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,560
this. Can we look at your ass to see if it looks like you like to get fucked? Do you

481
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:54,640
or wait fucking can be in and out talking to the to the lawyer right.

482
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,840
Yeah, okay. Well, we might as well throw you in there. Can I request a

483
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,080
short recess to go look at my lawyer's ass before he shows it on the stand?

484
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,680
No, that would be tampering with evidence. That's tampering with

485
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,320
evidence. Can I can I request a recess to do the same thing with my lawyer,

486
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,360
your honor? I'd like to request a recess so that my lawyer can fuck me

487
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,680
so I can prove that he fucks and doesn't get fucked.

488
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,760
I can't really allow that,

489
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,960
but I guess just as once if you want your lawyer to go fuck you, but I guess

490
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,300
that can happen. Well, I don't want to write, but there are things we want to

491
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,760
have to do in the course of life.

492
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,800
Okay, we'll take a ten minute break for you to get fucked by. We don't need ten

493
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,200
minutes.

494
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,760
Take like an hour and a half break

495
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,060
for that sort of thing.

496
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,960
You I am tied back there and you we only need two minutes.

497
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:53,920
Now that I'm done fucking that Hispanic guy, look, I don't believe this fucking prick for

498
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
one second.

499
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Now look at him.

500
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,760
Your honor, the lawyer has toilet paper on his foot.

501
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
That's not...

502
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,280
Did you guys fuck in the bathroom?

503
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,480
He has toilet paper on his shoe, on the bottom.

504
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,040
Oh I'm sorry, where were we supposed to fuck Mr. Genius?

505
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,600
We fucked in my car where I keep toilet paper in case I have to go when I'm driving because

506
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,560
I don't have a bathroom in my house because I can't afford one because of you.

507
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,480
for she to write this down. He keeps toilet paper in his car, write that down.

508
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,620
That'll be important later. If you wear diapers, you don't need toilet paper.

509
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,280
I don't wear diapers. I'm on the business end. I don't even know how to

510
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,880
send a friend request on diaper talk.

511
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:39,840
Now, look, you think that you know everything 'cause you wear a hoodie and

512
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,600
you got hair.

513
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,880
Yeah.

514
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,840
Let me tell you something about my client.

515
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,160
My client made sure that your website could exist.

516
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,160
He was there with you when he co-created it with you.

517
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,400
That's not true that you went home alone.

518
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,440
He was there, you smelled his jizz,

519
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,600
and you went back and you created it together.

520
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,440
- Okay.

521
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,000
- And I can prove that this is true.

522
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,040
- He came into my dorm room while I was writing

523
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,760
because I couldn't remember what a diaper looked like,

524
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,160
so he drew one on the window.

525
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,800
You're saying that that is tantamount

526
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,640
to being the co-founder of the website?

527
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,700
- Folks, jury, I wanna ask you.

528
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,700
You looked me in the eye and you told me that I would be the co founder of

529
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,300
Diaper Talk.

530
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,580
Why do you think... There's no proof for that. Why do you think Mr. Zuckerberg...

531
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,020
Oh yeah, I recorded the entire thing in this movie and I put this...

532
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:33,060
Well, some of the details were changed, I guess, to reach a broader audience.

533
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,540
Why do you think he would leave that part out until I pressed him?

534
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,500
First of all, it's 'cause I'm a very good lawyer from New York City.

535
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,220
Second of all... Who likes to get fucked? No, I fucked my client,

536
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,740
sold at through a point

537
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,940
and if he does get fucked he doesn't like it

538
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,700
precisely

539
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,620
and just like everyone who gets a lot of that and that's fair

540
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,460
the that with that admission i would just like to jury to reconsider maybe

541
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,500
think a little more

542
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,860
more with a little bit more a critical thinking

543
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,180
uh... a guy

544
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,900
who can admit what's true

545
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,540
who throws stuff

546
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,980
at the other other people here in this sort of generally kind of obnoxious in

547
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:19,420
deserves a fucking smack. Who did he throw something at? Right. All right. So he's going

548
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:27,260
to roll a d20. Huh? Where's my whoa. Where is it? It's over here. Oh my God. You it's

549
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:35,140
worth him. Rish buffoon lawyer. My Lord, you stay. It's just keep reaching. So that's Patrick.

550
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,140
Patrick's.

551
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh, you got it.

552
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,780
You're going to you're going to add a D6

553
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,780
because because

554
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,500
he lost the last one.

555
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,420
OK, I just roll a D6.

556
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,680
You're going to add that to this roll.

557
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,220
What I get?

558
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Seven.

559
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,140
Four.

560
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,340
Yes.

561
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,700
All right.

562
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,420
You are fail.

563
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,420
No, I'm not.

564
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,580
The dice are fail.

565
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,640
Now, I'm not responsible.

566
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,660
I'd like to call my client to the stand, Mr. Eduardo Severino.

567
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,980
Come on up, get over here.

568
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm up.

569
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,040
All right, thank you for coming.

570
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880
No problem.

571
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,260
I'm still here, you're sitting on my lap.

572
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,700
No, he's not.

573
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,660
You can't just say what's happening.

574
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,020
Stop grinding on me, Eduardo.

575
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,220
Only I could do that.

576
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,940
Stop grinding on me, we're not best friends anymore.

577
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,780
You can't do this anymore.

578
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,600
Stop, stop.

579
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,740
Well, best friends don't do this.

580
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,620
I'm gonna have my hand on your cheek.

581
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,580
I feel like I have to stop this,

582
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,660
but I don't really know what the rules are here.

583
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,540
Okay, I'll leave.

584
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,660
please stop grinding. Isn't that just like you? Why don't you run off to

585
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
California

586
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,440
and don't get grinded on my by Mr. Eduardo

587
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,800
Serino? You have a name of a foster's home for imaginary friends character. I

588
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,940
don't want to hear from you. Is it true that you got accepted into the Charizard

589
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,980
Club? Yes, and I just my pants when it happened right. We heard that from

590
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,440
to Zuckerberg earlier. So, is it now true that when you got invited into the club you had

591
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,860
to perform a series of, you had to perform in a series of games for full admittance?

592
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:17,540
Yes. The Charizard Club is very exclusive and what I had to do was I had to, and it's

593
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,740
probably one of the coolest clubs at the school. Everyone, the people in these clubs, they

594
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,380
going to become movie stars, TV stars.

595
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,220
- So we flash back to this time.

596
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,700
So you, after, and it's unclear,

597
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,140
but did you actually help Zuck?

598
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,440
I think so, we think so, maybe.

599
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,300
But we go back to you getting let into the child's art club.

600
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,500
- Well, if we're talking about the window scene,

601
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,580
what happened there is I busted into his room

602
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,420
and I saw a picture of a diaper on his computer

603
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,900
and I just drew it on the window.

604
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,860
- Yeah, that did happen.

605
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,860
- Look what I drew!

606
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,260
Look!

607
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,060
And in the Charizard Club, there's a series of games you have to play.

608
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,260
Okay.

609
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,260
There's the burlap sack race, the egg and spoon race.

610
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,560
Yeah.

611
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,760
There's a three-legged race and there's limbo.

612
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,260
Yeah, and you have to do all of those.

613
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,660
Okay, to get into the Charizard Club.

614
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,060
Right.

615
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,660
So you show up there and it's like, "Hi, welcome to the Charizard Club."

616
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,560
Oh my God.

617
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,860
I can't believe I'm here.

618
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:23,460
The only way you're gonna get in is if you complete our races.

619
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,960
What a Chad!

620
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,860
So first it's a burlap sack race.

621
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,360
Okay.

622
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,060
This is gonna be a series of balance ball checks.

623
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,560
Okay.

624
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,860
That you're gonna have to make.

625
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,360
Alright.

626
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,160
So you're all lined up.

627
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,660
Yep.

628
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,060
You have two other challengers in the burlap sacks.

629
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,860
And yeah, start rolling.

630
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,360
Okay.

631
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:45,860
Ready?

632
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,560
Go.

633
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,760
That's a 19 plus one.

634
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,620
Alright, you beat the beat.

635
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,300
The first racer like handedly.

636
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,700
You don't even need to like check.

637
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,500
He was trying to hop is like oh no.

638
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,700
Nice try, but actually calculated

639
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,940
the physics of the bag.

640
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,340
And then now you race against the other guy.

641
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,040
That's a three.

642
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,280
Oh no, so the other guy

643
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,640
is able to get out in front of you.

644
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,380
You get one more chance to beat him though.

645
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,740
He's like I'm going to win this

646
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,780
because I'm fucking killing you bitch.

647
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,080
OK, well, alright, that's his name.

648
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,680
I'm fucking killing you bitch. His name's fucking killing you bitch. Ten. Oh

649
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,500
Man, and he wins he gets out in front of you. So that's the first challenge. Okay, that's only the first one next challenge

650
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,080
Of course, I knew they were gonna be hard next challenge is the egg balancing challenge. Okay, I got this one in the bag

651
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
I do this every morning

652
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,920
Five okay, you win against that same guy. He's like no

653
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,000
Can I kind of throw the egg at him? Yeah, you do. Yeah, he's gonna try to catch it. He does not catch it

654
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I say oh that's gotta hurt

655
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,880
Yeah that too

656
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,400
Shut up, man

657
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,920
That's egg on my face. I'm rolling the next whatever the next thing is

658
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,320
Eight you beat him

659
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,360
Those are some really bad rules

660
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
insanely low rolls.

661
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,760
It's an exclusive club.

662
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
It's tough to get in.

663
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Yeah.

664
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Now, you can't get in with just any d20 roll.

665
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
The three-legged race.

666
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Oh, fuck.

667
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,920
I've never been able to do this.

668
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,080
So this, you get a partner.

669
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,200
I've been practicing this one.

670
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,020
I can never get it to work.

671
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,920
Each of you get a partner in this three-legged race.

672
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Here we go.

673
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,360
All right, that's another 20.

674
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Wow.

675
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,080
A crit one by this guy.

676
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
This guy is now out of the remaining competitions.

677
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Okay.

678
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
Yeah, because he died.

679
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
He died.

680
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
That's a net 20.

681
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
A net 20?

682
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
You clear this, you clear Limbo.

683
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Crit one.

684
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
I died in the three-second race.

685
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:57,080
And then the school had to shut down the Charizard Club for ages.

686
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,080
It's a dangerous club.

687
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
They know what they're getting into.

688
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
Not just anyone can get in.

689
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Actually, anyone can get into the Charizard Club.

690
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,080
And anyone who's listening is thinking, "Oh, that's not that hard."

691
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,080
That whole time, we were drinking beers.

692
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
I had two beers before Limbo.

693
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
I could get into the Charizard Club.

694
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Then why didn't you, Mark?

695
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Watch me.

696
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,080
I rolled a 16.

697
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
Plus my Charizard.

698
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,080
The jury is all like, "Yeah, maybe he can get into the Charizard Club. They're writing it down."

699
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Then why didn't you?

700
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Because I was busy creating the diaper talk.com.

701
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
Oh great, here we go again.

702
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
You fucking moronic.

703
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
So then we flash back.

704
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,080
He's just jealous of this Charizard club and that's why he made diaper talk I guess.

705
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
[Laughter]

706
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Based on the ending of this.

707
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Makes no sense.

708
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
We flash back to the courtroom.

709
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Now as you can see, my client handedly got into the Charizard club.

710
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Was cool as fuck. Everybody liked him. Everyone in Emerson liked him.

711
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Nobody had any problems with him.

712
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,080
him. And the guy who died, probably gay.

713
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:09,080
I don't think that was ever proven.

714
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
What does that have to do with anything?

715
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,080
The jury's like, "Okay." They're trying to figure out what that meant.

716
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Two of the jurors are just like...

717
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,080
So, you get a D8.

718
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
A date.

719
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Mark was on a D8 when?

720
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
5, 19.

721
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
That's 24.

722
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Now, a southern lawyer arrives on the scene.

723
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Well, well, well.

724
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Mr. Eduardo Saveron.

725
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Is it true that you are Latino?

726
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
No.

727
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
That is confusing.

728
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
You're not Argentinian.

729
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,080
I don't know.

730
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Or Chilean or one of those.

731
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Brazilian.

732
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Brazilian.

733
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,080
All I know is that I'm Jewish and I like Asian girls.

734
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Swag.

735
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
Let that enter into the record.

736
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:09,080
Sort of an axiomatic type of statement I would say.

737
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Now, Mr. Sovereign.

738
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
He's Brazilian.

739
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Now you will never be.

740
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
I don't think he's Jewish at all.

741
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
He is Jewish.

742
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
He could be Jewish.

743
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
He is Jewish.

744
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,480
He's a... I have seen it.

745
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,780
You saw it recently and you didn't know he was Jewish?

746
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,580
Your brain bleeped out the word Jewish.

747
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,880
His whole thing is he goes to the party and he says like,

748
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,280
"Why do Jewish guys like Asian girls?"

749
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,480
That's his whole thing.

750
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,580
How many dates Brenda Song?

751
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,680
I thought he was just talking about his friend.

752
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,380
No. Why would he be at the Jewish fraternity's party?

753
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,580
Mark Zuckerberg never hooks up with an Asian girl in the movie.

754
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,480
He only marries one in real life.

755
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,580
That's not true. No, he hooks up with her in the bathroom as well.

756
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,880
Yeah, next to each other.

757
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,780
Yeah, they are.

758
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
Yes, they are.

759
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,280
Yes.

760
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
They're both Asian.

761
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,780
No shit.

762
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,680
Yes, dude.

763
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
I can't see Chinese, I guess, man.

764
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
We didn't say Chinese.

765
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
We didn't even say Chinese.

766
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
You're throwing all these specifics at him.

767
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
What's wrong?

768
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,520
He gets racist one second end of just mentioning Asian girls?

769
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
No.

770
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
You got racist first.

771
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
How do we get racist?

772
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
You said she wasn't Asian.

773
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
What?

774
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
She wasn't Asian.

775
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
She was Asian.

776
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,340
It was an Asian girl and her friend, Jubio?

777
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,560
It's two Asian women.

778
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
It's not.

779
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,020
Look up Brenda Song and Brenda Song's friend in the social network.

780
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
It's two Asian women.

781
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,240
I saw this on a flight.

782
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,640
The social network bathroom scene.

783
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,880
I don't want to watch that scene.

784
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
bathroom stall scene

785
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
we don't have to watch this scene

786
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
bathroom kissing scene with brenda song

787
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
hd

788
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
laughing

789
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,880
she's asian

790
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
go back we want to see your friend

791
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,880
ok then go forward i guess

792
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
we're cutting this out

793
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
i guess they don't show it

794
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
it's implied it's her friend from earlier

795
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
this scene is gross

796
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,900
Just go just look at the cast. No, this is too much. Just trust this is three against one it is. Yeah, I remember it

797
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,140
I watch Asian descent this actress

798
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,760
Well, I would like to

799
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:10,080
Eduardo Saverin is a South American

800
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:18,520
uh never mind now look what is going on i don't even know regardless of the ethnicity or nationality

801
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,960

804
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:53,940

805
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,300
but I'm friends with one of the coolest guys in the world. Isn't that enough?

806
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,860
And who would that be?

807
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Mark Zuckerberg.

808
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Whoa.

809
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,040
Now, you're not friends with me.

810
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm best friends with Mark Zuckerberg. The Mark Zuckerberg.

811
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,480
such low self-esteem really have contributed anything to something as magnificent as DiaperTalk?

812
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,880
I know I love DiaperTalk. I didn't know self-esteem was what you needed to contribute to a website.

813
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,880
I thought it was almost $1,500 worth of funding. Huh? Now, DiaperTalk.com, look, I'm wearing

814
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:33,840
my diapers right now. We're all here loving DiaperTalk.com. But could somebody not wear

815
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,080
a diaper. Thank you in public unless they are confident and I would say Mr.

816
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,400
Severin here is not confident enough. He puts himself down. He thinks it's good

817
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,040
enough to get into the Charizard Club while the finger bros. What are you

818
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,120
about to wear my diaper right? Are you the alien from X-Men? Not X-Men. What's

819
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,240
that movie? Men in Black?

820
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,240
I guess those southern lawyer wouldn't have seen those movies.

821
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,640
Maybe

822
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,440
that up to date animal. Yeah, he's a bird. No, you I'm filling up my

823
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,140
diaper.

824
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,340
Now my client loves his diaper.

825
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,940
Which one?

826
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,640
Yeah, I said my client, which one they are. They are one in the same.

827
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,940
He has proven this.

828
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,140
So hello

829
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,840
and now I would just like you to reconsider

830
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,900
as cool as it was for a dwarves ever into kill one of the children

831
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,920
in that three-legged race

832
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,400
we have to consider

833
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,780
that he admitted himself he is not cool enough to wear a diaper in public

834
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,520
and some might say that spin but

835
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,280
i think we've been spun around enough today

836
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,480
you can say that again i still can't believe we're here

837
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,180
and uh...

838
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,300
you're all the six you didn't fail anything in this one

839
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,120
like twins

840
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,620
Two is the twins number.

841
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,820
Two is twins.

842
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,220
All right, you did quite well here, Eduardo.

843
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,220
I thought you were going to say, what, whoa and huh?

844
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,020
Me?

845
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,180
Whoa and huh, yeah.

846
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,340
You did fail.

847
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,660
Did whoa and huh fail?

848
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,300
What did you get on your die?

849
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,180
A 200.

850
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,700
Two.

851
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,980
You got a two.

852
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,620
Seems like not everything's working out for the finger

853
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,380
winkle-ers.

854
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,060
Finger bros.

855
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,820
We're called the Finger Bros twins.

856
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,820
The Finger Bros twins.

857
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,220
And we're named "huh" and "whoa."

858
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,480
(snickers)

859
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,360
All right.

860
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,720
Now, we're gonna--

861
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,760
And our lawyer is a bird.

862
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
I would like to--

863
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,960
And the judge is a frog.

864
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,240
I would like to call my client to the stand.

865
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,080
And one of the lawyers is a frog, too.

866
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,200
Enough with this farm animal--

867
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,380
Your lawyers are frogs.

868
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,080
Kind of shenanigans, please come to the stand.

869
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,600
And his lawyer is a woman.

870
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,560
Huh?

871
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,640
Come on!

872
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,120
Whoa, okay.

873
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,360
strokes aside, I would like to ask you now a few questions.

874
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Huh?

875
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Whoa.

876
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Both of you.

877
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Huh?

878
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Whoa.

879
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,720
Hold on, you're literally confusing me in real life.

880
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm trying to write something.

881
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,120
Sorry, we couldn't see each other because we're sitting next to each other and not face

882
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,100
to face.

883
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,840
Can we sit face to face?

884
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,040
You may sit however you need to.

885
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,800
I'll allow it.

886
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Now, is it true, twins, that you met Mr. Zuckerberg after a regatta?

887
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
That's confusing. I can't do it.

888
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,800
You just turn back. You don't even have to look at that. You just turn back and forth,

889
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
and he'll switch it for you.

890
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
After a regatta.

891
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Huh?

892
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,800
We flash back to the regatta. This is impossible.

893
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,800
We flash back to the regatta.

894
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
You are facing...

895
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
And we're all eating cheese.

896
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,640
Cheese is it all filmed in fucking tilt shift

897
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,540
and it looks like toys in a water?

898
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,700
Yes, it is all filmed in tilt shift and it's you.

899
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,940
It's Emerson University's regatta

900
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,540
crew team versus the venerable,

901
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,840
but much less intelligent Harvard University's regatta team.

902
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:16,540
Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

903
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:23,540
- 9 plus, that is 11.

904
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:30,540
- Okay. Roll bounce ball.

905
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,540
- 15.

906
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,540
- You just barely beat the Harvard team as you go by them.

907
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:44,540
It's your last push and that last ha and that last whoa gets you just over the edge.

908
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,540
You're feeling pretty good, you're feeling pretty high on that.

909
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,540
You get back to campus, sprawling Emerson campus.

910
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,540
Who wants to see me kiss my brother?

911
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,540
And who is, none other than, maybe one person does.

912
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
I guess I'd like to see that.

913
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,540
Whoa! Look who it is!

914
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,540
Now, is it-

915
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
That's Mark Zuckerberg!

916
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:13,540
Is it true that you then asked Mr. Zuckerberg to help you design a website that you called, I believe, ABL?

917
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,540
- Abdltwinks.com.

918
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,020
- Abdltwinks.com.

919
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,700
- Well, not before we asked him if he wants to watch us kiss.

920
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,700
- As we go back and you say,

921
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,460
- Do you want to watch us kiss?

922
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,080
We'll give you this sandwich.

923
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,860
- I guess I'm a little hungry.

924
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Yeah, sure.

925
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,540
- Okay.

926
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,860
Now come here, huh?

927
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,460
(laughter)

928
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,260
- Please, overruled, please stop, please.

929
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,660
- Oh my God, we started kissing in court.

930
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,880
- I'm listening to this.

931
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,360
- I need to,

932
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,820
you're gonna make Rashida Jones leave, I need this to stop.

933
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,220
- No, Rashida Jones likes it.

934
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,420
- Girls like that kind of shit.

935
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,260
- Oh, they don't?

936
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,080
- Yeah.

937
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,920
- Do they like that?

938
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,760
- Girls like guys kissing like girls kissing.

939
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,020
- Girls like twin brothers kissing.

940
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,860
- Isn't that crazy?

941
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,700
- Do they actually?

942
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,520
- They actually do.

943
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,860
- Especially when it's twin brothers.

944
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:26,540
is

945
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,540
I'm eating my sandwich.

946
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,780
You're eating your sandwich, you're watching them kiss.

947
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,420
I'm not even really watching them kiss.

948
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,340
I think, actually I'm watching them kiss and I decide that I'm not hungry anymore so I put

949
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,580
the sandwich on the ground.

950
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,500
So I'm five blocks away and I'm looking through a telescope into this room.

951
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,660
We're in the Boston Com and me and the finger roast ones.

952
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,460
Is it not true then that you asked him to help you design a website after of course he had

953
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,780
put down his sandwich and after you had sucked face here to fall with your brother huh whoa

954
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,860
depending on which one I'm talking to right now which is unclear at all times. Can you

955
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,900
repeat the question? Did you then ask him to make a website? I asked him to design a

956
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:20,380
website. Could you let's go back in time together. Okay. Do you have a machine? No I'm

957
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,280
man. Oh shit. You're getting so confused. You're breaking the

958
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,380
whole thing. Please talk to Mr. Zuckerberg in the past. Now

959
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,480
talk to him in the past. Are we going to use a time machine?

960
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,880
Stupid in real life.

961
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,480
It's going to drive me crazy.

962
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,280
Hello.

963
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,080
What's up, man?

964
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:46,980
Whoa, I forgot what we were talking about. Do you want to

965
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,580
watch me kiss my brother again?

966
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,980
we already did that on I'm late. After, of course, we fast forward to you want

967
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,020
to watch us eat a sandwich together

968
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,340
and

969
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:08,020
then my brother eats the other end and then what happens when you meet in the

970
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,300
middle?

971
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,860
Huh?

972
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,180
What?

973
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,220
No, whoa, no, huh?

974
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,860
What?

975
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:23,840
Now Abbott and Costello routine aside, you do admit that Mr. Zuckerberg then

976
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,560
absconded with your design plans. Well, if we look at the flashback, that never

977
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,000
happened.

978
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,540
He is making it very difficult for me. That never once... I'd like to say this

979
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:40,300
to the jury, we did the whole flashback, that never even got close to happening.

980
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,940
He kissed his brother, they gave me a sandwich and I didn't eat the rest of

981
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,300
it. I remember.

982
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,700
"We're gonna need a time machine."

983
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,140
She doesn't even bother talking to him.

984
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,300
She's like, "As you can see, this man is not capable of, sorry, these men are not really

985
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,340
capable of doing much of anything."

986
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,340
"Huh?"

987
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,340
"Whoa."

988
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,340
"No, I'm huh."

989
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:12,420
"I want you to ask yourself, despite them winning a regatta, after that scene that, frankly,

990
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,920
I could never have anticipated being how that played out.

991
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,560
You really think they could make a website?

992
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,560
I think I bit off more than I could chew playing these characters.

993
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,700
You roll roll a D8.

994
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,140
That has to be with this me. Yeah. OK.

995
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,300
Yeah. You get to add a D8 to this roll.

996
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,080
Which is this. Yes.

997
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,740
One.

998
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,840
Damn, I got fucked.

999
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,780
I got actually fired.

1000
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,320
Everything. The jury just thinks the twins are handsome.

1001
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,080
The jury's just, the jury really wants to watch the kids.

1002
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,080
It's a jury of all women.

1003
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,080
[Laughter]

1004
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,080
It's the worst jury in history.

1005
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,080
It's a jury of all women who like that.

1006
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,080
Yeah, it's a jury of female anime fans.

1007
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,080
[Laughter]

1008
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Um, cool. So...

1009
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,080
Um, sorry, Juvia, where are we at on time?

1010
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,080
49 minutes.

1011
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,080
49? Okay, cool, just making sure.

1012
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,080
He never started the timer like he said he was going to.

1013
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,080
No, that's not what I was trying to do.

1014
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,080
True.

1015
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
Should be his trial.

1016
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,080
We're going to shift this to the trial of Jubio.

1017
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
No, don't do that.

1018
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Okay.

1019
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,080
So, okay, cool.

1020
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:28,080
So now I'm going to do some math here.

1021
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,080
Okay.

1022
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,080
Cool.

1023
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,080
Why don't you save the math for your free time?

1024
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,080
Sorry, yeah, I will.

1025
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,080
Okay, cool.

1026
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,600
cool. We're going to move on to, we're going to take a quick

1027
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,400
court recess and then they come back and Sullivan bangs on the

1028
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,440
gavel. He says, all right, that was the first part. That was

1029
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,160
pretty interesting. We learned a lot about everybody here. Um,

1030
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,680
now, uh, we're going to move forward in this, this here tale.

1031
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,520
So Mr. Mr. Um, Mr. Zuckerberg, if you can please take the stand

1032
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:08,040
once again. Okay. Now, Mark, I want you to tell me about

1033
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Every lawyer is riveted.

1034
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
That was not me.

1035
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
It was you, we all saw it.

1036
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
We all saw it come out of your mouth.

1037
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,040
No, don't do that. He did that.

1038
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,040
I want to

1039
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,040
talk about the time when

1040
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
you've met superstar computer

1041
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
genius, Dylan

1042
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
in Palo Alto.

1043
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,040
(laughter)

1044
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,040
(laughter)

1045
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,040
(laughter)

1046
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,040
What do you want me to say?

1047
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,740
Dylan has to be the coolest guy I've ever met in my entire life. He's not

1048
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,440
even cool. Shut the fuck. You know he's cool. We've got star shirt is lame.

1049
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,040
The whole

1050
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,520
if you want to see what a real cool guy looks like. It's a guy who wears a

1051
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,760
black shirt and a black suit jacket and pulls the top button really far open

1052
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,800
and he wears that around all day every day with the collar popped. Yep, that

1053
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,460
is cool. I know Dylan from TV.

1054
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,660
So we flash back to a dinner between

1055
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:15,020
Zuck, Eduardo, and guess who shows up right on time, by the way,

1056
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,340
not late at all, he's early, actually, Dylan.

1057
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:24,700
Wow, you're the guy who's making diaper talk, right? Yeah. And me.

1058
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:30,820
That's great. And me. I do it really loud and everyone in the restaurant

1059
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:36,820
I put some money into it.

1060
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,820
That's awesome.

1061
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,820
So why don't you tell me about it?

1062
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,820
Well, basically I took some money that I had from my dad

1063
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,820
and I put it into a bank account and I was able to use that money

1064
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,820
to pay for some stuff.

1065
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,820
Okay.

1066
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,820
That's cool.

1067
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,820
What about you?

1068
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,820
He's my friend.

1069
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,820
I mean,

1070
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,820
Dylan starts to play with his fork a little bit.

1071
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,820
little bit. He's sort of like, um, uh, uh, I mean, what is there to say?

1072
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,620
We're changing the world. That's why I wanted to talk to you, man.

1073
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,780
I think you gotta come out to California.

1074
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,580
There's a lot of stars you can see out here, including me. That's, I mean,

1075
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,420
I do love movie stars, but I wait,

1076
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,100
I already live with my roommates.

1077
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,540
Isn't California like too warm?

1078
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,660
I don't think it's too warm.

1079
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,700
I don't want to leave my roommate wait is aren't the houses. They're really big.

1080
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:41,000
I might come to California, but as of right now, no man, there's movie stars

1081
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,600
there.

1082
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,240
Why do we want to live in California and where is making a lot of good points?

1083
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,340
Plus, I don't I don't want to leave my roommates Dante and Stan.

1084
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:59,480
Yeah, we won't be moving to California anytime soon, but in but I could be

1085
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:05,880
convinced on that was called sarcasm Dylan. No, I'm not being sarcastic.

1086
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,180
That's being sarcastic right now. That's his classic sarcastic wit. Okay,

1087
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,180
you roll.

1088
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:17,080
Sorry, you roll talking. Okay.

1089
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,580
That's a net 20. Fuck me.

1090
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:29,380
Every versus fucking campaign. I get fucking destroyed for no reason.

1091
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,820
It's okay though, because we're still friends, despite it all.

1092
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,300
If you don't want to go to California, I get it.

1093
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,100
I mean, it's pretty nice here though.

1094
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,980
I basically wear the same shirt every day.

1095
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,980
Okay.

1096
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:49,260
You wear the same shirt every day?

1097
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,940
Chicken fingers here are really good.

1098
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,940
Can I have a bite?

1099
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,280
Wait, could you get chicken fingers for the whole table?

1100
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
it.

1101
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,840
And uh, yeah, he said,

1102
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,840
Eduardo.

1103
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Edmundo.

1104
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,400
Do you see how cool Dylan is?

1105
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,680
He's getting his chicken tenders with honey mustard for the entire table.

1106
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,680
The waiter goes by the table.

1107
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,680
He's not cool at all.

1108
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,720
He stands up to say hi to the waiter.

1109
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,720
What we need.

1110
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,720
He sits down.

1111
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,280
Look how fucking cool Dylan is.

1112
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,400
He like forgets for a second how he's supposed to do stuff.

1113
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,120
Dylan's shirt may be cool, but he's not business smart.

1114
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,280
What we need is ads for vacuums and sex.

1115
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,600
We don't need chicken fingers.

1116
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,120
Bro, I hate to say this.

1117
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,120
A whole bunch of chicken fingers come to the table.

1118
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,120
Oh great.

1119
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:45,440
And uh, I'm allergic to fucking chicken.

1120
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,280
I can't even be near that stuff.

1121
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,320
Send it back to the kitchen.

1122
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,600
I can get you fries.

1123
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,880
They usually come with fries.

1124
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,000
Okay, I'll have fries.

1125
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,200
I'll pay for them myself with my own bank account.

1126
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,200
Cheese fries!

1127
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,200
Cheese fries!

1128
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,200
You're so right, Dylan.

1129
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,200
Yeah!

1130
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,880
And he's so excited that cheese fries come.

1131
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,760
And so we go back to the courtroom.

1132
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,600
Now while Eduardo made a pretty good argument though, you did eventually head to California,

1133
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,600
that's correct, right?

1134
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,300
Eventually Dylan did convince me.

1135
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:27,900
That was when we started what we like to call our long distance best friendship.

1136
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,540
Let's see what that looked like.

1137
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,540
Okay, we cut.

1138
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,540
Cut to you're in New York.

1139
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,540
I'm in New York.

1140
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,540
You're in New York.

1141
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,540
I'm doing an internship.

1142
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,540
Where are you doing an internship?

1143
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,540
Where are you doing an internship?

1144
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,540
I'm doing an internship at the business.

1145
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,540
Barstool.

1146
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,620
You're selling ads at Barstool?

1147
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,780
Yeah, I'm selling.

1148
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,780
I'm on the phone.

1149
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,860
I'm like I'm doing some kind of job that I'm doing. I'm like a telephone switchboard operator.

1150
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,020
Like I have like the wires that you have to plug into stuff. I'm a job that doesn't exist

1151
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:06,660
anymore. Right. Yeah. And I'm like wow this is what it's really like. Oh my God. This

1152
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:13,380
is what it's like to run a business. I'm shoveling coal into it. We're cutting to California.

1153
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,980
You are just hanging out by the pool and you're in Dylan's pad now.

1154
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,980
Where is it?

1155
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,980
Except that pina colada.

1156
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,980
He's not a frog.

1157
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,980
What?

1158
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:28,460
Yeah, there's, well, first of all, Dylan has tons of like that canned pina colada stuff.

1159
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,940
It's so good.

1160
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,940
Yeah.

1161
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,960
His house has got, has a, he has a water slide.

1162
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,260
Now I'm going down the water slide.

1163
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,380
Going down the water slide.

1164
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,380
And uh...

1165
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,380
Head first.

1166
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,380
On the belly.

1167
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:46,820
that but not me. He brings you into his his theater and he's like every single

1168
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:53,900
Star Wars movie in order. Let's do it Dylan press play right now. Press play

1169
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,300
up but we got to start with the Clone Wars animated series. I love that shit.

1170
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,340
Yeah okay and then right then the doorbell rings. Yep ding dong. Wait I'll

1171
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:07,380
go get the door. Okay you open the door it's a beautiful sunny California day.

1172
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,320
way I'm soaking wet covered in coal,

1173
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:17,960
and I'm like Mark, you haven't replied to my emojis. Wait, Eduardo, I thought

1174
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,980
you were chilling with a little Sasquatch at the bar.

1175
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:27,620
Chilling with little set, chilling with little set. Mark, I quit that

1176
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,680
internship after nine months,

1177
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,600
which was what like a couple of days ago.

1178
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,420
yeah. How am I supposed to know you didn't call me? I sent you emojis.

1179
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,660
What let's look take a look at these emojis. Okay, I open up my five

1180
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,000
fifty

1181
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:54,660
it comes upstairs. Oh, Eduardo, you made it. I slap him. Oh, he thought that

1182
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,380
you were in a homeless guy because we're in California. He didn't mean anything

1183
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,980
by that. I should roll talking.

1184
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,740
Let's see, with my talking, I have minus one talking.

1185
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,060
He's Zuckerberg.

1186
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,980
He's literally one of the biggest geniuses in the world.

1187
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,180
That doesn't mean he's good at talking.

1188
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,020
Seven.

1189
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,820
I don't think he thinks I'm homeless.

1190
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,060
Yeah. What's going on Eduardo?

1191
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,620
So Mark said that I didn't mean anything by that,

1192
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,780
but I actually did mean something by that.

1193
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,780
And I'm gonna tell you what I meant right now.

1194
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:28,260
What I meant by that slap is I'm changing my credit card pin

1195
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,500
or debit card pin from one, one, one, one,

1196
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,500
until 1112 and I'm not going to tell you the new pin.

1197
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,000
Wait, how are we going to use that credit card if we don't know the pin?

1198
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You're not going to be able to use it at all because I'm taking all my money

1199
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,500
that I've contributed to this thing and you're probably not even going to be

1200
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,000
able to pay rent without my $50-$60 a month.

1201
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
We got to the courtroom now and Rashida Jones goes,

1202
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
"So as you can see here, Eduardo was pretty bitter and acted in a

1203
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,880
really just not very nice way and

1204
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,360
doesn't sound like somebody who could have invented a website sounds like

1205
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,760
somebody who just holds a grudge because of a inferiority complex.

1206
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,400
I'm not the one that holds a grudge.

1207
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,280
He's holding a grudge because he's jealous that I got to be in the

1208
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,720
background of an episode of call her daddy.

1209
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,440
And he was also the cameraman for one of the pizza reviews.

1210
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,480
I just like to put that out there.

1211
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,720
See, he knew he knew.

1212
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,680
I didn't even tell him.

1213
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,820
Oh yeah, I for keeping up with my fucking friend, so we are friends

1214
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,440
and I immediately go to hug you

1215
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,040
slowly. No really fat

1216
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,640
because I know he's going to stop

1217
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:50,480
a little press to get in between you. I like a taste for out there. I hand on

1218
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,560
the taser. Yeah, whoa, whoa, try that listen just trying to hug him all day

1219
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,000
just because we're suing each other doesn't mean we're not the best of

1220
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,200
best friends. She or not the best of friends. Why don't you be a friend over

1221
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:02,440
there?

1222
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,520
Isn't that just fucking typical?

1223
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,520
Well, I guess you don't want this. I hold up a five dollar bill

1224
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:21,240
I'm jumping up because he's taller than me. Give me that right now, so

1225
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:26,320
you are because he got in that twenty you're not going to be able to add

1226
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,360
anything to this role.

1227
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,440
Okay, so thanks for pointing at me. Just roll.

1228
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,240
Okay.

1229
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,240
The...tain.

1230
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,240
Stop looking at my notes, hoe.

1231
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
He was sneaking a peek.

1232
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,240
I don't have many scenes.

1233
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,740
I think you just fell asleep. You could have been talking this whole time.

1234
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,740
He drew.

1235
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,740
I thought he did not fall asleep, he drew.

1236
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,740
Give me Cam's camera.

1237
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,240
I don't want to put myself, I'm trying to be true to the story.

1238
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,740
He spit the last 20 minutes drawing this.

1239
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,740
That is the lawyer from New York.

1240
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,240
Because he's a frog.

1241
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,440
And speaking of which, how is that?

1242
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,280
Anti-Semitic because his penis is small.

1243
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,880
You said that.

1244
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,780
Penis is small.

1245
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,120
That's him hard.

1246
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,080
That's him hard.

1247
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,520
Yeah. It points straight down.

1248
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,880
Points straight down because of his frog body.

1249
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,120
Can you imagine the mechanics of that?

1250
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,160
We cut to.

1251
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,960
But it'd be easy to pee in the morning, though.

1252
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,920
The scene. The winkle.

1253
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,360
The sorry, the penis bros. Finger bros. Finger bros.

1254
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,100
The finger bros twins are incensed at this point.

1255
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,500
I guess maybe they are hard to tell.

1256
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,640
They do talk to the president of Emerson University either way.

1257
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,600
Jeffrey Epstein.

1258
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,680
I don't know what his name is.

1259
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,440
I didn't give him a name.

1260
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,940
Hello, Dad. Tell me.

1261
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,640
OK, yeah, he's finger bros.

1262
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,280
Mr. Finger Bros, president of Emerson University.

1263
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,420
No, he's still Epstein.

1264
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,320
OK, he's still Epstein. Yeah, I didn't give him a name.

1265
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,960
So, yeah. OK, it is.

1266
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,220
I guess it can be my father.

1267
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,460
Yeah, but I'll be your dad. OK.

1268
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,300

Somebody took our new website

1280
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,000
And we need to use the army.

1281
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,100
I don't know if we could do that.

1282
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:04,100

1291
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:21,900
Okay.

1292
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,600
16.

1293
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,100
Okay.

1294
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,000
This is a battle of- a battle of wits.

1295
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,600
[laughter]

1296
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,100
Okay.

1297
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,800

1298
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,500

1299

[laughter]

1300
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,500
Seven.

1301
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,500
Alright.

1302
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Okay!

1303
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,600
[laughter]

1304
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,200
Yay!

1305
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,900
We're gonna use the army to get our website back.

1306
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,100
Let's get the army involved.

1307
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:45,700
Yay!

1308
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,500
We're gonna use our army to get our website back.

1309
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,400
I love you, sons.

1310
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,500
I love you, dads.

1311
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,600
Yay!

1312
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,400
Let's make out.

1313
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,400
Okay!

1314
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:52,900
The dads-

1315
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,620
They make out with "huh" and I'll make out with "whoa".

1316
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,620
Nice.

1317
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,020
And you two make out with each other.

1318
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,020
Okay.

1319
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,020
And we'll record it.

1320
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,020
We'll record it.

1321
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,020
Whoa.

1322
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,020
Whoa.

1323
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,020
Yay.

1324
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:06,020
And they make out.

1325
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,620
Now, after you were all done making out.

1326
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,060
We went to London.

1327
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,660
You went to London.

1328
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:11,660
That did happen.

1329
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,940
With our army.

1330
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,740
You accidentally invaded England.

1331
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:20,420
Now after you were finished invading England.

1332
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,140
Now I want the jury to pay attention here for one second.

1333
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,140
Okay.

1334
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,140
Think of the enterprise in...

1335
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:29,180
Wait, sorry, my middle name's the jury and I'm woe.

1336
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,180
I would like to...

1337
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:36,400
The group of people, the 12 or so people in front of me, whose name I shall not be referring

1338
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,600
to out loud as to not confuse my client.

1339
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,840
Sometimes I go by my middle name.

1340
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:50,560
The coordination it takes to be able to hire the entire US military to invade England on

1341
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,500
behalf of a diaper website.

1342
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:00,920
That takes a kind of intellect and resources that could only be procured through my clients,

1343
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,160
not Mr. Zuckerberg.

1344
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:12,200
I only know websites and diapers and war and rowing and kissing my brother and watching

1345
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,240
my dad kiss his brother.

1346
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:20,320
And now knowing of course that this here jury are all women, we must consider how hot would

1347
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,480
it be if the dads kissed two.

1348
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,480
What if I kissed my dad?

1349
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,560
Let's think about it, you guys like that sort of shit.

1350
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,840
Come here dad.

1351
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,600
The dad is not in the room right now.

1352
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,200
Oh that's my wallpaper on my phone.

1353
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,400
Okay I'm going to roll a d20, you get a d6 for that.

1354
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,400
Okay.

1355
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,400
I got a 5.

1356
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,400
You got a 2.

1357
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,400
This son of a lawyer sucks.

1358
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,280
Wait, is that good or bad?

1359
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,280
I got a 5.

1360
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,680
Yeah, but you only add the 5 to it.

1361
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,920
I don't understand how the rolls really work.

1362
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,600
I really weighted the lawyer rolls too much as a problem.

1363
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
Yeah?

1364
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
Yeah.

1365
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Why don't you unweight them?

1366
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
I won't do that.

1367
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
Okay.

1368
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
Nice try, buddy.

1369
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,600
I almost had them.

1370
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,040
You did almost have them.

1371
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:11,320
It's purely my fault, so I get it.

1372
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:17,360
But now we're going to have the New York lawyer.

1373
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,720
He's questioning me.

1374
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,680
Their storyline kind of ends in London, huh?

1375
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,320
Yeah, it does.

1376
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,640
Don't worry.

1377
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,360
I have more story than the movie.

1378
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,360
Oh, got it.

1379
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,360
Okay.

1380
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,360
We're not just reading the script.

1381
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,360
I thought we were.

1382
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,200
That's what I've been doing this whole time.

1383
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,320
Actually, wait, hold on.

1384
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
Oh, wait, hold on.

1385
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
You guys died.

1386
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,580
(laughing)

1387
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,180
- Yep, super roll.

1388
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:49,980
- Now look, you guys invaded England.

1389
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,820
- Whoa.

1390
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:51,980
- Who do you think you are?

1391
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,780
- The fu, the.

1392
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:57,060
(laughing)

1393
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,960
- Okay, let's settle down then.

1394
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,800
- What the?

1395
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,640
- You and your lawyer.

1396
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,660
- The finger bros twins.

1397
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,120
- Okay, and?

1398
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,500
I drew a photo of you.

1399
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,420
What can I see it?

1400
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,620
Drew a photo.

1401
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:22,820
Does that seem like now I want you to show that to the know

1402
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,420
it's for you.

1403
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:25,120
Show it to the jury and they'll go.

1404
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,820
They're all about to throw up.

1405
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,500
Does that look like somebody who knows what they're doing

1406
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,600
when building a website or does that look like the kind of

1407
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,220
maniac who would invade a sovereign nation?

1408
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,220
What did you say?

1409
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,220
Yeah.

1410
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:43,020
Because they were confused about what it means to make a website.

1411
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,220
No, I made a website when I was 13 called Twinks.

1412
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,220
13?

1413
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,220
Yes.

1414
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:52,220
Did anybody help you with that?

1415
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,020
Was it WordPress or like GeoCities?

1416
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,220
What did you do?

1417
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,220
Well, I paid a slave.

1418
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,220
Okay, right.

1419
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,220
You paid a slave?

1420
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,220
Now...

1421
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,220
It's the first rule of having a slave.

1422
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,220
You gotta pay.

1423
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:06,480
I pay this guy. So this guy's so okay.

1424
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,660
I'd like the jury to hear this. This guy's so stupid. He paid a slave.

1425
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:15,620
No, that's his name.

1426
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,180
A slave

1427
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:23,940
he has a slave's last name to

1428
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,920
know.

1429
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,580
He's white.

1430
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:32,900
My father's just very, wait, wait, wait. We didn't say anything about race,

1431
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,420
by the way. Why'd you say he's white?

1432
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,060
Because I don't know.

1433
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,220
Now I'm going to move on from this sort of thing.

1434
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,940
Who would have thought that the social network was the one that got all this

1435
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,260
stuff? Yeah, finally.

1436
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,300
Coming out of the woodwork.

1437
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,060
Yeah, the two most racist guys that I've ever seen in my life over here.

1438
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,860
These two. Patrick and Patches.

1439
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,420
Yeah, we are pretty racist.

1440
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,940
God, I did not mean to be.

1441
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,300
Just crossing swords.

1442
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,740
Yeah, just trying to get more racist every second.

1443
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:00,660
You could beat me. You could beat me in it.

1444
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,780
Don't worry about it.

1445
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,780
Pet is the goat.

1446
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:07,260
That's untouchable, though, when it comes to being racist.

1447
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,260
So racist.

1448
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,340
And then be like, I don't know what I just said.

1449
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:15,100
I'm sort of like finding my way through that kind of that kind of

1450
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,340
thing. Now, look, I don't I don't think

1451
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:22,500
that somebody like this who who pays a slave.

1452
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,740
No, that's his name.

1453
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,780
Remember my slip up?

1454
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,860
Oh, we could because we could cut it out.

1455
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,360
that we get

1456
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,660
and now I have to I'm going to now you're saying you think that black

1457
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,840
people weren't slaves.

1458
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,640
You we had a time machine

1459
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:47,080
and I use the time machine and I corrected all that because of that slip

1460
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,260
up. You get to roll corrected all that. So you think that white people should

1461
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:50,380
be

1462
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,900
why you just stop slavery. What am I rolling? You're old da

1463
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,780
oh wow

1464
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,840
somebody's gotta be a three. Is that essentially the sense of it here? So

1465
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,360
Patrick's

1466
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:10,160
it's gotta be a race. He said slaves where he said slavery is inevitable.

1467
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,940
They can't just be one guy that we pin it all on. Can't be everyone with the

1468
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:17,800
same name. It has to be a race of people. Okay, that's chill. And we pinned it,

1469
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,720
we pinned it on the

1470
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:25,640
on the what? Keep going. The Finger Bros family invented slavery.

1471
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,560
The Finger Bros family invented slavery.

1472
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,760
We have a rich history of evil shit.

1473
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,840
Alright, so we're going to have you roll one more time.

1474
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
One D4 you're going to add.

1475
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,840
Okay.

1476
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:43,840
Because it was entertaining.

1477
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,840
Three.

1478
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,840
Damn.

1479
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,560
I'm seeing these rolls.

1480
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,560
Good or bad?

1481
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,560
I'm a win y'all.

1482
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,560
He's probably going to win.

1483
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,560
Yeah, he's probably going to win.

1484
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,640
I mean, I kind of blew it this whole thing.

1485
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,720
And I deserve it because honestly my character is the only one who's positive and happy.

1486
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,720
You have the worst case of all three.

1487
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,720
What are you talking about?

1488
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,720
I have the worst case of all three

1489
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,720
and I got a racial somehow.

1490
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,720
I'm the only one with a decent case.

1491
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,720
Again, you're fucking me.

1492
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,720
I was in the room one or two times

1493
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,720
on the many days that you programmed

1494
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,720
to this website. I made terrible mechanics

1495
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,720
and so you're getting fucked by that.

1496
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,720
I had some ideas that weren't used.

1497
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,720
It's not intentional. You fuck me every fucking time.

1498
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,720
I made really bad mechanics.

1499
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,720
Can we do the scene where

1500
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,120
live in the morning today. Can we do the scene where he has relationship status?

1501
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,480
Did we already get past that in the story? Can we do that scene? You want to

1502
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,720
do that scene? I think we should do that scene. I don't remember that. I think

1503
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,840
this is just become movie. Okay, so it's... Let's do it. So you're in... I

1504
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,040
think we've lost the plot. It's going forward. You would, Slade boy. Okay,

1505
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,040
basically, the only reason I wanna do this scene is because this is a scene

1506
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,080
where you run back across

1507
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,480
campus and yeah, oh yeah, I remember yeah, you get to you. So yes, it's a

1508
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,720
great you get to your room, your wardo Eduardo, you get to your room to add

1509
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,860
something and in the and you that your door is slightly a jar and you walk

1510
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,900
into the room and I'm wearing your clothes. I'm sitting at your computer

1511
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:16,780
and we're not typing on your blog. You look at my you look at my I'm Mark

1512
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:17,400
Zuckerberg,

1513
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,040
Eduardo. What are you? What are you doing?

1514
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,300
(laughing)

1515
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,520
- What?

1516
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,720
This is what friends do.

1517
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,040
- Why are you wearing my clothes?

1518
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,760
- These are my clothes.

1519
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,000
- You're just perched up behind the window.

1520
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,400
- We can't hear him through the window.

1521
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,080
Wait, you're wearing my clothes,

1522
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,720
you're using my computer.

1523
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,080
What are you typing on my blog?

1524
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,680
You're saying I'm Mark Zuckerberg.

1525
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,480
- I just had an idea.

1526
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,640
Wait, Mark, I just had an idea.

1527
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,320
- No, I had an idea, that's why I ran home.

1528
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,520
- No, this is gonna change diaper talk.

1529
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,120
What if we made it so you type into the URL bar,

1530
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,560
what if we make it diaper talk

1531
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,360
dot com?

1532
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:57,800
That's it's already it's the diaper talk dot com. That's already the address

1533
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,280
Dylan. You got a phone call from Dylan. Hold on. I have to take this.

1534
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,880
Hello. You got suck.

1535
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,280
Drop the

1536
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:11,920
drop the dot com.

1537
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,560
Okay, just the diaper talk. Yeah,

1538
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,660
I mean, we can try that. Yeah, I think it could work. Okay, here,

1539
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:25,640
Eduardo, put in the diaper talk, just in the no.com. I type it in,

1540
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,480
it works perfectly. It comes up flawlessly, no issues. This is perfect.

1541
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,380
Okay, but I still think that we need to put some more ads on here.

1542
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:34,440
I take a photo of you guys. Which is the main reason I have a case.

1543
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,440
How many times do I have to tell you? I take a photo of you guys

1544
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,640
with a camera that has a really big flash.

1545
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,320
Wait, what was that?

1546
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,880
I think I just blinked and my eyelids were white. I must have blinked too.

1547
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,920
what are your roommates? You must have blinked with my

1548
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:54,720
okay. Here's my idea though, right? People don't just want to see other

1549
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,600
people in diapers.

1550
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:02,980
They wanna know if they get unbuttoned those diapers and get inside of them.

1551
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:07,320
We need to add relationship status. This is why people look at other people

1552
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,580
in diapers. They're trying to fuck, they're trying to get laid, they're

1553
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:12,560
trying to have sex, they're trying to get married or see who's best friends.

1554
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,340
the window was a...

1555
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,740
Okay, okay, you're right.

1556
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:19,540
We need to add a relationship status and also a best friend status.

1557
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:22,980
And the window is a little bit cracked and I'm still outside.

1558
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:23,980
I'm on my twin's.

1559
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,100
You're really shoehorning yourself into our show.

1560
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,340
My twin brother's shoulder.

1561
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,820
I didn't talk for most of this and then when I did I talked about slavery.

1562
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,820
You picked this character first.

1563
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:35,540
It's my bad.

1564
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:42,620
But all you can see, just like green billow of stink is going through the window from our

1565
01:14:42,620 --> 01:15:06,100
are

1566
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,360
laptop and I'm typing my best friend is already said to Dylan when you look I

1567
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,140
take and I'm like all right. If you're if you're going to develop this feature,

1568
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,500
I think you're probably going to need a little more money to get this off the

1569
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,300
ground. So I'm going to go ahead and send you really need any more money. 58

1570
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,820
cents. I just dropped in your account.

1571
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:24,580
This feels like this is like you're setting something up almost with how

1572
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:29,020
little money this is. What do you mean? We flash forward now.

1573
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:35,060
Eduardo is signed an unfortunate contract. Yeah, he's literally the

1574
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,280
the dumbest person ever. Yeah, just

1575
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:43,980
the contract is one sentence that says you will be fucked. It's actually I'm

1576
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:48,180
squinting eyes so funny. You will be friends. It's so

1577
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:51,780
we already are, but I guess there's no harm in signing it.

1578
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,680
It's actually amazing. The contracting side like in real life, just signing

1579
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:01,580
one, which is does. Anyway, you signs it and then Dylan makes an accounting

1580
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:06,680
share and it's like we got to make a new company. I got I'm sorry, but we just

1581
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,720
give the same shares to everybody shouldn't be a problem. Dylan, okay,

1582
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:14,560
shouldn't you be at one of your famous parties right now? Oh, yep, and he heads

1583
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,620
over there. Am I being asked about my shares? Do you know the ones? Did you

1584
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,440
write the party? I didn't write the party. I'd like to cut to the party.

1585
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,640
Wait before we cut to the party. Can we do the share? Can we do? I'm being asked

1586
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,080
about the shares. Yeah, the scene. Yeah. Were you being asked about the shares

1587
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:36,320
scene? With just the lawyer guy? Just like being asked like or... Yeah, ask about all

1588
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:46,480
the shares. Ask him about all... Oh, oh, the scene. Okay, yeah, yeah. Now, you were... So,

1589
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:53,000
you were supposed to have 50% of the company, right? Yes. What happened? What'd you sign?

1590
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,160
I signed a contract and it seems that some things happen with the shares.

1591
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:05,080
Now this contract, look I'm from New York, alright, we pull one over on each other, we're

1592
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,700
nasty, we're mean.

1593
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,600
This was the worst contract I've ever seen in my life.

1594
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,000
And you were completely tricked into signing it, right?

1595
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,840
Yeah well I basically read it and maybe some of the stuff that was bad they wrote in a

1596
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,920
slightly lighter color or something to stop me from seeing it or maybe when I

1597
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,680
I guess when I was reading the contract parts of it were folded over in advance

1598
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,920
in an origami style to block out some of the words. And either of these scenarios are

1599
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,280
highly illegal by the way. And there was a lot of in the contract there was also

1600
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,640
a lot of stuff that was probably I mean again I didn't read it but if I had I

1601
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,240
probably would have noticed a lot of language. Oh but you read the contract right?

1602
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:50,640
Oh no what? Fuck. Cut to him walking into the office. Yeah

1603
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,880
long in the office. You have a blind fold. I'm a blind fold on and I'm

1604
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,840
holding I'm holding a rubber stamp that just has my name on it and I'm just

1605
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,300
stamping it on the wall everywhere and then the guy's like trying to get you

1606
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:02,720
to get it.

1607
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:09,600
He turns you around and pushes you out. You're stamping all right. So tell them

1608
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:16,960
what happened next edwarda with your little outburst. Okay, well is the what I

1609
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,040
want to say what I want to say here before my outburst. Yeah,

1610
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,840
Mark's shares were diluted down.

1611
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,040
Not at all.

1612
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,840
And then how much were Dylan's shares diluted?

1613
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,340
They weren't diluted.

1614
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:36,540
In fact, Dylan got more shares. He got a special Starboy share.

1615
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,040
Right.

1616
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,740
Oh, I had shares too.

1617
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,440
You did not have shares.

1618
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,640
Oh, I just share things with my brother.

1619
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,640
The Finger Bros twin shares were not diluted either.

1620
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,140
They didn't have shares.

1621
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,740
Well, they weren't diluted because we didn't have any.

1622
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:54,940
Okay, point taken. The whole momentum of this scene has been destroyed.

1623
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:59,660
What happened to your shares? My shares were diluted

1624
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:02,180
to 49.995%

1625
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:09,540
from 50. Jury, not the jury, jury.

1626
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:16,720
Is this fair? This guy who put in almost $1200 into this company.

1627
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,980
(laughing)

1628
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,720
- My name was on the masthead.

1629
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:26,600
This guy who poured his blood, sweat, and tears

1630
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,200
into an internship in New York.

1631
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,140
I bought so many suits.

1632
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:36,240
This guy who pops his collar and walks around

1633
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,760
like he owns the place.

1634
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,560
You don't think he deserves at least 50%?

1635
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,160
- Let it be known, jury, he is a Bolsonaristo

1636
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,160
from Brazil.

1637
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,160
Overruled!

1638
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,160
I mean, objection!

1639
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,160
No, you don't have to object to that.

1640
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,160
Because it's true.

1641
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,160
Because it's true.

1642
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,160
He likes Bolsonaro.

1643
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,160
Bolsonaro is dope.

1644
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,160
Is he actually?

1645
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,160
I don't know.

1646
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,160
Maybe.

1647
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,160
I wasn't sure.

1648
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,160
I can't imagine that he...

1649
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,160
He gives a shit.

1650
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,160
He is a normal guy.

1651
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,160
Yeah.

1652
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,160
I think he lives in the Middle East now.

1653
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
Does he?

1654
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,160
I think he was a rich kid who had a lot of money.

1655
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,160
I don't think he does.

1656
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,160
I feel like he's like he moved to avoid getting taxed for that.

1657
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,160
Oh, that's right.

1658
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,160
That's right.

1659
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,160
That's right.

1660
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,160
That's right.

1661
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,160
That's right.

1662
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,160
That's right.

1663
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,160
That's right.

1664
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,160
That's right.

1665
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,360
taxed for that. Oh that I remember reading about. For the Facebook lawsuit. Yeah. Or that

1666
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,800
he moved to some country. So he probably doesn't give a shit about like Bolsonaro or whatever.

1667
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,920
Like it's probably all just like... He probably like says... Where does he live now? Can you

1668
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,880
see real quick on his Wikipedia? Looks exactly like Andrew Garfield by the way. Citizenship

1669
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:37,520
Brazil. It's so funny that it's his book. He moved to Singapore. It's his book that the

1670
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,760
whole thing is based off of. Well he's not allowed to spit anywhere. Yeah he could be

1671
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,840
be killed and so because you admitted to just like to eat gum. Yeah, you can eat

1672
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,780
gum in North America. You will die if you eat gum, not from the legal system,

1673
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:55,000
but it will accumulate in your stomach and you will have to get surgery for

1674
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,360
seven years. Imagine, imagine winning all that money and then they're like on.

1675
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,840
You can keep all of it. Okay, but I'm, but you have to stop eating gum. You

1676
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,580
can't eat double bubble ever again. I'm storming into the Facebook offices.

1677
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,940
Let's do it. Let's do it. I'm storming into the Facebook offices. You see Dylan.

1678
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:11,400
Dylan's like, "Hey, Eduardo, chicken fingers." And I'm putting my hand in his

1679
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:15,580
space and I walk for me. I walk up to Marcus typing and I say hey mark.

1680
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:19,220
How's it going miss you buddy

1681
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,080
mark?

1682
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,880
Do you want to go jump rope mark?

1683
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,340
Oh well, I turn around

1684
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:32,000
trips and destroys his computer by accident

1685
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,060
party foul.

1686
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,240
I was plugged in. I didn't hear it. I didn't hear the whole see

1687
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:47,560
I no idea. This is a for in in court is the first time I've ever I'm ever

1688
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,740
hearing about you having any

1689
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:55,020
so wait you're suing me.

1690
01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:01,000
I think so. I don't why I thought you were you had forty nine point nine

1691
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,180
nine five percent of the company. Why are you yeah, but I deserve at least

1692
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:04,620
ninety

1693
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,180
you deserve that you started with fifty. Why would you have ninety you give us

1694
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,920
twelve hundred dollars and then fifty eight cents on a credit card for

1695
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,520
inflation. Now that was three years ago. It's a lot more money today.

1696
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,420
That's almost twelve hundred and fifteen dollars. How is he going to win?

1697
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:28,960
How is he going to win? Well, to close this out jury just because just because

1698
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,100
Mark is

1699
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:34,720
smarter than me and he made the whole website and all of his business ideas

1700
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:42,400
company may have led to the website being valued more and because I just was strange and weird

1701
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:48,280
and acted off, that means that I should not own the entire company?

1702
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:56,340
So before the closing arguments, you all agreed to do one more thing, which is also highly

1703
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:04,400
unorthodox in this three-way trial, which is a hackathon to prove who is actually the

1704
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:12,160
smartest guy here. This is easy. So five of my intelligence roll out the computers. The

1705
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:18,960
computers are rolled out. Oh, you all need to sit in front of the computers. Can I have

1706
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:24,320
one for me and my brother? Yeah, you can have two computers. That's fine. Double the computers.

1707
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:29,740
That's not fair. They will do it. I guess fair went out the window the second we stepped

1708
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,880
stepped into this core room. I still can't even believe we're

1709
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,180
here. Your job is to hack into a we have a sort of a site that

1710
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:42,520
has been put up that's called E bombs world and your job is to

1711
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:50,160
hack into it by with the next 45 minutes. So, okay, we're going

1712
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:54,600
to do a bunch of rolls. So start rolling

1713
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:03,940
and you're in evidence, right? You said no sleepy. Okay, I got a six. I got a

1714
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,980
four. I got a ten. Are we rolling intelligence?

1715
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:10,920
How many times each? Three times? Yeah, sorry. Okay, I got a ten. Should we

1716
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,220
keep a running total or are we just... I got an eight saying them. A ten.

1717
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:18,780
Just say them, yeah. A seventeen is my second roll. My second roll is a

1718
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:23,800
eight. What was your first roll? Me? I already forgot. Okay, roll again.

1719
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,860
I think it was six or four or something along those lines.

1720
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,560
Well, you have a plus four on your end.

1721
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,460
I have a plus two.

1722
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,100
Oh, OK. I can't read you go.

1723
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,800
Oh, wait, I've been rolling this whole time.

1724
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,940
Yeah, I think you need to go through us one by one.

1725
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,300
Yeah, this is this is confusing.

1726
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,400
And it's I want you each to roll one at a time, like, like just roll your three

1727
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,180
first. You got 10, 17, 17, the whole rolls.

1728
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,080
Yeah. Just 10, 17, 18.

1729
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,880
OK, you know, OK.

1730
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,120
For.

1731
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:57,280
What, you get to roll all of them again?

1732
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,280
Yeah, that's fine.

1733
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,280
You do too.

1734
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,280
You do too.

1735
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,360
Four, sixteen.

1736
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,400
Also make sure to subtract your intelligence.

1737
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,400
Yeah, yeah.

1738
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,400
Okay.

1739
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,400
I have minus one.

1740
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,400
Yes.

1741
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,400
Seventeen.

1742
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,400
Okay, wow.

1743
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,400
Alright, you're up.

1744
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,080
So I'm doing three of them?

1745
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,080
That is a fourteen.

1746
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,080
Or wait, no.

1747
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,080
A sixteen.

1748
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,080
16.

1749
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,720
He's doing some sneaky shit.

1750
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,720
He's letting me roll off his hand.

1751
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:31,480
And a 16.

1752
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:34,120
You all start vibrating.

1753
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,080
The computers start to glow.

1754
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:41,360
I take it out of my butt, my vibrator that I had.

1755
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,280
Suddenly, I get off my brother's lap.

1756
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,720
You feel your, your, uh, uh, you start to feel, uh, your, your,

1757
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:53,440
whatever it is that the sort of, uh, uh, uh, intangible thing that makes you

1758
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:58,680
feel tethered to wherever you are, starts to slip away and you start to

1759
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:09,680
fall into the computer and you zoom into the computer and you're all in it

1760
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,920
and you're completely blue.

1761
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,500
It's fucking Tron.

1762
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,320
And next time.

1763
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,440
Oh my God.

1764
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:20,040
We'll deal with the three of you

1765
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,040
having to team up.

1766
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,080
That was just the first part.

1767
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,320
And we do Tron.

1768
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,360
Yeah.

1769
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,800
Well, play.

1770
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,480
I wish I

1771
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:32,280
wish that the first episode of

1772
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,480
this was way better.

1773
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,360
They'll they're going to like the

1774
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,360
second one. Yeah.

1775
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,720
The second one will be.

1776
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,640
You're just sad because you picked a

1777
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,140
character and you were too afraid to

1778
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,280
talk the whole time. I just picked the worst character. You picked the best character.

1779
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,600
Yeah, you're being goofy, man. You did a good job. You're a bitch. Don't let this music make

1780
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:57,120
you sad. It is sad music. You're right. You're not a bitch. You're two bitches. Yeah. I wish

1781
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:03,760
that we had that playing the whole time instead of this. This has been making me upset. Emotional.

1782
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,480
Alright, Tron next time. Tron next time, bye.

1783
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,360
All right, cool.
