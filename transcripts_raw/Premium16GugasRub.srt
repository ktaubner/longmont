00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
That's not free.

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I can play it for free for an entire weekend.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
It's not the weekend.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,320
pretty good deal. Super Monkey Ball. Sonic Mania is very fun. I like that game. I can

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:48,200
pull up the other controller. Turn off the Xbox. After. I want to make a Halo Forge. You

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:56,080
guys have to start bringing your Switch controllers over. No. Mine is in North Carolina. Mine

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,720
- Mine too. - We could play craps.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,460
- We could play craps. - That's a board game.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,740
- I got, oh, we got Civ 6 last night.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,020
- Yeah, you got Hiv 6 'cause you have HIV.

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,280
- You have Hiv. - Six.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
(laughing)

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,680
- Yeah, it's your initials.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,200
- I have Hiv.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,460
I just got the new Hiv 6.

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,200
I have HIV in six different ways.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,000
- Six different places. - That's my impression of Patrick.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
Yeah, I have HIV of the brain.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,640
- Yeah, brain, left arm, right arm,

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,720
left leg, right leg, pinot.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
I hope I don't get fucking...

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
You know...

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
That's probably the first place you get it.

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Your Pinot?

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Your Pinot.

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Yeah, how do you get AIDS?

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Yeah.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
I don't know.

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,280
Well, we were just listening to a Limp Bizkit song.

38
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
That's how you get AIDS?

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Hot Dog.

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,040
And he says, "Fucked up AIDS from fucked up sex."

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,760
You get it from real fucked up sex.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,720
You do something fucking messed up when you're having sex.

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,440
Fucked up AIDS from fucked up sex.

44
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
Yeah.

45
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,680
And then he says, "Fucked up titties on a fucked up chest."

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,840
You know what it is?

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,520
The way you get AIDS is if...

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,760
You know how sometimes people say like to last longer in bed, like imagine like your grandma

49
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
or something.

50
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Yeah.

51
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,640
If you imagine a gay guy, you get AIDS.

52
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Yeah.

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Yeah.

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
If you imagine AIDS.

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
That one slipped out of my mouth.

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Thanks Patrick.

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,000
You really set me up for that.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come on.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's what you said.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, you said it.

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Patrick said that if you're gay, you have AIDS.

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No.

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You did, dude.

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You wrote it on Notes app and you sent to me a screenshot.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You said that.

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,760
I sent it to Caleb on Whatsapp.

69
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
You did Whatsapp me.

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,480
Caleb doesn't even have a Whatsapp.

71
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
I know.

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
I should move to India and get on Whatsapp.

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Get a Whatsapp?

74
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Yeah.

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Be a Whatsapp guy?

76
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
It's like the biggest thing in India.

77
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
It's big in every other country.

78
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Really?

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,640
India's the biggest Whatsapp user base.

80
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
What is it?

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,760
It's just like texting for WiFi.

82
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,280
It's just WiFi texting and calling.

83
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,720
Oh, so it's like that free, that thing you would get.

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
It's iMessage basically.

85
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Yeah.

86
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,240
used to get in like 2010 it was called like iFreeText message for the

87
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,080
iPod Touch. Yeah, where they made it kind of look like the iMessage but it

88
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,160
was like a little shitty and there's like always an ad at the bottom.

89
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,480
You're like I'm not fooling anybody when I pull out my iPod Touch at

90
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,200
school. They know I don't have a phone yet. It's also like ten times thinner. And having a phone was

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,360
such a status symbol when you were in like middle school.

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
- Yeah.

93
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,040
- It was like, yeah.

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,840
- I didn't have a phone until I was like 16.

95
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,120
- Yeah, I had a--

96
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,080
- Well, I had like, I didn't have an iPhone until I was 16.

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,420
I had like a phone for a year before,

98
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,440
so it's until I was 15 I didn't have a phone.

99
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,080
- That's a little late, I would wager.

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
- Hmm, yeah. - Yeah.

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
- I would say it's a little late.

102
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,280
- Wow, what age do you have a phone?

103
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
- It's crazy how that's a little late.

104
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
- I think maybe-- - You were a late bloomer.

105
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,580
You were a late fooner.

106
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,680
- A phone-er. - A late phone-er.

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,520
- Fooner.

108
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,580
- You were a late fooner, my friend.

109
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,140
You didn't have apps growing up.

110
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
I didn't have apps until I was...

111
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,180
I didn't grow apps until I was 16 or 17.

112
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,020
I did have apps because I still had an iPod Touch that I still...

113
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,740
You had apps as in TGI Friday's fucking baked potato skins, you big fat bitch.

114
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
I used to get those as a kid.

115
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
I'm sorry, I'm locked in.

116
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,340
Well, this is back when I wasn't fat.

117
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,540
It's a lot different.

118
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,100
You had apps like the celery on the side of some hot wings because you were a skinny little

119
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
bitch.

120
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
It's true.

121
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
Yeah.

122
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
What are you saying?

123
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Flip phone.

124
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
I got worms on it.

125
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
He got worms on his damn phone.

126
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
He got worms on his damn phone.

127
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
He's putting worms on his damn phone.

128
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
It's crazy.

129
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
It was like a tiny flip screen.

130
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Like this big.

131
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Did it make it hard to use it?

132
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Because you would squish all the worms.

133
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
What?

134
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
What is the cat doing?

135
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Oh, he just fucking stuck his dick

136
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,820
dick in the other one's face. No, he just fucking jumped onto him like that. Yeah. That was awesome.

137
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,620
And his penis landed squarely in the mouth of the other one. Yeah. A little fucking gay wad.

138
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:54,100
I know, they're gay. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. It is awesome. Um, I cut off my fucking finger,

139
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:01,380
dude. Oh yeah. It sucks, dude. I cut off a huge chunk of my finger. Shut up. Yeah, who cares,

140
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,020
dude? Shut up. I'm talking about my finger. My cat looks awesome. No, he looks- Oh boy,

141
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
"My cat looks sexy!"

142
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
Shut up, dude.

143
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
We have to feed him a bunch now.

144
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Take a picture of him and put him online.

145
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,020
Okay, go ahead.

146
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,340
And say, "This guy is like a monster energy drink to me."

147
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Yeah, and have some fucking Washington Post reporter retweet it and be like, "These cats

148
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
are everything to me."

149
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,020
You fucking bitch.

150
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,540
I cut my finger off, Patrick.

151
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,060
Will you look at me?

152
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
I saw your finger.

153
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
No, you didn't.

154
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Yeah, I did.

155
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
You showed me the finger.

156
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Yeah, you didn't.

157
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,660
You were trying to do some Jon Favreau stuff, right?

158
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
You cut ginger.

159
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
I did, yeah.

160
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,900
because you thought it was ginger because it was all brown.

161
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,340
I didn't think it was, I didn't think my finger was ginger.

162
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,660
Your finger was brown from being stained from being in your ass.

163
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
No.

164
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
What happened was I was.

165
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,340
You were sitting on your thumb and your finger was.

166
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Shut up.

167
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
I'm going to crush your cat's mouth.

168
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
No.

169
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,340
Your finger was so brown from your butt.

170
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,340
I'm going to destroy your cat on my ass.

171
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,860
I'm going to sit on your cat like a wrecking ball.

172
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,540
Your finger was brown from your butt and you thought it was a part of the ginger which is

173
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,780
also brown and you cut it.

174
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,140
You can't talk for five minutes.

175
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
No I can't.

176
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,620
I had a dream where my arm got crushed in an elevator and got really

177
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,620
fucked up and was like mangled. Was it like crooked? It was like, no it got really

178
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:20,220
thin. Yeah. And like... Your arm gets hit by an elevator and it just like shrinks. Well it was like thin and like fucked up and like...

179
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,940
Yeah it was like it was like the width of like one finger. Before we go on

180
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,140
this date, I need you to know I have a thin arm. And they were like we're

181
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,020
gonna have to amputate your arm and I was really sad in the dream. I was just like

182
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,740
I was like really upset and it was like a really emotional dream.

183
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,380
And then in the dream, I went to bed and when I woke up, my arm was just normal again.

184
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,380
I'm just like, oh.

185
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,020
Because I had just been like going in my dream, I just even going to my family and being like,

186
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
look what happened to my arm.

187
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,340
Like my life is ruined.

188
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
I can't believe this.

189
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,340
And it was just normal the next day.

190
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,620
And then you woke up?

191
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,620
And I woke up.

192
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,980
How many days did you live just with a normal arm?

193
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,500
Well, I just I woke up after my arm was normal.

194
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I don't think much happened after that.

195
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
after that.

196
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,100
You looked at your arm and then you were like, "That shit's normal."

197
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
I'm sure other stuff happened, I don't remember.

198
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,180
Oh yeah, but I guess that is a dream story.

199
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,500
I cut my thumb off.

200
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,540
I also had another dream.

201
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,860
Oh my God, I cut a big chunk of my thumb off and I wrapped it and I have to keep the wrap

202
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,300
on for like a month.

203
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,020
It says, "My mom," because I didn't go to the doctor, but I can just feel just like how

204
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,220
much blood is pooling in this thing.

205
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,420
because it's still bleeding it's been like a day and a half. You can see it

206
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,900
bleeding through my bandage right here. Next time you see Caleb he's just like white. I can't see it.

207
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Where? Oh there. Yeah I can see it. And I can just feel it like squishing around. It sucks dude.

208
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm never gonna be the same. Yeah you are. You will. No I won't. You're gonna wake up tomorrow

209
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,860
it's coming back to normal. I swear to god. That's why I told my story. Yeah exactly. I was prefacing

210
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,340
I swear to God I was thinking, the fucking stupid part is I was thinking about, I was

211
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:09,020
cutting ginger and I was truly thinking about Chef with Jon Favreau and I was like, I swear

212
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,980
to God, my last thought before I cut the tip of my fucking finger off was like, I'm cutting

213
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,860
so fast right now and my fingers aren't even getting chopped off.

214
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,380
My fingers are completely fine.

215
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:30,680
Slice and I just thought I it's and I panicked that so I called my mom and I was like what

216
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,220
do you do when you slice part of your finger off?

217
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,540
She's like you need to throw the piece that you sliced off you need to put that in some

218
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,620
ice and then take it somewhere and they'll stitch it back on and then I was like oh where

219
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,780
is it and then I realized that in the immediate panic after I cut it off I just threw it in

220
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
the trash can.

221
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,780
(laughter)

222
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,620
'Cause I was like, 'cause my brain went into little kid mode

223
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,120
and I was like, I'm in trouble.

224
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,180
(laughter)

225
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,580
And I threw the piece of my finger in the trash can

226
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,100
and then I, and the trash can was full of coffee grounds,

227
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,500
fucking like vegetable shavings,

228
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
and she was like, find the piece,

229
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,940
and I tried for like 10 minutes,

230
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,300
just with my finger bleeding,

231
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,580
looking in the trash can for the other part of it.

232
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,100
And then I just gave up and I just wrapped it and went home.

233
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,140
- Went home?

234
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,680
Yeah, I was working, I was doing my nanny job.

235
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,340
Oh, okay. I was like making dinner.

236
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,900
I was making Herrera soup.

237
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,620
Damn. What is that?

238
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,460
It's ginger. Herrera soup?

239
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,220
Yeah, it's ginger, or it's onions.

240
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,620

241
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,900
and some garlic.

242
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,700
You saute all that together.

243
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,980
You add spices that are like turmeric,

244
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,780
and cardamom, and cinnamon, and some paprika.

245
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,020
Is it an Indian dish?

246
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,500

Not Guga. We've talked about Guga.

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:28,020
I watched a video last night that Guga made where he like took chicken bones and then he made like a creamy

Cameron, pull it up. He looks like he made cartoon.

261
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,060
I like when he's like, "We're gonna dry age a shoe."

262
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,300
And then they dry age a shoe.

263
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,860

264
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:55,540

265
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,980
shoe in front of Angel.

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,420

What's the young guy?

270
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,460
The young guy is his kid. And then Angel is like his cousin.

271
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,140
Yeah, Angel. All the ones I watch have Angel.

272
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,640
Angel's the best.

273
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:16,760
He'll set a shoe in front of Angel and he'll be like, "So you want to try, how's it look?"

274
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,680
And Angel will be like, "Man, this is a shoe, man. I can see this is a shoe, man."

275
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,100
And Google will be like, "Well, give it a taste."

276
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,440
And he'll take like two bites of it and be like, "Did you dry age this shoe?"

277
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,360
Yeah, he's like immediately like he loves everything he puts in front of them.

278
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,840
Yeah, unless there was one where he did a...

383
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:04,280
that video on repeat. Scientology killed him. The Gummy Bear video, the production company

384
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,440

386
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,000
John Travolta that never came out because they were just spending money on helicopter

387
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,040
Damn dude, that was a very sexual gummy bear.

388
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Yeah.

389
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Yeah.

390
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I remember being grossed out when he did -

391
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Dude, he shows like half his ass.

392
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
He does his butt, yeah.

393
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
And I was like, why is he doing that?

394
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Can't he just sing?

395
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
And what if his ass is going crazy because he's German?

396
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
He has a crazy eye.

397
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,440
Yeah, because he's German people, yeah.

398
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,240
Somebody walked into the art gallery today with the most insane lazy eye I've ever seen.

399
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Yeah.

400
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
It was awesome.

401
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,480
I had a math teacher who - I was in like - I had to get extra help for math and my extra

402
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,220
help for math teacher yeah very lazy I and I couldn't pay attention to any of

403
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,740
the problems because I didn't know which it's honestly so hard to be around this

404
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,180
people just until you get used to it yeah I mean like you know I never got used to

405
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,100

406
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,920
just laughing all over again yeah fuck you yeah fuck that math bitch dude

407
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
She's very nice.

408
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,640
She fucking sucks, man.

409
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,520
Math teacher, I've never had good experiences with math teachers.

410
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,480
I told you guys about my crazy 6th grade math teacher, right?

411
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,720
There was this math teacher in my school, my middle school, who was Indian and her name

412
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
was Miss Kaushik.

413
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
And you can guess how that went.

414
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah.

415
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
That was tough.

416
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,320
People used to call her Miss Cowlick.

417
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Yeah.

418
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
People used to call her Miss Crazy.

419
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Yeah, Miss K, but with a K.

420
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Miss Crazy with a K.

421
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,820
I also had an Indian math teacher, but I think her name was like Miranda or something.

422
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
Oh well, you know what they do with that one.

423
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Yeah.

424
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Mermanda.

425
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,820
I had an assistant Indian, an assistant math teacher who was Indian.

426
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,820
And she saw on the back of my phone case, I found a label maker and I wrote like poop boobs or something on it.

427
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,320
That's fucking awesome.

428
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,320
And I had like stickers that said like 420 and shit and I was like this is hilarious.

429
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,200
And then one day I just had my phone backwards and she was trying to help me with a problem

430
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,320
and then she kept laughing at my phone case.

431
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,080
It's pretty good.

432
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,320
My younger brother, the like really young one, he's like learning how to spell.

433
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Yeah.

434
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,640
Kind of late, but that's a different thing.

435
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,240
He's learning how to spell and he found the label maker and he just started on like everything

436
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
in the house.

437
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,880
Like he just writes random shit and puts it on it.

438
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,560
I was looking at this I was like trying to staple something and I looked at the

439
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:49,760
stapler and it said poop mom poop this crap crap dad yeah yeah minecraft - it's

440
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,840
it's awesome dude it's a paradise it's pretty good I wish somebody would rename

441
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:01,400
stuff that I wish I had minecraft yeah my house - I think is the microwave the

442
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:12,680
best game in the house. Minecraft is... Minecraft is sort of a game. It's true. Yeah, it's got

443
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,800
buttons. Yeah, it's got buttons. You put a lizard in there. Somebody told me a story

444
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:25,200
about someone they knew put their hamster in the microwave but like... Oh, God! But wrapped

445
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,800
it in tinfoil first. So they purposely were like I'm gonna destroy it.

446
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,120
They were like really little and they were just like oh that's what you do when

447
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,760
you put something in the microwave. And then I salted him with gunpowder.

448
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,120
I told you guys about my math teacher, my sixth grade math

449
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,720
teacher right? Is this the same story the third time? No. I feel like you've told

450
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,560
If you start it with, "I've told you this," right?

451
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,400
No, you told us about deluxe hugs. Yeah.

452
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,720
Yeah.

453
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,240
Have I said it on pod? I don't know.

454
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,120
No, I think you just told us that at Ryan's house.

455
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,440
Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, I had a math teacher who was clearly like an old pep.

456
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
Go on. Go off.

457
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
Cameron, take notes.

458
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
He used to say, "Fresh slice of paper," and then lick his lips.

459
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,440
We all thought he just had dementia, but it was like you can't just be around kids and have dementia.

460
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,940
Why?

461
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,720
And still not teach, because he had to teach a math class.

462
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,220
So?

463
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,640
Was he bad at it or something?

464
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
No, he was really good at math.

465
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,720
Exactly.

466
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,440
That was the problem.

467
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,600
Well, that's the... I feel like he's a great teacher then.

468
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,240
He would say penis M&Ms on purpose and he would lick his lips when he said fresh slice of paper.

469
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Fresh slice of paper thing... you're not building a great case against him as a pedophile, dude.

470
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
What? Oh, I told you about the deluxe hugs.

471
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Accusations of pedophile, deluxe, you didn't explain that though.

472
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,840
Oh yeah, that's true.

473
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,200
You just said deluxe hugs.

474
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,560
You know, the deluxe hugs guy.

475
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,840
Oh, so he, well I can't really explain, never mind.

476
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,880
You can't stop explaining.

477
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,240
Yeah, so he would grab kids by the, this was his deluxe hugs, he would grab kids by the shoulder.

478
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,040
And then he would go, like he would put his head on their-

479
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,920
Talk into the microphone.

480
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,800
He would put his head on their right shoulder, then their left shoulder,

481
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,440
then stare at them like in the face and go...

482
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,840
And stick his tongue out.

483
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
Do a frog lick?

484
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,600
Hey, do like a frog lick like near their face.

485
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,240
And that's what he gave kids at the end of the school year.

486
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,320
To me, honestly, that is less like kind of weird than just any long hug.

487
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,440
Yeah, that is less pedophile than a hug.

488
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,280
I think he invented the deluxe hug so that he wouldn't actually hug the kids.

489
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,880
Oh, well, I mean, he's not...

490
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
So he would keep his temptations down.

491
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Avoid his urges.

492
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Exactly.

493
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Okay.

494
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,200
Yeah, and also, you know, licking his, you know, putting his tongue out of his mouth,

495
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,920
it's not that crazy, he does it when he thinks about paper.

496
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
You've already established that.

497
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
You know what I mean?

498
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,880
Like it's not, he thinks of these kids, there might as well be paper to him.

499
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Yeah.

500
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
You know?

501
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,040
So I don't know, I feel like he's not a pedophile, but maybe just sort of a monster.

502
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
A cool guy.

503
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Yeah.

504
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Yeah.

505
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
A cool guy to hang out with.

506
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040

535
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:25,340

and he ran away. Just doing that to a... I don't do that to a...

537
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,180
A Boston police officer, one of the brave men in blue who are out there fucking...

538
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,220
Stopping the Boston bombing every day.

539
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,380
Yeah, dude. That's... And then, yeah, one slipped through the freaking cracks.

540
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,340
And now we have to disrespect all Boston cops.

541
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,900
People have been trying to do that bomb every day for 30 years.

542
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,300
True.

543
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:54,300
And two fucking... Two hot sauce named fucking weirdos get it through.

544
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,580
What does that mean?

545
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,820
Doesn't that sound like a, you know, kind of hot sauce?

546
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,500
Jokar Sarnaev does not sound like a hot sauce.

547
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,540
Sarnaev sounds like a sort of like a harissa kind of sauce.

548
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:02,700
No.

549
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,860
You're an idiot, you're an idiot.

550
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,060
Neither of you know anything about -

551
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,540
Sarnaev sounds more like a -

552
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,980
More like a Boston bomber.

553
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,820
It sounds more like a guy who bombed the Boston mossomer.

554
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,020
The Boston mossomer.

555
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,900
Sounds like the name of the holiday -

556
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,500
The Boston gossamer.

557
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:19,660
Yeah.

558
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,260
The Boston bossomer.

559
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,580
Whoa.

560
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,820
I'm the Boston bossomer.

561
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,780
I'm the boss of bossomers.

562
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,780
What did you hear?

563
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,780
Did you hear another?

564
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,780
The Grinch's goose.

565
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,780
The Grinch's goose.

566
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,780
No.

567
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
No.

568
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,660
I heard the Grinch's goose is going to be in Boston.

569
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,140
Are you serious?

570
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,420
For the marathon.

571
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
With Grinch eggs.

572
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
No.

573
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,380
He's going to leave Grinch eggs on the sidelines.

574
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,100
Grinch eggs are one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen.

575
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
They smell so bad.

576
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,340
They smell like stinky piss.

577
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,060
You crack that thing open, green eggs.

578
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,840
eggs and Grinch what do you think the ham is it's oh my god it's Grinch no it's

579
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,980

580
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,700
no no hams normal okay the ham is always normal it's green eggs and regular ham

581
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,580
actually I don't remember I think it's green ham - yeah it's not hard to make a

582
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,100
green ham though I mean well if it's made out of Grinch meat yeah do shit

583
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,480
this guy fucking dr. Seuss was obsessed with green he was obsessed with the

584
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,420
Grinch and Japanese people yeah those were his Grinch mm-hmm this is funny we

585
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,560
talk it for at least 10 minutes every episode about the great I talk it's such

586
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,260
it like I I mean I have to stop myself more than 10 minutes dude the Grinch is

587
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:44,400
like all I think about now I my boss caught me the other day in the art

588
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,040
gallery just talking myself saying Grinch stuff she's like you see the

589
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:55,560
great you have to switch locations you have to go to the other gallery and I was

590
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:03,200
like yeah sorry I was thinking about the Grinch yeah dude um it's a man I have

591
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,240
Grinch brain dude it's like Epstein brain but like way worse because it's

592
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,280
about the cringe is so much just a much worse thing to do to a kid is steal its

593
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,480
presence exactly yeah I feel like I never I don't know that I'll ever get presents

594
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,480
again mm-hmm you know doesn't that worry you guys live in friggin fear isn't that

595
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,360
a thought that runs in your brain all day every day yeah you I won't get my

596
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,080
present I might not get presents this year this might be the year I finally

597
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,040
stopped getting presents I might just get a bag of items I think I was oh no

598
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:45,840
Yeah, cuz here's the thing about the Grinch. Uh-huh. This Santa, if you're bad,

599
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,400
he still gives you coal. Yeah, you can fuel your house with that shit.

600
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,040
The Grinch, doesn't matter if you're good or you're bad, you get nothing. That's true.

601
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,840
You get nothing, dude. Nothing. Because he Grinched out in your house. I might get--

602
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,920
He takes the coal. Okay, but I might get like candy or something. Not if the Grinch has

603
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,800
his way I could hide it the great I could hide it from the Grinch you couldn't you

604
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,920
know he has a great vision dude no you're right you cannot 100% more

605
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,040
powerful yeah but I could still hide it no you're gonna Grinch grind what about

606
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,160
a Grinch crime Grinch grind what about what if you were indicted on Grinch

607
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,360
crimes mm-hmm Grinch crimes against the press the

608
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,560
Prince to grind down to 12-steer crap nice yeah doing the grit the Grinch

609
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,480
You should invent a new trick called the Grinch.

610
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,680
Yeah. Did I send you guys that GTA 5 mod with the Grinch?

611
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
No.

612
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,800
Do you guys think the Grinch is a spirit or a ghost or something else?

613
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,200
The Grinch is a guy. Let's be clear.

614
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,960
I watched that JayStation video where he downloads a Grinch from the dark web or where he buys

615
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
a Grinch.

616
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
He calls the Grinch.

617
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
The Blue Grinch or the Grinch?

618
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Did you watch the whole video?

619
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
No.

620
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,080
apparates Harry Potter style into his living room and steals his girlfriend

621
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,940
in a green cloud of smoke. So that made me reconsider. He might be a spirit. It made

622
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,600
me think he might be a you know he might even be a poltergeist. Yeah. A polter

623
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Grinch. He could be. Might even be a Grinchergeist. Oh man. Yeah. A Grincher

624
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,920
guy. He might be a Grinch Christ. He might be. That's a terrifying argument. Oh my god. Grinch

625
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:37,640
Christ yeah it's just in green slime but with green slime yeah it's terrifying

626
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,360
that'd be the worst they should crucify the Grinch we will crucify the Grinch

627
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,360
yeah when we find the Grinch and we compromise him to a permanent end he

628
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,240
will be crucified like like they did Jesus Christ what about like they do

629
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,960
you know other people say like eat the rich eat the Grinch oh see I don't think

630
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:05,020
think the Grinch would have I met the Grinch he's black. I met the Grinch he's green and mean

631
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:10,660
and he hates presents. Do you think he where does he put the presents is he like

632
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,580
comp is he compost? Oh doesn't he eat them? I don't think the Grinch eats the presents.

633
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,660
I don't think he eats the presents. The Blue Grinch eats the presents. I'll tell you that the Blue Grinch eats the presents.

634
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,800
So the Blue Grinch and the Green Grinch were separated at birth yeah you know and

635
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,280
the blue Grinch - Don't even get me started on the pink Grinch - The pink Grinch is the

636
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,920
girl Grinch and she has humongous pink breasts - It's either the Grinch's - From what I've

637
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,960
learned it's either the Grinch's sister or his girlfriend - It's both - It's both

638
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,600
because in Grinch, in the Grinch's fucked-up brain that's okay - Yeah and it's

639
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,360
actually good - That's how fucked up these Grinches are - That's how messed up these

640
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,400
people and I use people very lightly - Grinch-est - Are - Who? They're who's - They're who's, no the who's

641
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,120
are also not people though because who's are a dog elves that's true they live in

642
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,840
a snowflake they live in a snow yeah so that's the crazy thing though good one

643
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,920
Patrick the Grinch great Patrick that's you're doing great

644
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:18,000
do all right Caleb yeah so the thing is that's so terrifying about the Grinch is

645
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,840
that he can obviously change sizes. We know that he can be both sort of an

646
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,440
atomic sized Grinch in the tiniest Whoville nucleus of a snowflake, but he

647
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,600
can also be an enormous human sized Grinch because I've seen him. So I guess

648
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,600
what's scary about that is that if he can change that much, we don't know what

649
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,400
the ends of the spectrum are. Maybe he can go quantum like Ant-Man and he can jump

650
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,900
to a time where there were no presents. Well that's how he got here, he's from the

651
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,060
future. He's from the future like Ant-Man. Yeah. And he jumped into a quantum time

652
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:04,380
loop to stop presents from ever being invented. And he keeps failing. He killed baby Santa.

653
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,580
He went back in time and he killed baby Santa dude. Well it didn't work though. Yeah

654
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,380
because I mean history will rewrite, history will always rewrite itself.

655
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
History has its eyes on the Grinch.

656
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,380
That's what quantum theory is.

657
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,380
History is written by the Grinchers.

658
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,380
E=MC2 is about the Grinch.

659
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
E is...

660
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Evil.

661
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,380
M stands for man-like green creature.

662
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,380
Man-like creature.

663
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
And then 2 is the

664
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
numerical number for green.

665
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
Yeah, that's true.

666
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
Yeah.

667
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
Because a green...

668
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
We don't need to explain.

669
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,260
it actually mathematically numerical.

670
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,380
- It's hashtag, G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G.

671
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,140
- Exactly, which all stands for Grinch.

672
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,900
You think it stands for green, it stands for Grinch.

673
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
What came first, the Grinch or the green?

674
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,860
- Probably, probably the green.

675
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,700
- The green, yeah. - Probably the green.

676
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,180
- It was the green.

677
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,340
- It probably was the green.

678
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,180
- It was from the future.

679
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,460
- I think there were things green before the Grinch.

680
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
- No, it used to be-- - What about grass?

681
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,820
- Grass used to be--

682
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,300
- Grass is part of the Grinch that fell off and--

683
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,500
- Grass is Grinch hair.

684
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,460
- Yeah, it grew onto the planet.

685
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,300
- Oh my God, that's one of the most terrifying.

686
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,140
- He came back, he's from another planet as well.

687
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,380
- He is very stuffed.

688
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,540
Yeah, he's also from, he's from space Grinch 9.

689
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,700
- Planet Grinch.

690
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
- He's from Grinch X.

691
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,620
- Grinch X.

692
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,260
- Yeah, which is a, and it's shaped exactly like his head.

693
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,100
And it just flies through space

694
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,340
at an unimaginable speed towards Earth

695
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,120
and we never know when it's gonna hit.

696
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,960
- Never.

697
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,700
- But we will blink out of existence

698
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,900
in an instant when it does.

699
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,020
- It's gonna steal the, oh my God, oh my God.

700
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,160
he came from the future to steal the present

701
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,100
world

702
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,740
for

703
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,260
for

704
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,220

705
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,880

Yeah, that's a real guy man. We're talking about the freaking Grinch right now.

713
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,760
Bringing in this guy who has Parkinson's. Fuck you man.

714
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,200
Do you think if they did make like a Back to the Future 4, do you think that would,

715
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,160
do you think they would write that into Marty Fly's character?

716
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,660
Wow, the future is so shaky. They would put it, it would stabilize him with a video camera.

717
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,460
They would do the video stabilization on him and everything around him would shake.

718
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,180
Whoa, this is an earthquake 24/7 in California in the year 2080.

719
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,980
Yeah, it's time interference Marty.

720
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Why is everything so shaky?

722
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:53,220
Well, let me tell you, a little president in the 2015's named Donald J. Trump.

723
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,220
Yeah, that's right, he made the world shaky and now Marty McFly.

724
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,220
With his fat ass.

725
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Yeah, his big fat ass.

726
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,260
He's been walking around the White House so much that he caused a fucking, he caused stalactites

727
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
to happen.

728
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,000
(laughing)

729
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,060
Forgot the word for tectonic plates

730
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,360
and I went a different direction.

731
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,280
- Donald Trump put a bunch of stalactites on the ground.

732
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,320
- Donald Trump sat on a stalactite chair.

733
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
- In the year 20XX.

734
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,640
- Good thing of stalagmites.

735
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,960
- They're both, no, stalagmite is a bug.

736
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,800
A stalactite.

737
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,720
(laughing)

738
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,200
A stalactite is an evil sword

739
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,000
that runs from the bottom of the ground.

740
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,960
- And sure. - Because water,

741
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,080
here's the thing about stalactites and stalagmites,

742
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,680
they'll make no goddamn sense.

743
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,320
stalagmites, or stalactites I understand.

744
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,680
It's water dripping off of the cave or whatever,

745
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,520
the erosion makes it go.

746
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,000
- Yeah, but the ones that go up.

747
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,880
- But the ones that go, wait,

748
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,700
you tell me water went upstairs?

749
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,520
- What?

750
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,880
- I think-- - It's probably magnet water.

751
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,720
- Oh.

752
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,080
- And the top of the cave is a magnet.

753
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,040
- Yeah, and it's as a, yeah, and it's magnetized water.

754
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,720
- I think it's just because of,

755
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,520
the earth turns around, so.

756
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,120
- Would you drink the water if it had magnets in it?

757
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Yeah.

758
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Discuss.

759
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
Yeah, I would.

760
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,560
I would be afraid because I take a lot of lead supplements, I would be afraid that they

761
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,520
would be attracted to the water.

762
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,320
Would you ever eat a magnet?

763
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I would eat a magnet.

764
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
Yeah?

765
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Yeah, for like 60 bucks.

766
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,640
I would eat three magnets.

767
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,040
You know like those ones that you--

768
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
For free?

769
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,880
Like the rattlesnake magnets where you like put them, you throw them in the air and then

770
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
they go and--

771
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,480
Yeah, just like a rattlesnake.

772
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Yeah.

773
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Yeah.

774
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,000
on the inside of your stomach and then put the magnet on the outside.

775
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,800
That would be pretty funny. Yeah. That would be some funny ass bullshit. Okay.

776
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,840
I think people would like it at least. I could probably go to different

777
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,480
like malls and be like check out this magic trick and they'd just be like

778
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,600
oh nice dude you you glued the magnet to your stomach. No but then I would move it up and down.

779
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,440
And they're like oh great you have a sticky magnet. Yeah and I'd be like you've...

780
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,800
I you guys need to believe me I need to get a new job and you can just hold the

781
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,440
magnet that's when you're legs and it'll pull the pull the other one out of your

782
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,280
ass all right nevermind I would pull a magnet out of my ass no problem

783
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,560
what if we get like dermal piercings right yeah I know you learned about

784
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,360
this yeah we get a subdermal implant yeah right here of a magnet of them

785
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,400
Right where it's like a metal stomach. Yeah, and then you put like a

786
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,120
Magnet and then we can get like big magnets you can put them on it

787
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,200
Whoa, what if you got a giant hook on your back so you could hang on to a telephone pole and swing around?

788
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,300
What if you got a light bulb installed in your chest like Iron Man? Mm-hmm, right?

789
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,160
What if I do anything but it looks cool if I go good fly?

790
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,140
What if Cameron could fly?

791
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,260
If Cameron, if you could fly, I would totally send you to the store to get me some French fries.

792
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,760
Yeah.

793
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,260
Right now.

794
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,760
Oh, damn.

795
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
Pat threw away his French fries.

796
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
You did? What now?

797
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
I didn't know. I didn't know when you were gonna get here.

798
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
You threw away some fries, man?

799
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,260
Yeah.

800
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,760
Before I got home?

801
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
I asked Cameron if he was gonna eat them.

802
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
I already ate French fries before I got here.

803
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,760
He said he already ate French fries and then I asked Dominique and well, they were her fries.

804
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,760
And she said she didn't want them, so I offered them to Cameron and Cameron said no.

805
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
And you were like, "Those are the two people I know."

806
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Those are the only two people who were here.

807
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Those are the only two people who I'll see tonight.

808
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,320
I couldn't feed them to the cats.

809
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Why?

810
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,680
I don't know.

811
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Yeah.

812
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Cats can have potatoes.

813
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,280
They should put on a little beef anyway.

814
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,880
No, they are, dude.

815
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Look at Yoda.

816
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Yoda's like getting big.

817
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,000
Yeah, has he been going to your cat gym?

818
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,080
No, he's just been feeding them a lot.

819
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
Yeah?

820
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
What have you been feeding them?

821
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Food.

822
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
What kind of food?

823
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Dry food.

824
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Cat food?

825
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Yeah.

826
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Why don't you go wet?

827
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,680
Oh, you got both.

828
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,520
Is it because sometimes they like to change the opposite treat?

829
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
We give them wet food for dinner.

830
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,440
Oh, that's what I eat for dinner.

831
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Yeah.

832
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
I only eat wet food for dinner.

833
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,920
Dry in the morning, wet at night.

834
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
I'm the opposite.

835
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Yeah?

836
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Yeah.

837
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
I have wet, I have...

838
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Wet breakfast?

839
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
I have wet drinks and dry drinks.

840
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,560
I made my wet breakfast today.

841
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah.

842
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Wet breakfast.

843
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
Yeah.

844
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
I had wet breakfast this morning.

845
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
Oatmeal?

846
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
Cereal.

847
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Cereal.

848
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Damn, I want some cereal right now.

849
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Yeah, you know what would come to my house to eat my cereal?

850
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,560
I like healthy people cereal. I like like grape nuts and shit.

851
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,560
I like Raisin Bran. I love Raisin Bran. I like any bran cereal.

852
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,560
I like bran flakes. I like those bran tubes.

853
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,560
I don't like any kind of cereal. No? You wouldn't even fuck with a Lucky Charms?

854
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,560
No, that's the worst. That's my least favorite. Patrick loves Lucky Charms.

855
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,560
I hate Lucky Charms. Pat loves Lucky Charms.

856
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,560
They make fun of my people. You call yourself Irish?

857
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:47,720
No, that's a mockery. No it's not. It was created by the leprechaun. Lucky the leprechaun.

858
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,120
He beats the kids every single time. Is that so embarrassing? Yeah, Irish people beat up their kids.

859
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,000
They don't beat the kids, he outruns them. It says Irish people are way

860
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,120
are faster than any kid alive. Lucky the leprechaun is the same as Chief Wahoo.

861
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,560
Yeah. Or that picture of that Jewish guy rubbing his hands. Yeah.

862
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,700
Yeah, Lucky the Leprechaun is Aunt John's mascot.

863
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,760
Yeah, the Jewish guy rubbing his hands, Ronald McDonald.

864
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,580
We're living in the Lucky Leprechaun era, said like the Jim Crow era.

865
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,280
Yeah, because they're sort of the same thing.

866
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,040
Yeah, the new Jim Crow is Lucky the Leprechaun.

867
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,080
Yeah, that book's about Lucky.

868
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Yeah.

869
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
Yeah.

870
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,560
The whole book is about being a--

871
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
The entire thing.

872
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
I haven't read it yet.

873
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Just know.

874
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,920
No, but I'm pretty sure it's about Lucky the Leprechaun and how it is an absolute mockery

875
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
of the Irish people.

876
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,800
I don't know what else it could be about.

877
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,240
I mean, that green suit, that's just a classic fucking...

878
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,840
Shamrock on his hat, fuck you.

879
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,880
Yeah, fuck you, dude.

880
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,120
It's funny how many Irish people you see with the shamrock tattoo.

881
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,640
Oh yeah, my uncle.

882
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,920
My dad has a shamrock tattoo.

883
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Your dad has one?

884
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
God, I'm so glad I'm not Irish.

885
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,040
He's got a shamrock and then he's got his... my dead Nana's initials.

886
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
His mom.

887
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040

892
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:12,100
Naboo, Naboo. Oh my god, dude, you're Star Wars-ese. No, then I don't know what the NAB stands for cuz it's not my

893
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:19,740
That's what he said about his mom no, yeah, he said he's got a bit he's got like the barbed wire

894
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,780
Tattoo on his barbed wire. I back barbed wire tats

Humongously, he's that's the uncle who got in that car accident. Oh, no, wait, we weren't

896
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,800

898
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,840
Epic win for sure. I told you. That's a victory royale if I've ever heard one. I think I told you

899
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,560
about this. But I hadn't seen my Nana or my grandma since I was like 14 and then

900
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,600
like I saw her for the first time in this hospital room and she just looked

Whoa.

920
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,960
Oh my God.

921
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:34,000
When I was a kid I saw this episode of House where like somebody has a kid that's intersex

922
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,480
and I looked at my taint and I was like oh my God I'm intersex. That's a vagina.

923
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,920
You think because like all people are.

924
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,800
Did someone just assume your parents didn't like know?

925
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Well no, I thought they knew but the--

926
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
They just, every time they changed you,

927
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
they looked away like, "Ahh!"

928
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
So in the show,

929
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
the kid--

930
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Seeing a baby dick is fine,

931
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
but a baby vagina...

932
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,800
No, but I--

933
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
In the show, the kid is like

934
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,800
13 or whatever and he's having some health

935
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,800
issues and they reveal that

936
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,800
he's intersex but they chose

937
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,800
to make him male by sewing

938
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,240
up the vagina and so I looked at my taint and I was like they sewed, there's a clear line,

939
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:29,240
they sewed the vagina and my balls were like, I mean it's like a Neapolitan ice cream gradient

940
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:37,240
and it's my dick, my balls and my pussy.

941
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:43,040
And turns out it wasn't true though.

942
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,540
I've been a guy since day one, baby.

943
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,540
Neapolitan ice cream, god damn.

944
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,460
Yeah, it was disgusting.

945
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:56,780
I do have a pink penis and white balls and a big red pussy.

946
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:01,540
That you're missing the brown. And a black pussy, is what I meant to say.

947
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,060
Black ice cream?

948
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,580
[laughter]

949
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,740
The greatest

950
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,260
Atlanta comedian ever.

00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,460
just named ice cream. Yeah and he's like damn I guess I'm black ice cream now.

953
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:33,020
Remember ice cream shoes? Ice cream is also black. They're both black. Two black guys

954
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,620
but one's black ice cream. Yeah. I black ice cream I think I've had

955
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:44,120

956
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,660
something black though what's black what's a liquorice it wasn't licorice

957
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,380
and it wasn't like dark chocolate was like pitch black yeah yeah might have

958
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,380
been a gimmick thing my friend you so no Noah he's working an ice cream shop and

959
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,020
he would just bring me ice cream all the time

00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,420
father's poop it was father's poop is black vial that falls out of his ass

961
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:10,540
Yeah, so when you take Pepto-Bismol and you take too much of it and you poop black.

962
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,820
Does Pepto-Bismol make you poop back?

963
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,820
Oh, yeah.

964
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,820
Really?

965
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,820
Because of the bismuth?

966
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,820
I almost...

967
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,820
Oh, I took...

968
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,700
You keep saying bismuth at me, I'm gonna smack your ass.

969
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,020
I don't know what that means, man.

970
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,300
Quit looking at me and saying bismuth and shit.

971
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:31,260
There was like a week where I just had really bad stomach problems and I was taking Pepto

972
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,500
And then like they stopped but then I like took a shit and it was just like dark black.

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Yeah, just an evil shit.

974
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Dark black?

975
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Yeah, it was like a Darth Vader poop.

I took a Vantablack shit and all the light in my bathroom went to my toilet.

979
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,500
It just, it turned off the lights.

980
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,500
It's like, yeah, you just hear the plop and then it's just dark.

981
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
Yeah, but I was sitting there.

hypochondriac? Yeah yeah. I thought I was allergic to weed for four years.

990
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,880
You thought that there was a car crash when the garbage can closed. Yeah that's

991
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,120
that's the same. That's the same thing as a hypochondriac. Patrick went to the doctor for the black

992
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:57,360
shit and they sliced open his butt and they just put vanilla in and then vanilla

shooting out like a pitching machine.

998
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,160
That's one of the most terrifying dreams I've ever heard.

999
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,160
He told me about it because I guess one night he woke up screaming and my mom

00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,760
ran into the room and he was like she was like what's going on what's going on he

00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,160
Like she knew and he was fucking.

1003
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,160
God damn. I've been having some of the most amazing shits in my life recently.

1004
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,280
Just A+ dude.

1005
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,320
Oh, I've had the worst.

1006
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,920
Just like a quick, like not too quick, because I used to sit down and it was like a, like

1007
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:57,560
somebody got like a question wrong on Nickelodeon and it was just like slime just falling.

1008
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,600
And just out of a big bucket.

1009
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,000
Yeah, and it's a really fast worm.

1010
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,040
It was exactly, yeah.

1011
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,080
No, no, because it was always, it was like a two year span where I shit liquid every

1012
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,240
single time. Yeah. And it would just explode like a like fucking bird shot at

1013
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,600
my ass. It's terrible dude. My toilets always, I had to like clean the toilet after every shit.

1014
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,640
I went to the doctor and she was like, I think you probably like, there's it's like 50/50 chance

1015
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,080
you either have like E. coli or stomach cancer. So I need you to like do a stool sample. And she

1016
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,360
like gave me the things and then I was like. You sprayed all over the car? No, I was just like,

1017
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,480
I don't want to fucking shit in this. So I left. Damn. Yeah. But I'm fine now. You know,

1018
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,860
know my shits are pretty yeah what if you when I was on Adderall I was just like I

1019
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:46,500
don't yeah it's fast worm a fast worm yeah they never have any a soft fast

1020
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:53,060
worm I never saw her took like a worm just like zoom a zooming warning us a

1021
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:59,380
zooming snake oh my god I really felt shit's trash the graces body such a

1022
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,880
shape of trash but it's brown but he didn't even they even need to eat it's

1023
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,280
like a soda can made of shit. Could you imagine the smell of a Grinch shit? Oh my god. I don't want to. It probably

1024
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,780
smells good actually. No. Because human shit smell bad. The Grinch smells bad. Yeah but the Grinch

1025
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:25,280
eats trash. So. We eat food. Food smells good. He eats rotten banana peels. Yeah that probably smells good. I saw Jim Carrey do it in the movie. No. He is a rotten banana peel.

1026
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,780
Remember that's in the song. So what is the what's the primary Grinch like sort

1027
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,660
like canon source. What's like the primary text of The Grinch? Is it the movie?

1028
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,140
Book.

1029
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,940
You think it's the book but the book doesn't provide enough things.

1030
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,300
No, there's not enough world building.

1031
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,380
I would say it's a - it ranks like this.

1032
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,100
Jim Carrey movie.

1033
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,020
Animated movie that has the famous smile.

1034
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:49,260
Yeah.

1035
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,540
Book.

1036
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,580
And then Halloween is Grinch night.

1037
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,500
No, no, no, and then the 3D movie.

1038
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,220
And then Halloween is Grinch night.

1039
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,660
What is Halloween is Grinch night?

1040
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,660
- You don't know that? - You haven't seen that?

1041
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,660
- No. - It's like this like...

1042
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,660
- It's one of the craziest. - Yeah.

1043
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,660
- It's dude, it will make you feel like you took acid and went to the Grinch party.

1044
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,660
- Yeah, which is I would never do that.

1045
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,660
- I would never go to the Grinch party in the first place.

1046
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,660
- We should...

1047
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,660
- Let alone do acid in the...

1048
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,660
- We honestly, we should do a smoke weeding watch along of the Grinch.

1049
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,660
- That's probably, I mean that makes the most sense for our watch along.

1050
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
- Me and Cameron hate smoking weed.

1051
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,660
- Yeah, I will freak out.

1052
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,660
- I will freak out too, but I will freak out.

1053
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,660
- I will freak out too.

1054
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,660
I will freak out.

1055
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,220
I will freak out too, but I'm willing to do it.

1056
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,220
I'll do it.

1057
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,420
Just because I think in that scenario I would freak out and just be like, I'm just watching

1058
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,420
The Grinch right now.

1059
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,820
So I think we could do it.

1060
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,820
Yeah.

1061
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,180
We keep suggesting movies to do watchalongs for.

1062
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,180
I think that's the obvious one.

1063
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,180
I think Grinch is the obvious one.

1064
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Yeah.

1065
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,340
And we have to, yeah, because we have big Grinch plans coming.

1066
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,100
Oh yeah, we sure do.

1067
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,100
We can't tell.

1068
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,100
That's still locked up in the vault.

1069
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,100
Top secret Grinch information.

1070
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,340
Yeah, that is between us and The Grinch and God.

1071
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,220
Me, you, God, the Grinch.

1072
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,220
The Grinch killed God.

1073
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:05,580
The Grinch climbed up to heaven on a big green ladder and he stabbed God with a green Grinch

1074
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,580
sword.

1075
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,500
He disemboweled that big white man.

1076
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,620
He disemboweled her.

1077
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,980
The Grinch killed God and she was black.

1078
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,980
Both of them.

1079
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,800
Yeah, both of them.

1080
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,800
Both of them she was black.

1081
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
There's two gods.

1082
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,160
I just heard that the Grinch drew a picture of the Prophet Muhammad.

1083
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,520
Alien vs. Predator vs. Grinch. Who wins?

1084
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,480
Grinch.

1085
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,560
The thing is, in this version, Alien and Predator

1086
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,600
are made out of presents.

1087
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,400
Grinch already won. I hope that.

1088
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,480
How about Grinch vs.

1089
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,480
How about Grinch vs. Evil?

1090
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,920
Obviously the answer is going to be Grinch, but Grinch vs. Grouch.

1091
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,620
ooh no hold on cuz Oscar the grouch yeah you seen grouch land it's like a Grinch's

1092
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:05,620
paradise and grouch grouch Oscar lives in trash they have to be granted seats

1093
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:10,260
trash Oscar the Grinch it's just we mispronounced it from Sesame Street

1094
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,500
people it's people have been think it's Oscar the Grinch but it's really Oscar

1095
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,580
the Grinch people just haven't been saying it wrong okay well so he's a

1096
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:23,380
Grinch? Because he's not the Oscar the Grinch. But he's not THE Grinch. Well yeah I mean he's Oscar the Grinch.

1097
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,860
The movie's called The Grinch though. Exactly so there's one Grinch. Well there's

1098
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,020
the Grinch and there's Oscar the Grinch. That'd be like calling the movie like the Chinese

1099
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:38,060
guy that's like... Yeah or Ip Man. What's that? You don't know Ip Man? It's a movie

1100
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:43,900
about the Ip Man. The guy who invented IP. Yeah he invented, he I-vented, he I-p-vented

1101
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:51,100
Kung Fu. He invented chop suey by system of a down. The bye-bye man invented saying

1102
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,860
goodbye. Yeah. That's why he's so scary. Yeah Mr. Meat invented the hamburger.

1103
00:55:55,860 --> 00:56:01,380
Mr. Meaty? Mr. Meaty from Nicktoons. Yeah. He invented the hamburger. Mm-hmm. Yeah,

1104
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,660
that's true. Well he said in the song, in the theme song, it says all God's

1105
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:11,300
creatures fresh off the grill. What else did he invent? He also, he invented

1106
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,700
the he invented the uh... world's biggest toilet

1107
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,660
once you take the

1108
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,580
when she the biggest hamburger you're gonna want to take the biggest shit and

1109
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,380
so it'd be built a big toilet just for that

1110
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,700
it's true for you talking about what are you talking about man

1111
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,740

is that available on streaming

1121
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,580
well maybe some

1122
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,220

1123
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,220
interest in but it's a different grinch

1124
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:00,020

bomb to tell you what i will pay three ninety nine to rent

1126
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,940
Well, what I'm thinking about more is just other people.

1127
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,940
True.

1128
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,940
It's annoying for a watch-along if we're gonna make people.

1129
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,580
Well, if we watch, we should upload it to the Patreon.

1130
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,580
Pirate the Grinch.

1131
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,580
Just the whole movie.

1132
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,580
And watermark it with a podcast logo.

1133
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,620
And then we could just put the audio on the movie.

1134
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,820
If we record ourselves in front of a green screen.

1135
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,240
That's actually a really good point.

1136
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,220
We could do Grinchery Grinches Theater Grinch 1000.

1137
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,900
Grinch tracks.

1138
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,900
Grinch tracks.

1139
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,740
- Yes.

1140
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,560
- Grinch tracks.

1141
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,400
- Yeah, 'cause we put us in the corner.

1142
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,420
- Let's just watch all the different Grinch movies.

1143
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,260
- Okay.

1144
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,100
- And do Grinch tracks.

1145
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,220
- We'll do a Grinch track for it.

1146
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,900
- Is there, yeah, there's a, wait.

1147
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,180
- There's three Grinch movies,

1148
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,740
plus Halloween is Grinch night.

1149
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,140
- I think I've seen part of Halloween is Grinch night

1150
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,340
now that I'm thinking about it.

1151
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,280
Is there like a lot of yellow in that movie?

1152
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,860
(laughing)

1153
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,780
- Dude, I don't know why I'm remembering it like a dream.

1154
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,900
Yeah, I'm remembering it like a dream.

1155
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,860
- Every time anyone brings anything up,

1156
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,380
Patrick is like, "Oh, was that the thing with the shapes in it?"

1157
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,380
Yeah.

1158
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,380
I think I know what you're talking about.

1159
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,500
Was that the Super Bowl where she showed her boob?

1160
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,740
I remember that vividly.

1161
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:17,460
Me too, because I remember we watched it on TV and then my older brother was like, "You

1162
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,100
want to watch that shit again?" and he brought me to the computer and we watched it like

1163
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,900
on YouTube or whatever.

1164
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,900
Yeah.
