Go ahead, JGL, press record.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,500
I did it. I did it already.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000
I think it is Marie Kondo.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's hit record.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
I think this is Marie Kondo right now.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,200
Yeah. Yeah.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,800
Yeah, I think I am. I think I am gonna step in on this room.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Ugh.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm gonna make some big changes in your life.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't...

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,320
I don't want to talk about my room in another episode. This is the second time.

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,600
We keep doing it in your room.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
No we didn't. This is only the second time.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,400
I know and both times we have to talk. If we were in a castle, we'd be like, "Wow."

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,600
Every time, the castle would be impressive. Every time this room is insane.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,280
I mean, also I will admit if I lived by myself, it'd be like 50 times worse than this.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,760
Oh yeah.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,160
Yeah, no.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,640
There's like-

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm doing good for how it used to be.

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,880
The thing is, I don't think that women--

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,400
When I was living at my parents' place, you guys never came over because you guys were

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,520
like fucking-- We were scared.

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
Yeah, you were scared, but scared of my parents.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
No, you were afraid to let us near your parents.

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,880
Yeah, you were.

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,480
But-- Let me near them.

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,520
Oh, man, I just didn't clean at all.

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Yeah.

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,360
I just-- There's no reason to.

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,120
I just had clothes everywhere, yeah.

35
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,240
Here's the thing is, living with a girl, I don't think that women should have to clean

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,520
everything or like have to do all of that shit but they're really really good

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,760
they're like really really good at it and I'm happy to help yeah I'm not very good

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,840
at it unfortunately no I'm also not good at it no so I just you know I recently

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,160
recently Janice started putting up like notes like on the fridge that'll be like

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,800
like that helps so much dude what am I eight years old and then it was like

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,320
this is genius. It's helping me so much. Like something that just says like, "Don't put

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:06,820
like a cup of water in the fridge." And I look at that and I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I guess I'll

43
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,700
just finish my water." Like it's crazy shit, dude. Like what my instinct is telling me

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,880
to do is like always just not conducive to a house at all.

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,960
Man, I feel like the fucking worst roommate most of the times because it's just like if

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,360
If I'm done drinking my cup of water,

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,680
I'll leave it on the counter just 'cause I wanna go get

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,140
more water later and I don't wanna wash a cup.

49
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,480
- Oh yeah, I do that.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,320
Come on, man.

51
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,480
- But you gotta do it in your room, not on the counter.

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,120
- Or you need to have a holster that you carry around

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
with you that has a--

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,780
- With a big glass cup.

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,620
- Place that can put a cup.

56
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,600
- My Patrick Yoda cup.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,200
- Exactly, yeah, something that could be attached

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,920
to your body, maybe like a money clip with a cup glued to it.

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
- Or like a wallet chain.

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Yeah, yeah, wallet so you have a glass cup.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
Yeah, it swings on a chain.

62
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,840
It's a glass cup with a hole in it that has a chain.

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,120
Yeah, and the hole in the bottom.

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Yeah.

65
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah.

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,620
This is a good idea.

67
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,460
This is really smart.

68
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,300
Yeah.

69
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,120
'Cause if you think about it,

70
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,960
they already basically designed that

71
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,760
with those old bathtubs that have plugs on a chain, right?

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,880
So you basically just, you just have to find an old bathtub

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,960
and you can repurpose that.

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,320
So that's like green or eco-friendly or whatever,

75
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,520
'cause you don't have to build a new chain.

76
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,920
Yeah, and it's a green cup too.

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,760
It's very, it's green.

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,600
Oh my God.

79
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,320
It's made out of green.

80
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Yeah. And...

81
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
It's pretty smart.

82
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
It's pretty smart shit, actually.

83
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,320
You can also take the claw feet off of the bathtub and use them like...

84
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Why do they put them claw feet on those bathtubs?

85
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
So they can walk away.

86
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm like... That like brought a tear to my eye right then.

87
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
I don't know why.

88
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
I don't know why.

89
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
That's why kids hate taking baths.

90
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
It's evolutionary.

91
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,320
They used to see all the claw feet on the bathtub

92
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
and think it was a bear.

93
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah.

94
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,600
And so they were like, "I'm not climbing in there."

95
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
It's like dogs only take him back.

96
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
I think it's another dog.

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Exactly, yeah.

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,360
Because they remember back when there used to be claws on it.

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
I'll show you this.

100
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Like with ancestral DNA.

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Remember like two...

102
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
What happened to you, man?

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,840
Two episodes ago, I think it's two episodes ago, I talked about how I just got so sweaty

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
that I had to buy a pack of undershirts.

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,400
I bought them from like this like, you know, just one of those stores that just exists in

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
New York that says like 99...

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
99.

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,400
That's it. Yeah, it just says 99 on it. You go. It's a bro brothers 99. Yeah, it's like yeah 59 cent 99 cent 79 cent

Star and it's like the more you know star. Yeah, what is it?

114
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,360
like a big picture of a baby on it too. Yeah and it's like a picture of that store because I walked

115
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,920
by it. It has like a really really old fucked up uh Mickey Mouse ride. Yeah yeah like happy 100 bb

116
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,080

117
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:05,080
and uh I went and I bought a pack of bootlegs Hanes undershirts. Okay. And uh it has this was

118
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,800
straight out of the pack. It just had a bunch of like letters numbers and letters on it. Sharpied

119
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,320
onto it yeah what out of the pack well let's see I'm trying I'm looking at this

120
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,600
this is not a phone number no no this is like a like like a routing number one

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:34,480
two two four seven four two m h four one nine - two eight three eight - two oh I

122
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,000
swear to God that's like a routing number it's yeah for like a package I

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,920
I feel like that might be the last words of a madman.

124
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Of a madman who's lost his mind.

125
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
And you know what?

126
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Another shirt in the pack, it was a pack of three shirts, another shirt in the pack on

127
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,000
the back had like, I guess there was a hole in it and they just stitched it up.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,480
It's pretty cool.

129
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Come on.

131
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,880
Oh no, I'm not, you know.

132
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,000
A factory made shirt would never have that kind of care put into it.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They would never stitch it up.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
I think it's on the back here.

135
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,040
there any red because there was a red there was red on the third shirt I do

136
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,560
not see red okay I have one a similar style shirt from a similar kind of place

137
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,640
that just has like a giant line in the middle of it yeah I didn't know yeah it's

138
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,920
a black shirt with a big white line in the middle of it is it like it's not

139
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,640
supposed to be there yeah no it's like it's like clearly like they just fucked

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,760
up like dying this one area and it's just a line of white and does it go all

141
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,680
the way across? No, it doesn't even go, it goes like eight inches across. That's

142
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,280
awesome. It's horrible because I looked at it and I guess I looked at the wrong

143
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,680
side of it when I bought it. You know I got home and I turned it around to the

144
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,960
front, big-ass white line. Yeah, pretty unlucky. Yeah, it's cool. I'm just

145
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,640
learning, the thing that sucks dude is like especially living here, you

146
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,680
just, everything, if you want to have like good shit like that, like cheap

147
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,020
t-shirts you have to buy them from amazon.com. You cannot support any local

148
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,260
business because they are fucking evil here dude I swear to God. They're always

149
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,660
like yeah they like you know and they'll like they try to sell you like the

150
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,200
weirdest shit at the counter. There's always like I'm always skeptical at like

151
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,220
a clothing store where I get to the counter and these are all over in New

152
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,380
York. I get to the counter of the clothing store and there's food for sale.

153
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,980
yeah there's like candy and like like fresh fruit yeah you can't mix those

154
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,520
those yeah I'm like how do you come on the same truck like why do you have this

155
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,420
too yeah like this should not like like a pack of like trident gum and a passion

156
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,660
fruit exactly yeah like where do you get yeah where do you get a knockoff Haynes

157
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,740
t-shirt that like literally fell off of a truck yeah like a barrel of bananas

158
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,020
like a Donkey Kong barrel of bananas it's huge yeah and then like every flavor of

159
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,620
gum why do you sell those three things? I don't know maybe it's maybe it's just

160
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,700
something we don't understand as as a as freaking gentrifiers. I'm not a

161
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,340
gentrifier I'm born and raised in New York City. Yeah? Yeah. Really? I've never

162
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,100
left I'm one of those people who draws a map of the United States in New York City

163
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,020
is like the size of like Florida and then everything else is really small I

164
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,260
I know somebody who drew, who you two know, who's from New York, who in college I had them

165
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,840
draw America.

166
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,160
They left off Florida and Texas, drew a bubble, and then New England was like just a dick hanging

167
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
off of the top.

168
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,380
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

169
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,900
And I asked her, I was like, "How wide do you think the United States is?"

170
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,300
She was like, I was like, "Really think about this, like give me an honest answer."

171
00:08:50,300 --> 00:09:01,260
said 1,000 miles. This is the worst city. We know it's like 2,000 miles. This makes this

172
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,940
city produces the worst people in the world. It is absolutely the worst. It's so horrible.

173
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:16,340
People who are from New York are like disgusting to me. It's just Colin, my roommate. Especially

174
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:23,020
Yeah, yeah, it's Colin Jo and just like defend this yeah, maybe that's no it is it warps your brain. Yeah

175
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:30,340
No, it's not the water is too good the water has too many little shrimps in it. There's not shrimp

176
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,700
What are you talking about? Why are you anti New York water? It's got a little shrimp in it. When did you see?

177
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,540
- yeah, it was like your favorite. I like shrimp when I can see it

178
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,780
Shrimps it's shrimps and you drink it and they go in your brain and they make you say things like mad brolic

179
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,720
No, that's cool. Those guys from New York are cool. Yeah. No, I mean like like white people from Manhattan are like, oh

180
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,000
People they're all yeah. Yeah, it's like I say brolic like that's that's like why I moved here to say brolic

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,460
Yeah, I watched the movie kids and I said that's mad brolic. You took a lot of lessons from that. No, I didn't

182
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,060
Basically my goal is to the scene in

183
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:30,300
Was watching Harold hunter clips so fuck off I was not you're typing in kid hunter

184
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,460
Kids I

185
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,620
I was watching that it just I forgot that in that movie there's like a in within

186
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:47,100
like three minutes it's like how to roll a blunt and a bunch of kids just

187
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:58,140
murdering a black guy yeah it's like pretty it's pretty crazy movie what the

188
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,900
hell were they on when they made that oh my god sugar yeah

189
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,040
Harmony Corrine probably had so much damn sugar he was like I'm gonna make a whole

190
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,380
movie about it. I'm gonna make the craziest movie ever. And also here's the thing do

191
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,020
you think when he do you think he start he was like I'm gonna make a movie about

192
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,860
kids? He wrote that when he was like 17. Okay but do you think he was like, do you think

193
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,420
it later it became weird or at first like at first he was maybe just like

194
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,660
yeah it'll just be about you know. Yeah the director I think it was Larry Clark

195
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:33,060
directed it and he was probably like very old at the time and I don't know I mean

196
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,520
no disrespect to Larry Clark but if if someone came to up to me and said hey I

197
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,140
want to make a movie about kids probably like all right hold on yeah

198
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,460
no that's what you would have done yeah I'm the hunter so yeah do you guys need

199
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,800
a hunter involved in the production? You guys need someone with like a really good nose like the

200
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,480
nose of a bloodhound. I don't have a good nose. I mean I can help with auditions too.

201
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,800
I don't I'm not good at casting either you are you would be great at casting no

202
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,200
I wouldn't you just treat what do you mean? It's like your own. It's like American Idol

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,860
Would not be good at that just fucking admit. You're right. You would you wouldn't let you be the fucking Paula

204
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,000
Mm-hmm you'd be Paul Abdul. I would yeah, I'd be drunk all the time everybody come in you'd be like

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,240
Oh, honey

206
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
That would be you.

207
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,320
Dude, so, I mean, there's a cultural moment, like, it sucks that it doesn't exist anymore,

208
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,160
but it also makes complete sense that that doesn't exist anymore.

209
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
American Idol?

210
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Yeah.

211
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
They got rid of all the mean shows.

212
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,320
It wasn't even that mean.

213
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Dude.

214
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Well, yeah.

215
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,680
The only good shit was the mean shit.

216
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,920
Yeah, William Hung, I mean.

217
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,400
I mean, all the mean shit was like the funny and good parts of that shit.

218
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,360
I mean, Sam, we were talking about fucking Susan Boyle yesterday.

219
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Yeah.

220
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,360
like Susan Boyle you would you could never do that today she wouldn't even be

221
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,960
famous because she would come on and they'd be the whole thing would be like

222
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,920
well we expect you to be talented because you're very ugly mm-hmm but then

223
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,200
like it well you know she was a trailblazer in that regard maybe maybe

224
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,640
she changed the whole culture yeah in 2000 like like it would not be

225
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,240
acceptable now for an ugly woman to come out and then doll be like get a load of

226
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,680
this fucking ugly bitch remember this is what the whole thing was they

227
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,480
immediately just like did her hair different when she was like continuing

228
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,960
to like be a competitor on that show and everyone was just like she was

229
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,000
actually beautiful the whole time yeah it's like they just did her hair yeah

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,280
they just had like whoever does like the the the stuff for like the show poodles

231
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,840
they had that person they show up they were like listen it's not exactly a dog

232
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,000
but you do she's not very good-looking and she needs to look good enough for TV

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,240
it was well she was just like Irish or something she's an old Irish woman she

234
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:57,320
was the swamp that she's at the swamp then yeah I mean she was cool though

235
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,560
yeah also she kind of leaned into it a little bit you know cuz like there's

236
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,880
some shit you can do to not look well I mean that must have sucked so bad just

237
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,800
like immediately just everybody like like ugly woman sings awesome yeah just

238
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,960
like god I would have fucking killed myself after. You go up there you're like I just

239
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,520
I just look normal I look normal to me and then like immediately it's just like

240
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,560
oh look at this disgusting bitch. Yeah horrible slug monster sings almost

241
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,200
inhuman thing sings pretty good yeah but like also the thing is if she sung like

242
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,160
if she sounded like Britney Spears or something that'd be different but she

243
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,160
also sings like if she rapped. What if she went up there and she did rap

244
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,080
She was rapping granny the Susan Boyle rap is what we're trying to create

245
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, but if she the problem is that she also has like she has like an opera voice, which is like

246
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,320
Yeah, what ugly people sing like that's like yeah like that. Oh, yeah. No you make perfect sense

247
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
Yeah, well, it's like that that the voice France clip where the guy who's like

248
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,320
I think he's like blind or something, but his eyes are like completely

249
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,920
Yeah, and he comes out and he does the like crazy opera singing and then he transitions into lose yourself

250
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,280
Yeah, he does lose yourself. Yeah, but like in like

251
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:19,000
But singing in not rapping. Yeah, most French, but it's English. Yeah, it's a thing where he's like approximating the pronunciation

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,520
Yeah, it's awesome

253
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:33,080
It's really good

254
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,760
It's funny and also like, you know

255
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,240
that's the thing where like their their their chairs are like facing the other

256
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,360
way and they have to like vote in so you think they're all there because they all

257
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,080
press the button really fast either they like all press the button and see his

258
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,760
cross eyes and go oh no and then just press a button again and go back

259
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,440
turn back around that should be an option yeah that would be so fun the

260
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,880
voice should be there should be one button that turns them around still

261
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,960
going on there should be one button that turns them like 180 degrees so they're

262
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,440
like and and there should be another button that just turns them all the way

263
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,440
around to fake them out. There should just be tubes of spinning around me.

264
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Just constantly spinning. You know the button where you press it and they like turn a little

265
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,000
bit but then turn back and then turn a little bit more and then turn back.

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,680
So it's like three buttons like the one to do that and then the third one is to turn

267
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,160
someone else as a prank and you get to use that once. Yeah yeah it's like the

268
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,720
golden exit. And then it can be then the the voting is more fun then they can have

269
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,520
like it doesn't have to be all these like you know celebrities or whatever we can

270
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,920
just have people having that can be like its own the audience has those chairs so

271
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,960
the whole audience is turned to their backs faced to you yeah and and they're

272
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,800
always going oh by ten minutes into the show everybody just that's what they

273
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,600
they're not even watching they're just like enjoying spinning also as the show

274
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,080
goes on every minute the...

275
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
One guy's spinning super super fast.

276
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,800
Every minute that passes on the show the motors that turn the chairs get a little bit more

277
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,920
powerful so they gradually start moving faster and faster so you have to be careful because

278
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
if you try to spin a little bit but you spin really fast you go all the way around you

279
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
know that's it.

280
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,240
Well that's if you're too eager if you're too much of an eager beaver with your spinning

281
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,160
they they pump up they double it every single time.

282
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,360
And then and then after the commercial break they had a button that makes your chair go

283
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:38,120
up and down yeah like what those shows don't exist anymore but like they just

284
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,580
added higher stakes to them you know I mean like yeah like now we have like the

285
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,980
masked singer and stuff which is fucking to me like I don't give a like the whole

286
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,600
point of those shows I mean what Kermit popped out I was like holy I mean I was

287
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
like Kermit. I didn't know you had it like that.

288
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh shit, Kermit what the hell? Who knew you could sing?

289
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I think there is a version of the...

290
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Real fans of Kermit know that he sings on Rainbow Connection.

291
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
He had pipe singing way back.

292
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
The Masked Singer could be like an insanely good show if they picked the right people to be inside there.

293
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Yeah, they got Jenny McCarthy on there.

294
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
If they got like OJ Simpson, if he popped out, that would be like...

295
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Jason Voorhees.

296
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
That would be really, really good.

297
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Or OJ Simpson is dressed up as Jason Voorhees and they're like, "Who's this guy?"

298
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,760
They also have to have some people that just pop out and nobody's ever heard of them.

299
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
There's a hobo.

300
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,840
"Oh my god, it's former French President Nicolas Sarkozy!"

301
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,360
You know what I mean?

302
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,480
Like I feel like there's some mix of people that they could have on that show that would

303
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
make it like a perfect TV show.

304
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
Like apparently they had T-Pain.

305
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,400
It's like, dude, T-Pain would have been probably the second guest I would have had.

306
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Yeah, don't have any singers.

307
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Yeah.

308
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
No singers.

309
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Oh, you can't have a singer on The Masked Singer.

310
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
What are you doing, man?

311
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,440
man yeah like just fucking Kevin Hart uh-huh I don't know if he's been on it

312
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:01,920
but that'd be a good one mm-hmm no they who me Susan Boyle cuz yeah she

313
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,880
wouldn't even have to wear a mask no she would she would take it off the

314
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,880
be like, "Susan Boyle, yeah! Put the mask back on, yeah! Come on, woo!"

315
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Oh man, you know what would be the best one? So like, big, like, caterpillar--

316
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
The Headless Horseman.

317
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I'm picturing it now, like, big caterpillar costume, comes out, wiggles out, right?

318
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,880
So like, you know, dude coming out on stage, big, like, foam, like, green--

319

337
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,100
beautiful piece of work. It just wouldn't make any sense. Well they all the Greeks did all

logical theorems on you right now oh and you were you were getting owned you're

344
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,860
using a theorem invented by a pedophile? No. Yeah you are. On purpose. I just remembered when I was like

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:50,860
my my uncle Kevin who'd made the most jokes about Michael Jackson being a diddler. A diddler. A

348
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,900
fucking diddler he's a fucking diddler the guy who made the most jokes about it

349
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:01,260
sat us all down and made us like watch like the vh1 like Michael Jackson loop

350
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,900
and was like he was so talented oh he was the most talented guy ever he was yeah

351
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,700
dude he's like he's number one it what a fucking what a what a moment what a

352
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,100
moment culturally I got a text from a girl in my middle school and it was like

353
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,620
plea it was like Michael Jackson the king of pop has died please pray for his

354
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,460
family and send this to like ten people and I was like and I was like dude I

355
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,980
mean what is a better way to memorialize Michael Jackson than a bunch of 11 year

356
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,140
old

357
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:42,500
like that is so beautiful yeah so beautiful you know those those texts were

358
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,780
going around like years and years before that was like Oh Michael Jackson he's

359
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:53,620
about to die he needs a picture of your face right now. It's funny that he was

360
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,780
killed by his doctor yeah the doctor was like I'm fucking I don't know a hundred

361
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,260
pills a day whatever that's just so funny to me. That guy rules.

362
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,940
Yeah Conrad Murray. Conrad Murray. That's a cool action hero name yeah yeah like

363
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,180
that's yeah action hero name. That's like the name of like one of the soldiers in

364
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:22,320
predator yeah yeah it makes sense yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean that guy

365
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,260
should like a medal of honor would be funny to just like you go and you just

366
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,700
show up at Conrad Murray's house and just give him a trophy

367
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:50,060
this Conrad Murray the pedophile clear a giant check for a hundred more pills

368
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:56,540
Woody Allen next buddy go crazy damn it's gonna be so I mean yeah funny but

369
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,600
like you know funny to see the like the reaction when Woody Allen like eventually

370
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,460
dies next year yeah just like all the like like all the people who are like

371
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,880
"Yeah, but I mean Manhattan's a great movie" or whatever, like the people like the die-hard defenders and like

372
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,380
Like look I get it like Annie Hall, good movie

373
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,020
Woody Allen

374
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Jury's still out on that guy

375
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:26,260
The thing is stop making Diane Keaton dress like a motherfucking four-year-old boy. What is she doing?

376
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,900
What is he doing those movies man? I don't think- She's a beautiful woman, put her in a dress. I think she dressed herself

377
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,940
Diane Keaton, you the stupidest bitch on earth

378
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,060
What are you doing man?

379
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,740
I don't think I've ever seen a Woody Allen movie.

380
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
Really?

381
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Yeah, I mean there.

382
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,340
Movie night, us three, oh my god.

383
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:54,220
Yeah, I mean the thing is like, you know, I can, like the Woody Allen movies I can all

384
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,580
day be like, oh yeah, I wouldn't watch those, like because the guy who made them is a bad

385
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
guy.

386
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,020
But I've also watched like two guys one hammer like three different times.

387
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Those guys were way worse as like creators of something. Behind the scenes they were pretty bad.

388
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Yeah, I mean the thing is you can't really watch a movie that's not evil.

389
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Yeah, that's true. It's not possible.

390
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,020
I mean, what, like the Weinstein Company made...

391
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,020
They did the first 30 episodes of this podcast.

392
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,980
well yeah that's all I think right it's all freaking fucked up dude it's all

393
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,300
weird and crazy dude Hollywood got me fucked up he's got me pissed off we're

394
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,700
not gonna be alive after this episode comes out do that as we just exposed all

395
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,300
the secrets yeah fuck I don't think I don't think Hollywood people kill

396
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,860
anybody there yeah they're just no they they hire people in Las Vegas to kill

397
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,260
people but they also are like like to them like the sentence worse than death

398
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,660
is like you'll never be in a movie yeah which is like it is I remember the

399
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:05,220
something always makes me laugh is like like Michael Crichton who's a guy who

400
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,420
wrote like Jurassic Park yeah and shit he like some reviewer or something gave

401
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,060
him a really bad review for his book and then in the next book he wrote he named

402
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,940
a character after that guy and made the character a pedophile with a

403
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,660
the tiny penis. I think more like, more filmmakers and stuff should be doing stuff like that.

404
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,940
Yeah, that is like, yeah, that is the way, yeah, that's so much better than killing somebody.

405
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,900
Yeah. Especially make like a really good movie and people like, are like, remember it for

406
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,900
like years and years. Yeah. I mean, how many people do you think that has happened to though?

407
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Well, let's think of all, who, who's, who dies in movies in a funny way? Uh, Robin Williams.

408
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,500
I would hate to be the guy that Kenny from South Park is based off of.

409
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I would be so embarrassed.

410
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,580
That guy's been getting hell from Matt and Trey for decades.

411
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,020
They've been destroying him.

412
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,660
Are you guys excited for the 400 South Park movies?

413
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
Speaking of.

414
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,140
It's so funny.

415
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:08,780
No, that's exactly what Matt and Trey, or Trey Parker did to his ex-girlfriend in Cannibal

416
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
the Musical.

417
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,780
He, the horse.

418
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,580
He named the horse in Cannibal the Musical after his ex-girlfriend.

419
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,580
In the movie, it's basically just like, it's all euphemisms to "she's a whore."

420
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,900
Then in the video, the commentary of the movie is just him having a breakdown.

421
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,220
It's like, "Oh yeah, she's married to a manager at Bennigan's and oh look at me, I just made

422
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,020
the fucking South Park movie!"

423
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,420
It's fucking nuts.

424
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,980
It's so funny, any movie that's about high school or college or something, you can tell,

425
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,980
can like see characters that are like oh yeah this is somebody who the director

426
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,140
knew and maybe made fun of the director one time in the lunchroom yeah yeah

427
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,100
yeah some bully who has like a very specific interest yeah it doesn't really

428
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,580
fit at all yeah you know yeah I think speaking of the like South Park guys I

429
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,260
was saying earlier I was like I think like my goal in life is to have one of

430
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,620
those like 50 year cartoons yeah we're like the cast keeps dying and shit you

431
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,380
just keep doing it forever yeah yeah like what are they they're in talks to buy

432
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,980

00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:41,940
I want to smorgasbord. So I've been like really hungry for a smorgasbord of something

471
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:49,780
I dude I I mean I've been dying to have a panoply of the light. Oh, do you guys know of any good cornucopia places?

472
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,980
That might have a cornucopia and like a big

473
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,060
In the in the Lower East Side, there's plethoras. Oh, I love a plethora. Yeah. Yeah

474
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,380
- If it was the real cornucopia, I'd be so fucking sick.

475
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,900
- See, the thing is, they don't have buffets around here

476
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,460
because all the old people here are rich.

477
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,580
- True, and they like little food.

478
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,060
- Yeah, they like little food on a big plate.

479
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,620
But if you go to the Midwest, it's small plate, big food.

480
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,180
- Big food, little plate.

481
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,880
That's the coastal divide.

482
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,720
- Yeah.

483
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,540
- Yeah, little food.

484
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,460
- We need to start making medium plates.

485
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,300
- That's true.

486
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,660
- Medium food, medium plate.

487
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,340
Yeah, I think like, yeah, 'cause you're right.

488
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,500
It's always a Dixie plate with three different sections.

489
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,140
You know, as if that's what you,

490
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,020
as if you're having three instead of 10 things

491
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,220
you put on that plate.

492
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,180
You know, 'cause that's the thing,

493
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,100
get rid of those fucking dividers, man.

494
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,940
I don't, it's all going to the same place.

495
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,620
Yeah, it's all going in my mouth, out my ass.

496
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,620
It's all going out my ass.

497
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,860
I don't need any of these dividers, you know?

498
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,700
And then the big plate problem--

499
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,620
I mean, I will say, I will say,

500
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,900
those dividers are good if you're, you know,

501
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,260
want some condiments maybe use it as like a...

502
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,420
But if you're at a buffet like... I mean the hardest part about a buffet is carrying all

503
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:14,700
the

504
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,020
food back to the damn table. That's true. That's a really good point.

505
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,260
I feel like a juggler.

506
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,300
You know those tubes they have at banks? Yeah and we put

507
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,500
you put all the food into a capsule.

508
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,620
You put it into the like vacuum tube and it goes boom and it goes

509
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,860
it flies around, it flies to a random table,

510
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,520
and you have to go sit at that table

511
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,440
because there's no dial or anything to control it.

512
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,780
- My dad seriously looked into trying to put one of those

513
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,940
in our house growing up.

514
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,760
- Yeah?

515
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,600
- He was like-- - Those are so cool.

516
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,140
- He was like, "That's the coolest thing ever."

517
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,140
He was like, "Why do you want that?

518
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,300
"Would it help you with work?"

519
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,800
And he was like, "No, I sit on the couch,

520
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,140
"I ask Mom to put a soda in the tube,

521
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,260
"and it appears right next to me."

522
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,620
I was like, "Somebody still has to get the soda, though.

523
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,500
It's not like an automatic, he's on a robot.

524
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,820
Even then, you'd have to calibrate the fucking tube so that the machine doesn't shake up your

525
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,820
soda.

526
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,500
Yeah, soda's gotta be the worst thing to send in one of those fuckers.

527
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,700
Same with beer, the only thing you can really put in there is a can of still water.

528
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,260
You know what movies always made look so cool?

529
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,540
Is having an old house with a dumb waiter.

530
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,500
I feel like in the movie a kid would go in a dumb waiter and go down to the next floor,

531
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,620
like in real life I feel like that's just like a machine that's designed to just

532
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,740
break children's arms and legs. Pretty much, yeah. Or like starve them. I saw I was in a

533
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,060
house with a dumbwaiter one time it was like my mom's boss's house and the

534
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,420
dumbwaiter's like it's like the size of like like a lunchbox. Yeah. No kid could

535
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,700
these dumbwaiters in movies are huge. Those ones are for laundry not for food.

536
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,980
That's another thing that looks so much fun jumping into the laundry chute. Dude

537
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,620
Dude, that, I bet that was sick.

538
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,660
I bet, yeah, dude.

539
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,480
Yeah.

540
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,380
Laundry chute, man.

541
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,700
Man, I wish I had a laundry chute.

542
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,540
We should get one.

543
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,380
Oh, yeah.

544
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,200
We should, we could like--

545
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,260
Hold on, let me check my--

546
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,580
Yeah, can I get a rent reduction?

547
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,460
I'm gonna put a laundry chute in.

548
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,380
Yeah, I have 18 minutes 'til my laundry's done.

549
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,220
Oh, nice, dude.

550
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,040
Yeah.

551
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,880
That's exciting.

552
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,900
Anything good in there today?

553
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,460
No, the machine did not,

554
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,980
one of the machines did not run.

555
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,460
So either I, somebody opened it

556
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,300
and didn't, you know--

557
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,880
- You're a two machines guy?

558
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
- Yeah.

559
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,720
- I just have--

560
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,880
- They're too small, I can't fucking--

561
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,840
- I miss having laundry, like I just go,

562
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,680
I have a laundromat now, and I don't even pay the guy

563
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,880
to like do it for me, 'cause it just is like,

564
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,560
even though it's only like 10 bucks extra,

565
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,060
I'm just like, I just don't like that.

566
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,120
- There's no reason to do that, yeah.

567
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,900
- Yeah, he like folds it and shit,

568
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,120
but I just go in and he's always trying to talk to me.

569
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,960
- Yeah.

570
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,700
- And I don't know what he's saying ever.

571
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,760
And so I just say yes, and then it's like clear

572
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,760
that I that he wanted me to say no and then he just talks to me until I leave

573
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,440
and then I come back he keeps talking to me and we do that every time so he just

574
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,120
and but everybody else seems to have the most normal relationship with him and he

575
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,240
just hates me and I've never done anything except spill a bunch of

576
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,760
detergent everywhere you realize he keeps saying you do you hate me do you

577
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,960
hate me do you hate me you're saying yes yes yes it's just every time he's asking

578
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,240
you every time to check it's like honestly that might be like in my week

579
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,600
the worst that I ever feel is leaving the laundromat I'm like I just feel like

580
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,200
I feel like I'm the villain in this laundromat.

581
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,000
- Yeah, I mean, I just hate doing laundry now.

582
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,440
I used to, when I had Inunit.

583
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
- You used to like it?

584
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,040
- I fucking loved doing it. - Inunit, what's that?

585
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,880
- Inunit.

586
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,280
- Oh.

587
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,880
When I did Inunit laundry down by the glacier,

588
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
this was, it was so easy.

589
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,040
- I mean, the color stayed in the shirts, you know?

590
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,880
It's not like the warm water.

591
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,040
- That's a good point, yeah.

592
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,080
- Can't even decide, can't even decide on the machine

593
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,120
downstairs if I want to do cold.

594
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,160
You're not really. - Really?

595
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,880
- Yeah, it's always warm wash.

596
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,480
Whenever I hit colors. - Oh, I thought you meant

597
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,680
You can't decide.

598
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,180
No.

599
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,680
You're like, "Cold, hot."

600
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,880
No, no. I always wash my clothes and always used to.

601
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,580
Uh-huh.

602
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,780
And now, like, the fucking-- the dye's running out of my shirts and shit.

603
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,880
Pissing me off.

604
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,380
I gotta--

605
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:05,980
Well, hey!

606
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,880
Pat, why don't you tell me, what else is ticking you off these days?

607
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,580
Come on!

608
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,080
That I gotta do fucking laundry.

609
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,580
Yeah?

610
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:19,080
I mean, what else are these little-- these little fucking moments in life that just make you say, "Pee-ew"?

611
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,780
What else?

612
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,280
I don't wanna do that.

613
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
Come on!

614
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
Yeah, come on, give me something.

615
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Give me Patrick's Peeves!

616
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
What grinds your gears?

617
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Ummm...

618
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,280
When you go down to the laundry room and your clothes aren't even dry?

619
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
That's like the same thing, but go on.

620
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
What gets your blood really boiling though?

621
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,280
When you don't have in-unit laundry.

622
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Really?

623
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
This is all you got?

624
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
The only thing that makes you mad.

625
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
How about this?

626
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
There's so much fucking war in the world.

627
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,280
That's, that's much better.

628
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
You're getting there.

629
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,560
What else? Yeah, I don't know. I don't want to step on Louis Black's toes. How about demons?

630
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,160
Demons? Yeah, do those piss you off? I can take them or leave them. Really? Yeah, me too. I'm kind of on the fence.

631
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,120
Two thieves their own? What if I told... I mean they're red and hot. Does that piss you off anymore? Not really.

632
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,080
Yeah, that gets me red and hot because I'm saying, "Listen you demons, you're in my damn city."

633
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,160
You're a demon. Saying you're red and hot like a demon. No, they get me red and hot as in I'm a demon.

634
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,760
You said a demon is red and hot, and then you said you're red and hot.

635
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
What is that poking out of your shorts?

636
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,160
It's my penis, probably. I don't know.

637
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Probably not a horn.

638
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
It's not a tail, either.

639
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
The red thing poking out of the back is your penis.

640
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,660
This is my normal penis.

641
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,160
Yeah, I have a red penis. Whatever.

642
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,660
And it comes out the back?

643
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
Yeah, I'm Italian. You know that.

644
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
They come out the back.

645
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,660
They don't come out the back.

646
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,660
They come out the back.

647
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
No. Why is it...

648
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Come on, touch it!

649
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,160
It's got hair on it.

650
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,660
You have a shaven penis? What's wrong with you?

651
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,660
You have a beautiful no hair penis. Just touch my fucking...

652
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,140
No, actually I...

653
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,220
Oh yeah, you cut a chunk out of your dick? I forgot.

654
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:59,700
Does it hurt? I forgot you told me that.

655
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,260
Yeah.

656
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,980
Does it hurt?

657
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,540
It did.

658
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,100
It did?

659
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,420
Yeah.

660
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,340
Pat just texted me and Cam the other day, he was like, "I cut a chunk out of my..."

661
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:11,620
Which is like, I've never done that.

662
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:17,580
I realized the other day that like I get hair on like the shaft like that's how fucking hairy I am dude. I'm like

663
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,980
It's disgusting. Yeah

664
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,860
so I was trying to like, you know clean it up because it looked weird and

665
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,060
Just immediately I just cut a chunk out

666
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,340
Well, I get this because if you shave if you shave like around your cock

667
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,940
But then not on your cock and your cock everything is Elsa shaving, but then you're like a huge thing

668
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
it looks like a goblin plant.

669
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,900
I looked down and there was like one hair like sticking up.

670
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,980
I was like, "Oh, that's fucking weird."

671
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,900
So do you shave it with like a razor sharp ice cream scoop?

672
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,420
No, I have a Philips OneBlade.

673
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Oh my God.

674
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,940
I cut like a chunk out of the foreskin.

675
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,940
Oh God, dude.

676
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,340
Does it still hurt?

677
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,700
We shouldn't talk about this on the show.

678
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Your doctor might listen.

679
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
It's true.

680
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
It's probably good, right?

681
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,900
like I had a moment where I was like, do I put a band-aid on this?

682
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,700
A band-aid on your cock?

683
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Like the-

684
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
I almost did.

685
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,700
You just put on a condom and it holds all the blood in.

686
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:25,700
Just walking around with a condom taped to her cock with a cotton ball.

687
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,700
And then walking out of the bathroom holding it and it's like filled with blood.

688
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,700
To throw it away in the kitchen trash.

689
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,460
No, it like, I mean it like closed up, the wound closed up pretty quick.

690
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:38,960
Uh-huh.

691
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,460
But like-

692
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,540
You should have put a band-aid on it like the back of the guy's head in Pulp Fiction.

693
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,040
Yeah.

694
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Because there's like a look thing.

695
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,540
Oh yeah.

696
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,040
Yeah.

697
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Like I got like a Nelly thing going on with my penis.

698
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,840
Yeah, yeah exactly.

699
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,340
It would have been great.

700
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,840
Yeah.

701
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,340
Yeah.

702
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,840
But yeah, I fucking, I cut a chunk out dude.

703
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Gross.

704
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,340
Nasty.

705
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:54,840
Yeah.

706
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Maybe, maybe I should, maybe Brandon was right, I should get on that Manscaped thing.

707
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,340
I don't know what Manscape is.

708
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,840
My dad has one.

709
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,340
Really?

710
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,840
Yeah.

711
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,600
like a thing that like it's like suck all the hair off it's like it's like a

712
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,800
ceramic blade razor and it like yeah no fuck you I'm not doing advertising yeah

713
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,840
you better you pay us fucking pay me right now motherfucker you pay me for

714
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,920

715
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,080
dad thinks about it google it yeah and don't even look at no listen to this and

716
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,200
you own it throw it away mm-hmm yeah throw it out right now it's disgusting

717
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,200
You know what else I hate? MailChimp.com. I fucking... MailChimp...

718
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I go on there, I'm looking up, I want to see a mail chimp. I want to see...

719
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,880
If you ever make me send effortless newsletters to hundreds of people with the click of a

720
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,200
button again, MailChimp, I'm gonna fuck you up.

721
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
And, and, speaking of... And...

722
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Yeah.

723
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,200
They don't even have a chimp, they don't even have pictures of chimps on their website.

724
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Yeah, speaking of mail...

725
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,000
I gotta sign up for somebody's MailChimp newsletter called Chimp of the Day and it sends me a

726
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,320
picture of a chimp every day? I don't think so. Through the effortless...

727
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,680
Newsletters! Newsletters! One click newsletter! One button, one click, you're done!

728
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,880
I gotta do that to get pictures of chimps directly to my email? Come on!

729
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,880
One click, one button, you're done. Supposedly that's like the MailChimp promise or something.

730
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,720
And you know what else I fucking hate? Building websites.

731
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,240
Oh god! Oh come on! If a... what's it called again?

732
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,000
I don't even know. Some bullshit like Squarespace or something.

733
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,560
I think it's actually Squarespace. Yeah. That shit sucks.

734
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,360
There's like, here's an annoying thing. You log into Squarespace, all of a sudden

735
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,960
there's hundreds of templates to choose from. And they give you the tools to

736
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,240
help your own business. Oh my god. What's that? What's that? Square integration?

737
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:54,360
You're gonna make me vomit, Squarespace. Oh my god. And I hate how easy it is to

738
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,720
to start an online shop on there.

739
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,560
- Absolutely.

740
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,820
- Oh my god.

741
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,500
- Just pisses me off.

742
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,420
- 'Cause here's the other thing.

743
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,820
- And you don't even have to know HTML.

744
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,460
- No, no coding necessary at all.

745
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,340
But there are easy tutorials, supposedly,

746
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,840
if you do get yourself into a bit of a pickle.

747
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,460
And the other thing I hate is that it's so fuckin'

748
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,100
affordable.

749
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,300
It's too affordable.

750
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,140
- Oh my god.

751
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,180
- As a web designer myself,

752
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:29,980
They're stealing my business. I keep buying them. I know. I keep buying websites. And here's the other thing that I honestly hate.

753
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:37,100
That you know, let's talk about something we love for one second. Sure, yeah. I mean I for one I love going to the post office.

754
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,700
Yeah.

755
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,020
Oh my god, you know what's the best part about going to the post office is buying stamps. I know.

756
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,460
Yeah. You get to look at them. And sitting in that long ass line.

757
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,460
Uh-huh. Oh, I love that long ass line.

758
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,620
I love the lady who works there.

759
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,620
Mm-hmm.

760
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,000
She's super nice.

761
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,420
But what I would hate is if there was some way that you could send mail from home.

762
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
No.

763
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,780
I mean, I've been, people have been talking about this and it's like...

764
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,780
Really?

765
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,780
Yeah.

766
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,780
People have been...

767
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,780
Literally been pissing me off to no end.

768
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Who's been talking about this?

769
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,780
Do you know Mark?

770
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
Yeah.

771
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
Oh, not Mark.

772
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,780
Mark.

773
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
Yeah, they got him.

774
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
They got him?

775
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,780
Yeah.

776
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Fuckin' Christ.

777
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,780
But he, I mean, let's say this.

778
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,780
He's not like...

779
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,780
- My dad knew him too. - And this is how he betrays us?

780
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,780
- Oh yeah, this fucking guy. - Listen buddy, I get that you don't like the post office,

781
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,780
you have to go ruining it for everyone else. Every real American.

782
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,780
- You know? - Yeah. And you know, I thought, you know,

783
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,780
that guy was like an uncle to me. And you know what?

784
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,780
I'll say it, I'm disowning him right now. Fuck you Mark.

785
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,780
- That's brave. - You're not coming to my birthday.

786
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,780
- That's fucking brave man. - You're not coming to my fucking family reunion.

787
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,500
ask me to go on your show I won't do it yeah no I'm gonna tell you take that damn

788
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,100
ad off of your show and replace it with an ad for going to the post office yeah

789
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,500
exactly what I like to do how about that we should be doing ads for the post

790
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,540
office yeah yeah yeah I did I found out the other day that I have like remember

791
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,260
you remember when like there was a big thing or is like Oh Trump is gonna defund

792
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:10,300
the post office and then everyone was like buy post office t-shirts and buy

793
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:16,660
like it's like what the fuck you want you want to chill out money for fucking the

794
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,820
post office the fuck it's pretty weird I found it so when I forever 21 did a

795
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:28,140
collab with the USPS that's pretty cool flames though it's some of it did I will

796
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,700
say the other day I I remembered when I first moved to New York like a year ago

797
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,580
now I was like pretty broke and I needed like a job and so I asked around and

798
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,380
And some guy hooked me up with this dude he knew who like runs...

799
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,140
You hooked up with a dude?

800
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,980
No, but if I did it's okay because it's New York City.

801
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,700
This guy put me...

802
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,700
He hooked me...

803
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,540
I had sex with this guy who does these like sweepstakes scam things where he just sends

804
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:00,700
in like a million entries to like every sweepstakes so he eventually wins like tens of thousands

805
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,040
of dollars on them.

806
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,780
And so he's like, "Yeah, you just have to like handwrite these letters and pretend you're

807
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:12,660
me and send in as many as you can and I'll pay you like 10 cents per letter or like 4

808
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,660
cents per letter or something.

809
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,060
Was this just a guy that lived in your building?

810
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,500
No, it's a guy that a friend of mine knew and I just asked that guy who lives in New

811
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,300
York for work and he was like, "Oh, well I guess I know this fucking weird evil kid."

812
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,900
And so the dude dropped off a giant box of envelopes at my house and then also a bunch

813
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,860
of stamps and I never thought anything about it and then Jan had to mail

814
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,800
something yesterday and the stamps are like 50 cents each so it's like a

815
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,100
hundred and fifty dollars of stamps that I have right now and so now I'm looking

816
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:49,900
how to if I can sell the stamps that's like I just ripped that kid off yeah

817
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:56,220
back to that kid mmm so I'm back at a markup I feel like I'm scared now that

818
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,900
he's gonna like break my legs or something yeah well I mean you did talk

819
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,920
about it on the show yeah and I and I like like those things they got to my

820
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,300

821
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,620
money with the podcast I could like pay rent easily and then I as soon as it was

822
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,260
like even like a little bit more than that I just I just let that shit sit in

823

Oh my god.

846
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,180
When the fat caterpillar eats the blue stuff.

Yeah, I would love to lick that.

848
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Lick that caterpillar all the way down its back.

Yeah, boysenberries, by the way, best fruit.

851
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,180
Never had a boysenberry.

852
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,180
Insanely good fruit.

853
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,180
Dude, the three-eyed fish from the Simpsons, oh my god.

854
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,180
Or that big fish from Star Wars Episode I.

855
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,180
Oh, dude, imagine filleting that bad boy.

856
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,180
Taking him out on him.

857
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,180
I don't know, I feel like that thing is probably

858
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,260
I don't know I feel like that thing is probably like dude I also I feel like

859
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,300
it's like a tilapia if you if you put your if you got your thumbs in both of

860
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,500
plow Coons eyes and just kind of like opened him up I feel like it'd be like

00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:31,620
disgusting. I would love to, what are they called? What's the Star Wars with the long

864
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:39,740
thing? A Twi'lek. I feel like you said that way too fast. They're sexy dude. Their whole

865
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:47,300
thing is that they're like sexy. That's not their whole thing. If you like Fortuna, you

869
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,460
and says day one oh one guy you know i probably wouldn't find him very attractive yeah but the

870
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:15,940
but the you did this i would love to run that i would i would love to be said it to be turning um

871
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,380
salacious b-crumb around on a spit.

872
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,880
Yeah.

873
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,900
Just eating him?

874
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,780
I want to eat Scrooge's hair. It's so fucking thin. It's so thin.

875
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,660
It's like cotton candy.

876
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,620
It's crazy, yeah.

877
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,120
Yeah.

878
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,240
Yeah.

879
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,740
Oh my god.

880
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,900
Oh, the animated Jim Carrey.

881
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,500
There's been so many iterations of Scrooge.

882
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,180
Have I told you guys about the time when I was like the most hungover I ever was?

883
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,100
And like, this is like maybe the worst day of my entire life.

884
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:49,140
It was the day before Thanksgiving, and I forgot that I told Janna's family that I would go with

885
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:54,660
them to their Thanksgiving thing out of town. It was a two-hour drive. So the night before, I went

886
00:51:54,660 --> 00:52:02,260
out and I was smoking cigars with my friend's dad and drinking full bottles of wine, just getting

887
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,300
insanely fucked up. Woke up the next day, obviously insanely hungover, get in the back of this van,

888
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,660
the back backseat and then oh sorry no this was this was near Christmas but we

889
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,780
go to their Christmas thing and their their tradition is every time they go on

890
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:23,480
this ride they listen to the audiobook of the the Scrooge thing the Christmas

891
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,220
story. Christmas Carol yeah yeah Christmas Carol so I it's like a

892
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:32,460
two-and-a-half hour audiobook and I'm in the back right next to the speaker and I

893
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,620
can't tell them like hey turn it down I'm insanely hungover and 17 and I'm

894
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:43,620
just hearing like "SCROOGE! YOU HAVE DISRESPECTED CHRISTMAS!" It was like one of the worst days

895
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:50,180
of my entire fucking life. It was so fucked up. Yeah. I mean if I had to hear about Scrooge

896
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,180
for an hour or two, I'd probably lose my shit. Why are you so grumpy? Chill. I have to say

897
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:00,180
too, I mean if we- Scrooge chill! We're talking about like- Scrooge, smoke this. Food in movies

898
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:05,420
that looks delicious like some of the kibble from Air Bud just like had my mouth watering.

899
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,560
Some of the food from Chef is actually pretty good.

900
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,560
And Spirited Away.

901
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,560
Oh, I know.

902
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,560
He invented that, you know.

903
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,040
What if they made like a YouTube channel?

904
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,360
Dude, yeah, and anime food.

905
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,360
Or he'd eat the food from movies.

906
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,360
What?

907
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,760
Anime food looks like so good too.

908
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,560
Like in Spirited Away, that giant baby, I know if you roasted him, he would...

909
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,440
Was that Jordan Peterson?

910
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,360
No, Jordan posted that picture of like E.T. on a spit.

911
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
Honestly, I'd look at that.

912
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,960
I feel like almost every single like puppet from a movie would taste so good if you roasted

913
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
a snow dove.

914
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
You would never do that to me.

915
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,960
The main character from the Dark Crystal?

916
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,960
Yeah.

917
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Oh yeah, the Gelflings?

918
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
Oh, they would taste like baklava.

919
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:49,760
No, the only thing that's good about the Gelflings is their essence.

920
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,760
As I've learned.

921
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,760
Well, that's only if you're a Skeksis and you're evil.

922
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
Well, I don't know.

923
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,080
You know those giant, what are the big spider things called?

924
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,480
I know those taste like crab.

925
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,480
I know those taste like crab.

926
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,480
Those definitely taste like crab.

927
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, the big walker things?

928
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
Yeah. No, not the striders.

929
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
Not the tall ones? Oh, the striders.

930
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,480
No, the evil ones. The spider things.

931
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
I forget what those are called.

932
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,480
I feel like in cartoons,

933
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,480
vomit in a cartoon usually looks pretty good.

934
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,480
Yeah. Oh my god, dude.

935
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,480
It looks like a good green gazpacho verde.

936
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,480
Like the vomit in Family Guy?

937
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,480
Yeah, I would dip a chip into that.

938
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
Yeah. You know? A tortilla chip.

939
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,480
Why didn't I just say guacamole?

940
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,480
I don't know.

941
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,480
Green gazpacho.

942
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,480
The uh...

943
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,480
Gazpacho.

944
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,480
Gazpacho vanadate.

945
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:42,480
When you see like Sylvester the cat like walking around putting pieces of trash on a trash can lid like it's a buffet like that.

946
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,480
Dude a fish, eating a whole fish off the bone like that?

947
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,480
Or just the bone?

948
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,480
Oh my god.

949
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,480
Just a fish bone, a whole fish bone with no meat on it?

950
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,480
Yeah.

951
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,480
That's gonna, can you imagine that getting stuck in your throat?

952
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
It'd be so good.

953
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
Yeah.

954
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:56,980
Yeah.

955
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,480
Yeah.

956
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,980
Oh, fuck.

957
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,480
Or a bomb that looks like a cake.

958
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,480
Yeah, that could be good. I would love to fry Tweety Bird, too.

959
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,480
Me, too.

960
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,480
Anything with a wick in it, I think I would eat.

961
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:07,980
Yeah.

962
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,480
Yeah, pretty much.

963
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:08,980
Candle.

964
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:13,480
If they fried her, I'd probably eat the granny from Looney Tunes, too.

965
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:13,980
Yeah.

966
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,480
Yeah.

967
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,480
Might as well.

968
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,480
She had a big fat ass.

969
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,980
Remember that? They gave her a big fat ass.

970
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,480
Did they?

971
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
She walked with a limp, dude.

972
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
That was funny back then.

973
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
She walked bow-legged.

974
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,480
That was funny back then if someone had a big fat ass.

975
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:34,480
Granny from Looney Tunes looks like a girl that like Kevin Gates would have sex with.

976
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,480
And like post on his Instagram.

977
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,480
It looks exactly like that.

978
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Yeah.

979
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,480
It is Granny.

980
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,480
Yerr me.

981
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,480
Hey, hello.

982
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,480
My girl Granny, yerr me.

983
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
I don't remember what she sounds like.

984
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,480
I don't remember either.

985
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,480
Oh, fuck, I'm Grandma.

986
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,360
Grandma. Oh I'm Tweety Bird's mom. Also you can't be no granny with if you don't got no damn

987
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,480
grandkids. We didn't see those. Tweety Bird. Tweety Bird. The kid is Tweety Bird. Yeah. Who's a guy by the

988
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:12,680
way did you know that? I did know that. He's not a boy. But he's such a wimp. Yeah that's why I mean

989
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:18,480
imagine you imagine if you you didn't have any parents you just had a grandmother. Yeah. And

990
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,440
you were a bird and you were bright yellow. Imagine how you might feel then. That's like the most

991
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,440
beautiful lyrics I've ever heard. Imagine you have no parents, imagine you have a granny,

992
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
imagine you're a bird and you're yellow.

993
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,440
A bright yellow bird.

994
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Yeah. I mean if Gal Gadot had sung that instead, that would have fixed COVID.

995
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,440
Yeah.

996
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,440
Yeah.

997
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:50,440
You remember, ah fuck, it feels so long ago, like all the shit from last year, but like,

998
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:56,440
What was it, that, uh, like in June of last year when all that, all that crap was going on

999
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,440
and all those white celebrities got together and made that video where they were like,

1000
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,440
"I take responsibility."

1001
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Oh yeah. Remember that shit?

1002
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,440
Yeah, the one that sticks in my head from that is the Aaron Paul one.

1003
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Yeah.

1004
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,440
Where he like, he's like acting way harder than anybody else in the video.

1005
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:18,200
the video so he goes like yeah I yo take the white responsibility responsibility

1006
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,440
but he like yeah he like does like prayer hands and like breathing like a lot of

1007
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,800
every word it's already been memory hold like it's already been like memory hold

1008
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,520
like that's when the CIA deletes it from your memory but what yeah but like that

1009
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,520
and then memory what memory hold means is people forgot about it I I was uh I

1010
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,800
was thinking about it earlier but aerial pink at the fucking capital rights I

1011
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,480
I have not forgot about that.

1012
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,160
I think about that every day.

1013
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,960
I was listening to Ariel Pink today.

1014
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,960
What's his deal?

1015
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,440
He just makes weird, like, shitty music.

1016
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Yeah.

1017
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,440
Sounds cool.

1018
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,560
He's a guy who calls himself Ariel Pink.

1019
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,080
I think that pretty much explains it.

1020
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:03,480
I was like, I do remember seeing Ariel Pink in the news and being like, "Hmm, Google image

1021
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,960
search Ariel Pink."

1022
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,440
And being like, "She sounds really hot."

1023
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,320
Being pretty disappointed.

1024
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,680
The first time I ever heard the name Ariel Pink was in fucking Childish Gambino Freaks

1025
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,680
and Geeks.

1026
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,480
He says, "I'm in that Ariel Pink" and then I looked up Ariel Pink and I was like, "Oh,

1027
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,720
this is just a weird guy.

1028
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,800
Like, why would you say that you're inside of him?"

1029
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,200
He had some wild lyrics back in the day.

1030
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,600
"You know I'm a retard and I'm a fat guy."

1031
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,600
That was like every song.

1032
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,960
Is that an actual thing or is that you just saying that?

1033
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,520
That's off the dome, dude.

1034
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
I think this is your own song.

1035
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,920
I think this is a song you've been writing and you need to get used to it.

1036
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,440
You know I'm a retard and I'm a fat guy.

1037
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,440
Yeah.

1038
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,440
Childish Gambino, yeah I'm a black guy.

1039
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,840
That was like his first like eight albums.

1040
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,640
Dude that fucking I'm not a rapper mixtape.

1041
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,520
Brandon and I were talking about this but it's just like the fucking, he raps over Grizzly

1042
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,760
Bear and it's like why the fuck would you ever rap like two weeks by Grizzly Bear you

1043
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,760
want to rap over that?

1044
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,040
is the most insane shit you could do. You should rap over AC/DC. That would be cool.

1045
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,720
That actually, that's some like, that's a Danny Brown move I think. Yeah.

1046
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:24,160
Someone, someone should honestly rap over Aerosmith. Yeah. I think that's... Oh man, could you imagine?

1047
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,320
Yeah, I think that'd be a really really good song. And they do a video together. Yeah.

1048
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,480
I mean I am such a sucker for when like just a SoundCloud rapper just raps over

1049
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,400
a song that is not supposed to be rapped over. That's like the best shit ever. Like

1050
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:44,320
Like when Lil Peep wrapped over Wonderwall, when Cemetery wrapped over Burzum and stuff,

1051
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,960
dude it's so tight, it's so awesome.

1052
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,640
That sounds cool but like...

1053
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,840
I mean literally it doesn't matter what, as long as it's a song that shouldn't be wrapped

1054
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,160
over it's awesome when they do it.

1055
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,880
But I mean, you know how they invented rap, right?

1056
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,880
How did they invent rap?

1057
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,000
What tell me.

1058
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,640
They took crap and they took off the C.

1059
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,640
Oh, 'cause the C was for country.

1060
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Mm-hmm.

1061
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,640
Country plus rap equals crun...

1062
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,640
Crunch...

1063
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,640
Crunchy...

1064
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,640
Crunchy...

1065
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,640
Crunchy crap.

1066
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,640
Okay, bye everybody!

1067
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,880
(laughing)
