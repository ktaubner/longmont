Ow.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,400

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,200
Yeah, I did.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,300
Hurt myself.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,800
What? Did you- Is this why you called me the other day?

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,600
No.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,200
Oh.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,200
No, I called you yesterday because

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,700
I got to the skate park.

15
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,700
Like, I was skating for a good, like,

16
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,220
hour or so and then it just started pouring and I was like hiding under like

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,620
like it's this like community center next to um this like skate park and I was just hiding under

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,740
their like alcove thing and I was like getting wet no I didn't want to get my board wet I didn't want

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,460
to get my board or my bearings wet it could ruin it. You're afraid it'll warp into a Dr. Seuss board?

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,500
Yeah I'll have like a big like curvy like the nose will be like looped around like a jester shoe.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
You could be like the goofy skater.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,000
I could be the...

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,500
That's uh...

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
There's this guy Simon Woodstock in the 90s.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
He used to do shit like that.

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Of course, his last name was Woodstock.

29
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
I mean, come on.

31
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He would like uh...

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Put like...

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Trucks on like a big surfboard.

35
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Like skate... skate parks.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Could do something like that.

37
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Well, I mean, I'm out of commission now.

38
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
'Cause I fucking...

39
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,000
I didn't warm up today.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,500
And I dinged my knee pretty hard.

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
You slipped on a banana peel and hit your knee on the ceiling.

42
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
[Laughs]

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He got so much...

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,120
is the most air he's ever gotten is eight inches.

46
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,280
He hit his knee on the ceiling.

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,640
(laughing)

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,920
Maybe you're like the greatest banana slipper of all time.

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
Maybe you should transition from skating

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,160
to riding a banana around.

51
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,000
- I could.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
- You know, just you on one leg,

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,400
going whoa!

54
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,280
All across town.

55
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
- Yeah, up the corner of the pipe.

56
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,680
- Holding onto the back of a truck.

57
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,520
- Yeah.

58
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,340
- Whoa!

59
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,640
- Oh God!

60
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,880
Somebody stop this thing!

61
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,600
I feel like you'd be better at that than skating.

62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,160
Oh I already am.

63
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,500
I can, I like, the good, the thing I'm good at is making it look like I can land things.

64
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,720
And then be like, "Oh, today's just not my day."

65
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Yeah.

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,200
That's basically, that's basically my whole thing is like I'll land something once or twice

67
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,800
and then like try to do something that's clearly out of my skill set and then people will be

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,480
be like damn dude you got that and I'm like I hope I do that's exactly how I am

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,660
with like pool I have like a nice you and I know how to like how to look like I'm

70
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,820
good at pool and then I'll just miss shots but oh sorry I'm getting over a

71
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,340
cold right now right oh yeah I'm usually hit every shot if skating was about

72
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,980
excuses I'd be amazing I'd be the top pro it is about excuse it is a jail dude

73
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,620
yeah yeah where you should be by the way I don't condone any form of skateboarding

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,740
I watched skating dancing I think should be illegal I watched Lords of Docktown

75
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,580
today oh yeah yeah yeah just again yeah what does it time do you think you've

76
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,300
seen that movie not a lot I don't know yeah I saw it like a bunch when I like

77
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,660
maybe like I've probably seen Lords of Docktown five times nice those are the

78
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,620
guys who invented who invented sitting in a pool and hurting yourself yeah they

79
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,500
sound awesome it is funny that it's weird like framing it like like the movie

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
frames it like Tony Alva was this like huge star which he like was in like the

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,860
skateboarding world but it's like he's riding in like limousines and shit it's

82
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,660
like it's making them like it's I don't know it's kind of gassing them up too

83
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,340
much yeah I think all skateboarders should be

84
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,420
taken down a peg yeah I think we're a truck I think we should be gassing all

85
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:54,860
skateboarders yep what the that's right up up yeah into the Sun yeah I agree we

86
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,140
should be experimenting on you guys like lab rats don't take it dude you guys

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,500

92
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,420
something about wanting to fuck Mary from Jesus's mom and that's exactly how

93
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,340
they reacted is like when it's um when I talk shit about skateboarding yeah same

94
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,140
reaction is them and I was like yeah Mary probably had a wet-ass fucking butthole

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:52,740
and pussy. You didn't say that. You didn't say that. I did say I want to fuck Mary.

96
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,280
Why? Why would you? That is like the worst thing you could say. It's funny to mess with your friends parents dude.

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,420
What do you think I why do you think I'm fucking a mess on your mom every time I

98
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,420

99
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,020
then he goes over and he goes, "Excuse me, Mrs. Neal, can I have another Ritz Cracker,

100
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,020
please?"

101
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
And then he comes back and he goes, "Yo, dude!"

102
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
"Dude, I didn't need one!"

103
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
"I didn't need one!"

104
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,860
Yeah, he did not even do anything like that when my mom was here.

105
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
You hid from her.

106
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,020
I hid on her.

107
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,460
No, you hid from my mom.

108
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,460
Nah, dude.

109
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,100
Yeah, you thought so.

110
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
You stayed in the other room.

111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
Remember when I walked her out to the car?

112
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
You didn't.

113
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,740
Remember how it took four and a half hours to walk her out to the car?

114
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,580
Remember how long that was?

115
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,080
You hid from my mom.

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
You stayed in the living room.

117
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,760
I didn't hide from your mom, dude.

118
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Yeah, you did.

119
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,020
I didn't hide from your- I would never hide from your mom, dude.

120
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,740
I'd run towards the light.

121
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,800
You hid from my mom.

122
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,260
As soon as my mom and dad were in the living room, you were like, "Me and Julio are nowhere

123
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
to go."

124
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,340
I had to leave.

125
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
I had an appointment.

126
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,940
Oh, you had an appointment.

127
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,340
Yeah, with Manhattan.

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
I did.

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,020
With the Statue of Liberty?

131
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Yeah dude, I had to make my time.

132
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,020
You saw my mom and my dad in the same room and you ran away.

133
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
No.

134
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Why would I run away from your beautiful mom and your ugly dad?

135
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,020
Don't say- no, uh uh uh.

136
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Your weak, ugly, short dad.

137
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,020
I'll stomp him to the ground like a Goomba, bro.

138
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,020
My dad is like way taller than you.

139
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
My dad can beat the shit out of you.

140
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,020
My dad's-

141
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Dude, your dad's 80 years old.

142
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,020
I would break his fucking femur bone.

143
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
For 55, my dad's ripped as fuck.

144
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,500
455 he's 55 years old yeah I'm gonna beat the shit out of your dad no you're not

145
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,340

146
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,820

147
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,500

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,540
me fucking dirt Eric Eric fuck you Eric like you could be saying that to my

149
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,900
brother you got to say Eric senior fuck you Eric senior well he's not okay I

150
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,540
I've talked about this before I think but he's not Eric Sr. because he

151
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,520
doesn't have the same exact name as my brother. There's about to be one Eric in town.

152
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,220
Okay is it only junior and senior if it's the same middle name too? I think so.

153
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,060
I don't think that's true. Well yeah but... Because my dad is a junior I don't

154
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,740
think that he his dad has the same middle name. But my dad says like well

155
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,740
he's not Eric Jr. when he talks about my brother. I mean that's

156
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,660
just him protecting your brother like you can't go to school as someone named

157
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,860
Eric jr. it's true like that's the end that's it yeah you know oh and my mom

158
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:42,860
claims that I'm not named after her her name's Patrick her name's Patricia

159
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,740
we had no idea weird coincidence right I guess it is mostly the exact same so we

160
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,660
have one kid Eric and one name Patrick yeah she's like she swears up and down

161
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,800

What the fuck is that shit?

184
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,760
That's the funniest Irish shit of all time.

185
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,240
My name was almost Edmund.

186
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,480
I mean Irish people are named with a magic 8 ball.

187
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
What are you fucking-

188
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
True, yeah.

189
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Patrick, Colin.

190
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Yeah.

191
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,360
They don't even have enough for like a roulette wheel.

192
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,120
Like there's only enough names for a magic 8 ball.

193
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Yeah.

194
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
A die.

195
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
These are the two-

196
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Seamus.

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
My brother was almost named Seamus.

198
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,300
if he was born this is a cooler name than yeah whatever his name is Eric if he was

199
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,940
born he's born the day before st. Patrick's Day so if he was born on st.

200
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,740
Patrick's Day name would have been named Seamus that would have sucked dude yeah

201
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,700
growing up in Boston named Seamus born on st. Patrick's Day I mean first of all

202
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,100
you have to be the mayor if we yeah if we stayed in summer well no he would

203
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,300
have moved to Boston yeah he would have had no question he would have stayed

204
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,020
there they would have whole I would have deported him they would have become a

205
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,940
mask Austin the mayor of fucking well there's no mayor in London there's only

206
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,060
four mayors in New Hampshire yeah yeah good for them only four mayors it's

207
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,620
useless job dude man doesn't do shit well for sure the mayor in my hometown

208
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:01,180
his name I almost said his name is build a Blasio but I don't think it is it's

209
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,660
Bill something guys a fucking bill nobody knows what he does and he's just

210
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,500
been the mayor for like 50 years all you do as the mayor is you just have to wear

211
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,660
the sash that says mayor that's pretty much it

212
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,780
ceremonies but other than there should at least have to have like a physical

213
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,860
fitness test they need to be like they need to be like extremely ripped yeah

214
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,300
you know our hot that's the governor no the governor has to be ripped

215
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,220
California's at the president no I don't like that that precedent I don't think

216
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,140
all governors need to be hot governor I think the mayor should have to be very

217
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,540
ugly yeah oh the mayor could be like a like a troll like a hunchback type yeah

218
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,980
yeah that's good too you only like lives in a tower yeah it's Punxsutawney Phil

219
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,980
the mayor he should be if if mayors acted like the hunchback of Notre Dame like if

220
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,820
they had to live in a tower and their job was they like rang bells and stuff

221
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:56,820
that'd be pretty cool maybe that was the mayor's job back in the 1700s and we

222
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,660
just don't talk about it it's just lost in translation yeah maybe there's just

223
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:19,140
just

224
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,900
the world I got some big checks to write right now. Dude we're gonna have a fair

225
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:31,200
tomorrow yeah that's right oh what oh oh oh you like the mayor now? The first

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,180
cool mayor looked at his giant pair of scissors and was like what if I

227
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,020
what if I use this to cut ribbons for new buildings instead of chasing children

228
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,060
down the stairs of my tower. What if I opened a laundromat with this?

229
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,500
yeah that'd be so sick that'd be some swag ass mayor shit do people actually like

230
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,260

235
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:22,380
hunchback yeah it's like a last day like a back binder uh-huh yeah yeah you're

236
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,660
taking that hunch out yeah that's true that's completely true yeah you can

237
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,300
fact-check that dude yep fucking call the infographics show they'll get let's

238
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,780
get Snopes on here come on Snopes I know you listen come on Snopes I know you're

239
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,660
in the room with us come on professor Snope

240
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:45,140
Professor Snope. Come on Snope. The inventor is Snope. Yeah. Come fuck with us.

241
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,860
Mm-hmm. Yeah. We should hire a live fact-checker. That is a good idea. Yeah.

242
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,980
We could get a like a hire like a like a really good live fact-checker like one

243
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,620
of these guys they hire for like the CNN debates. We should hire Pinocchio.

244
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,020
And then just have him sit in the in the call. Yeah. And just interrupt anytime he has

245
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,340
something to say. We have Pinocchio on the call right but he's muted the whole. Let's get Nate Silver dude.

246
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,620
Pinocchio's muted the whole call so anytime that like he's just repeating

247
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,020
everything we're saying so anytime he says something. Oh that's smart! That's very clever.

248
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,360
Until he knocks his webcam off. Uh-huh yeah well he just doesn't face the

249
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,780
webcam that's yeah he has to sit sideways. He sits sideways and then and then we'll uh and

250
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:32,820
then we unmute him when we have to ask him what the the fact is that we got

251
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,260
wrong right he what he doesn't know the I guess he knows because of his nose

252
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,260
grow yeah it's like a thing see Pinocchio could if he just said

253
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,940
different things out loud he could figure out so many formulas and

254
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,020
scientific rooms you know if you're for cancer is yeah and then just start

255
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,660
vinegar no it's not that yeah be careful someone's gonna call

256
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:07,420

260
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,100

261
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,740
be thousands of dollars in plastic surgery. If you think about it, the word

275
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,640
deal you have to be self effacing. Oh me I can't be no damn mayor. Oh I'm no hunchback.

276
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,720
What's that these giant scissors my hands fit perfectly in these? Oh it must be some

277
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,680
sort of coincidence Jesus Christ yeah imagine how big a mayor's hands must be

278
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:17,720
to kill this fucking system. That's so true. We gotta be strong. Do you think he gets back, do you think when he signs a bill into law he's a giant pen?

279
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:25,720
It's a two handed pen. I need you to, ah fuck, big checks, I'm all about big checks, big scissors and big asses.

280
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,720
That's how you make sure that nobody else can sign a bill it has to be the mayor.

281
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
true that's a good one.

282
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880

I, this one's out of fucking ink.

285
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm all out of big pens.

286
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,720
Yeah, I should just get a big fountain pen.

287
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
I don't know.

288
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
I just prefer a ballpoint.

289
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,360
Oh, fuck, hand me the big stapler.

290
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Hand me giant whiteout.

291
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,080
I fucked this one up.

292
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Give me the giant whiteout.

293
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,480
It's just a bucket of paint.

294
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Yeah.

295
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,160
tragedy struck last night as the mayor accidentally decapitated himself while

296
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,480
trying to sharpen his giant pencil with his giant scissors.

297
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,480
[Laughter]

298
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Dude, that was always the worst, like...

299
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
That was always the worst when that happened.

300
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,480
No, just like sharp, when you like, you're doing your homework as a kid and you just...

301
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Did you guys like own electric pencil sharpeners in your house?

302
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
No. Yeah, because my mom was a teacher.

303
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Oh, right, yeah. I was actually from the ghetto.

304
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Yeah? Yeah.

305
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I didn't know they had electricity there.

306
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
I was actually from the ghetto.

307
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Yeah.

308
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
I didn't have electricity, didn't have water.

309
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
We'd always have those like those fucking shitty like

310
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
scholastic book fair. The small ones?

311
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
Yeah, we'd have those but then like you know

312
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
you fucking like those break or you lose them

313
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
and I would have to like sharpen my pencils

314
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
with like a kitchen knife or something.

315
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Dude, you were pissed off

316
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
about having to use a kitchen knife?

317
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
What kind of fucking kid were you?

318
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
It's the coolest shit ever to get to take a knife and sharpen a pencil.

319
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,320
That's literally the coolest thing. It's cooler to use an electric sharpener. I only had it's cooler to use an electric sharpener

320
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,600
I like the electric sharpener much better. You know those flat pencils that people use for like construction jobs. Yeah, yeah

321
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,180
That's the only pencil I had growing up cuz my dad was like we don't need to buy pencils for school

322
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,480
You just use the ones from work

323
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,000
And I had a pocket knife that I sharpened all my pencils with if this is explaining anything about me. Yeah, yeah

324
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,400
I always sharpen my shit with a knife

325
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,360
And then I put the knife in my gold teeth and I'd look at the teacher, say, "You want to give me a F now, Holmes?"

326
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
[laughs]

327
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,360
It was not good. It was a very offensive child.

328
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Yeah.

329
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Yeah.

330
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Yeah.

331
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,360
I used to, I just hated teachers so much, dude.

332
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Me too.

333
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
I was on a mission to destroy the teacher.

334
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Oh, man.

335
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Mentally and physically.

336
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Did I, when I was in fifth grade, I just never did homework. I almost got held back in the

337
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,640
fifth grade because like I just didn't want to do homework but there was this thing called

338
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
homework club.

339
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
It sounds awesome.

340
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,280
And my fifth grade teacher like kept me in the homework club.

341
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,920
I couldn't go to recess at the end of the day because I was constantly in homework club

342
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,400
and I learned that her last name was like German and I came home one day and I was like

343
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,360
she's a fucking Nazi.

344
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,520
Dude, there was a teacher in my school whose last name was, she was Italian, her last name

345
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
was Be a Nazi.

346
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Oh my god!

347
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,600
No, I have a good funny teacher name.

348
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,640
It was the lady at the front desk, her last name was Dabona, so they would go in the intercom

349
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
and say, "Paging Miss Dabona."

350
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,160
That's a good last name, though.

351
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Really good.

352
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
There was a-

353
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,040
And you know they'd said miss instead of misses every single time.

354
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Oh yeah.

355
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Miss Dabona!

356
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Miss Dabona.

357
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,320
Oh, drats, another one gone.

358
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,320
We had a teacher in my elementary school named Mrs. Pringle.

359
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Why do people with the stupidest names become teachers and nurses?

360
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,320
That was fucking... the fucking... when I worked at the liquor store, the guy who...

361
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,320
there was the guy who was named Swastikar, and then we would always get the order from Swastikar,

362
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,320
and then also a guy named Jimmy Pringle, and we would get them on the same day,

363
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,400
be like okay you have to prepare an order for swastika and also one for jimmy pringle

364
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,920
damn dude yeah that's the thing before pringles were chips it was definitely just like a name

365
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,440
you had just a silly word like yeah name people had i wonder what um jimmy wonder where pringle

366
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:39,520
comes from the can it's too easy for me it's just too easy yeah well it's actually it's from it's

367
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,000
from it's from like colonial times where the every town had a Pringler

368
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,640
mm-hmm yeah he would hear people would bring him their chips and they would

369
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,460
bring him they would bring him yeah like flavor sludge and he would it's a

370
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,400
minute of various shapes I think it's a Scottish name because I found a a

371
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,880
clothe a clothing brand called Pringle of Scotland could be that would make sense

372
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Robert Pringle established Pringle of Scotland in 1815.

373
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Wow.

374
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,880
You guys have relatively normal last names. I was cursed with a stupid last name.

375
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,880
I have a teacher style last name.

376
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Yeah, Clan Pringle is a lowland clan from the Scottish borders.

377
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Pringle clan.

378
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Dude, imagine you fucking, you're like, "Alright, I'm finally gonna figure out my Scottish heritage.

379
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,800
out of sheritage like I'm gonna find my clan I'm gonna go to like the highlands

380
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,540
I'm gonna visit their castle or whatever and you find out it's called clan

381
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:41,260
Pringle yeah and it's in a tube. I'm gonna buy all like I'm gonna buy the family crest I'm so excited.

382
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:47,720
The family crest it's like it's like some like it's like a shield with just a Pringles guy in the middle.

383
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,100
I'm a descendant of Lord Hostess of the of the Hostess clan of Britain.

384
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:00,660
My great-great-grandfather Tobias Tastycake did not come to this country for me to be a

385
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
fucking slacker.

386
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Oh man.

387
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,300
I don't even know where my family is from, really.

388
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,940
I got some notification today from Ancestry.com that they found my grandpa or something.

389
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
Oh yeah?

390
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,300
And yeah, and the first thing I did was text my grandpa to see if he had like died or something

391
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,740
so there's finally a record of him.

392
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,700
But I just don't know.

393
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Pass them.

394
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,860
I gotta do Ancestry or something, because I don't know either really.

395
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
Yeah, I gotta figure that out.

396
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,620
Dude, we can read it all on the podcast.

397
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
I did Ancestry.

398
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
I remember, yeah.

399
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,180
I don't want to give him my spit, dude.

400
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,420
I don't want him to clone my ass.

401
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,580
Well, no, I did 23 and me, but I also did Ancestry for, like, Lineage.

402
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Nice, dude.

403
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,140
It sounds like you're brainwashed.

404
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,140
Yeah.

405
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Yeah.

406
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,140
What's that like?

407
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
It's pretty good.

408
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,380
I found out that I'm a descendant of John of Great Battles.

409
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Yeah.

410
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Doesn't sound like it.

411
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,860
the FBI is gonna put your spit on the next bullet that kills a president dude.

412
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:03,820
That's right. Okay, sounds pretty sick. Being framed for the murder of the president just being like yeah I mean

413
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,260
it's good sure I guess I did it I don't really remember. Yeah I don't feel any

414
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,460
remorse. Yeah I don't see any reason why I wouldn't do that. It's kinda cool actually. Yeah you know I guess I guess if I did have that

415
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,740
bullet in my mouth then I must have done it. Yeah I don't know I mean why would I have a

416
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,260
bullet in my mouth I wasn't gonna shoot somebody with it doesn't really make a

417
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,820
lot of sense yeah I guess that's right this is the last time I've spit my

418
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,260
bullet shells out at the ballgame

419
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:39,380

probably like maybe Shrek could be Shrek get involved no it's one of the most

426
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,820
fucked up realities of life dude they should make a they should make an

427
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,380
article about that I mean they what they should do they should have to open the

428
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,660
shells of the pistachios check if they're okay and then seal them back so

429
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,500
you still get to like I've been saying this for a long time every single bite

430
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,060
of every food that ends up on my plate should be taste tested should be quality

431
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,180
checked yeah yeah yeah somebody sitting in a in a factory should have to chew it

432
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,620
up spit it out and then see what's good yep I don't know they get shelled

433
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:47,620
pistachios in a bag true they do they just sit in their mouth

434
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,540
it's a guy in his back molar and he goes and it just like shoots it out that's

435
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:59,460
pretty check to see if it tastes like Shrek mm-hmm yeah you guys fuck with

436
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:08,700
pistachio y'all rocking with pistachio ice cream when it's done when it's done

437
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,920
- If you put it on like shitily, it's delicious

438
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,760
'cause it just tastes like the color green.

439
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,600
- Yeah.

440
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
- Otherwise it's like a vegetable ice cream.

441
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,920
- Yeah.

442
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,760
- I don't want that shit.

443
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,840
- It's a weird flavor. - I like it.

444
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,000
- I like it too. - I like pistachio ice cream.

445
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,160
- I think pistachio flavor, I mean,

446
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,840
the thing about it, it's one of those flavors

447
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,520
that I don't think really tastes all that much

448
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,400
like the actual thing, but scientists have somehow

449
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,760
created a chemical that just is its own flavor.

450
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,520
Like they created like a, you know,

451
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,140
it's the same thing with like watermelon.

452
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,980
- You know what I think it is?

453
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,300
I think it's I think some pistachio ice cream has like almond extract in it and I think

454
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,900
it's a combination of the almond extract and the pistachio flavor.

455
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,860
Yeah I think it's also that you never eat you can it's literally impossible to eat pistachios

456
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,740
fast enough to get a concentrated flavor from them because you have to shell them.

457
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,940
Yeah they just taste like salt.

458
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,180
Right yeah yeah most nuts do nuts are pretty overrated.

459
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,980
But you gotta love how those shells taste.

460
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,500
Oh god damn when you're crunching those shells.

461
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,740
I make sure I lick the outside of the shell before I open it every time.

462
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,140
The best thing is just throwing them all over your floor and stepping on them.

463
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,620
Do you guys ever wish you could eat an acorn?

464
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,620
Yes, dude.

465
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
Are you kidding?

466
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,140
When I was a kid I used to eat anything that fell off a tree in my backyard.

467
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,260
I would crack it open and I would eat it.

468
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,140
I've eaten like the inside of a pine cone.

469
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,980
Why do they taste so bad?

470
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,620
They look like they should taste amazing.

471
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,060
Yeah, how stupid are these squirrels?

472
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Squirrels?

473
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,460
How fucking stupid are these squirrels?

474
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,540
It's a double R, you pronounce it like that.

475
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,020
These squirrels are absolutely foolish.

476
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,180
Anytime I see a squirrel put a bunch of acorns in a tree and be like, "Oh yeah, these are

477
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
all mine.

478
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,300
I'm taking these for the winter."

479
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,300
A squirrel?

480
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,420
Every time I see a squale put a bunch of acorns in a tree.

481
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,420
A squarrel.

482
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
It's called a squarrel.

483
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
It's what it's called.

484
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:03,180
Squirrel. That's what it's called. Okay, I didn't want to say it the normal way I say

485
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,140
it because I knew you guys would say it funnily.

486
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,820
What's the normal way you say it? Squirrel.

487
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,500
That's how I say it. I thought that was like a southern way to say it.

488

Fine we get everything we get the entire world. That's not the cell. I get all the pussy States like California and India

506
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,820
Against you and India South you said all the rest of the world

507
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,100
India say that Cameron it is like snowflakes

508
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,820
Every everywhere, but the South what we get everywhere, but the South

509
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,500
Yeah, you're gonna lose. That's like seven billion people

510
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,980
Yeah, but he's got India now. No no you guys have India

511
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,820
Oh, that's why we have the entire world. I heard it wrong

512
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,340
Do you even know what a civil war is dude?

513
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah, it's a war between two sides. Yeah, Captain America and Iron Man. Okay. All right, I

514
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,760
Get to be Iron Man rich

515
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,040
Okay

516
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:33,340
I get rich on man. Oh nice. I'll crush him like an bug. Well, he'll get big - that's weird

517
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,980
I will crush him like a dinosaur. He shouldn't be allowed to get big. He should be a different guy.

518
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,500
They should yeah they call his name is Ant-Man but then they also call him Giant-Man too.

519
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,940
Like he has multiple names because they couldn't because they couldn't just call him like

520
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,300
Grow and Shrink-Man. Yeah if he's so big they should call him Elephant-Man.

521
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:59,420
That's what I think. So you're gonna just pick the biggest thing. That's why um at least DC had

522
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,620
had the right idea where they made their Ant-Man like...

523
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,620
The atom, right?

524
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,620
Yeah, the atom.

525
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,380
Because an atom could be anything.

526
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,580
And the thing is, that guy too, he could just be a normal sized guy named Adam.

527
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,580
So the name is really, it's multi-purpose.

528
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,020
But his name is Dr. Choi.

529
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,900
It's insanely, I would say he is the most fucked up superhero that they've come up with.

530
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Who, Adam?

531
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
The Ant-Man.

532
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Yeah.

533
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,780
The idea that he can like jump into your shit and rearrange your molecules.

534
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:36,300
That's true. That's fucked up dude. Yeah. He turned you into slush. Personally I think it's Captain America because of imperialism.

535
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,940
Nice dude.

536
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:44,380
Fuck. Yeah, you're not coming back from that one. Damn. You just lost all your political capital. Oh my god dude.

537
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:51,940
Okay, I also I think Red Skull is fucked up because of obvious reasons. Because you don't like Nazis being portrayed as evil?

538
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,940
No.

539
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,220
No, I mean the Todd Nishikot's

540
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:04,620
one the one where he's like where he's Jordan Peterson yeah he's like he like

541
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,100
likes Jordan Peterson or whatever yeah that's a brave as a brash move yeah I'm

542
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,100
further than brave that was brash I'm gonna start if I had that job I would I

543
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,540
would just make the Nazi character just anybody I didn't like dude yeah yeah

544
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,780
yeah just make like I mean that's yeah it's basically I'd make a I'd make a

545
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:28,180
Patrick one no definitely be a Patrick Nazi Patrick's goal hey what you could

546
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,460
rename him Patrick skull his power is that he can headbutt people cuz his head

547
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,420
is too thick yeah yeah Gabby Gifford she'd be catching the smoke for me who's

548
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:47,380
that that lady that that senator who got shot in the face and it's not nothing

549
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:56,900
personal but I just don't like her vibe really. She gives off bad vibes. She showed up to your

550
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,500
party dude she'd be like complaining about everything she'd be going to the

551
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,580
bathroom multiple times. What's wrong with going to the bathroom multiple times?

552
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,260
If you're at a party and you go to the bathroom you get one bathroom visit. No you

553
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,700
don't. If you're at my house for a bit of a get-together you get a single

554
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,660
bathroom visit. I'm gonna hand out tickets you get a hall pass and that's it.

555
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,780
If I was a comic book writer, every time a celebrity died in real life, I would write

556
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,940
the celebrity death into the comic and have everybody celebrate it because they were evil

557
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,940
in the comic.

558
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,580
That'd be a good way to balance out, like, you know, people are feeling really sad, they

559
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,460
could maybe read the comic and, you know, he could have been a super villain who destroyed

560
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,460
half the planet.

561
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,100
It could have been a lot worse, we'll say that.

562
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,860
Maybe if he had lived, he would have lived out.

563
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,180
Anton Yelchin could have done some horrible things.

564
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
you know.

565
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
Yep.

566
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
Yeah, dude.

567
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,260
He could have tied up a dame behind that jeep.

568
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,300
I mean, he could have destroyed the entire planet of Galactroid if he was still alive,

569
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,860
so I'm glad that he got crushed.

570
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
Why anti-Yelchin?

571
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
I don't get it.

572
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,860
I was just trying to think of the most inoffensive celebrity.

573
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,380
Just a guy who just, I mean...

574
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,300
Just total dog shit.

575
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,660
You can't say he didn't deserve it, I guess, because he did just like...

576
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
He created a rude gold person.

577
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
What do you mean he didn't deserve it?

578
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,860
- Yeah, he's like, "What are you fucking talking about?"

579
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,780
- Dude, anybody smart enough to fly on the Starship Enterprise

580
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,040
should know not to be crushed by a truck.

581
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,980
- I mean, also just like--

582
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,460
- It wasn't a truck, it was a Jeep.

583
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,140
- Okay, that's the same thing.

584
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,020
- You're so stupid you can't put your car in park?

585
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,500
- Yeah, I thought it was.

586
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,900
- I mean, I don't know the details,

587
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,300
but here's what I'm thinking happened.

588
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,380
He put a brick on the gas pedal,

589
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,700
swung that thing in reverse, and said,

590
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
"Watch this, I'm practicing a magic trick

591
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,260
"for the first time."

592
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:49,140
didn't work out. Oh look at me I'm so famous and cool but I don't even know to put a tiny

593
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,480
little door on my gate so if my car rolls down and crushes me against it I can open the little

594
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,880
door and crawl through and escape without being crushed. That's my impression of Anton Yelchin.

595
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,220
He should have had Scotty beam him up. Exactly. In a moment before. He probably thought that.

596
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,520
He just like looked at the jeep and was like "Yeah you think you're about to fucking kill

597
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,180
me with my own hey Scotty yeah he's standing there with the fingers over

598
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:21,620
like the Star Trek thing beam me up you know I gotta say he did a good job in

599
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:31,460
green room but he's down in a red place right now poor Anton dude man yeah he's

600
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,140
so good in green room he had a great injury humor though he would love this

601
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:44,260
conversation yeah you'd actually think he's probably smiling about yeah yep

602
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:51,340
probably as a some sort of demon gargoyle flings a pitchfork he gets a

603
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:57,340
single glimpse at the world above says well a clip of audio for any down and he

604
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,660
has a small smile on his face the first smile he's had in the millions of years

605
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,200
he's been trapped in there as far as he is concerned and he says you know what

606
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:14,860
you know what he says you know what I'm still still putting smiles on the

607
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:24,220
American people's faces even from way down here in Christian hell Wow so fuck

608
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,660
no no no it's fine dude it doesn't matter defend I'm taking it I'm taking

609
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,840
Anton's side you're gonna help down there with them Jesus that'd be really funny

610
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:42,020
I'm open to legal action oh I don't I'm not open to that please we're gonna be

He was evil. He just said shit like that to everyone. If you look it up, there's so many funny things.

625
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,440
He said to these, like he went to Australia and like the first thing he said to like a group of Aboriginals was like,

626
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,940
"Uh, you guys don't still throw spears, right?"

627
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,940
He's just like, he's like the worst guy ever.

Nonces and buggers to me. To schoolboy George Barlow in 2003 who had written a letter to

648

the Queen, Prince Philip reportedly said, "Ah, you're the one who wrote the letter, so you

can write then, ha ha." Wow. Damn. I mean, this guy's a real scallywag. He told, he told

674
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,720
bedroom house in North Carolina, a palace that I think is eight million dollars.

675
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,720
I don't think that's a palace, I think that's called a plantation.

676
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,080
No, no, it's a palace.

677
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,840
It's a palatial plantation.

678
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,440
It's a cotton palace.

679
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,920
There's tons of shit everywhere, it's sick.

680
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,560
No, but it was like eight million dollars or something and like the monthly payment,

681
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,160
the zestiment on Zillow was like eight thousand bucks a month or something.

682
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:58,640
I was like dude that's like get my fucking 17 closest friends split $8,000 a month

684
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,760
interestingly enough though 17 of your friends have to live in a small low

685
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,840
house that's a little bit off of the big main house. It's mostly a big wooden it's like a

686
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,160
like a chicken coop more than anything that they'd be living in but I get that

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,040
Do you think you could live with like a fucking a ghost haunting you all the time in that place?

689
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,480
There's no ghosts there. Why would there be a why would there be a ghost there?

690
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,000

697
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,520

00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,740
That's fine.

742
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:42,100
John Lovitz you simple son of a... You disgusting little man. Isn't he like an insanely right-wing now?

743
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,280
Uh yeah, I mean he went down the same path as like Schneider and stuff.

744
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,140
Dressed like a, looks like a weeble. Oh, that's your move. He's a little, he's a tiny man,

745
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,580
John Lovitz. John Lovitz, really? I don't, I don't know a single thing about him. He's small.

746
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:00,020
That's how he snuck into our hearts and minds, dude.

747
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,020
He is 5'10".

748
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,020
Yep, he's tiny to me.

749
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,020
Whoa, dude.

750
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,020
Yeah, that's right.

751
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:09,700
5'9" and a half, talking up at John Lovitz.

752
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,820
Oh, nope.

753
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,820
It's going to be talking down.

754
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,820
You're right, because you're big, dude.

755
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,820
Yeah, that's right.

756
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,820
I'll whoop him.

757
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,820
You're going to whoop him?

758
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,820
You're going to shoot to whoop him, dude.

759
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,820
Yeah, that's right.

760
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,820
That's right.

761
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,460
Hit him with the shoot to whoop.

762
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,420
Ooh, John Lovitz, you're not ready.

763
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,580
I'm just looking at pictures of John Lovitz right now.

764
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,740
How did that guy become like, what did he do on SNL?

765
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:36,460
- How did he become the most famous guy of all time?

766
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,040
- Oh, how is he like, every woman is upset.

767
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,200
Oh wait, I just remembered his feud with Andy Dick.

768
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,900
- I'm not familiar.

769
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,420
- You don't know about the John Lovitz, Andy Dick feud?

770
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,660
- No, is it like, who could stay in the closet the longest?

771
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:59,140
No, John Lovitz blamed Andy Dick for the murder of Phil Hartman.

772
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,060
Oh yeah, I do remember that actually.

773
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,060
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:12,100
He claimed that Andy Dick had given Phil Hartman's wife cocaine or something and made her go crazy.

775
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,420
And I guess Andy Dick, it was like a feud forever because they were both on news radio.

776
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:24,140
And then in like 2004 or something like that, or 2005, Andy Dick walked up to Jon Lovitz

777
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,020
at the Laugh Factory and was like, "I'm putting the Phil Hartman curse on you!"

778
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,260
Oh, that rules.

779
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,260
You know, I can't make a ruling until Rogan kind of gives his take on that.

780
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,700
I've kind of got to wait for the big dog to send it down the ladder.

781
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,740
And then I'll let you know who I think did it.

782
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,220
Could have been Jon Lovitz, you know?

783
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,500
Yeah, could have been Patton Oswalt.

784
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,940
Yep, I guess you're right.

785
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,420
Could have been.

786
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,980
Could have been Anton, dude.

787
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,980
True.

788
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,460
Okay, so I'm on his Wikipedia.

789
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,460
"Politically, Lovitz is a Democrat.

790
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,380
However, he was an outspoken critic of Obama, called him a fucking asshole, and accused

791
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,380
him of hypocrisy."

792
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,380
I wonder why.

793
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,380
Yeah.

794
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:08,460
If he's a Democrat, you know, I wonder what was different with him.

795
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,460
Yeah, strange.

796
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,220
Yeah, I don't know.

797
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,860
We'll have to look more into that.

798
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,060
We'll have to get our fact checker on that one.

799
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,060
Yeah.

800
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,060
Yeah, John Lovitz is one of those guys who like got famous on TV and then started doing

801
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,460
stand up and just sucked but just could sell out anywhere because it's like, "Oh yeah,

802
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,620
that's that fucking, that's that freak from television.

803
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,620
Let's go see him."

804
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,620
Mm-hmm.

805
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,620
That's always such a funny move.

806
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,100
Why would you go from being an actor to being a stand up, that's such a clear downgrade.

807
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,100
Yeah.

808
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,900
I mean like Steve-O did that in like, I mean that's a whole other thing I think.

809
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,900
Yeah.

810
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,540
I mean, Stevo's just like storytelling stand-up.

811
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,340
If you already have a good job,

812
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,380
why would you like fuck it up

813
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,580
and make it like the worst job in the world?

814
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,900
If you have a good job being addicted to whippets

815
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,100
and like stapling your balls to your thigh for money,

816
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,100
why would you do stand-up?

817
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,900
He was fucking on top of the world.

818
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,260
Yeah, oh my God.

819
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,260
There's no videos of his like lowest point doing jackass.

820
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,600
Definitely not.

821
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,780
I just don't get it, man.

822
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,180
That's great, good for Stevo though.

823
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:16,900
Have you seen those home movies of him where he's just fucked out of his mind?

824
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,900
Oh yeah.

825
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,900
And he's like, he recorded himself where he was on too many whippets and he thought he

826
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,940
was having a conversation with somebody and then halfway through, in the video he's all

827
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,060
fucked up and he goes, "I thought someone was here."

828
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,940
Damn dude, on whippets dude?

829
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,940
Yeah.

830
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,940
I've been there on Redditor.

831
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,740
Dude, he got addicted to whippets.

832
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,460
know how fucking hard that is? Yeah, that's nuts. It's fucking easy now dude I go to the

833
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:50,580
smoke shop they have giant whipped cream cans that are called Whippets and

834
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:55,600
but then it just says like whipped cream dispenser and it has like a mouth on the

835
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:01,220
logo. Well okay in like 2006 2007 this is probably way harder. Probably yeah you'd

836
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,660
have to go into the grocery store to empty out some whipped cream cans. Yeah.

837
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,300
Yeah just sitting there. I'm taste testing seeing which flavor of whipped

838
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:14,540
cream is my favorite. I actually have a lot of pumpkin pies coming up. So you're kind

839
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:19,220
of being rude by trying to stop me. Oh look who ruined Thanksgiving.

840
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,380
Look who fucking ruined Thanksgiving. Yeah you guys. Yeah I know it's January but

841
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:29,460
yep it's called planning ahead okay. It's called prepping. Listen if I leave all the whip

842
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,820
cream in the fucking can it's gonna go bad. I take it out and I

843
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:40,500
freeze it okay and I wait for Thanksgiving. I have it, I hold it in my mouth, I have six

844
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Tupperware containers right next to me. I'm spitting a whipped cream into the

845
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:50,260
Tupperware then I throw it in the freezer. Can somebody drive me home? I've tested too

846
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:58,620
much whipped cream and I need somebody to be my DD. Yeah, Whippets is not good dude

847
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,180
that's not I never done with any any

848
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,820
inhalants I is not not my thing really

849
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,220
mm-hmm yeah it's it's fun but it's the

850
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,060
most insane thing to get addicted to I

851
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,900
think yeah yeah the last like fucking

852
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,300
like 30 seconds and it's just it's the

853
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,100
same as it's just it's not even that you

854
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,540
get like an interesting high you just go

855
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:20,020
like whoa it's the same entertainment

856
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,100
level and procedure as inhaling a helium

857
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,500
balloon yeah and being like exactly like

858
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:33,420
yeah that i would rather do helium it's like getting addicted to pong in 2021 instead of

859
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,940
like league of legends yeah it's just it's nothing yeah it feels like an early it's like

860
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:44,740
it's like a pong if every time you pressed a button in pong half of your brain disappeared

861
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:50,740
yeah exactly yeah yeah it gives you the same i would guess like it's probably the same

862
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,500
as like a runner's high as far as like how much you like it i mean i don't think that

863
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:02,540
It's just like standing up too fast but like multiplied by two.

864
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,740
That's all it is.

865
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,420
When I was in high school I was like, "I am going to try and get a runner's high because

866
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,980
I bet that shit is so fire."

867
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,340
And then I just got skinny.

868
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,780
It never got it a single time.

869
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,060
Every single time I ran I was like, "This fucking sucks.

870
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,060
I want to die."

871
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,060
Oh, I am a wimp.

872
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,060
Cameron, you're lying.

873
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,060
You've never had a runner's high.

874
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,060
I have.

875
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,060
I used to run in high school.

876
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,060
It's not a thing.

877
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,060
It's not real.

878
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,060
It is real, dude.

879
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,900
It's fun to run.

880
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,900
Yeah.

881
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,220
You guys wouldn't understand because you're short.

882
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,020
My oxygen's thinner up here.

883
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,660
You get high when you breathe faster.

884
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,660
Yep.

885
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,660
You get high when you're high.

886
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,100
That's why they call it high.

887
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,300
So what I need to do is invest in some stilts.

888
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,540
What you need to do is leave me alone.

889
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,540
All right.

890
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,540
All right.

891
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,340
You know what?

892
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,340
That's fair.

893
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,340
I guess that's fair.

894
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,340
I guess that's fair.

895
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,340
I guess that's fair.

896
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,340
Yeah.

897
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,340
Dude, my knee is so fucked.

898
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,340
Yeah, are you gonna go to the hospital?

899
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,340
No, I just have to

900
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,340
wait for this to go away. I think it's just I bruised

901
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,340
like something.

902
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,340
Time is time's oldest doctor.

903
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,340
Yeah. Dude, I'm

904
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,340
getting, it's so crazy how old I'm

905
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,340
getting. It sucks. I'm the oldest one

906
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,340
so you have to complain to my face.

907
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,340
I know, but I'm like

908
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,180
- Ah, fuck, I'm getting so--

909
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,300
- I'm 24, dude, Kobe year.

910
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,740
- I'm still young and happy.

911
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,140
- Second Kobe year, my first one was eight, I guess.

912
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,020
But now, second Kobe year, dude.

913
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,420
Who knows how much time I got left.

914
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,500
- My Kobe year's coming up.

915
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,620
Dude, when I turn 24, it's all downhill.

916
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,540
- Yeah?

917
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,380
- I think.

918
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,620
- I think you're about halfway down the hill, I would say.

919
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,460
- Yeah?

920
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,660
- Yeah.

921
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,500
- What do you mean?

922
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,340
- I mean, I think--

923
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,180
- I mean, Patrick, I'll admit--

924
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,780
- You peak at, everybody peaks at 18.

925
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,660
- It may be downhill after 24,

926
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,660
but you know, you could hit a pebble

927
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:54,620
and get some real air, like, you know,

928
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,100
like fall off the board and go flying.

929
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,320
- I thought you were a skateboarder, man.

930
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,460
Think about it like you're skateboarding.

931
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,300
Why'd you come down here?

932
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,140
- Dude, there could be a ramp at the bottom of the hill.

933
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,900
- Yeah, that shoots you up into the stratosphere.

934
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,380
- I saw your computer freeze.

935
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,500
- See, that's another downhill moment.

936
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,260
- You said hit a pebble and you just went,

937
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,500
you could've just hit a pebble.

938
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,220
(laughing)

939
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,740
- Yep, it's all downhill, nevermind.

940
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,620
It doesn't get picked up on my end at all,

941
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,460
but it sounded really funny.

942
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,360
- Yeah, my computer does that sometimes.

943
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,200
- Yeah.

944
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,020
- So it's pretty funny.

945
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,020
- Yeah, I don't know what it is.

946
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,940
It's like, for some reason my computer will just like stall.

947
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,180
- It's the government trying to access your files.

948
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,020
- It's true.

949
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,340
- Nerd alert. - That's what it is.

950
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,700
- I'm gonna close my ears while you guys

951
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,020
talk about computers.

952
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,260
- Okay.

953
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,820
Well now that Caleb's ears are closed.

954
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,020
- Yeah, we can finally talk about cool stuff.

955
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,500
- Yep, spider.

956
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,500
- Yeah.

957
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,340
(screams)

958
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,180
(laughs)

959
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,100
- I knew he was listening.

960
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,100
Sorry, I can't help it. I was worried that you guys might talk about spiders.

961
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:59,180
I don't like bugs, dude. Yeah, I was talking about the spider right behind you! No! Are you serious?

962
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:04,700
You're kidding. Yeah. Okay, now hit him in the back of the head. Oh, sorry. Oh, turn back around.

963
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:12,540
I don't like spiders. A lot of times I'll have dreams that there's a spider on my face.

964
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:16,460
Yeah? Yeah, and then I'll wake up and I'll be slapping myself in the face.

965
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,540
like a stooge. When I was living with my parents I woke up to like a spider

966
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,460
hanging in front of me. I mean just get it over with and put it in your mouth at that point.

967
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,020
Dude I woke up like I woke up and the spider was right there I just woke up and

968
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:36,300

969
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:42,900
recluse that I like just I just went ah! I just punched it. Nice. And then it just I

970
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,920
I think it just ended up in my bed because I punched it and I had to like I just squirmed

971
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,920
at a bed.

972
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,920
It sucked.

973
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,320
I do not fuck with spiders at all dude.

974
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,320
I don't know.

975
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,560
My uncle, my ghost hunting uncle had a tarantula when I was growing up and he was just...

976
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,960
I used to be scared of tarantulas.

977
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
I'm so sorry.

978
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,920
You just like bring it around the house.

979
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,560
But he was like, I can't let it go because it'll like just like hide somewhere in the

980
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
house.

981
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,560
Yeah, that's what I...

982
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,560
That's my biggest fear.

983
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,500
afraid of tarantulas like when I was in like elementary school and then they like

984
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,700
did that thing where they bring animals to like the after-school program yeah

985
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,060
and they brought like a tarantula and they were showing it and they're like

986
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:23,020
yeah well like just so you know like everybody knows tarantulas if they try

987
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:26,380
to climb they can like climb walls or something but if they try to climb glass

988
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,300
they'll just slip and die and they don't know the difference and I was like okay

989
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,100
these I'm not scared anymore I just close the window you had to have the

990
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:40,060
realization that a bug is stupid yeah okay what tarantula looks devilishly

991
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:46,260
intelligent oh you're sure yeah it's a very it's why I like third grader or

992
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,940
something a tarantula looks like something that will follow you home it's

993
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,620
got a bunch of eyes you know how many glasses you can put on those eyes

994
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:55,500
exactly how I knew it was just a killing machine though mm-hmm

995
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:02,300
that's true exactly yeah I I just I don't I don't anything that I don't like

Would you let me apologize or would you scream at me?
