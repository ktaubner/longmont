1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,160

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,440
- You guys, I got a couple of recipes

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,200
for alcoholic beef stew.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,480
I got a few people, I put out the bat signal,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,000
the stew signal, I put it out.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
I got a couple things, somebody told me

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,460
to put powdered alcohol in it, and I got too scared.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,300
but you didn't you got to scared you didn't do it. Well, no, I read you about

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,440
it. I read things about people getting sent to the hospital for consuming

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,140
powdered alcohol. Well, they probably weren't consuming it cut with beef. Did

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,580
we already talk about we're going to we're going to booth the beef stew? We're

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,100
going to say that yeah, because then it yeah, yeah, it'll be stronger. You get

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,060
more of the beef flavor. He's the

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,460
no, but I got a we all wear gym short. We

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,260
and then a good idea and then we get in a jumping competition with yeah. That's

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,800
a good idea. I'm actually in a mattress. Oh my God, a big funnel, a big funnel of

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,660
our but we should go to a mattress to go to a mattresses and more or whatever we

21
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,840
believe is for move the beef stew and then we have a jumping competition on a

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,260
bed and see who leaks more beef yeah wow.

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,080
I was told to just put Guinness in at the end of the beef in the bow. That's

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,400
we're not alcoholic enough. Yeah, that's very low. I can't even think about we

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,540
are doing all right. Let's not I can't even think about this because yeah,

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,980
we're not what we're going to be talking about. You started Jupiter. It's

27
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,840
Jupiter today and you started with beef.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,180
I got beef y'all boofed beef. First thing you know, as beef man, this is

29
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,780
actually hurting me so badly. What's beef guys? I'm sorry.

30
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,500
What's wrong?

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,220
It's just that fucking Ethan and Hassan are fucking fighting. Oh, bro. They're

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,620
writing man. It's over political differences. I heard that I heard

33
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,120
sleep. I mean I heard that Hassan was begging Ethan to go back on what he

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,420
said. Really? And I heard that Ethan said that I'm gonna say what I said.

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,180
Yeah, I said what I said. I meant what I meant. An elephant's word is

36
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,180
100%. That's what he said. That's what he said. Straight the fuck up.

37
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,060
He said that shit. He should have said a teddy's word. He stood on

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,060
business. He should have said a teddy's word is 100% because of his

39
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,900
that is an intrusive thought I had. I was trying to fall asleep and I thought

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,320
probably a thousand times in a row, just he's standing on business over and over

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,960
for no reason. Guys, this is my new favorite thing to say. Y'all standing on

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,420
me. I'm literally looking at guys who are at sitting at bus stops, looking at

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,440
them and thinking brainily. He's standing on standing up and I swear to God I was

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,280
trying to fall asleep and that was keeping me awake. What genius came up

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,440
with stood on where it is who said that recently the best shit I ever heard man.

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,920
I just heard Noah say at one time Noah is the filter of which I get like all like

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,080
teenage lingo from. And Noah said, he said something about, did he stand on bidness,

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,240
talking about our friend Chad, like making mac and cheese or something. He was like,

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,800
he stood on bidness when he made that mac and cheese. And I was like, I don't know what

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,680
you said, man, but I'm going to say that every day for the rest of my life.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,160
Yeah. I can hear Noah in his room sometimes just watching. It's just like I can hear a

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,760
million tic talks per minute, just like yeah, like I can hear the scroll like

it doesn't go. That's how fast he's watching him three times. He's pumping.

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,520
That's how

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,120
it's like. It's like sending the mail tube. Yeah, he's got a vacuum tube with

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,400
different phones that go into his room. I need to be shrunk down and sent in. Oh

Now that he's now that he's persona non grata. I can say this story guys. One

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,020
time I was at a bar, my friend Xavier walks in says there's a milf at this

86
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,800
bar. I want to have sex with a milf. I go dude. I fucking love milfs. Let me

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,460
see the milf. We walk outside. He points at a woman says there's the milf and

88
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,680
brace belt and says what are you guys doing? I said we're looking for a milf

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,820
and Andrew Callahan sitting right next to him and he says

90
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:32,040
and then Xavier says man that with the milf is Andrew Callahan's

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,860
and then I guess he told people that he wanted to fight me later. Yep

92
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,480
Oh, that feels good to get off my chest.

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,180
Yeah, that was two years ago.

94
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,580
That was two years ago.

95
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,180
Is that the first time we've ever done?

96
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,180
That was the day we got back from North Carolina.

97
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,180
That was the first, that was literally like after we got off the plane,

98
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,280
after we recorded with Uncle Matt for the first time.

99
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,180
And he's a big guy, dude.

100
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180

Uncle Matt, we put Andrew and Uncle Matt in a ring together.

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,380
Look at Uncle Matt, just hear him.

107
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,680

161
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,180
who stood who stood on business the most in the Harry Potter movie.

162
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,940
Ron Weasley, Ron or Dudley feel like it's got to be snake Dudley was

163
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,440
talking was Dudley was a bitch bro. Dudley became a hero at the end. He

164
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,280
became no, he did not, but okay, not a great in a story. He was did not become

165
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,320
a hero at the end and also he did not stand on business. The most he did not

166
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,760
sit on business. He maybe did one or two times near the end. He made a fucking

167
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,320
squealing pig. Maybe at the end he maybe became certified. He became certified

168
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,520
for sure certified definitely became certified. Stay, but stood on this more

169
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,400
than anybody in every single Harry Potter. Move actually right. It was

170
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
fucking snape snape sure he's on business like no other man. So he

171
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
popped in Voldemort. He popped his O. G. He's

172
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,840
he stood on business because he got broken by Harry Potter's mom. He was so

173
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,040
in love with her. He wanted to know he's heartbroken, you know, heartbroken,

174
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,720
that he stood on some within he came back and you're so bad. I've become Mr.

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,640
Potter. I've become Sigma.

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,840
I've become sick, but can you imagine those snape completely trying to hit on

177
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,560
if you're a girl and Snape is coming up to you and he's like, "Oh, you should come over.

178
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,720
We'll watch Netflix tonight." "Show me your butt." "We can watch Harry Potter." "We can

179
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,880
Netflix and chill if you know what I mean." "Show me your butthole." No, you don't say

180
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,200
that again. "Show me your butt." He wouldn't say, "Show me your butt." "Butt-over, cadaver."

181
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,000
He's texting her and he's texting her a picture of two little baby pandas or something and

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,880
he's like, "This is us. This is so us." "That is you and me." "This is completely us." It's

183
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,980
forgive for the penguin with its yeah

184
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,880
that is he made to any man who tries to talk to you prove it.

185
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:30,620
I'm glad he died. Personally, yeah, he was kind of a creep. I hear yeah. Well,

186
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,700
he literally made evil potions, but yeah, that was his job at. It's not much

187
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,900
of an excuse to be into the dark arts to do it to defend one child. The dark

188
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,640
arts is the teacher that they rotated out every year because of yes things

189
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,480
happening. Yes, kind of a stupid that writing kind of stupid writing. Why?

190
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:56,360
Because it's gay and that's on BD. Not on BD is not the same as business man. You

191
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,160
can't say BD dude. Harry Potter is gay and that's on business. There we go, that's

192
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,760
better. Yeah, there we go. You can say that. Yeah. BD I think is a gang related

193
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,360
thing. Oh heavens. Yeah, you don't want any. Oh me? I don't want to say that. I

194
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,560
I want to say on BD then unless BD is a bull Durham,

195
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,480
my favorite movie.

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,320
What the fuck is a bull Durham? It's a movie about baseball.

197
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,160
Okay, not my favorite movie. I'm more of an angel than an outfield kind of guy.

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,920
I was trying to be the most honky I could be. All right, y'all, Jupiter.

199
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,600
Jupiter, man. We have been distracted. You know what? Let's start with the

200
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,200
outfits. Let's start with the outfits. Okay. So me, I got the Jupiter

201
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,520
coloration. I know it's a little more saturated than Jupiter actually is, but

202
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,180
some of the pictures you'll see it's got this kind of deep orangish color with

203
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,780
the lighter stuff interspersed and it's got the important part about Jupiter,

204
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,020
it's got clouds and stuff, so I feel like I got the clouds going on. Yeah,

205
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,940
you got red. And then up here, I got the great red spot, which we'll learn

206
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,500
about, I'm sure. Oh, yeah, I'm looking forward to that. But I got the red

207
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,660
spot up on top of the hat. And your bike's a red spot as well. That's two,

208
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,700
I got two red spots on them. You probably didn't even need the hat. Double

209
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,420
Jupiter, Jupiter. Yeah, Double Jupiter, that's a good... Jupiter, Jupiter. That'd

210
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,020
be a cool name for something. Then I have this Jupiter kind of style shirt.

211
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,140
If this was all blended together... This is a good Jupiter shirt. This is a

212
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,620
This is all blended together.

213
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,060
Jupiter, I mean, it does.

214
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,180
That's the pattern.

215
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,660
And then this is supposed to be the dot.

216
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,540
I thought that the dot was more orange, but then I got beige pants on and then.

217
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,180
Blue shoes on blue shoes on man.

218
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
You are.

219
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,700
Let me let you just you gave him the Sharon Stone, man.

220
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,780
It's crazy.

221
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,740
Holy Sharon Stone.

222
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,460
That was a new type of Sharon Stone.

223
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,100
That was like doing that in the movie.

224
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,500
but she like she's on one of these chairs in her butt. Keep what I saw was like if

225
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,340
Sharon Stone was hatching out of an egg in that movie,

226
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,740
like she was like pressing against the membrane. Nobody does nobody's rock.

227
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,480
Nobody fucks with how come the camel toe gets so much so much beloving love, but

228
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,220
nobody loves moose knuckle no more. Who is who's rocking with camel toe? I love

229
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,300
fucking camels. I'll do girl. Every guy's love camel toes. I don't know any

230
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,700
guy that's like I'm and you're hanging with the wrong crowd. If you're if your

231
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,580
circle is not

232
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:14,240
moose knuckle knuckle but but toe but toe but toe but toe sea urchin. We call

233
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,580

234
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:22,100
the but the butthole camel toe is the sea urchin sea urchin is crazy. Wow but

235
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,900
the whole sea urchin is crazy. It is. That's crazy. That's so gross. Shut up

236
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,260
bitch. That is so because it's a hairy spiky object is that it's got a

237
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,620
seeing that on a but I seen him. You see no sea urchin. I seen him all

238
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,380
way around.

239
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,660
Let me walk you through my outfit. Okay, okay,

240
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,500
brown hat.

241
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,780
What's that?

242
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,020
For some of the brown, it's on the

243
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:55,540
cream. Perfect. I would say perfect to Jupiter colored hoodie, right? Yeah, I

244
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,840
got some green same green pants. There's a little bit of green in the Jupiter

245
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,140
thing. In the photo I saw, the photo I used as a reference for my painting,

246
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,240
which we'll get to later, and brown shoes. And guys, there's another layer

247
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,740
to this. Well, there's two layers. Is it the round spot of your head? No.

248
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,280
Your red head? No, no, no, there's actually many layers. I don't have a

249
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,740
red head. I'm pink, if anything. If any colour, I'm pink. I have a round,

250
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,080
bald head, which reminds you of a planet, especially because of its size.

251
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,600
but then also I take this off. Oh my God, I would eat high die. But wait guys,

252
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,960
guess what I made in this shirt the other day. Let me get spaghetti sauce

253
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,160
and guess what it gave me a red spot. A red spot. A red spot. Wow. Got the

254
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,720
red dot, make your head high. Holy shit. I feel like we killed it. I feel

255
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,200
like you guys killed it a little more than me. I feel like we all killed

256
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,680
it a little. I think you have been on some shit lately.

257
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,880
you've been on one you've been crushing it. So we have a kind of representing

258
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,120
different aspects of the of different colors. You can see if you search images

259
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,660
of Jupiter. Yeah, if you look up Jupiter color palette like I did, if you're

260
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,240
seeing one that's about that's teaching kids about planets, you're gonna see

261
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,400
something that looks more like me, orange and red. Yeah, but for the real adult

262
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,520
scientists who don't need bright colors to care about the planet, it's the

263
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,000
pastel. Who is the most looking like Jupiter? Subscribe in the comments down

264

below, subscribe below, subscribe below and let us know. I'm loving our energy

265
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,300
We are on one. Yeah, we are on one. I have this kind of, I got, I went today to Middle Village

266
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,860
Bagels. Oh, that's nice. And I got an egg bagel, which is, I found out when I, I got a bacon,

267
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,700
egg and cheese, and cream cheese on an egg bagel. I found out an egg bagel is more of

268
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,100
a dessert style bagel that tastes like a donut. Not a bad move though. It was good, but it

269
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,460
was a bit of a slap in the face. Yeah. And I got some Italian wedding soup, guys. And

270
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,220
I was eating the Italian wedding soup with the tiny little meatballs. And I was thinking,

271
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,020
Dude, these meatballs might as well be planets.

272
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
- They look like Jupiter.

273
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,980
- And these tiny pieces of couscous.

274
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,380
- Planets have been everywhere lately.

275
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,860
- These might as well be fucking stars.

276
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,980
And the vegetables could be a vegetable that's flying around.

277
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,660
- A space vegetable, space veggie.

278
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,900
- 'Cause we don't know.

279
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,220
There's so many mysteries in the cosmos.

280
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,220
- Imagine the type of vegetable that would grow on Jupiter.

281
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,900
- Should I go ahead and do the Jupiter planet report?

282
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,740
Are we ready?

283
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,900
- Yeah, I'm ready.

284
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,340
- All right, I need to see this.

285
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,660
I need to hear this.

286
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,600
Join us once again on a five week galactic journey through our solar

287
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,120
system.

288
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,160
Be prepared to learn and to laugh a little too.

289
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,480
And now the Planet Report with Cameron Fetter.

290
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,820
So I changed the background music this time 'cause somebody in the comments

291
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,020
last time said that it made them, always made them think the episode was over

292
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,660
because it is the outro music, which I guess makes a lot of sense when I

293
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,260
think about it. I can make you a new song. Well, I made one for myself.

294
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,900
I think the episode is only people, but I think the episodes fifteen minutes. I

295
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,100
made a new planet song for you and this one's on the last time I did poetry.

296
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,060
This one is more a little more comedic, so if you could imagine I mean, if maybe

297
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,660
if we had the resources I could be standing, you can imagine me standing up

298
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,340
with a red curtain and a microphone. We can hold a pause right now. Let me get

299
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,580
you a mic to hold. I can just stand up and hold this one. I guess it's the

300
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,980
camera that's the problem. All right, we can yeah, I'll change the camera and

301
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,720
and yeah and then I'll get the red curtain from over there. You keep talking okay.

302
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,320
Well

303
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,820
okay, here I'll just say something funny that I thought of yesterday. Well, this

304
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,020
all happens. I was having Sam. We're talking about something yesterday. I

305
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,120
thought it'd be really funny. If you lived in like a

306
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,520
to just a normal two bedroom apartment like in in Brooklyn, but you had a

307
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,020
butler and the but let's you in one bedroom and the butler lives in the

308
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
another bedroom

309
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,420
like he might as well just be your roommate.

310
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,220
Okay, are you guys ready?

311
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,820
Okay, hold on. Let me play this new music

312
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,620
and this is kind of sci-fi type music.

313
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,720
Okay.

314
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
All right, I'm going to go.

315
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,420
All right,

316
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,020
the joy of Jupiter a planet report.

317
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,820
Jupiter is by far the largest planet in our solar system.

318
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,620
That is if you don't count planet Lizzo

319
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,880
(laughing)

320
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,720
- Okay.

321
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,260
- One year on Jupiter is the equivalent

322
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,580
of almost 12 years on Earth,

323
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,540
or roughly the time it takes my girlfriend

324
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,740
to get ready to go out.

325
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,660
Jupiter is composed almost entirely of gas,

326
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,120
much like the day after I get Taco Bell.

327
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,220
Its core could be either liquid or solid,

328
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,660
much like my shit the day after I get Taco Bell.

329
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,500
(laughing)

330
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,340
- Oh damn.

331
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,100
Holy shit.

332
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,500
- Jupiter's surface is made up of many cloud systems

333
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,940
and vapors. And for all you stoners out there who just perked up, these gases would be toxic

334
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,460
for humans. Although I guess that's never stopped a druggie from chasing a high. So let

335
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,100
me just make it extra clear for all you degenerate dopers out there. There are no Doritos on

336
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:57,640
Jupiter. Thank you. Thank you. One of the most interesting features of Jupiter is its

337
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:05,400
red spot. Sounds like somebody needs a tampon. The red spot is actually a raging storm that's

338
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,140
gone and been going on for hundreds of years. Reminds me of the weather when I want to go

339
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:16,980
outside and play. Jupiter has a very cold exterior, but it gets warmer the deeper you go, like

340
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:24,300
a butthole. Jupiter is named after the Roman king of the gods because yeah, somehow gods

341
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,180
weren't powerful enough. We need a God that's also a king.

342
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:33,740
Yeah, I was waiting for the clap. It's the end of the paragraph.

343
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,500
Yeah, there are 95 confirmed moons orbiting Jupiter. Don't

344
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,140
let Buzz Aldrin find that out or he'll kill himself.

345
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:54,020
Let's talk about EO Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. And no,

346
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,400
Those aren't the names of Angelina Jolie's children.

347
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,840
Those are the four Galilean moons of Jupiter, more massive than the others.

348
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,540
They were discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei,

349
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,420
who takes his name from the famous dinner gibberish scene from Billy Madison.

350
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,620
Europa, the Galilean moon, second closest to Jupiter,

351
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,220
may have a water ocean underneath its surface,

352
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,720
which means it could conceivably be home to extraterrestrial life.

353
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,080
Wow, how exciting said nobody ever.

354
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,200
It's often been said, and this is the conclusion.

355
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,660
This is where I get kind of real.

356
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:28,960
OK.

357
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,080
It's often been said that girls go to college

358
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,300
to get more knowledge and boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider.

359
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,500
But with modern science, we know the truth.

360
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,720
It's actually girls that go to Jupiter to get more stupider

361
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,400
and boys go to the planet report to get more handsome and smart.

362
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,080
Cameron Fetter, everybody. That's today's Planet Report. That was amazing.

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,160
Yeah, I'll put the camera back. I feel like you,

364
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,320
I feel I feel like you really figured out a lane for yourself.

365
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,600
Yeah, I think that we should just have you do different kind of reports

366
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,800
every episode. I'm really liking writing the reports and thinking of my ideas

367
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,720
for the reports. Yeah, I think y'all ain't ready for Saturn either.

368
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
Oh, my God. I'm excited for Saturn.

369
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,200
I'll say that much. I'm so excited for Saturn.

370
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,320
It's just incredible to me to be able to make people laugh while also teaching

371
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,320
giving them a factor to about the great spheres and that's the best part about

372
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,360
this. I could see you taking a kind of role as a bill nye style science

373
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,000
educator or beekman kind of vsauce veritasium

374
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,120
fuck bro beekman is my I don't know. Beekman is that a bird and beekman is

375
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,880
not a bird. We've told you we've schooled you on beekman before school.

376
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,960
We schooled you on young boy. We

377
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,420
Beakman hundred percent stood up. Who the hell is Beakman Beakman stood on

378
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,020
business Beakman man Beakman from Beakman's world is he he has so he has

379
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,060
his own world. He was a scientist scientist don't have their own world. He

380
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,740
had a world where he taught people educational things and he had a big

381
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,380
haircut

382
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,900
Beakman big haircut. He had a big haircut. Yeah,

383
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:18,020
that sounded like a piece of cardboard falling over. Oh God,

384
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,520
(laughter)

385
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,020
Why did I do that?

386
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh God, it smells so bad.

387
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,260
I need to hail all of it before you smell it.

388
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,500
(sniffing)

389
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,380
- That really was a crazy sounding fart.

390
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
- Well it hit the metal chair.

391
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,220
- I know.

392
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,060
- That was a school fart.

393
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,220
- Yeah, that was, Jesus Christ.

394
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,060
- Yeah.

395
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
- Oh my God.

396
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,220
I'm starting to smell it.

397
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,600
- Yeah, it's not good.

398
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,820
- I'm gonna work on not smelling it.

399
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,660
- Yeah, you should work on that.

400
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,860
- I'm gonna do my best to not smell it.

401
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,660
- But I think that you should have your own show

402
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,460
where you tell people because that was really well done. Thank you. You like

403
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,420
the jokes. I feel like adding humour to it almost made it funny. Yeah, yeah, it

404
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,820
makes and the thing is it gets people's attention. It disarms people because

405
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,500
right, you think you start telling talking people about science. I

406
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,820
experience this a lot. I started talking to people. Get away from me. You're

407
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,380
like, oh, I don't know. Oh, you think you're better than me? You're going to

408
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,340
talk to me about science and mathematics. You're a scientist. Fuck you. And then

409
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,740
I do, but I say, you know, I'm talking about math and I say, yeah, why six

410
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,280
afraid of seven. Why? Because seven, eight, nine. It's true. Seven, eight, nine. It's true.

411
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,280
And then they're learning the numbers and they're laughing. Yeah. Yeah, they're learning

412
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,440
about the sequential order of the numbers. Yeah. But you brought up a good point, which

413
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,720
is that girls go to Jupiter to get more stupid or boys go to college. You know what I thought

414
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:38,640
you were going to say? Nowadays, girls go to OnlyFans to get more money bands. And guys

415
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,120
Boys go to Andrew Tate to learn about what's right.

416
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Scams we hate.

417
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Yes.

418
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Yeah.

419
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah.

420
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
To learn about scams we hate.

421
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Uh huh.

422
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Uh huh.

423
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Is that what he does?

424
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
He talks about scams he doesn't like.

425
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
He debunks scams.

426
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,680
Boys go to Baldur's Gate.

427
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Yeah.

428
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
To get more bald and straight.

429
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Bald and straight.

430
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Yeah.

431
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
That works.

432
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
That makes sense.

433
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Yeah.

434
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
It's simple as, man.

435
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
It is simple as.

436
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,240
It's simple as man. It is simple as that is. What do you guys think about living

437
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,280
with a one roommate who's a butler?

438
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,440
I could see that.

439
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,020
And you get home and you're like, there's like, there's dust all, he

440
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,880
hasn't been dusting with his feather duster and you can hear him in his room

441
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,320
and he's playing Overwatch. I mean, I live with my wife. You guys live with

442
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,480
your girlfriends, we already live this reality. Yeah, living with a butler. I

443
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,220
already live with a fucking butler. Yeah. Actually, my wife lives with a butler.

444
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm the butler in my house, unfortunately.

445
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,780
I hate to say it, I'm the butler.

446
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,720
- I do know that about you.

447
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,640
- I'm a complete butler.

448
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,560
I have a checklist every day. - Your wife has a real job.

449
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
- I have to vacuum the carpets,

450
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,440
because to get all the dog hair off,

451
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,120
I have to pretend that the dog was never on the couch.

452
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,960
I have to do all sorts of crazy covering up

453
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,440
to make sure that she doesn't,

454
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,960
I have to get rid of every stain

455
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,980
from when he chewed a bone on the couch.

456
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,880
And I have to do the dishes every day before she gets home,

457
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,160
or else she gets home and she--

458
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,000
- Hits you?

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,480
- Well, no, she just kinda-- - She won't pay you?

460
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,780
so he starts crocheting and kind of a weird mean way. You have kind of like an

461
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,200
Andy Cap and his wife kind of relationship where she's always chasing you around

462
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,140
with a rolling pin. Andy Cap is a chip, bro. Andy Cap was a cartoon before it

463
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,280
was a chip. You just blew my fucking noodle.

464
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,840
He thinks that were my noodle is in orbit. Your noodle is going around Jupiter.

465
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,400
My noodle is- Is that what a chiptune is? Whoa. Holy shit. A cartoon that became

466
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,340
a chip. He's the original chiptune. Or, well, but also, in another way,

467
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,580
he was a chip. What was Pringle?

468
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:41,520
What was you never like this? You never ever watch Pringle is a show on it was

469
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,900
on ABC family, but it was only runs. I actually remember that and it's a who

470
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,040
can do it. Pringle can yeah, I remember that shit yeah. That was the theme song

471
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,760
there was okay. There was speaking of actual potato cartoon.

472
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,160
There was a Mr. Potato Head show in the nineties that I used to watch and I

473
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
It feels like a dream.

474
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Like that and then like we've

475
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Oh and Timmy the Tooth.

476
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Do you ever watch Timmy the Tooth?

477
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
You'd be pulling out these

478
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
TV shows never heard of.

479
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
I was so obsessed with

480
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
puppetry as a kid. I was so obsessed with puppets

481
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
that if anything had a puppet in it

482
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
I would watch it. So what you liked

483
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
these politicians?

484
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
God damn.

485
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
We're on fire today.

486
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
What the fuck is up with me today? We are going nuts.

487
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,800
guts. Holy oh my God, you know this is dude. It's the it's the it was the

488
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,000
Andrew Callahan story. It put me it put me completely on fire did it gives you a

489
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
special boost to say something you shouldn't say a gossip, say something

490
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,360
that yeah being to be I would say over we one percent gossip about just a

491
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,920
pretty standard misunderstanding. Yeah, standard, miss already walking it back.

492
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,160
So

493
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,320
yeah, no, he's actually a good

494
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,440
standard misunderstanding. Well, speaking of stories

495
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,240
today,

496
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,480
there's a new Jupiter based track

497
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
by OJ the alien.

498
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,560
Who's OJ the alien?

499
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,240
We mean Dr. Dazzle? Oh, he was that guy on that Dr. Dazzle track last week.

500
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,640
Oh, I remember him. Yeah, he's yeah. Yes, I was bodied on my own. He was

501
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,440
bodied on his own track. He got renegade. It's not me. It's not me. I feel I feel

502
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,080
bad about that, but I heard Dr. Dazzle does not care. I remember that. He does

503
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,600
like the hook or something on that Dr. Dazzle song. I feel bad for OJ the Alien

504
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,520
because I mostly and then he made two other Dr. Dazzle songs that didn't have

505
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:44,120
Dr. Dazzle on. Well, there's one there's one OJ the Alien song today that is

506
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,120
actually a harrowing tale and I think that we need to listen to it. I'm sorry

507
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,000
to bring the mood down, but there is a very harrowing. All right, let's hear it

508
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,520
from tail. You can check all these songs out on the lyrics master on. Yeah, go on

509
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,960
YouTube and just search the way this one's unlisted. Well, they'll they'll

510
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,560
become listed. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm trying to remember what this

511
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:14,960
is a cover rip. What is this of again? You'll see. Oh, this is okay. I remember

512
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,320
now. Actually, I completely let's listen. Let's listen.

513
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,520
This is Dance with the Grouperter.

514
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,320
Oh my God.

515
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,480
I once knew this boy and his name was Grouperter

516
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,800
His main concern was getting real stupider His mom raised him on the streets of Jupiter

517
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,520
He hated his moms, he would always go poop on her

518
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,840
He never ate limes, lemons, or clementines All he did was jack up all the time

519
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,320
Addicted to jacking and he never ate limes By the way, he did lots of crimes

520
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,520
One of them was his hatred for limes He hated all fruit, especially clementines

521
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,160
He hated rap too, he hated my dope rhymes

522
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,720
Hated dope shit like fruit and Adventure Time

523
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,440
He just jacked off, he was addicted to gooning

524
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,000
Jacked so much that his dick was ballooning

525
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,640
He'd sit in his room, holler and hooting

526
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,360
And then one day, he did a homeschool shooting

527
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,080
Shot up his house with a gun called a Baus

528
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,560
Alien gun, if bullets are a mouse

529
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,280
But anyway, back to the story

530
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,080
He didn't eat fruit, so he got the scurvy

531
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,560
That's when his life got all topsy turvy

532
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,200
It made him insane, all up in his brain

533
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,800
Also Jupiter has helium rain

534
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,480
Oops my bad, got distracted again

535
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,080
He shot up his house and the new Aubon pain

536
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,920
Was a massacre, employees were slain

537
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,440
He shot a guy in his left gastric vein

538
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,160
Then robbed his dead body, he took his gold chain

539
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,880
Made his escape on a passenger train

540
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,400
Then he hid in a new Aubon pain

541
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,120
A different one from the one with the shooting

542
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,800
And when he got there, he started gooning

543
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,960
The cop shot him.

544
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,560
I can still hear him mooing.

545
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,100
When he died, he started mooing.

546
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,460
It fucks me up.

547
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,840
Why'd he start mooing?

548
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,000
This is all true.

549
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm not just poo pooing.

550
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,160
This happened to a guy I knew when I was schooling.

551
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,140
Eat your fruit.

552
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Eat your fruit, y'all.

553
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,000
It's OJ the alien.

554
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,800
Signing off.

555
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,360
Peace.

556
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,860
Wow.

557
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,040
Oh my God.

558
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,040
It's a cautionary tale about fruit.

559
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,040
But also it does feel like Dr. Dazzle somehow...

560
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
I think Dr. Dazzle is more of a pop artist.

561
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Dr. Dazzle like changed...

562
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,040
He like... OJ had to switch it up after the Dr. Dazzle thing.

563
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Like OJ made him reconsider his entire life.

564
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
I think he became more conscious.

565
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:46,040
And he's still doing the thing where he makes up a word to rhyme and then explains what that word is.

566
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,200
it's an alien. It's different kind of things. Explain the culture. Yeah,

567
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,520
you have to explain it's called bullets are a mouth as bullets about shoots

568
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,480
mouses, mice, mice, mice, a bow. So it's bullets are a mouse. It's a mouse

569
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,900
that you put in and then it deteriorates the mouse and turns into bullets.

570
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,820
When it comes out, it's actually very scary technology that doesn't make any

571
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,600
sense. You just shoot a mice. Why shoot a mouse? A mouse? Why does it? Why

572
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,760
does it have to turn it? Are a mouse? The bullet, the clip is a mouse. Oh,

573
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,680
the clip at the mag is it just didn't rhyme look. This is you can also this all

574
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,300
stuff you can take up with OJ the alien on maybe his genius video. That's going

575
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,920
to drop soon.

576
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,460
Is he going to do one? Maybe that's a good idea. Maybe there's an OJ the alien

577
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,940
great. I can't wait. I honestly can't wait for when this album drops in the

578
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:40,260
press cycle. Just when OJ is going on interviews and stuff. When Nardwar yeah,

579
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,500
but did you hear the Fallon performance? Did you hear the twist ending in that

580
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,500
- Not really, man. - He knew him?

581
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
- It was his brother.

582
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,620
'Cause he was homeschooled.

583
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,260
- I'll say that a guy I knew when I was schooling.

584
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,020
- Well, you don't necessarily get homeschooled

585
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,860
with your brother.

586
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,940
- It's his twin brother.

587
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,020
- I like the dance with the devil twist a little more,

588
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,860
I'm gonna be honest.

589
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,380
- Yeah, I was expecting something crazy

590
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,220
at the end of that one.

591
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,860
- You should've just made him fuck his mom.

592
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,820
- I did have an audio clip that says,

593
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,580
"And he fucked his mom too."

594
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,060
It was supposed to go at the end, yeah.

595
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,280
- But you did?

596
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,460
- I can always put it in, I mean, I got a day,

597
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,100
I had a day before this comes out.

598
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,420
- True, yeah, you can change that.

599
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,020
- I can change it.

600
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,020
- But that's not the one you wanted me on, bro?

601
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,860
- No.

602
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,140
- Even though you know that I have that kind of ability?

603
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,900
- I made that beat and I was thinking

604
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,660
maybe Caleb should hop on this.

605
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,020
Maybe Caleb should hop on this.

606
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,660
Maybe there's still time for--

607
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,940
- Do we think we're gonna see a return

608
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,060
from Dr. Dazzle at all?

609
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,420
- The people are clamoring.

610
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,700
- Maybe, maybe there's another one.

611
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,700
I think that there's a beat in the future

612
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,300
for Dr. Dazzle that I made that I think I already showed you.

613
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,660
I want a full doctor dazzle rap album. Now, I think that I showed Dr.

614
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,100
Dazzle

615
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,300
every week.

616
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:55,660
It's fun to wrap it. So I'm having so much fun. This is the most

617
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:01,100
to do a song like this. Every single song is such a great idea. Every

618
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,700
episode that and then we just use it as the outro music every time. Yeah,

619
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,260
and also listen to it to a well over fifteen times in the middle of the

620
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,300
show. We could do like the like sway. We could be like, hold on, run that

621
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,420
get back and then hit like the explosion. That's like you know if we're doing if

622
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,740
we're doing say we do like for example on our OSHA episode, we could have just

623
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,660
done a bun a song about OSHA yeah. Every topic we have we just do a song about

624
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,620
it. We got to make a full album out every episode yeah. Why not make an

625
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,540
album every episode? That's a good episode listening to what I you know

626
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,980
what I heard recently do what little Wayne when he goes and he does an

627
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,900
album or not an album. He goes into the studio and he records for a night. He

628
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,200
he does like eighty songs every single time. Yeah, I was like I can do one song

629
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,680
a fucking day, yeah, seven songs a week. Funny, I love, I love whenever they do

630
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:46,900
like

631
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,020
like it's like there's someone's writing an article about a new album that's

632
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,260
coming out and like the it's not even the artist who's saying it, but there's

633
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,740
like apparently like yeah, this person wrote one hundred and twenty songs for

634
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,460
this album and it's funny because you know that those songs are all it's like

635
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,940
there it's like eight second long yeah,

636
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,100
and that's all there is. That counts as writing a song that you cut from the album.

637
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,340
I have a million beats on my computer that I just don't touch. You don't have a

638
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,700
million beats. I got so many in there. You probably have. You have a billion

639
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,500
beats. I would say you have 17 beats. I think it's more like 23. 23 beats.

640
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,060
That's basically a million. 23 things that I started and then maybe finished.

641
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,300
A lot of it is... Wait, that's a great name for the compilation album.

642
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,060
Of the 23 things I started. Whoa. And it's a photo of me like this. Yeah.

643
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:38,040
J Dilla Donuts cover. Yeah. You laughing into your hand. Yeah. Damn. Wow. It's a

644
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,640
good idea. That is a good idea. I've got a beat for Dr. Dazzo and I've got a

645
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,540
beat, maybe, maybe OJ the Alien is gonna step back and just only do production.

646
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,900
Dude, people need your... Alchemist style. People need your bars, bro. Alchemist

647
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,180
raps. Oh, he does? Yeah, dude. Oh, then maybe he actually has to become more

648
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:02,580
like the alchemist you. I think that you have historically been the worst

649
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,480
rapper on the show and it's not even close. Like you, you've always been

650
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,540
really, really terrible and I'm still seeing kind of shades of that in the way

651
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,940
that you write these raps, but

652
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,520
the end product so far, everyone has been a banger. It's sublime. You are, you

653
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,500
are, you are levelling up your rapping ability in my way, in a way I never has

654
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,700
better. In a way I never ever thought that was. I thought that you had a brain that was

655
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:34,940
wired wrong for rap. I thought you had a rock only brain. It is and I'm being trained. Neuroplasticity

656
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,880
man. I'm training myself to become one of the greatest rappers of all time. You really

657
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,820
are dude. If you did this, if you kept this up for like 40,000 years, you'd be really

658
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:51,340
pretty good. I think once I turn 56 or something, maybe like I could put out a full album. Yeah,

659
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
you're already putting out a full rap.

660
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,700
Well, a 56-year-old put out a full rap, like serious rap.

661
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,500
What's going to be the name?

662
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:04,580
56 years old, already had like a way already forgotten about comedy career and then you

663
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,540
put out a very serious rap album.

664
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,660
Very, very serious, like it's all about stuff that happened to me.

665
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,900
And it's just like Michael Rapaport style.

666
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,620
A Dance with the Devil song about your SNL audition.

667
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,180
That would be so fucking crazy.

668
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,020
when he fell down his shoelaces were tied together. I don't know why

669
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,100
yes. See that wasn't anything. My girlfriend this morning showed me a

670
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:34,380
tick tock that she saw on her feed. That was a guy performing a live concert,

671
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,580
and he was you could like really only hear the vocals. Mostly, I couldn't tell

672
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,180
what kind of music it was, but he was just going like this, like, pastor,

673
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,140
please, pastor, please, why are you taking off your jeans? Oh, and then all

674
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,860
the comments are like the pain in his voice. Oh, my God, and I think you

675
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,860
to do that yeah pastor, please pastor, please you taking off those he was

676
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,640
doing it partially like he was rapping, but he was also doing kind of like

677
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,220
don't know what

678
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,760
oh

679
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:06,040
there's trauma inside. You can't go in there. See when you rap about something

680
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,340
you really know, like being molested by clergyman. This is bars man. See I was

681
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,840
going to say pastor, please pass the bees. That doesn't make any sense.

682
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Nothing makes no sense at all. Yo, pastor, please pass the bees. I gotta

683
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,340
ash my tree and then I asked it for free. I do wanna hear it. Yeah, I wanna

684
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,460
hear

685
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:24,740
this.

686
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:36,340
Oh my God.

687
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,580
That's almost exactly... What was that, man? That's almost exactly what I

688
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,340
thought it was that was Hamilton crazy yeah that all the comments are like oh

689
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,020
my God, this is the saddest thing I've ever heard in my life. Is it about him?

690
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,800
Please wait

691
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,820
later, where he says like I'm only nine years old and you're fifty two wait

692
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,820
play the whole song. Okay, I gotta hear this whole thing man. Yeah, I was gonna

693
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,700
say I need to stop about is this about him being gay with the pastor, but then

694
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,420
no it's about getting molested yeah, but he doesn't make a song by being gay.

695
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,300
That could be a good balance.

696
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:39,300
[Music]

697
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,100
what

698
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,260
dude actually wait. I just had a

699
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,060
it's at a concert, we got a concert. Everyone's like

700
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:54,120
I just had a mental vision of just driving down driving down Malcolm X

701
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,940
Boulevard and an escalate just go at eight miles an hour, blasting that so

702
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,180
loud, blessing that in the drive through and like cook out to please. Why you

703
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,540
take the quarters in the cup holders are shaking

704
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,100
I did right through it cook out and you're I just get

705
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,180
yeah barbecue plate

706
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:16,400
sorry, hold on, hold on and then it fades out and then it starts playing again.

707
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,360
Hold on. I love this song turn it all the way

708
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,200
hold on. That's the best or pastor. Please, pastor, pastor, please. Why are

709
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,800
you taking off your jeans is the craziest? Why is the pastor wearing

710
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,180
g? I know that's what it's because why is he wearing jeans so funny to me that

711
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:36,000
he's a he's wearing jeans and Sunday shoes? Yeah, what the fuck is that? Hold

712
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,460
and wait kind of pastor is ways the twist ending to this one, the devil and

713
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,580
the devil and the

714
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,920
the devil or what's that song dance with the dance with the devil, the devil

715
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,340
twist there. The man is the pastor who's singing well. That would be one

716
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:57,180
saying to himself in the mirror. I did forget I was listening there at the

717
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,100
pool. I also like that he it's a it's a song where he's he's getting molested

718
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,560
yeah and he has to throw in like I thought you said that Christians

719
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,960
gonna be gay? Yeah, no. Why is he throwing that in there? I like the Eminem song about

720
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,080
being molested. Oh, so you're gay, buddy? Oh, you're molesting me. That means you're

721
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,920
gay. You can't be Christian. We're kicking you out of the church, buddy. You're gay.

722
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,200
Caught ya. Got ya. Everett, there's a camera. I'm an undercover nine-year-old. There's a

723
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,680
camera right there. It doesn't really rhyme with the other stuff well either, so you know,

724
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,960
he just like wrote, he was like, oh, this is good. I have to fit this in there. Yeah.

725
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,800
Pastor, pastor, please, why are you taking off your jeans? It's fucking crazy. I mean...

726
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,600
He bodied that. I can't lie. He bodied that shit. That sounds like Hobo Johnson.

727
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,360
Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Maybe it is. Maybe it is. Could be. Is that Hobo

728
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,640
Johnson? That's what he sounds like? Yeah. I wanted to knew it. He doesn't

729
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:50,880
speak English. My hair is too curly. Can you imagine if the forefathers of rap

730
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,200
came back to life and heard Hobo Johnson and gave him a medal? Bullshit, man.

731
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,720
No, they wouldn't give him a medal. They'd say, "Dude, you have four pillars there, but

732
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,880
you're missing the fifth one."

733
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
B-boying.

734
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
You're missing knowledge.

735
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
You're missing B-boying.

736
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,400
You're not a B-boy, straight up.

737
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,520
No. Show me a headspin right now.

738
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Right now.

739
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,520
Show me a fucking headspin.

740
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,360
What happened? How come B-boying has fallen out of vogue with our popular rappers? Roddy

741
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,040
Rich can't spin on his head.

742
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
No.

743
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,960
Can he do this, though?

744
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
He could probably do that.

745
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Most people can do that.

746
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
Bad B-boy.

747
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Bad Baby can't.

748
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960

I'm going to fucking kill playboy card. I had to say it. Well, I have to say it

770
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,300
imagine imagine how amazing the Dracula X Bobby Althoff interview would be that

771
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,560
be so amazing. I don't know. It is amazing Dracula, so the amazing can't see

772
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,560
him because you know he's being filmed and then you would set it up as a

773
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,680
mirror. Yeah, so there's mirrors in your you can't see you can't Dracula can't

774
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,120
see himself in the mirror. Yeah, well he can't see himself. He loses it. He like

775
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,200
forty five minutes and he's he's fed up. You're such a fucking bitch. You are

776
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,780
such a vied to be. Do you not know who I am? How do you not know who I am? Where

777
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
Oh, he gave up. Wait, he gotta go get Bobby.

778
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,780
Somebody's here?

779
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,780
Who the hell's at the door? Oh, God.

780
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,780
Oh, my God.

781
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,780
It's mail again, dude.

782
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Wait, maybe it's the gift card from Verizon.

783
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,780
Maybe finally.

784
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Maybe finally they sent it.

785
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,780
Because we were late on two payments, and I think that maybe that's why they didn't send us the $300 signing bonus.

786
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,780
They were holding out?

787
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,780
They were. They said that in July, and then they said, "Oh, yeah, direct deposit."

788
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,780
Is anything from Verizon?

789
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,780
No, it's for the...

790
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,780
God damn it, man.

791
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,820
I have to call them now. I have to call them and say we never got our signing

792
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,380
bonus for business Fios. I want to show you guys my painting. Bring my mood back

793
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,900
up because I'm thinking about this lost $300 gift card. I'm going to be honest,

794
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,460
last week, dude, I'm going the opposite of Cameron this week. Last week, I went

795
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:08,900
funny as crap with my paintings, trying to be fun. I mean, look at this. Remember

796
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:15,780
that I was doing more watercolor paintings in my free time and I think

797
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:21,300
that I just like painting now. Yes, that's what happened when I think it is

798
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,700
completely... This has been, it's opened up. We found passions. We have, it's the

799
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:32,780
greatest week. Oh my god! That looks just like that! Look at that paint, look at my

800
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,500
Jupiter painting. What's the black dot? That's the red dot because it's black in

801
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,000
in a photo that it's a very dark red. All right,

802
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,300
yeah, I just had a great time painting this and it had nothing to do with the

803
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,860
fact that it's my wife's birthday and I had twenty minutes to paint.

804
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:51,980
It was because I got so in love with painting looks great, but I also give

805
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,660
that to her. I'll show right. I think I'm going to paint her something beautiful

806
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,060
tonight. Yeah, it's nice. You're going to paint a picture of Phil.

807
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,760
I was going to paint a picture of you really

808
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,780
for your wife.

809
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,280
I

810
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,040
like George

811
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,480
like a cane in front of a fire place. Yeah, I thought you would love that, but

812
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,980
I also wrote a hike because I'm getting into this to its forty eight by fifty.

813
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:27,460
It's not it's five by seven by five to big to hang up. Oh, you're talking

814
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,080
about painting. Yeah, a giant painting.

815
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,000
This is my

816
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:51,460
I

817
00:46:51,460 --> 00:47:02,380
like

818
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:08,220
tears like a huge burger. I want fries right now.

819
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:15,180
That's the whole hike.

820
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,280
Don't what kind of dickhead?

821
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,780
I like who is 17 syllables man. Yeah, you should have been counting them out.

822
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,580
Yeah, I want you to count them out. I thought I was like I felt like I was

823
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,580
missing a syllable.

824
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,580
Alright, ready?

825
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,580
Give me the music again real quick.

826
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,580
Missing a syllable.

827
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,580
Flying to Ridgeville.

828
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,580
Alright, watch this.

829
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,580
Woah, that was C, holy shit, he's really learning.

830
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,580
Planet Jupiter.

831
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,580
Layers, like a huge burger.

832
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,580
I want fries, right now.

833
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
Wow, that's 575 y'all.

834
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,580
575.

835
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
We don't need that for a haiku man, you're getting a long vibe from my camera.

836
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,580
Alright, so we're going to be doing a little bit of a haiku.

837
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,580
Alright, so we're going to be doing a little bit of a haiku.

838
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Alright, so we're going to be doing a little bit of a haiku.

839
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,580
Alright, so we're going to be doing a little bit of a haiku.

840
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,580
Alright, so we're going to be doing a little bit of a haiku.

841
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:52,260
I want fries right now.

842
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,260
That's 575 y'all.

843
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,260
575.

844
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,260
We don't need that for a haiku man.

845
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,260
You're getting the wrong vibe for my coup.

846
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,260
How's that?

847
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,260
That's fine.

848
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,260
The clapping.

849
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,260
I don't think you clap at a...

850
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,260
Snap I guess but I don't have a snap.

851
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,260
Dude I went to a bar that had a jazz performance the other night.

852
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,260
Oh yeah?

853
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,260
It was amazing.

854
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,260
But...

855
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,260
They do haikus there?

856
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,260
No but what the hell?

857
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,260
Are you supposed to clap when they finish jazz?

858
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,260
Yeah I don't know.

859
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,260
I don't know.

860
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,260
I don't know.

861
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,260
I don't know.

862
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,260
I don't know.

863
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,260
I don't know.

864
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,260
I don't know.

865
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,260
I don't know.

866
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,260
I don't know.

867
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,060
I don't know you're supposed to go. I was I started clapping, then I felt kind of

868
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,580
rude wasn't nobody else was clapping a couple of people, but I think they were

869
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,500
clapping because I started clapping yeah and then it was every song. As soon as

870
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,800
I finished, they started clapping and then the guy to like justify the collapse

871
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,500
introduced the bassist and the drummer, because it was a guitar player, a

872
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,260
bassist and a drummer, and he introduced them every single time, one of them

873
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,940
every time between songs. He'd be like and on the drums you got Nick. Here's my

874
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,220
question was it was a background situation or there was a like a

875
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,500
concert like it was like was it like people were hanging out and they're

876
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,900
just they were it's like a restaurant and they had yeah it's like a yeah,

877
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,900
I think the vibe there is probably just that in general nobody nobody knows

878
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,460
what to do when a song ends like that. Nobody knows you're supposed to call it

879
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,100
no matter what kind of music it is. Everybody knows that he's trying to

880
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,660
clap. It was not so I think you created you made everyone feel bad that they

881
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,940
hadn't been clapping before probably yeah. Oh fuck you probably made everyone

882
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,260
go. Oh shit, maybe we should be clapping. You made someone think in their head

883
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,780
douche chill. I know exactly what me you remember that from remember that from

884
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:23,080
arrested development. You think they got a douche chill for me to do is chill the

885
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,100
bias. You and K would say that douche chill. I somebody somebody said douche

886
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,620
chill in their head. No, I think so. No toasty under that an hour of this.

887
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,660
Remember that yeah,

888
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,580
those days from mortal combat. What else do we remember

889
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:41,700
still? You remember okay, guys, we have to do jupiter. We barely talked about

890
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,420
Jupiter. We barely what time are you put or we're at fifty. We got ten minutes.

891
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,900
Ten minutes. We have

892
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,080
well, this is all the time. We'll do a two hour episodes. We talk about

893
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,100
Jupiter. Yeah, let's just talk about Jupiter. All right. Okay. What is your

894
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,260
experience with Jupiter? Don't know much about it. Big as fuck. It's you. Did

895
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,660
you guys know it's like

896
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,780
really

897
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,740
quite big? It's the biggest planet. It's the biggest planet on the solar system

898
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,220
and it's I think it's bigger than like all the other planets combined or

899
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,900
something like that. Do you feel like

900
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,500
because it's a gas giant, there's a little bit of an issue in terms of size.

901
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,700
Yeah, 'cause it is its atmosphere. Yeah, so it's like who gives a fuck,

902
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:21,580
really? I think it still is anyway. I think visually, it's the planet I would

903
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,300
like to take a bite out of the most. I think I agree with you there.

904
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,260
Actually, no, I would like to put it in my mouth like a jaw breaker.

905
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,940
I think Neptune looks the... It looks the candiest, but we'll get to Neptune.

906
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,340
Yeah, don't talk about that. If you had to fit any planet in your

907
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:39,140
asshole. This would be the one to do because it's just air. Yeah, it's true.

908
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,360
Well, that's what I thought I've thought I found interesting when I was doing my

909
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,540
research. They don't they don't know what the core is. They don't know if the

910
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,120
core is all it could have no solid. Well, let's send it be let's send a let's

911
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,720
send someone in there. The first manned mission to do because there's been a

912
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,540
woman to mission every single year to get stupider, but a manned mission yeah

913
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,020
to find out what's in that core. Imagine I just ask the girls

914
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,260
I don't understand. Oh yeah, they're too. I don't know what a or is too dumb to

915
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,500
play it because they went to do they got more stupid. What's the difference?

916
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,940
Yeah. Can you explain? Yeah, sorry, I forgot you got stupider there while I

917
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,500
was in college. They so they learn so much while they're on there, but then I

918
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,100
think the gas itself, I think that's what it's supposed to be saying and that

919
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,860
it's like kind of like how Ring Around the Rosie was about like

920
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,940
whatever. The gas is a neurotoxin. The gas is a neurotoxin. So all these women

921
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,700
go there and they're very, very smart. Then they, you know, hang out. Our

922
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,780
brightest minds. Yeah, well, yeah, how they're gonna get to Jupiter and then

923
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,460
to get to Jupiter and then their brain kind of it's like you know you sit in

924
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,580
like a room full of carbon monoxide for a little bit you're going to feel stupid.

925
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,460
Did you guys also know the same they named Jupiter after the king of the gods

926
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,880
back in Roman times or whatever and they named the they named it that before they

927
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,060
even knew it was the biggest planet. It just happened to be that Jesus Christ

928
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,400
is that incredible discover planets back then they had telescopes man in the

929
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
sixteen hundreds even they were looking up rocks. They were just taking pieces of

930
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,860
glass and putting them into different pieces of glass. You just put one piece

931
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,660
of glass here. I saw this crazy telescope in Ireland called the Great Telescope

932
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,280
that was from hella long ago, and it was a big wooden telescope that was huge,

933
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,300
like a NASA telescope, like giant. Really? And they could adjust it, and they

934
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,500
were able to trace the planets and stuff. Did it go like, "Click, click, click,

935
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,020
click, click, click"? I don't know, they didn't move it. Would you, if you got

936
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,500
sent back to a far away time,

937
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:30,000
What is one thing that you think with the knowledge that you have today, you could

938
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,740
invent there and get credit for?

939
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,660
RCA cables.

940
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,460
I can invent the kickflip.

941
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,540
Kickflip, maybe, but you'd have to invent a skateboard.

942
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,300
Oh, right.

943
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,780
If I went back into the 1970s, I could invent the kickflip.

944
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,580
And also, I don't think they would have cared that much about a kickflip,

945
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:46,940
honestly.

946
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,020
That would have been magical.

947
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,100
No, they would have cared more about that back then than they do now.

948
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,340
Yeah.

949
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:51,940
Kickflip?

950
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,380
Yeah.

951
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:52,940
Kickflip means nothing now.

952
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,540
People were swallowing swords and eating fire.

953
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,820
every single day. Yeah, but a new type of trick completely it would blow their

954
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:04,340
minds. It's a trick. It'd be a rolling. It'd be like this is a trick flip a

955
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,260
rolling kick flip. So not like

956
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:11,460
not like a just, you know, stationary, stationary. It's like, Oh, what the hell?

957
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,220
How the hell did you do that? If somebody could, if somebody could magic

958
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,740
back could jump more than one foot in the air in the olden days, they would

959
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,940
call them the human frog. Yeah, it called them leaper. But then they kill

960
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,180
you, man. What? Okay, that what's that? You have to strike a balance. Get last

961
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,920
names like Smith first you're going first you're saying they won't care now

962
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,200
you're saying they'll kill you you think you get him in an RCA cable yeah it's

963
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:37,340
easy it's just red yellow and white I guess that's true the red goes in the

964
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:44,500
red yeah why didn't they call it a r y w cable yeah I don't know I think is

965
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:50,140
great because they were invented by the RCA corporation shut up man mystery of

966
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:54,780
media arts how long ago would you have to go back okay I'm trying to think of a

967
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,660
really easy. How far in time would you have to go to invent like I mean, I

968
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,740
guess I could go back to really long and invent the wheel. That's a yeah, but

969
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,620
even then man, I don't know how well of a wheel I'd I'd whittle. I would find a

970
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,000
rock

971
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,980
that was kind of like a basically already a wheel and I would you know

972
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:17,120
smooth. I would rub it on other rocks and smooth it out a little bit, but then

973
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,260
even then, what are you like? What are you? Are you going to use that to move a

974
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,480
piece of meat. I'm just going to show them about it. I'm going back to the

975
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,640
year one and I'm a venting doggy style.

976
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,760
I'll go back.

977
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:35,000
I think dog that's all that was the first one. Yeah, yeah, no you would need to

978
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,360
invent the Amazon position. Can you imagine that guy, the guy who invented

979
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:45,520
missionary? Yeah, wow yeah, did John John mission. What is one brown? It was

980
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,560
yeah, it's definitely John Brown. It was John Brown from the evolutionist era. I

981
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,840
guess that for a real answer, I mean you could go back to cave men because they

982
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,960
were using tools, but they none of the tools they had had handles. They were

983
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,820
just taking rocks and you didn't eat it. So I could just I would just do the

984
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,760
classic, you know, medieval tool of just I would just take a stick and I would

985
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,680
tie it with a vine

986
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,000
onto there. I would just take their axe head that they already made. I'd be

987
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,080
like see you'd be doing that you'd be there would be a lot of going. Yeah,

988
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,480
and then honestly to be so honest with you realistically scientifically, they'd

989
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,020
probably start fucking me. I didn't fake breasts

990
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:25,860
breast implants again. I think going to the and inventing I'd get cantaloupes

991
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,720
and watermelons and cut them in half. So we have different approaches here. I'm

992
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,300
saying we could you could go so far back that you could invent something easy and

993
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,440
it would be incredible and brand new. You're saying if you go recent, you

994
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,880
could you have more tools to invent. That is a good point. That actually you have

995
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,120
outsmarted this question. Yeah, you could because I could go to the if you go

996
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,700
back you could go to nine years, seventy nine hundred and seventy invent like

997
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,700
flat jack or in venture time. I know another I know another good way to cheat

998
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,640
this question. What's that just memorize a mathematical formula? Oh yeah,

999
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,860
but you're walking around theory, but you're walking around Pythagoras, but

1000
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,340
then also you have to all those guys had to prove it on a big chalk. The

1001
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,940
Pythagorean theorem is easy to prove. You just draw triangles. Well, that's a

1002
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,540
good point. I would invent the isosceles triangle. I would go back to like the

1003
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,700
when you I would be like pre pre homo sapiens, I'd be showing it to like

1004
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,820
australopithecus yeah, just like trying to draw a triangle, the butterfly of the

1005
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,920
one of them, grabbing my leg and trying to pull me into the river to drown me

1006
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,880
sitting in a car. You go and change that and then some kids in a third grade

1007
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,320
class getting taught to. I saw some of these triangles because you could

1008
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,800
remember the

1009
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,620
yeah. I saw some of the I saw some of these triangles. Yeah, you go back in

1010
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,720
time when you teach cavemen about triangles and you go back to the future

1011
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,360
and is everything is a triangle. Yeah, yeah, no other shapes in the world.

1012
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,660
Yeah, exactly that's that would be my big fear. I triangle heads because I'm

1013
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,180
a

1014
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,560
like when you mold a baby's because they started like it's just natural

1015
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,400
selection of people who had the kind of triangle head. It's been a hundred

1016
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,960
thousand years. There's been time yeah of triangle selective breeding yeah

1017
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,960
damn that's what they do. I'm too much of a believer in the butterfly effect to

1018
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,160
anything with a time machine. Yeah. I wouldn't do it, man. I'm too scared. You can go forward.

1019
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,900
I mean, I just don't want to get hurt. I have to worry about the butterfly. Then you'd butter

1020
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,440
or butter is amazing.

1021
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,260
The forward thing would suck as you go forward in time and you find out that you're going

1022
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:31,640
to fucking die because of stray soccer ball. I'm dead. I'm going to die. What was it? What

1023
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,000
was that truck honking sounded like dramatic chip. No, you guys are like

1024
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,640
newly adopted dogs. You heard a car before I've heard of a car.

1025
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,760
You don't have to worry about going forward, though, because the butterfly

1026
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,120
effect would just apply to the people in front of where you go. You do you do

1027
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,880
all this butterfly effect stuff like you go back in time, you invent the

1028
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,960
isosceles triangle or whatever, and then you come back to the future and

1029
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,560
Ashton Kutcher is got a nosebleed. Oh, she's got some new. It's a every worth

1030
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,480
it. And every single holocaust, when you come back nosebleed, Ashton Kutcher's

1031
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,500
hurt. Actually, I would do it now because he's proven to be a CIA asset.

1032
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:12,840
Was there... Did somebody... Was this in a Freddie Wong podcast or was this a movie where

1033
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:19,820
somebody stops the Holocaust and then comes back to the normal time and stuff is way worse

1034
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,820
somehow?

1035
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,420
Freddie Wong did that?

1036
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,980
Like a guy was like, "Oh man, the Holocaust almost happened. I'm going to do it 50 times

1037
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,100
bigger. Yeah. Yeah. No, not for anyone. I feel like somebody talked about that on a Freddie

1038
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:38,300
Wong podcast. Huh? Yeah, but that's a scary thought. Yeah. What if we're in the safest,

1039
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,500
most amazing timeline that it could possibly exist? Well, I know I aren't. Well, you are

1040
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,940
for sure. I know I am. Cameron is. I mean, because he's going to make a quantum leap

1041
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:54,300
one day. I'm never going to be killed. You don't think so? He's going to be preserved

1042
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:58,360
can imagine as well. I will be in as well. He wants to be preserved in amber

1043
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,000
rather not be killed. Would you guys want to get cremated? You want to get put

1044
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,040
in the ground, say cream,

1045
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:09,400
would you rather be cremated or cream pod when you die? When I die, I guess

1046
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,740
moments after you feel it yeah, you won't you know sometimes they don't

1047
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,220
people's body. You know sometimes they donate people's bodies to science. I

1048
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,640
want my body to be donated to pleasure. I want to be my body. I want my body

1049
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,980
so don't it to the fan. Would you like to see what we're doing with your

1050
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,580
grandmother?

1051
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:32,080
My body was donated to the fan bus. I feel like we have baby alien wears it

1052
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,180
like a mech suit. I fuck bigger with

1053
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:42,500
I feel like we've taught we probably I feel like we maybe talked about it

1054
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,880
before, but yeah you don't your grandmother don't answer body to

1055
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,380
science and you come to see what research they're doing and they're using

1056
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,640
her to invent a new flesh like

1057
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:57,840
taking molds of her. I'd be sad man be tragic. I would re that make me rethink

1058
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:02,560
my entire throw up yeah straight up. I would honestly be the least of the

1059
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,040
reactions. I have I emotionally it would shatter me. I'd bar for a bag. I hope I

1060
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:13,000
get donated to like a sushi bar yeah and they use me to put to do the taxidermy.

1061
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,320
You you think you'd be great, no not sushi great not to eat, but use me like

1062
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,420
one of the naked things to eat off as a plate. Yeah, I want to be a play. I

1063
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:27,020
think I'd like to be a plate when I pass. I think that's a good idea or maybe I

1064
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:31,700
want them to use my body to make an RC airplane or helicopter. I truly want to

1065
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:35,260
fly. I want to get donated to the science to the haunted house science.

1066
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,560
Wasn't there like some story I God I'm

1067
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,020
there was some story where they thought like some guy was like, oh, my

1068
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:47,340
grandmother is being donated donated to science and then the army put a bunch of

1069
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:52,380
explosives in her. Yeah, that happens all the time. Oh my God, that's so fucking funny.

1070
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:58,320
I think something like a huge percentage of people whose bodies are donated to science

1071
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,540
get donated to like weapons testing. Yeah, they get donated to the army. And they get

1072
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:06,980
stuffed with dynamite and they do MythBusters stuff with everybody's dead creatures. It's

1073
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:13,380
so fucking funny. It's so funny how gross that shit is. That is so awesome. Oh my God.

1074
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,220
What a terrible world.

1075
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:19,060
I would want to stop. I would want to be donated to the police or something.

1076
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:23,160
Yeah. I want them to, when I die, I want them to like dissect my brain and study it and

1077
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,180
use the information to make a pill that would make people like TV more than normal.

1078
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:31,860
Yeah. I want to be donated to like a college classroom. It's just like a pinata for like

1079
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,860
the last day of class.

1080
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,860
Pinata is good, yeah.

1081
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,860
Last day of class.

1082
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,860
Oh, pinata is good. Oh yeah, getting donated.

1083
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,860
I'm feeling filled up with Kindles.

1084
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,860
Oh, I have a good one.

1085
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,860
I'll be fat by then. I'll be fatter.

1086
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:45,860
I'll be fat by then. I want to get donated to a guy who needs somebody to sit in his front seat so he can get in the carpool lane.

1087
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,860
That'd be a good one.

1088
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:56,860
I want to be donated to the city so they can stuff me like a bear and then put me into the sewers or any abandoned buildings to scare urban explorers.

1089
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,860
So people are like, "Oh, we're going to go exploring."

1090
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,860
That's a good idea.

1091
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,860
It's you holding a gun.

1092
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,860
And a cop outfit.

1093
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:08,660
And a big text bubble made of cardboard that says freeze.

1094
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,500
They turn your body into a pyramid head from Silent Hill.

1095
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Yeah, they should make me a ghost.

1096
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,980
And then they just put you in like abandoned hospitals.

1097
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,980
Yeah.

1098
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,700
And just have you stand there.

1099
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,700
Wow.

1100
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,220
That's a good idea.

1101
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,420
Just in general to be scolding and scaring people for doing something wrong.

1102
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,620
Oh my god, that'd be so...

1103
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,420
To have a job in death.

1104
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,420
To still have a purpose.

1105
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,420
A purpose for your entire legacy.

1106
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,420
To have a purpose even when you're gone.

1107
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,420
Yeah.

1108
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,420
That's how like Einstein must feel.

1109
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,420
Wearing a shirt that says one way, pointing.

1110
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,420
Yeah.

1111
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,420
All signs should be dead people.

1112
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,420
Because who's catching

1113
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,420
when you walk by one of those billboards

1114
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,420
that has a fake person hanging off of it

1115
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,420
that catches your eye man.

1116
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,420
I've never seen one of those.

1117
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,420
These should be outlawed.

1118
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,420
Imagine how you would feel when you're walking down the street

1119
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,420
you're like, "Oh is this the turn? What street is this?"

1120
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,420
You're squinting up at the street sign. It's your friend who killed himself last year.

1121
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,420
Exactly. Yeah, giant hole in his head.

1122
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:10,220
in his head. Oh my god, you know what would be perfect is getting turned into a bike.

1123
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:18,260
Like arm like this, holding the wheel and then the feet are also the wheel. Like an

1124
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:26,820
HRT gear thing. Yeah. That's good. I can just like this. Mic stand. You want to be a mic

1125
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:30,180
stand? Yeah, well someone could be. They put the microphone in your mouth when they're

1126
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:35,060
done. That's a good idea. You know what also would be good is if maybe I have the same measurements

1127
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:39,980
as like a celebrity who's about to be in a wax museum, right? So they can just take my

1128
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,860
body, right? Put it on chains. I got a movie to show you, man. Put it on chains and then

1129
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:50,020
dunk me up and down into a big thing, a big tub of wax and then mold my face into like

1130
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,020
Obama or whatever. I hope you like Paris Hilton, man. That movie's so fucking good, dude. They're

1131
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:57,580
gonna turn me into Paris Hilton? I love that movie. You like the House of Wax remake? It's

1132
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,060
It's so good. I've been watching it since I was a kid. I've never seen it. It's really,

1133
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:06,060
really good. I remember it being disgusting. It's so gross. And they spent like fucking

1134
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:11,460
millions of dollars. It's like the, he has a huge budget. Really? They built a town for

1135
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,700
it. Whoa. It's so swag, dude. It's awesome. All the marketing for it was like, "Watch

1136
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:20,220
Paris Hilton get killed." Yeah. That's what all the trailers were. And me and all my boys

1137
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:25,220
lined up, dude. Midnight premiere. What a movie. I got that shit on Blu-ray, man. Wow.

1138
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,480
I watched it this year. I'm gonna have to watch it rewatch it. I believe I've never seen it.

1139
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,040
It's sick dude. You know it's a good movie. The wrong guy. I watched it again on YouTube

1140
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:41,880
for free. What's the wrong guy? Dave Foley. That movie is so funny. Dave Foley, Joe Flatterdy.

1141
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:49,920
Free guy. Jennifer Tilly is in it also. What's it about? It's about a guy who walks in on

1142
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:57,920
his manager dead and then he flees. So it's like it's like the Alfred Hitchcock movie.

1143
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,120
It's like the player. I don't know my favorite movie man the player. Julio pull this go on

1144
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:10,120
a YouTube look up the wrong guy 1997. No whole movie on there in HD for free for free free

1145
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:14,400
but with ads probably no. If you have not if you have YouTube premium. Well I do have

1146
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,480
YouTube premium or if you know how to download one hour of medieval M&M. Why are you pulling

1147
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:25,180
pulling up this meme shit bro. Yeah, pull up the wrong guy. We don't need to show

1148
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:30,080
anything. We'll have the last hour of the episode and it'll be us watching a show.

1149
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,340
We're not actually doing a two hour episode, man. I want to shake you so bad. Don't shake

1150
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:38,960
me. Do you guys want to go to a giant buffet? I want to go to a buffet, so I've been thinking

1151
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,260
about it. I want to go to Fogo de Chao. There's a buffet over... I never got to go to Fogo

1152
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:49,080
de Chao. Over a Chinese buffet. Really? Yeah. It doesn't look like it is good. But I kind

1153
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,500
I don't want to go to like a big I want to go to like a golden corral. Yeah,

1154
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,280
golden corral. Yeah, I miss that fucking seafood buffet man. We gotta get back to

1155
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,080
murder, murder beach. We gotta go back to murder. That's just the best idea ever.

1156
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,980
We grab legs. Oh my God, it's fish sitting out all day. Yeah. Oh my God, on

1157
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,200
a hot sternum. That place, I drove by that place on the way to

1158
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:13,720
on the way to the airport. Calabash. Yeah, the Calabash seafood place and

1159
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:18,880
it's called like Captain something. Yeah, but a guy had a guy had driven off

1160
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,940
road into the sign and it was like I passed by right as it happened the like

1161
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,620
big brick sign a bunch of cops were there. That's crazy. Pretty badass dude.

1162
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:35,020
Yeah you know what's badass? The wrong guy. Stop talking about the wrong guy. It's a really good movie.

1163
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,980
You gotta stop speaking on the wrong guy. Okay you are not standing on business.

1164
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,800
I'm not standing on business but what if I change the movie up? Let me stand on

1165
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,380
business and promote my show. Oh yeah that's right. Can I promote my show?

1166
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:53,940
Yeah, you can promote it. Guys, there is very few tickets left. How many? Probably, let's

1167
01:06:53,940 --> 01:07:00,180
see, it's a 110 cap venue, there's two shows, there's probably only a hundred and

1168
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:05,740
fifty tickets left guys. Wow. Which is almost none and we're one week from

1169
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,780
today that I'm recording this is the show. The Yard Theatre, or the two shows,

1170
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:14,380
the Yard Theatre in Los Angeles, me and my friend Gus Fiveros are doing 30

1171
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,460
minutes of stand-up comedy. Julio, can you pull up this poster? The poster was made

1172
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:23,220
by Neil Linsky, little known fact. Whoa! And Neil is going to be... I would call it a

1173
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:27,740
known fact, I knew it. We're flying him out to host it and mostly to just hang out with us.

1174
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,860
But this is going to be an amazing show guys. Please come out to this. One show at

1175
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:36,080
eight, one show at ten. I wish I could be there. I wish I could go to the show. Maybe I give

1176
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,860
you a two-minute video you can play up the top that says hello to everybody. Yeah,

1177
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,860
Yeah, probably.

1178
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,860
Why do you keep asking people to do that?

1179
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,860
You're asking that to Pierce too.

1180
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,860
What?

1181
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,860
What is this thing with you where you want to film a video for people to play before their shows?

1182
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,860
I would love to be a part of the show in some capacity.

1183
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,860
You're trying to make it about you, man. It's my show.

1184
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,860
I'm not trying to make it about me.

1185
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,860
How about you do 30 minutes with some guy?

1186
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,860
Maybe I could. I could maybe do that.

1187
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,860
Who would you do it with, huh?

1188
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,860
Because I already got Gus.

1189
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,860
It would be Andy Kaufman.

1190
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,860
Andy Kaufman's long dead, man.

1191
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,260
Andy Kaufman's long dead. Andy Kaufman? That's what you think. He was faking it the whole

1192
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:17,640
time. Dude, he's dead as a doornand. And then, and then it's my, then I reveal, basically

1193
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:22,260
I'm the one that's revealing it. That you're Andy Kaufman? No, that I know him. You're

1194
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:28,380
so crazy. That I know him. You hate girls so much. I beat up every woman I see. I wrestle

1195
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:35,380
women. I've seen you do that at bars. Wrestle random women. You ever seen Andy Kaufman?

1196
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:40,520
off and yeah and you have to hold me back by my chain. You have to start

1197
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,120
bringing me. I have you on a chain right up step right up. Watch the I call him

1198
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:45,340
the

1199
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,080
human

1200
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:53,780
the human people. Look at him. He's foaming at the mouth. Please come out to

1201
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:58,460
my show. That'd be really good. Go to Pierce's show. Oh, and Pierce's show is

1202
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,660
also that night. So you do have to choose that. We'll just go to the eight

1203
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,740
the clock in line and go to the his show at ten o'clock. He put the day on the

1204
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:10,540
same show as you. Yeah, I don't care, bro. Here's this is your burn notice.

1205
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:14,400
I'm standing on business and I know you're gonna stand on everybody. We

1206
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,180
didn't talk much about Jupiter today, but you can rest assured that we will

1207
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:21,660
be talking a lot about Saturn on the next episode, which is the next planet

1208
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,740
coming up. I wish we had

1209
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:28,220
stay tuned for all types of special surprises for the planets coming

1210
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,580
forward. I wish that we had planned this. I wish that we had planned this.

1211
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,620
Saturday.

1212
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,620
Shareholders meeting is when?

1213
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,620
Saturn would be on a Saturday.

1214
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,620
21st.

1215
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,620
Well, it's okay.

1216
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,620
Shareholders meeting is on the 21st.

1217
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:44,460
That's 21st of November, so subscribe to the executive producer tier on Patreon.

1218
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:48,920
And we have something pretty amazing, I think, for the shareholders.

1219
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,740
We got to explain what the shareholders is.

1220
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,740
Yeah, go ahead.

1221
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,740
I'm going to go pee.

1222
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,380
We got to explain what that is, because I don't think people understand.

1223
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:58,380
We are doing, we do basically a monthly live show.

1224
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:03,900
Remember during COVID when everybody was doing Zoom stand up? It's basically that.

1225
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,900
It's Zoom stand up.

1226
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,900
So if you missed that, come on in.

1227
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,620
We'll release one on YouTube or something so everyone can see how awesome it is.

1228
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,980
Yes. Maybe we're coming up on one year of shareholders.

1229
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,380
Is that true?

1230
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,980
Yeah, pretty soon.

1231
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:15,980
That's unbelievable.

1232
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:16,980
Yeah, that's true.

1233
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:17,980
All right.

1234
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:18,980
All right.

1235
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,980
And then Julio has a show coming up.

1236
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,980
Yeah.

1237
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:21,980
You want to plug that?

1238
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:27,700
Yeah. I'm coming to New York. I'm going to be doing five minutes during Thanksgiving at

1239
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:32,080
at Kills apartment. We're going to have Julio do his first open mic set at a bar

1240
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:32,800
in Bushwick.

1241
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,400
All right, Thanksgiving on Thanksgiving. Happy Jupiter, y'all.

1242
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:44,380
Wait, guys, we should literally become a spa worker so we can see women naked all

1243
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:44,900
the time.

1244
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:52,500
It's a great idea. I'm all these people who are wasting their time jacking off

1245
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,100
to porn. Just get a job at a

1246
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:02,340
We have to go on Shark Tank and we have to pitch this to Mark Cuban and Mr. Wonderful.

1247
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,020
A spa for women who don't mind being ogled.

1248
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,020
Yeah.

1249
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,020
A spa where you...

1250
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,020
How about this?

1251
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,940
A spa where you go for free and you get a bunch of perverts who pay.

1252
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,340
Like if a woman wants to go to a spa, you could either...

1253
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,340
You could either...

1254
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,340
The perverts are paying double what the women would pay.

1255
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,340
Yeah, you could either pay...

1256
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,340
$1,000.

1257
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,340
This is a great idea.

1258
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,180
You either pay $50 to go to a normal spa or you pay zero.

1259
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:27,260
Meanwhile, the perverts, Patrick and Cameron, are sitting behind a...

1260
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,780
I didn't say that I was going to be there.

1261
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,820
Oh wait, here's the thing though.

1262
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:30,860
You could even do tears.

1263
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,980
I'm literally the inventor of this company.

1264
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,100
I wouldn't be one of the perverts.

1265
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,700
You could even do... well, you have to test it out.

1266
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,940
You could even do tears of the...

1267
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,020
I would honestly be whipping and torturing the perverts.

1268
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,940
The pervert tears could be this, dude.

1269
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:41,900
Listen to this.

1270
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,180
You could either have...

1271
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:46,220
You could say, "It's a pervert honeypot."

1272
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:50,460
We pitch this business on Shark Tank and then we post that.

1273
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:55,100
We tell them afterwards like we and this the secret don't air this part on your

1274
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,300
TV show, but actually we're going to kill all the perfect.

1275
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,100
We don't want to kill.

1276
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,460
We're going to get that and John and conchig were you guys.

1277
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,340
If you OK, you guys are fucking idiots because you're wasting a million dollar

1278
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:04,460
idea. You can even have it.

1279
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,540
He wants to go.

1280
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:09,580
You could even have it be tiered where there's windows that you think that

1281
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,460
they can be seen through both sides and that tickets 50.

1282
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,100
Well, they already have.

1283
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:13,940
But then they shut up.

1284
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:16,220
There's one that is that is a mirror.

1285
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,620
What do they call that?

1286
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:21,100
A double sided mirror, one way, one way, two way mirror, a two way mirror.

1287
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,780
it really is. And that one is more money so that your identity is hidden.

1288
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,820
And then there's one that's even more that is a private cube.

1289
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:33,140
They have this already, the window and everything. It's called a peep show.

1290
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:37,140
But these women are just doing their own thing. They're not like put on a show.

1291
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,340
Yeah, but wouldn't you want to pay for women doing the show?

1292
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:45,380
If we're trying to maximize profit, I just thought of an even better idea, Caleb, kind of jumping off your two-way mirror idea.

1293
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:48,660
What if we have it, it's all two-way mirrors, the

1294
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:52,220
perverts pay a hundred dollars to come watch from behind the mirror and the

1295
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,180
women also are charged a hundred dollars to use the spot they don't know the

1296
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:55,820
perverts watching

1297
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:59,160
