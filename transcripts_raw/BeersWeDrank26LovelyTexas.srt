(upbeat music)

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,320
- What's up all my chuggers?

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm trying to get that burp out.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,060
(burping)

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,720
- This is a journey into--

- Into the middle of--

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,400
- Plain and clean--

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,220
- Bud Light.

- Here it comes, here it comes.

19
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,440
- It's beer time, here it comes.

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,280
- Oh, God.

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,140
- Here, I'll do my answer. - It's a cool cap of.

22
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,580
- That does not look like a beer, man.

23
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,220
I'm gonna be real, that looks to me like a liquid death.

24
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,900
- Guys.

25
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,740
- Show me.

26
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,100
- You, I think, you know, I have never been

27
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,980
to the U.S. in my entire life.

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,300
and walking around here I was like,

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,460
I wonder what the beer situation's like

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,820
in this beautiful country,

31
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,980
this beautiful big, big ass country.

32
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,980
And I found the most badass beer in the entire world.

33
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,540
It is a tall boy. - You are a cringe man.

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,420
- It is completely black,

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,820
it has an insane skull on it,

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,680
and it literally has death on it.

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,620
Like that'll even kill people who die drinking this.

38
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,460
Check it out.

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,500
- Okay, but it says sparkling water on it.

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,740
- Bro, here, okay, I don't wanna interrupt the flow.

41
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,580
- Oh, you're right.

42
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,540
- Go ahead and give it a taste test and a review.

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,420
- Oh, it's so light, I can't even taste the alcohol.

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,740
(laughing)

45
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,420
- You are over, you are done for.

46
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,020
This is the last straw for me, man.

47
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,860
- Yeah, you can't do that.

48
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,820
- I was joking.

49
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,660
- Oh, thank God.

50
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,900
- It was my joke.

51
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,460
- Oh, thank God.

52
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,780
- I actually know what a sparkling water is.

53
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,860
Thank you very much.

54
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,700
- I don't know why you opened this.

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,780
- Give it a sparkling water rating.

56
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,500
- I think you're stupid, I don't like sparkling water at all.

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
I should just give this to my girlfriend.

58
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,500
- This dude bought a $2 joke.

59
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,580
That's $400 Mexican dollars.

60
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,740
- Yeah, that's pretty penny.

61
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,300
- I don't wanna talk about money right now.

62
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,660
I wanna cry, I wanna start crying.

63
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,980
- Stop, do not talk about money, stop.

64
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,420
- So I saw this big ass Shiner Rock beer can.

65
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,220
- Shiner Bock, you said rock.

66
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,140
- Shiner Bock.

67
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,460
said Shiner Rock. It looks like it said rock on my end. Yeah what's that Jade? Anyways,

68
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,060
Shiner Rock. I saw an awesome ad for it and I was like whoa. It said something about luxury

69
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,860
or some shit. I forgot what it said. It does look luxurious. It's in a golden can. It's

70
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,420
a golden can. That's not cheap. And I saw it and I was like wow I gotta have it and

71
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,420
now I'm gonna drink it. Alright what's the rating? It tastes just like any other light

72
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,020
beer and have never tasted in my entire life.

73
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,520
Okay, numerical and basketball play.

74
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,720
Shiny Rock, the same, what's there's like a...

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,020
It's like lighter than a Bud Light.

76
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
Which is not great I guess.

77
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,420
Well maybe it is if you don't drink like a thousand of these.

78
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,420
I'll say it's like a 6.5.

79
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,420
Okay, that's pretty good actually.

80
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
That's not bad.

81
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,520
I mean I don't hate it, I just think it's like super light.

82
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,200
It's like barely any alcohol over this one, basically.

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,720
Yeah, it is more though.

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,040
Okay, you guys.

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,120
I have a long-standing feud with this brand.

86
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,200
It is called, referred to as its name, Montauk.

87
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,520
So here's the thing with Montauk, man.

88
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,960
They make a watermelon beer.

89
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,500
And the first, and I think only time I've had this beer, I thought that it was going

90
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,220
to be a watermelon seltzer because it just says watermelon in big letters.

91
00:03:52,220 --> 00:04:01,340
Turns out it was a fucking beer. So I hated it. Zero. And also zero inches. I know that, I mean,

92
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,300
you tell me if that's good or bad. That's bad.

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,940
But I'm giving him another chance. Montauk, I'm a nice guy. I'm a courteous, sweet guy.

94
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,820
I'm going to give you one more try. So I got the summer ale. And what sounds better

95
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,320
than a summer ale from a brand called Montauk.

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,620
Guys, this is a vacation spot that people come

97
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,500
from all over the universe to go to.

98
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,560
This is going to be good.

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
- Where's Montauk at? - Here I go.

100
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,340
- I think it's like a Shandy.

101
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,020
- I don't remember where Montauk is.

102
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,860
- It's a Shandy?

103
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,220
What's a Shandy?

104
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,740
- Montauk is somewhere in New York.

105
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,180
It's like Long Island or some shit.

106
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,260
- I love New York. - Okay, here I go guys.

107
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,100
Hmm.

108
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,580
- Yeah, I did it again.

109
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,420
- Is it a beer or is it a--

110
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,580
- Maybe take a third sip.

111
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,660
- This is, you know what,

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,760
Rex, that's not a half bad idea, my friend.

113
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,540
Okay, all right.

114
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,220
To all of my reverse sober gophers out there

115
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,020
who love drinking and enjoy ales of all kinds,

116
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,460
run, don't walk to your nearest beer store

117
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,300
and get a Montauk Summer Ale.

118
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,900
Guys, this is an 8'1" and a 6'9".

119
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,380
- Wow.

120
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,860
That's an unprecedented score.

121
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,740
- What's the taste of the summer?

122
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,820
- Guys, this has notes of different fruits.

123
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,860
- Such as?

124
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,780
- Such as a medley.

125
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,660
- Okay.

126
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,960
Which comprise of?

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,760
- Hold on, let me take one more sip.

128
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,180
It has a, it's on the hoppy end.

129
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,020
- Okay.

130
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,060
- I wouldn't quite call it a pale ale.

131
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,980
It doesn't have that kind of classic IPA bitterness to it,

132
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,300
but it has the refreshingness.

133
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,220
It's very hoppy.

134
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,860
But, and it's not a lager.

135
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,060
There's nothing deep about it.

136
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,580
There's nothing dark about it.

137
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,900
This is a great beer if you're on a boat or a kayak

138
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,780
and you don't wanna go home.

139
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,740
You never want it to end.

140
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,220
This would be a good beer for you.

141
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,460
- Okay.

142
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,300
- Guys, there it is.

143
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,500
That's my review.

144
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,460
I think before Rex goes, I want to say a couple of things.

145
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,260
Number one, the Shining Rock is actually

146
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,620
going down really smooth.

147
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,420
But I actually do feel that it does have alcohol in it.

148
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,340
So I would like to revise my rating and give it a 6.8.

149
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,540
Because I really hate harsh beers that I can't drink

150
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,260
and I make faces.

151
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,140
That's a good man.

152
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,620
I think that might be one of your highest ratings ever.

153
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,540
I think-- I don't know-- a single height in feet.

154
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,260
Also, I want to say Rex's beard looks so strange from where

155
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,780
I can see.

156
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,780
It looks like a painting that's been wrapped into a can.

157
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,020
- It does look like that Machine Girl album.

158
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,180
- Yes.

159
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,660
So I guess I'll introduce my beer.

160
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,820
I asked my roommates when they went to the grocery store,

161
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,620
I said, "Find me a weird beer."

162
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,180
(laughing)

163
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,780
- I've made this mistake before.

164
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,740
- So they got me a Thin Man Brewery, Trial by Wombat.

165
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,540
- Wow.

166
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,900
Wow, that is an actually repulsive can.

167
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,400
That is so fucking repulsive.

168
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,820
What kind of beer is this?

169
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Because this is giving me no information.

170
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,620
This is obviously an India Pale Ale.

171
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
Okay.

172
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,260
It was either that or a sour.

173
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
Yeah.

174
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
Hopped with galaxy.

175
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,860
I don't know what that means.

176
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
That's the world.

177
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,860
I have a strong feeling you're about to find out.

178
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,780
I think he's been sipping it and he still doesn't know what it tastes like.

179
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,500
If I had to say what it tastes like,

180
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,620
it's like if someone put a Bud Light

181
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,100
and an IPA down in front of you,

182
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,260
and then blindfolded you,

183
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,720
and you picked up the Bud Light,

184
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,900
but you thought it was the IPA,

185
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,460
that's what it tastes like.

186
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,940
So it tastes like a light beer

187
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,740
where you're imagining there's more hops in it.

188
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,420
- That's kind of what this tastes like, I guess,

189
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,500
this Montauk.

190
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,260
Maybe they might be a little bit similar.

191
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,100
- It seems as though--

192
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,620
- It tastes like someone's feeding you an IPA

193
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,820
from like four feet away.

194
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,520
- Maybe you're drinking a Bud Light.

195
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,540
(laughing)

196
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,980
Okay, that made no sense.

197
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,460
Feeding you a drink from feet away.

198
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,260
- Four feet away.

199
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,980
(laughing)

200
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,700
- Like it's just, like the IPA is just a little far away

201
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,540
from the rest of the beer.

202
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,620
- So here's a good way to describe it.

203
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,900
It's like drinking a Bud Light, but smelling an IPA.

204
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,740
- Yes.

205
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,900
- Oh, that's perfect.

206
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,580
- Maybe that might be a little better of a description

207
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,780
than just drinking it from a long way away.

208
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,460
(laughing)

209
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,960
Maybe a big straw with a bunch of loops in it.

210
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,840
Guys, are you catching up on the trend

211
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,160
that we're kind of setting ourselves up to?

212
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,880
I think everyone loves Bud Light.

213
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,520
I think the cancellation of Bud Light has to end.

214
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,360
It's over.

215
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,920
And Bud Light has to get three new spokesmen

216
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,700
for the brand new marketing campaign.

217
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,420
Well.

218
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,720
Kid Rock drank Bud Light.

219
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
He did?

220
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
He squashed the beef?

221
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,760
He got caught drinking Bud Light.

222
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,280
He got caught.

223
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,840
- Well, he didn't want to waste it.

224
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,280
Was he shotgunning it?

225
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,960
- No, he was drinking it in a normal way.

226
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,640
- Yeah, he was like at a stadium

227
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,480
and someone took a photo of him

228
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,800
from down at the peasant seats.

229
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
- In a box.

230
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
- Yeah.

231
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,560
- And you know those boxes don't just have Bud Light.

232
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,960
They have Blue Moon.

233
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,920
- Yeah.

234
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,200
Which the only beer gayer than Bud Light is a Blue Moon.

235
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
- Yeah.

236
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,040
So, they've got, what's the, they got a Fat Tire?

237
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,140
Fat Tire is one of my dad's favorite beers.

238
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,800
- Yeah, those are beers men in their 40s drink.

239
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,360
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

240
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,240
And they're like, "Oh, I'm gonna get into beer.

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,400
"Let me get the slightly more expensive one

242
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
"at the grocery store."

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
They don't know what the fuck's going on.

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
- They don't have a clue.

245
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,920
- They've never rated a beer based on the height

246
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,600
of the person that might drink it.

247
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,440
- Yeah.

248
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,940
- These people are fucking stupid.

249
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,440
- I feel like I'm a beer expert at this point.

250
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,520
- We are beer experts.

251
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,920
We drink more beer than almost anybody,

252
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,720
like in terms of variety.

253
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
- That's true, actually.

254
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,560
I've never had a more varied consumption of beer

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
in my entire life than I have this past couple of months.

256
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,080
- Yeah, true.

257
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,520
How susceptible do you guys think you are

258
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,520
to falling into those sort of rabbit holes

259
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,160
where you just get into a thing?

260
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,320
- 100%.

261
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,960
- 100%, I think all men are susceptible

262
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,200
to hobbies, they call them.

263
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
- I think I could, well, not just like a hobby,

264
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,440
but just something stupid, like getting into gay beers

265
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,560
or something that I caught myself before I came into this trip

266
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,280
is I bought a safety razor

267
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,400
because I saw one TikTok of a guy being like,

268
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,960
they're good for you.

269
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,160
I was like, okay, I'm gonna buy one.

270
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440
And I bought one and I didn't know how to open it.

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
So I didn't use it for like some weeks.

272
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,920
And then right before my trip,

273
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,020
I finally figured out how to use it.

274
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,160
And the tutorial that I watched of a guy

275
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
like shaving himself, he had like a brush,

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,600
he had a whole thing.

277
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,320
And I was like, maybe I should buy all these

278
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
fucking stupid shit. - Wow.

279
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
- And I was like, you know what?

280
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,160
I'll just buy some aftershave and I'm gonna be done with it.

281
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,280
I don't wanna get into this, this is too stupid.

282
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
- I get made fun of by my wife,

283
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,640
who is out of town by the way,

284
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,860
when the wife is away at the mice show play.

285
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,680
The bed is not made behind me, you'll notice.

286
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,000
'Cause I didn't ask her. - That's the mice playing.

287
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
- Looks the same as always.

288
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,240
- 'Cause nobody made me do it this morning.

289
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,680
- And there's a backpack on it.

290
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,640
- And there's a backpack, which is supposed to go

291
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,780
in the cubby, but I don't give a fuck.

292
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,420
- And the drawer behind you is slightly ajar.

293
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,260
- Good.

294
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,780
I'm gonna take out the drawers and put food in 'em.

295
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,080
(laughing)

296
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,040
Yep, I'm crazy.

297
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
What was I saying?

298
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,240
- Something about getting made fun of.

299
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,320
- She makes fun of me because I get into things

300
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
pretty often for about two months.

301
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
That's the interval for me.

302
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
Two months.

303
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,280
Last thing I was into was watches,

304
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
and I keep buying single watches.

305
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,720
- That's crazy.

306
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,320
- I watch a bunch of videos about the way watches work

307
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
and the movement of watches.

308
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,880
- This bro's watching watches.

309
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,040
- I was watching watches.

310
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,080
I was watch it, I was watch it watching.

311
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,920
- Yeah.

312
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,760
- And it was, I mean, it's, I like shit like that.

313
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,000
I've always said if I had the money and a garage,

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,040
I would be a model train guy.

315
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,560
- Why do you need a garage for that?

316
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
I could have sworn you were going

317
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
in a different direction with that.

318
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,240
Why not like a basement?

319
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,200
- That's fine too.

320
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
Yeah, that's fine.

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,880
Any extra space, if I had an extra room,

322
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,800
maybe I would even be a model train guy.

323
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
I have all this shit, I don't need--

324
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,520
- Do you have lofted ceilings?

325
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,240
High ceilings in your apartment?

326
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
- Decently high ceilings.

327
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
You're thinking I could put it around the top,

328
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,400
like a Christmas decoration? - Yeah, like a vertical,

329
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
yeah, use the vertical space. - That's a pretty good idea.

330
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,840
- That would be insane.

331
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,920
What you could just do when your wife is away,

332
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,040
she's going to be like-- (laughing)

333
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,040
- Hands over her eyes, like a home makeover video.

334
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,760
- Yeah, I know, I--

335
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,120
- Maybe, I got a surprise.

336
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,080
- Right at the top of her hand range.

337
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
- Her corner vision?

338
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,040
- Yeah.

339
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
- Yeah, she's like, try to make it as long as you can

340
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
before she notices.

341
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,320
Because what is she gonna do?

342
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
Is she gonna clean the ceiling?

343
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,240
- Yeah, you've got a little remote that like turns it on.

344
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,520
- Maybe that's how I could sell it,

345
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,320
is I maybe put some kind, you know those Swiffer dusters?

346
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,120
Put one of those on the front.

347
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,760
And I say like, I was just thinking with my brain,

348
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,800
using my noodle, and this is how we're gonna dust

349
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,920
the corners of the apartment.

350
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,600
No more cobwebs in this apartment.

351
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,140
Mm-hmm.

352
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,260
It'd be cool if there was really strong magnets,

353
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,640
and you could say you were cleaning the window

354
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,680
by getting those, like, magnet cleaners.

355
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,440
But on the inside, it's just a big TV,

356
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,520
and you just kind of move it. Yes.

357
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,980
Oh, I'm tired.

358
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,320
I've been cleaning the window all day long.

359
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,940
By the way, that -- that --

360
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,620
I don't even know why you said "window cleaner."

361
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,440
That is just the most crazy stretch invention

362
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
I've ever heard in my life.

363
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,600
A magnet window cleaner that is a TV?

364
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,960
Yeah, well, they've got those, the window cleaners that are magnets

365
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,400
from like the outside, right?

366
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,360
I haven't seen these.

367
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,520
I know what you mean.

368
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,120
Yeah.

369
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,120
There's like a brush part, like a, like a soft cloth.

370
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,280
Oh, so it brushes the outside?

371
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,760
Right.

372
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,960
And then you've got it on the inside.

373
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,880
So you can sit in there and just do like this.

374
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,520
These are also like very common to like, just like clean, like the inside of a,

375
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,360
like fish tanks when you don't want to like check all this shit out.

376
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,440
- Yeah. - That would really help me out

377
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,440
'cause I'm paying upwards of two or $3,000 a year

378
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,680
to have these guys come clean my windows.

379
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,520
- Yeah, you could get down there with a big hose

380
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,640
and kind of put your thumb over it really tight

381
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,160
and shoot straight up.

382
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,680
- Yeah, these guys, they hate me, man.

383
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,080
I insist on walking around with a towel

384
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,680
right above my nipples all the time

385
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,240
and just dropping it at the perfect time.

386
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,760
My penis is covered by their helmet

387
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,180
if there were to be a camera behind them.

388
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,500
They do not like me.

389
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,980
- And just think, you could spend $400

390
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,820
on really expensive magnets.

391
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,660
- Yeah.

392
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,460
- $1,600 on a new flat screen TV.

393
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,100
- I did get the A-OK to get a new TV the other day.

394
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,940
- Yo!

395
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,980
- Wait, how big we talking?

396
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
- How big?

397
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,820
- Guys, my wife--

398
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,660
- It's gonna be so small.

399
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,860
- My wife is prepared to go--

400
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,260
My wife is prepared to go as large as 42 inches.

401
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,180
(laughing)

402
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,020
Guys, this is huge.

403
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,140
- Damn.

404
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,500
- This is fucking huge.

405
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,340
- Dang.

406
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,940
- That's a five inch difference.

407
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
- You're gonna put the big game on there?

408
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,540
- Oh, I'm gonna put the big everything on there.

409
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,140
Everything's gonna look big on there,

410
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,900
'cause it's a big TV.

411
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,500
- Yeah, I will say I did just get a 42 inch TV

412
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,380
and I do feel that it's pretty big.

413
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,020
- It's a decent size, I have a small apartment,

414
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,620
I feel like it's not too small.

415
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,860
And also, I do think it's a little corny

416
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,760
to have a TV so big that it is like too big.

417
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,800
You know what I mean?

418
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
- You say that, but it is fun.

419
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,640
- I'm putting it somewhere right now.

420
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,120
I don't know, I'm putting it somewhere right now.

421
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
- Yeah, well, but that's different being,

422
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,760
I mean like, if you go to like a couple's house

423
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,880
and they have just a giant TV that dominates the room.

424
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,600
- That means the man wears the pants.

425
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,280
- The TV should, well, I wear pants.

426
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,120
- That means the man--

427
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,940
- No, you don't, you don't wear pants.

428
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,920
You just told us you don't wear pants.

429
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,760
You walk around with your--

430
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,840
- I wear the pants, my wife is out of town

431
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,700
and guess what, you guys?

432
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,240
When I came back from the park with the dog today,

433
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,200
which is one of my chores,

434
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,000
I didn't wipe his paws off when he came inside.

435
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
- Come on.

436
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,160
- So he got dirt everywhere.

437
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,000
- You're so naughty.

438
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,280
- And I'm not gonna clean it until right before she gets home

439
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,560
so she never notices.

440
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,400
- I can already tell how this is gonna go.

441
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,160
- They should make a tape measure

442
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,300
that measures 60 inches is 42 inches.

443
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,960
- That would be useful for a lot of shit.

444
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,200
- Yeah.

445
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
- I can only think of--

446
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,440
- Yeah, look at my 200 inch penis.

447
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,960
- Yeah, women don't know how long an inch is.

448
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,600
You just get a tape measure, see?

449
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,160
- 10. - Yeah.

450
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,400
- Told you.

451
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,760
- Biggest in the world.

452
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,820
Jonah Falcon can blow me.

453
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,160
- Rex is on some handyman shit.

454
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,080
- Yeah, I've been hanging stuff lately.

455
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,240
So I hung my big TV, I hung my smaller TV,

456
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,440
bought some shelves, built some shelves, hung them.

457
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,280
- Amazing.

458
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,400
- He's been so, so productive and so handy.

459
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,720
Rex, why don't you give us a little tour

460
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,080
of your desk right now?

461
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,040
- Oh, sure, yeah, so.

462
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,840
The desk door, the favorite segment of many fans.

463
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
The trial by walnut.

464
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,720
- Let's take a look at what's right here.

465
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,880
Oh, what could that be?

466
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
- Oh my God.

467
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,320
- Just all in a week's worth since I set up my desk.

468
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
- Until you set up your, what do you mean

469
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,000
until you set up your desk, take it to the kitchen,

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,840
throw that away.

471
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,960
- After I set up my desk, you know,

472
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,360
just like it's been like a week, you know.

473
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,200
- That is lunacy.

474
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
all those in the last week.

475
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,060
Have you thought about investing on a little trash bin,

476
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,360
as they call it in the UK?

477
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,200
Yeah, a bin.

478
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,960
A bin?

479
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,800
Bin service.

480
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,040
There's just little tiny bits of...

481
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,200
That's why you put a bag in it.

482
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
You're saving them for later.

483
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,840
No, I got to take them to the sink

484
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,000
and then empty them into the sink

485
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,700
and then put them into the recycle bin.

486
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,960
But what a lot of people don't realize

487
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,800
is that from your bedroom to your kitchen

488
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,160
is probably about two or 300 miles.

489
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,940
Right.

490
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,420
This is not, this is going to, you're going to be, I mean, you're going to be

491
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,140
crawling on your hands and knees begging for water by the time you get there.

492
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,140
It's probably 10 feet.

493
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,020
In terms of routing, I need to go all the way, maybe like three feet.

494
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,140
As soon as you say all the way, I'm out.

495
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,200
Yeah.

496
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,700
I hate going all the way.

497
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,500
I don't need to know the rest of it, guys.

498
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,480
Yeah.

499
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,380
I probably need to walk another 10 feet.

500
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,020
So it's probably like 20 feet.

501
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,500
Guys, there is some big news for all the men in the world.

502
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:41,940
What is it? Sam Sulek is starting his fall cut. I don't know who Sam Sulek is. He is a

503
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,300
21 year old bodybuilder who is on more steroids than probably any human being in

504
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,740
the world. Look up a picture of him right now. The guy that was like having

505
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,620
trouble breathing? Yeah he's always... Get the fuck out of here you fucking dog!

506
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,460
- Dog.

507
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,900
- That guy is like his dog.

508
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,740
- Yeah, he's always--

509
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,060
- Is that him not cutting?

510
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Is that him bulking?

511
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,540
- He's cutting now.

512
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,900
- But I'm saying when he like,

513
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,280
that video that went around where he couldn't breathe.

514
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
- Yeah.

515
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,940
- Is that him bulking?

516
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,220
- Yes, yeah.

517
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,060
- Oh my God.

518
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,060
- So he eats like 7,000 calories a day.

519
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,460
- Yeah.

520
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,300
- Oh my God, dude.

521
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,860
- And every morning he drinks a gallon of chocolate milk

522
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,420
for breakfast.

523
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,700
And this guy is a hero to me and many, many others.

524
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,060
You guys should see the comments.

525
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,180
I watch every one of his videos.

526
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,580
They're 40 minutes long.

527
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,660
It's just him working out

528
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,700
and talking about the workouts he does.

529
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,140
You should see the comments on these videos, man.

530
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,820
People are like, "Sam, you changed my life.

531
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,980
I used to think you should eat vegetables and fruits.

532
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,300
I just recently realized that that is gay.

533
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,980
And now I drink chocolate milk for every meal.

534
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,380
And I wake up, I cook a steak the night before,

535
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,180
put it on my nightstand, wake up and eat it.

536
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,260
Yep, this guy's massive.

537
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,180
This guy's, yeah, that's him.

538
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,160
I mean, this is the ideal male physique, guys.

539
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,420
But I just thought you guys might want a little update.

540
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,820
He started the cut, he's on day two.

541
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,540
- That's so crazy.

542
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,260
Do you think that guy's gonna make it?

543
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,740
- Make it to what? - I mean, to what?

544
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,940
- 400 pounds? - To another year?

545
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,520
- Probably another year. - I think he's got at least

546
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,980
three good years left in him.

547
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,420
- Yeah, well he's 21, let's see, Ziz,

548
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,620
Ziz, Ziz, never learned how to say his name.

549
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,860
He died at what, 26, 27?

550
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,140
- Yeah.

551
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,780
- And I would, oh, wait, hold on.

552
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,620
- No!

553
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,940
- I never knew that guy used to,

554
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,740
I know he's like a meme.

555
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,080
- Yes, he's just an old bodybuilding forum guy.

556
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,920
- Right.

557
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,060
I don't get that shit.

558
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,820
I'm more like a books and chess type of guy.

559
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,820
He's like an Indian guy that looked like a lanky nerd.

560
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Yeah.

561
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,820
Guys, tragedy is striking. Hold on.

562
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Tragedy is striking in a major way.

563
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,820
The beer has been spilled.

564
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,820
The beer has been spilled on my mouse pad, guys.

565
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
No!

566
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Guys, this is going to stick it up.

567
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
Alright. Mental reset.

568
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,820
Mental reset.

569
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Guys, I'm on tour.

570
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
You are on tour. How's that?

571
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,700
Yeah, I'm on tour and I got plenty of stories on the tour.

572
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,960
I think Texas is completely based, especially the San Antonio area.

573
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,680
I think anyone who chooses to leave, to live in either in LA or New York is an idiot.

574
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,720
This is true.

575
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,680
This is the best place to live in.

576
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,600
You can just drive your car, your awesome car everywhere.

577
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,300
I want to buy a truck so bad.

578
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,900
But also I've run into some issues on my way here.

579
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,740
- No.

580
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,580
What has happened?

581
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,400
- Which is really sad.

582
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,240
- What the fuck did they do to you?

583
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,220
- On my first day up here,

584
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,180
it wasn't even the good people of Texas, I don't think.

585
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,420
On my way here, before I hit the border,

586
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,540
I got stopped, I like the border town, by a cop.

587
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,020
And I was like, "Yo, you were going so incredibly fast

588
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,500
"on your awesome car."

589
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,740
I was like, "Thank you, man."

590
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,580
And I dabbed him up.

591
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,420
(laughing)

592
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,580
And he was like, "No, actually you have to pay me for that."

593
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,180
I was like, "Ah, shit."

594
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,260
So he starts talking about how I owe the state,

595
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,460
like I think it's like around 300 bucks or some shit.

596
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,260
He's like, "Yeah, you gotta pay this fine for 300 bucks."

597
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,100
- Who gives a fuck?

598
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,460
You're in a different fucking country.

599
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,340
- I'm gonna take, no, that's just in Mexico.

600
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,260
It's in a different city, but still Mexico.

601
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,500
- Wait, so by 300 bucks, you mean like $7?

602
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,340
- 300 American?

603
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,260
- 300 American, yeah.

604
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,500
- Oh God, that's a bad speaking.

605
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,340
- What?

606
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,620
- Yeah, it's like 6,000 pesos.

607
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,460
I'm just trying to make the conversion on my head.

608
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,180
And I was like, "Oh, okay."

609
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,740
And he's like, "Yeah, well, you gotta pay this.

610
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm gonna take your license and your registration.

611
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,100
It's gonna stay here.

612
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,580
You can leave the note with a phone number

613
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,020
if you have anyone here."

614
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,480
I was like, "No, I don't got family.

615
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,220
I don't have any cash on me, whatever."

616
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,500
And he's like, "Okay, well, I can give you a discount

617
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,700
and you can pay 60 bucks for this."

618
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,220
I was like, "Uh."

619
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,380
- Negotiator.

620
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,220
- Yeah. - Look at you.

621
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,140
- Well, I didn't say anything.

622
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,740
I was like, "I don't have any money on me."

623
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,520
It's like, all right, I'll give you a discount for 60 bucks.

624
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,780
You don't have to pay 60 bucks.

625
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,220
- All right, $15 for the ticket and a dollar for my Coke.

626
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,380
- That is actually kind of what happened.

627
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,020
He told me like, you can pay this like immediately now,

628
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,580
cash only at the gas station store.

629
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,700
I was like, okay, I'll do that.

630
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,060
- What kind of fucking system do you guys have?

631
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,340
You pay your tickets at the gas station?

632
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,180
- Chill.

633
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,340
- Did you get scammed?

634
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,420
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

635
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,520
I was like, okay, yeah, I'll do that.

636
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,220
I'll pay the money then.

637
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,460
And I was like, he kept on like,

638
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,060
do you have your cash on you now?

639
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,460
I was like, no, no, no, I gotta go there

640
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,860
and I gotta take some cash out and then I'll pay it.

641
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,780
He's like, all right, I'll help you out.

642
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll take half of it off.

643
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,100
You can pay only like 20,

644
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,940
like essentially like just like 20 bucks on this fine.

645
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,460
I was like, okay.

646
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,460
So we just drive to like the nearest gas station.

647
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,900
I take out like 10 bucks that I needed

648
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,580
to like make these two bucks.

649
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,180
And I just pay this like code that he gave me.

650
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,440
And I was like, "Okay, I got my ticket."

651
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,280
And I gave it to him.

652
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,700
I was like, "All right, all right, here you go."

653
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,500
I was like, "All right, just don't do it again, all right?"

654
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,260
I was like, "All right, sorry."

655
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,460
So I got a ticket, I guess, and I just paid 20 bucks

656
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
and I got out of it, which is completely fine with me.

657
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,940
- Did he follow you to the gas station?

658
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,580
- This is a cartel shakedown.

659
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,060
This is not a police officer, man.

660
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,580
- That is completely fake.

661
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,100
- He gave me a thing, like a coded,

662
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,340
like an actual barcode thing that I had to pay at the gas station.

663
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,180
- Cash app. - Yeah.

664
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,620
- Okay, but did you have to go-- - Not a cash app.

665
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,700
Did you have to go to like an official like mexico.mx.org?

666
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Nope.

667
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Yeah, you got scammed.

668
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,380
You got scammed.

669
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,700
For $20.

670
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,780
I don't care.

671
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,460
You still got-- just admit you got scammed, though.

672
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
Yeah, I don't care.

673
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,420
I've been scammed worse by the actual government before.

674
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,140
When I got a--

675
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,300
I think-- I don't know if I told this on the podcast,

676
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,780
but this one time I got a ticket for speeding,

677
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,460
like some speed camera got my license plate,

678
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,780
but it was so dark it was actually someone else's license

679
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,380
plate.

680
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,820
and I try my best at just like going around town

681
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,340
and getting reverted.

682
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,100
And at the end of the year, I go to pay my fee

683
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,740
for owning a car and the ticket's still there.

684
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,940
And I email the person, I was like,

685
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,260
well, I thought I did this.

686
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,460
He's just like, no, well, you gotta go

687
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,860
tell the other people that you did it.

688
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,540
I was like, you know what, it's $20.

689
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,220
I'll just eat, I just get scammed, I guess.

690
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,060
So if I get scammed for $20, you're free to go by me.

691
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,900
I don't care, I don't care what's $20.

692
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,780
- I don't really disagree with that.

693
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
- Yeah, you're getting off, I'm fine with that.

694
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,660
You know, if it's not gonna lead

695
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,580
to any kind of escalation, then sure.

696
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,420
- Yeah, I'd rather pay 20 bucks.

697
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,340
- He probably would have killed you if you didn't pay.

698
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,360
- Yeah, and I didn't give him any money.

699
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,460
I just gave him like the receipt.

700
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,140
I was like, here you go, I paid $20.

701
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,980
He's like, all right.

702
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,540
And he gave me my shit and I just watched it all my way.

703
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,140
- So he has some kind of thing worked out

704
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,060
with this gas station.

705
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,140
How, what did his car and outfit look like?

706
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,080
- He looked like a transit officer.

707
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,220
- Interesting.

708
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,040
- So he had a--

709
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,880
- Did he have like a siren at all?

710
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,720
- A conductor's cap.

711
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,960
- He had a complete siren and a very official car

712
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,800
and everything.

713
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,640
I think it's in some way a complete scam

714
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,280
that I scared so little about

715
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,120
that I kind of stopped thinking about it because--

716
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,440
- Is it possible that he was an actual police officer

717
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,740
doing a scam?

718
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,480
- Yes. - A corrupt cop?

719
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,600
- 100% because he kept telling me if I had any cash on me

720
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,000
at his truck and I was like, no I don't,

721
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm gonna go take some cash out.

722
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,340
Just so nakedly corrupt.

723
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,440
I like that.

724
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,940
That is kind of awesome.

725
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,540
Yeah.

726
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,440
Anyways, that's how I was here.

727
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,140
Yeah, I know.

728
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
That was not the least of my woes.

729
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,140
After that, I went on my merry way.

730
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,340
I got to the bridge.

731
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,740
Luckily, I decided to cross on a Tuesday morning.

732
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,440
So there was no one waiting.

733
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,340
There was no line to the bridge.

734
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,740
There was no one on the bridge.

735
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,240
Nice.

736
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,540
And coming out, there was completely no traffic.

737
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,580
So I was sitting out of there in like five minutes tops.

738
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,820
Nada.

739
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,260
I got a little lost in Laredo because it's such a shit town.

740
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,660
But I got my permit and I was on my way.

741
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,620
But before I left Laredo, I saw a little bump on my front tire.

742
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,260
I was like, hmm, that doesn't look big, but I think that's always a problem.

743
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,500
So I was a little worried, but I just kept going.

744
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,620
That happened, that was like, what, Tuesday?

745
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,740
Wednesday, I went to hang out with a friend.

746
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,060
And we go have lunch, and we come out of lunch,

747
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,500
and what do I see on my tire?

748
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,860
On the same exact tire, but this.

749
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,580
No.

750
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,380
This gnarly slash on my tire.

751
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,540
A slasher.

752
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,580
A slasher attacked me.

753
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,620
This is horrible.

754
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,100
This is the worst news.

755
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
This is one of the worst things I've ever heard.

756
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,300
I have been a victim of a racist crime,

757
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,400
and I don't know when it happened,

758
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,540
but I'm so thankful that he decided to do it

759
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,940
on the one tire that was already damaged.

760
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,900
So it didn't cost me more than a single tire to get replaced.

761
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
- That is amazing.

762
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,580
- So that's why I remain steadfast on my thinking

763
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,680
that Texas is based and we should all completely move here.

764
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,540
- I would love to move.

765
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,460
I would love to get a compound, man.

766
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,060
Oh, I want a compound so badly.

767
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,100
- You can actually do a full fantasy factory in Texas.

768
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,380
- We could actually do the, what's it called,

769
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,420
the gemstones, like down here.

770
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,660
- You wanna do a church.

771
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,500
- Yeah, we could do a church.

772
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,340
- The pod church.

773
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,580
- The podcast church.

774
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,940
- Where we all live on the same area.

775
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,580
- Can you imagine Caleb with like a Kenneth Copeland face?

776
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,200
- Who dat is?

777
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,060
- Like the guy who looks insane.

778
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,940
You know who Caleb Copeland is?

779
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,140
- The boyfriend?

780
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,260
- No, that is crazy that they don't know him.

781
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,620
- Who is Kenneth Copeland?

782
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,820
- But it would be cool if we had a huge property

783
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,300
and we all had houses in each corner of it

784
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
and we had to drive quads to go do the podcast.

785
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,140
- We need quads.

786
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,740
(laughing)

787
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,260
We need quads.

788
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,380
- I think we would die if we were on a quad.

789
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,940
- We had to drive 15 minutes on a quad

790
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,140
to get to a shared meeting spot.

791
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,980
- You don't know this guy?

792
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,820
- Oh, that guy.

793
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,660
- Yeah, the pastor. - I don't know who that is.

794
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,980
I don't know why I said, "Oh, that guy."

795
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,420
- The pastor with the insane face.

796
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,920
Oh shit.

797
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,020
Whoa.

798
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,800
He looks cool.

799
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,160
He looks grumpy.

800
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,480
He looks like a, sorry, mini pants.

801
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah, he does.

802
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,800
He looks exactly like the, uh, Walter.

803
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,240
Yeah.

804
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,800
Yeah.

805
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,300
He's speaking of Walter.

806
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,280
I have a New York complaint.

807
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,320
Oh, go ahead.

808
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,200
Let it fly.

809
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,840
No, I knew it was coming.

810
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,160
I knew one day the rose tinted glasses were going to fade.

811
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,040
The sheen of this amazing city was going to wear off.

812
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,160
So three days ago.

813
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm fully stink maxed.

814
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,480
I'm ready for my shower.

815
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,440
Yes, sir.

816
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,840
And I go and I turn my shower on.

817
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,640
And what do I have?

818
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,360
No hot water.

819
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,960
Oh, so I call my super.

820
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,560
And he doesn't answer.

821
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,880
What's a strong word?

822
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Oh, oh, you don't know about supers.

823
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,920
What's a super?

824
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,760
They're guys who live in the building who never answer the phone.

825
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,280
Yes.

826
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, that's cool.

827
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
Yes.

828
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,880
I called the maintenance guy.

829
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,800
He says, I'll take a look at it.

830
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,520
Nothing happens.

831
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,800
Second day.

832
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,120
Call again.

833
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,200
No answer.

834
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,880
Third day today.

835
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,840
Call three times in a row.

836
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,480
Turns out he's on vacation.

837
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,560
Oh my feet up on the beach right now.

838
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,280
Bro.

839
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,440
He's probably drinking one of these Montauk summer.

840
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,880
Else they point summer.

841
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
-Meanwhile, I-- -The taste of the summer.

842
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,820
--am fully stinky.

843
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,980
My hair is greasy.

844
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,920
The worst thing is, yesterday, I ate Popeyes.

845
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,880
-No.

846
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,680
-I had extremely nasty, gross diarrhea.

847
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,600
I wanted to take a shower to rinse it out of my butthole.

848
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,440
-Yes, after he found out that he didn't have to eat hot water.

849
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,760
-After you already knew that the hot water was gone,

850
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,320
you decided, "I will eat Popeyes."

851
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,680
-Yes.

852
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,440
and I took a cold shower and I backed up slowly

853
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,280
like into the shower to get the water into my asshole.

854
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
- I bet that was hot.

855
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,480
(laughs)

856
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,680
I bet that was fucking hot.

857
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,320
- And then what would you know,

858
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
30 minutes after I get out of the shower,

859
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
I have to have diarrhea again.

860
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,340
- It's a vicious cycle.

861
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,240
- And I thought, I can't do it again.

862
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,260
I can't live like this.

863
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,100
I can't take a second cold shower.

864
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,080
- You don't like cold showers?

865
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,120
- No, it's horrible.

866
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,080
- They're amazing.

867
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,540
- I think your opinion of a cold shower

868
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,840
is directly related to how much hair you have.

869
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,760
- I think that I probably experience cold showers

870
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,440
maybe worse 'cause it's pure scalp.

871
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,160
- Yeah, but it, here's the thing, right?

872
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
- Yeah, but it doesn't stick around.

873
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,760
- It doesn't hold the cold in for me.

874
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,600
- The coldness doesn't stick around.

875
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,000
- Well, but I know you're wrapping your hair in a towel

876
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,540
and doing a Marge Simpson with it.

877
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,960
You don't have to lie to me.

878
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,160
- I mean, not in the shower.

879
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,240
- Well, in the shower, you're already cold.

880
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,800
There's already cold water being sprayed

881
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,880
- All on your beautiful body.

882
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,980
- That's not how that works,

883
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,000
'cause it feels even colder,

884
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and it becomes like being whipped by a cold wind, you know?

885
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,520
Like your hair turns into a whip of ice.

886
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,840
- Have you ever worn a shower cap?

887
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,000
- Well, that's what I did,

888
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,840
is I wore my hair up so I didn't get it wet.

889
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,360
- I find cold showers pretty refreshing.

890
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,280
I end every shower with a little cold area.

891
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
- I do the same thing.

892
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,400
- It's nice.

893
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,840
you need a little heat.

894
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,680
- That is true.

895
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,200
- You don't wanna wash your body in cold.

896
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,040
- It is, yeah.

897
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,860
- You wanna refresh yourself in cold.

898
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,640
- The hotel I stayed at in DC this past weekend,

899
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,440
my hotel room, the shower had no hot water.

900
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,280
But I didn't even complain.

901
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,120
- That sucks.

902
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,800
- I'm such a baby.

903
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,280
'Cause like, I was just thinking,

904
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,120
what are they gonna do,

905
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,940
send me to another room

906
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,720
and I gotta move my one bag over there?

907
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,840
That sounds like a nightmare.

908
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
- Yeah.

909
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,500
- I'm not doing that shit.

910
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,960
So I just took three cold showers while I was there.

911
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,120
- Dude, I love hotels.

912
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,400
Hotels are so sick.

913
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
- Me too, man.

914
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,600
- They're so awesome.

915
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
- I love hotel, it's the best sleep,

916
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,720
it's the only good sleep I ever get is in a hotel.

917
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,360
- Maybe that's just because your wife isn't there.

918
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,600
- That's true, but also I think it's the blackout curtains,

919
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,320
the blackout shades.

920
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,800
- There is nothing that a hotel should have--

921
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,120
- Wait, your bedroom is in a different room

922
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,360
than your windows.

923
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,760
- But the window, the door has windows to the bedroom.

924
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,360
- So you need a blackout curtain for the bed,

925
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,680
for the bed door.

926
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,400
I sleep with a sleeping mask on these days.

927
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,040
Really?

928
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Yeah.

929
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,240
If I'm trying to get a good night's sleep,

930
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,200
which is not that often, but if I am, I wear my sleeping mask.

931
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,680
Do you find that the mask creates blemishes

932
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,320
or sits on your face, do you think?

933
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,280
No, I wash it pretty often.

934
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,680
I wash it pretty often.

935
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,800
And it's pretty breathable.

936
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,360
I got a nice one.

937
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,680
It was $25 if you have to know everything

938
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,080
about my personal finances.

939
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,880
I do.

940
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
I was very interested.

941
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,960
- You know what I want to do though?

942
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,060
I want to go to a hotel that has a pool, man.

943
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,080
Let me swim, man.

944
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,920
- Dude, that's--

945
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,680
- In a hotel pool?

946
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
- Yes, are you crazy?

947
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,640
- Are you crazy?

948
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,680
You're gonna get HIV, the virus, the parasites.

949
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,520
- I got-- - Don't give a fuck

950
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,480
about getting HIV.

951
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,080
- I got something to put into this conversation.

952
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,160
- Put that.

953
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,060
- Just 30 minutes ago, I was in the pool at this hotel.

954
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,040
And it was so relaxing.

955
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,680
- You people are crazy. - Rex, this is the most

956
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,360
sanitary pool you can get in.

957
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,520
These are chlorinated to the point where you walk into the room

958
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,760
and you're having some kind of aging orange attack.

959
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,200
Who fucking cares even if it's completely dark shit in there?

960
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,280
You just take a shower anyways afterwards.

961
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,520
Yeah. Well, not me.

962
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,560
When I'm ... If there's a hotel with a pool,

963
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,840
my shower is the pool.

964
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay, that is crazy.

965
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,840
How's that crazy?

966
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,560
There are used condoms and plastic bags and diapers.

967
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,120
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

968
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,320
You're hanging out in an odd motel, man.

969
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
You're not in a motel. That is a motel.

970
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,000
That is a motel.

971
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,800
Do not, do not, you know, don't come down here.

972
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
- Do not besmirch the good name of hotels.

973
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,840
- The sanctity of hotels.

974
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,040
This hotel has graced me with hot water,

975
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,080
fast enough internet so I could do my job.

976
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,160
- It only took them eight minutes

977
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,560
to download Google Chrome, y'all.

978
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,800
- I did, let's not talk about that.

979
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,360
I have a kitchen in my room,

980
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,040
even though the fare is so cheap.

981
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,000
I get this beautiful breakfast

982
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,920
every single day of my mornings.

983
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,760
Look at that.

984
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
- Look at that Texas waffle.

985
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,320
- Where am I gonna get that anywhere in this world?

986
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,600
- Hotel pools are nice.

987
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,440
- Yeah.

988
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,160
- I will say, I grew up going to a resort pool.

989
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,840
So I am like, you know.

990
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,640
- Are you anti-water park as well?

991
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Any public pool?

992
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,520
- I haven't been to a water park in a long time.

993
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,880
- I'm not gonna lie, I don't like water parks.

994
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,720
- I love them.

995
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,560
- I think they're stinky.

996
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,360
- I'm not opposed to it, but as I got older,

997
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,200
it became like grosser to me.

998
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,560
- Is it an ache of yours?

999
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,680
- It's not, well, let's not go too far.

1000
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,840
- It sounds like an ache of yours.

1001
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,840
- I just would prefer not to be touched by that water.

1002
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,200
- We should all do a getaway at some Mexican beach.

1003
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,680
- We should go to Atlantis.

1004
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,920
(laughing)

1005
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,140
That's an actual resort.

1006
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,360
You're laughing.

1007
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,200
I'm laughing.

1008
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,040
Because you think I'm talking about

1009
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,300
The lost city.

1010
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,500
The lost city from far history.

1011
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,340
But no guys.

1012
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,160
Atlantis Resort.

1013
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,940
This is a resort.

1014
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,900
And I, a kid that was,

1015
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,340
that I knew from.

1016
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,020
We should go to Sandals and share a room together.

1017
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,860
I'm down.

1018
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,980
My brother knew this kid who was like

1019
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,660
the son of the owner of Atlantis or something

1020
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,500
when we were growing up.

1021
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,320
And they were like close friends

1022
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,160
and kept being like,

1023
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,420
man I'll take you guys to Atlantis.

1024
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,380
I wanna take you guys to Atlantis so bad.

1025
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,860
So we went to go to Atlantis and see the mermaids and he never did man.

1026
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,180
He got addicted to drugs.

1027
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,300
Oh, well, many of the relatives fall into this fate.

1028
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,580
I've never been to a rich guy's son thing to do.

1029
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,160
Yeah.

1030
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,620
I've never been to an actual Island.

1031
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,940
This looks scary, man.

1032
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,060
I went to the Bahamas.

1033
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,500
That's the only place I've ever been.

1034
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,660
That was not technically in America.

1035
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,740
When my parents got divorced the first week, my dad was like, we're going on a

1036
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,480
cruise y'all and we went to the Bahamas for one day.

1037
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,840
-Did you share a room with your dad or did he have his own?

1038
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,640
-No, we had two sets of bunk bed for me, my dad, and my two brothers.

1039
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,280
-Tom was not having any sex.

1040
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,440
-Oh, fuck no, man. We all got so sick.

1041
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,400
-Yes, that seems to be the only reason to go on a cruise.

1042
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,040
-That's funny how as soon as--

1043
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,360
Yeah, it's like a place for adults to be college students.

1044
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,440
I think they're just like cheap vacations.

1045
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,600
They're cheaper than any hotels.

1046
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,680
Yeah, and they have an all-cruises,

1047
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,480
well, maybe not all-cruises, but this cruise had an all-in,

1048
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,480
all-you-can-drink-booze option that was like...

1049
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,680
What the fuck else are you going to do?

1050
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,600
That is sick.

1051
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,240
You paid double the ticket for unlimited all-you-can-drink-booze.

1052
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,040
they give you a wristband and you just say,

1053
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,960
"Give me a gin and tonic."

1054
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,800
And they have to give it to you.

1055
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,920
- Most of the time you guys have been to like a place

1056
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,740
that's just like an all-inclusive,

1057
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,560
where they take care of all of your needs.

1058
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,080
- When I went to Cancun when I was 12 years old

1059
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,400
and I drank so many strawberry daiquiris

1060
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
that I threw up in the pool.

1061
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
(laughing)

1062
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,040
- Oh, that's why you don't like pools.

1063
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,600
You think kids are throwing up in that shit.

1064
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,680
(laughing)

1065
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,000
- I love all-inclusive.

1066
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
I love not thinking about my life.

1067
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,880
I love just going to get fat and drinking.

1068
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,080
- They handle everything, man.

1069
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,920
- I love that.

1070
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,760
- I had a bunch of steak.

1071
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,580
- That's how I really need,

1072
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,240
that's how I've been probably since I cruised.

1073
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,640
- Life should be every single day.

1074
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,240
- Life should be all inclusive.

1075
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,080
- I need servants to cook me awesome food.

1076
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,520
- I feel like-- - That sounds so amazing.

1077
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,640
- It doesn't feel wrong to go to Mexico and have servants,

1078
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,560
but I feel like it's wrong for you to go to Cancun

1079
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,920
and have servants or something like that.

1080
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,760
- Me?

1081
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,600
- Yeah, you.

1082
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,420
- What's that?

1083
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,260
- These are your brothers.

1084
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,100
- I don't give a shit.

1085
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,880
- Yeah, you should have solidarity with them.

1086
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,720
Me?

1087
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
They would kill me in a heartbeat.

1088
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,720
You know, in Cancun, they basically have the same living conditions as they do in Dubai,

1089
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,720
where they just make all the staff sleep in this one big stinky room.

1090
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Really? I don't believe that. In Mexico?

1091
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Yeah.

1092
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Wow.

1093
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,720
It's pretty cool. And every single morning, they have to come up and serve you all your treats,

1094
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
all your drinks.

1095
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Whoa.

1096
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
And you give them one peso as a tip.

1097
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
No, I give them a dollar for their cooking.

1098
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,460
- I know a couple of comedians who did like,

1099
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,140
like cruise ship gigs,

1100
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,900
where they live on a cruise ship for like six months,

1101
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,240
and they do like improv in some ship.

1102
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,500
And that seems like,

1103
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,200
they always talk about it like it was hell,

1104
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,940
but it seems amazing.

1105
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,740
- Yeah. - I think for 30 days,

1106
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,700
it would be cool.

1107
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,500
- You have to do one hour of work every day.

1108
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,820
- Yeah, but you can't leave.

1109
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,140
- You can leave, you just lose all your money.

1110
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,500
Okay, so this was like recommended to me a couple of times

1111
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,460
like when I was in school.

1112
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,820
One of my teacher was like,

1113
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,420
yeah, if you just like go work at a cruise

1114
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,980
for like a couple of months,

1115
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,540
you basically make so much money

1116
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,140
because even if they don't like pay you like that much more

1117
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,340
than you would make like at a normal hotel,

1118
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,420
you pretty much, you like don't leave.

1119
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,380
So you don't spend it anywhere.

1120
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,940
Yeah, it is all inclusive.

1121
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,580
You just put yourself in like a prison

1122
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,180
basically for a couple of months.

1123
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,060
Then you come out with a bunch of money.

1124
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,300
There's nothing wrong with prison. Many people leave prison enriched.

1125
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,620
They have master's degrees and a new religion.

1126
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,180
So basically that's, that's what life was.

1127
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,540
And I think I could have done it if I was desperate enough.

1128
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,940
But, uh, I think that's the chip sailed.

1129
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,260
I don't want to be in prison anymore.

1130
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,340
Very, very funny.

1131
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,140
That ship sailed.

1132
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,180
Very funny.

1133
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,940
That is very, very funny.

1134
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,660
I think I would like doing something like that though.

1135
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,820
I would love to have some, some job that just like deletes a year of your life.

1136
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,380
You know,

1137
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,160
like ice fishing or something?

1138
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,920
When I was a kid, I really wanted to be an

1139
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,300
Alaskan crab fisherman.

1140
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,940
Yeah.

1141
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,820
Because of that show.

1142
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,260
And I was obsessed with that show.

1143
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,060
And my mom is so kind of neurotic that she was like,

1144
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,420
I was 10 years old saying I wanted to do the

1145
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,060
reality TV show job.

1146
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,500
And she was like, no, it's too dangerous.

1147
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,340
You're going to die.

1148
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,880
She was like, really?

1149
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,820
She talked me out of it.

1150
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,060
When I was 10 years old, she thought that that dream was

1151
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,300
going to persist for another decade.

1152
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,140
Yeah.

1153
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,300
But it did not. I really, I don't care about the deadliest catch anymore.

1154
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,300
I've been watching these videos, you guys watch these videos of this guy who's a lobster fisherman?

1155
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,300
You're gonna have to be more specific.

1156
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Yeah, because there's so many of those guys. Well, I do have like a, I have come across

1157
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,300
some TikToks of like guys who just like go out on the water

1158
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,300
and what they post the most I guess is just like them like getting

1159
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,300
like crabs and just like taking all the barnacles off them. Oh yeah, that's

1160
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
That's what this guy does too.

1161
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,000
He takes, he gets lobsters and he says,

1162
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,540
"We're gonna fix this guy up."

1163
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:09,140
He takes like pliers, he takes all the barnacles off him,

1164
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,400
gives him a little piece of fish

1165
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,640
and throws him back into the ocean.

1166
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,040
That sounds like it would be fun to do.

1167
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,080
But he does not, strangely enough,

1168
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,340
does not make that many videos about the thousands

1169
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,920
of lobsters he catches a day that get turned into food.

1170
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,760
Crazy.

1171
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,720
Well, listen, well, I thought they were just like doing like,

1172
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,980
they're dropping like the big cage

1173
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,820
And then sometimes they get like crabs and lobsters

1174
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,820
and I'm like, no, we're not here for these.

1175
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,500
- No, this guy, he only throws back lobsters

1176
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,060
that are too big, 'cause if they're past a certain size,

1177
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,220
then you have to throw them back legally in Maine.

1178
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,980
- Have you seen like the praying crabs

1179
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,340
with like the big bellies

1180
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,020
and like the millions of eggs that they have on them?

1181
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,860
- They're beautiful.

1182
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,860
- Have you seen a blue lobster?

1183
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,560
- I have never seen a blue lobster in person.

1184
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,400
I've seen photos.

1185
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,740
- Photos. - Photos.

1186
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,220
- I've seen photos of these.

1187
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,160
- I like fishing, I would like to go fishing again.

1188
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,000
I haven't gone in many years.

1189
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,400
- I've never been fishing.

1190
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,240
- Really?

1191
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,060
- Yeah.

1192
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,900
- That's crazy.

1193
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,800
- We need to, Brian's been talking about

1194
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,280
chartering a boat.

1195
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,720
- Ooh, that'd be fun.

1196
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,980
- On the sound or something.

1197
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,460
- Off where, like New York?

1198
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,340
- Yeah, you can like charter a fishing boat.

1199
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,820
I think it's like 500 bucks and you go out

1200
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,880
and you fish for a day.

1201
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,600
- Yeah, and you get beer.

1202
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,280
- And you get beer and pizza.

1203
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,380
- Yummy.

1204
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,840
- Wait, do you get pizza in the boat?

1205
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,540
- Um, I would hope so.

1206
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,180
- You could just order the pizza ahead of time.

1207
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,780
They have a little cabin cruiser.

1208
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,820
- Well, it's not gonna come to you in the water.

1209
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,420
- Well, I don't know what these pizza guys are doing.

1210
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,980
- There's a microwave.

1211
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,420
- Okay, I'm sold.

1212
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,340
I'm gonna go fishing on the microwave boat.

1213
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,340
- Have you guys ever stayed on a houseboat?

1214
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,160
- No.

1215
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,700
- No. - He's thinking.

1216
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,020
but wow, that was a long time to think about that question.

1217
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,580
What could have possibly been the weird house that you stated

1218
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,700
that you thought it was maybe a houseboat?

1219
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:08,260
There was some friends of my grandma that had a huge mega yacht.

1220
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:08,980
Wow.

1221
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:15,100
I think they sold it before I was able to be on a boat.

1222
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,380
They are completely broke now, which is also funny.

1223
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,660
You can be on a boat whenever.

1224
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,900
And they lived, and here's the thing too,

1225
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,940
they lived in a house that was shaped like a boat.

1226
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,980
- Wow, that's dedication.

1227
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,620
- It was, it was a beautiful house.

1228
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,000
- When I got moved into college in Boston,

1229
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,860
my mom came up and it was like the week

1230
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,780
that everybody was moving into college.

1231
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,860
So Boston has like 50 colleges,

1232
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,620
so there was no like cheap hotels or Airbnbs,

1233
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,260
except she found a listing on VRBO

1234
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,620
that was, it was like houseboat, sleeps four.

1235
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,200
And she drove up with like all my shit.

1236
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:01,060
And we get there and it was not a houseboat, it was a boat.

1237
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:01,900
- Just a regular boat?

1238
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,620
- It was just a regular fucking boat, man.

1239
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,820
It was a boat that had cushions on it,

1240
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,660
on like a couch, and that was the bed.

1241
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,580
And it was one of the worst nights of sleep

1242
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,860
of my entire life.

1243
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,620
I kept thinking that somebody was,

1244
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,540
there was no lock on the door.

1245
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,700
So I was like, and I'd never been to Boston before.

1246
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,700
I was like some crazy guy's going to come in here and start fishing or something.

1247
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,140
Yeah. In your butthole.

1248
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,980
Yeah. I mean fishing for something.

1249
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,100
Whoa.

1250
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,780
My dad had a boat with like a little cabin in it and uh,

1251
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,260
when Arizona, yeah, he, it was about two hours away that he would go to,

1252
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,500
that's the dream about this.

1253
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,460
Yeah. But he, whenever he would get so mad at his girlfriend,

1254
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,020
he would just go there and sleep for two days.

1255
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,860
(laughing)

1256
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,680
- Wow.

1257
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,260
- And it had like, you know, if you were at the dock,

1258
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,300
you could get like a DirecTV and like,

1259
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,300
you had like a little 20 inch TV.

1260
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,700
So he'd watch like football and take phone calls on it.

1261
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,540
- That's sick.

1262
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,360
- Just completely ignore everyone.

1263
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,660
- I used to want to live on a boat so bad.

1264
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,820
Like there was this documentary about this girl

1265
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,940
who was like 16 or 17 that came out when I was in high school

1266
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,780
and it was about her,

1267
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,900
like she went all the way across the world by herself

1268
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,380
on a sailboat.

1269
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,220
And I was like, I'm gonna do that shit.

1270
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,940
And then I watched two YouTube videos about sailing

1271
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,220
and it seemed so hard, man.

1272
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,500
- Yeah, absolutely not.

1273
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,060
- I think that's the same case with like the people

1274
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,240
who like talk about living in a,

1275
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,060
like a van.

1276
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,740
- Yeah, van life, man.

1277
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,700
- Like they set up like all these videos

1278
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,860
about them like making this van like beautiful,

1279
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,180
but they're like, where do you go pee and poop?

1280
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,020
- Out the war.

1281
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,260
- I have a bucket that I keep around

1282
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,140
and then I throw it out every once in a while.

1283
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,540
- Yeah, the stink bucket.

1284
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,380
- The stink bucket.

1285
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,380
- I've been known to admire the nomads in my time.

1286
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,180
- Really?

1287
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,900
- Yeah, the transient souls

1288
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,340
who travel across this great nation.

1289
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,800
But at this time in my life, man,

1290
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,860
I'm getting too old for that shit.

1291
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,700
- You are.

1292
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,580
- I don't wanna ever sleep in a car again.

1293
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,060
- The moment you taste a bit of comfort,

1294
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,060
it's impossible to go back.

1295
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,460
Me and my buddy John, we used to, both of our parents,

1296
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,060
we had two parents between the two of us,

1297
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,060
he would, they hated marijuana.

1298
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,020
They hated it so, so much and we could not,

1299
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,640
and they knew that we liked smoking it

1300
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,740
and they would not let us go to their house

1301
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,140
to smoke this stuff.

1302
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,420
But they also hated each other,

1303
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,860
they never talked to each other.

1304
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,380
So we would say, I would say, I'm going to John's house,

1305
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,820
John would say, I'm going to Caleb's house,

1306
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,660
and then we would go and sleep in his Passat and smoke weed.

1307
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,620
Wow.

1308
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,580
And I slept in that car probably 40 times.

1309
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,980
- That is fucking awesome.

1310
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,820
- It was so awesome, man.

1311
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,780
We would listen to WTF with Mark Maron and smoke weed.

1312
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,100
Guys, this has gotta be the ultimate vibe.

1313
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,500
- You had a gay boyfriend.

1314
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,780
You were in a gay boyfriend relationship.

1315
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,620
- No, he was Christian.

1316
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,860
- Okay.

1317
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,140
You guys never kissed?

1318
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,460
- We kissed, but not like that.

1319
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,300
- Okay.

1320
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,260
- Just indirectly, but--

1321
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,300
- Kissed in a funny way, like guys like to do.

1322
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,060
Do you guys want to become digital nomads with me?

1323
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,900
No.

1324
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,340
You know, I just said I don't want to, but yeah, I do.

1325
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,700
Yeah, I'd like to completely retract my previous statements

1326
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,220
on being a digital nomad.

1327
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,660
I think you are the one who has the most easiest life

1328
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,460
to just be on the road,

1329
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,980
because you live in such a small space.

1330
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,820
I have a dog. No offense.

1331
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,940
No, this is you, man.

1332
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,820
I have a dog, I have a wife.

1333
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,820
I got issues, man.

1334
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,020
- Yeah. - There's stuff I can't,

1335
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,860
people depend on me.

1336
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,820
I'm sending checks back to Africa, man.

1337
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,560
I can't do this shit.

1338
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,460
- And you have to show up in person to do the podcast.

1339
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,300
- That's true.

1340
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,120
- Well, that's true.

1341
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,100
- You gotta go back to prison every single Tuesday.

1342
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,620
- It would be funny to have two vans

1343
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,380
and then you just have someone else

1344
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,580
drive a different van to go podcast in.

1345
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,540
- That's my office.

1346
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,380
That's actually a good idea.

1347
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,860
See, I could do two vans.

1348
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,180
A two van lifestyle, two van life.

1349
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,660
That's a great idea.

1350
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,660
- Double wide.

1351
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,380
- Yeah, we're like, yeah, 'cause if I am getting bad sleep

1352
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,820
or my wife's mad 'cause I'm farting or something

1353
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,540
'cause I drink beer, I'm gonna go to the boys van.

1354
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,380
- Go to the fart van.

1355
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,200
- Bye bye.

1356
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,540
See you in Idaho.

1357
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,380
We're driving.

1358
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,220
- That's a horrible idea.

1359
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,580
- It would be cool to do like a John Madden-style

1360
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,020
touring podcast, but you never get out

1361
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,820
and like do anything in front of anyone.

1362
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,300
- We should ride bikes all across the country

1363
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
and do podcasts while we're on the bikes.

1364
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,040
Like a regular bicycle?

1365
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,940
When I was young, many, many years ago,

1366
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,380
everything like that was so interesting to me.

1367
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,120
I wanted to do the Appalachian Trail so, so badly

1368
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,880
until I found out there was bears on the trail.

1369
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,360
And then I didn't want to do it so much, man.

1370
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,060
I do not want to-

1371
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,900
You can scare them off.

1372
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,100
Maybe you can.

1373
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,020
I'm four feet tall.

1374
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:03,960
What am I going to do?

1375
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,060
You're also the youngest of everyone here.

1376
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,240
I'm four feet tall and I look exactly like a fish.

1377
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,880
- I would not do well with a bear.

1378
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,800
I have a salmon colored skin.

1379
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,620
- Are you a good swimmer?

1380
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,240
- I'm one of the best swimmers in the world.

1381
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,160
- You can just swim upstream and get away from him.

1382
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,760
- Well he's very aerodynamic.

1383
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,080
- Bears are lightning fast.

1384
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,920
People don't know about bears.

1385
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,640
- Can you put your headphones the way you had them

1386
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,640
before we talked? - Way back here?

1387
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,800
- Yeah, just for a treat.

1388
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,600
Just a visual treat for the video watchers.

1389
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,760
Caleb somehow gave himself a receding hairline

1390
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,880
while already being bald.

1391
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,160
- I have a receding hair, my hairline is fully receded.

1392
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,600
If it goes any further than this,

1393
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,520
it's God is almost not real.

1394
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,800
(laughing)

1395
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,640
Almost.

1396
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,720
- Still believe.

1397
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,640
- Still believe, 'cause he's given me

1398
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,000
so many amazing blessings.

1399
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,880
Like this second Montauk Summer Ale

1400
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,000
that I'm about to crack open.

1401
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,320
- Wow. - Let's go.

1402
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,780
- This is how good this beer is, guys.

1403
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,200
I gotta like a beer a lot to drink two on this show.

1404
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,040
- That is true.

1405
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,280
- Or it needs to be in a 12 ounce can

1406
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,040
instead of a tall boy.

1407
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,440
- 'Cause it's 50 minutes in, you didn't really drink it

1408
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,280
that fast. - Yeah.

1409
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,740
- The shenanigan is not even done,

1410
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,360
and I do feel it in my head.

1411
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,680
- You are wasted. - This is okay.

1412
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,120
- You are wasted as fuck, man.

1413
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,280
- That's not true, but I'm also,

1414
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,360
I wanted dinner, and I feel like I don't wanna drive

1415
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,780
to the Whataburger anymore.

1416
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,160
- You acting like a slut, 'cause you're so wasted.

1417
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,720
- I'm not acting like a slut, stop.

1418
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,800
- You're going wild. - Stop.

1419
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,840
- You are being a hunk. - No, I'm not.

1420
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,360
Stop, I'm so shy. - Did you guys have

1421
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,120
Girls Gone Wild in Mexico?

1422
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,040
- Yeah.

1423
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,880
- That's awesome.

1424
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,700
Was it different?

1425
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,040
Or was it like a port?

1426
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,040
Was it like, "Girls Gone Wild Mexico"?

1427
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,360
- It was dubbed badly.

1428
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,640
- Well, that is really sad for the big fans.

1429
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,880
- Los señoritos es gone wild.

1430
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,720
- Tetas oculos.

1431
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,560
- Yeah.

1432
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,240
- Yeah, that's what they were saying basically.

1433
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,000
And they would just go like, "Woo!"

1434
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,520
And I'd be like, "That's awesome."

1435
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,000
- That little jingle, I can almost hear it now

1436
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,500
from all the times I stayed up till 2 or 3 a.m.

1437
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,840
watching Adult Swim as a 12-year-old.

1438
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,240
- I remember one time waking up to,

1439
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,240
like I fell asleep to Comedy Central,

1440
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,440
waking up to one of those commercials,

1441
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,080
and I had a boner already when I woke up.

1442
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,240
(laughing)

1443
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,200
- That's so crazy.

1444
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,840
No one ever wakes up with a boner.

1445
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,320
- But it was like I had been watching,

1446
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,920
I remember thinking, this is how dumb I was as a kid,

1447
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,080
it was probably one of my first wake-up boners,

1448
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,800
I was like, oh my God, just the sound of Girls Gone Wild

1449
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,280
made me get a boner in my sleep and woke up with one.

1450
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,120
- Yeah.

1451
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,040
(humming)

1452
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,880
- Yeah.

1453
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,040
(humming)

1454
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,320
- I don't remember anything.

1455
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,400
- Uh, have we talked about

1456
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,880
Wardell on here?

1457
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,960
- Oh, about how he kicked us out of his house

1458
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,560
to jack off to Girls Gone Wild?

1459
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,520
- Yeah.

1460
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,120
- That was so funny.

1461
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,240
I don't know if we talked about it.

1462
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,080
- No.

1463
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,840
- Yeah, we were at Wardell's house and he was like,

1464
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,100
(laughing)

1465
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,360
Probably not a story he wants out there,

1466
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,000
but you know what?

1467
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,840
He doesn't know.

1468
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,200
Actually, I think he does subscribe to the Patreon.

1469
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,600
- No, he doesn't listen to this one.

1470
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,760
- He definitely doesn't listen to this one.

1471
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,600
- Brandon, if you're listening, may God speed.

1472
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,720
But one time we were at his house and he was like,

1473
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,040
"Dude, do you guys remember Girls Gone Wild?"

1474
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,920
And we were like, "Yeah, we remember Girls Gone Wild."

1475
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,560
And he was like, "Bro, let's watch one of the commercials."

1476
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,400
And he pulled it up.

1477
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,400
He watched, we watched probably 15 of these commercials.

1478
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,080
And then he was like, man, that is some funny ass shit.

1479
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,080
You guys need to leave my apartment right now for no reason.

1480
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,160
And we're like, okay.

1481
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,620
- Yeah, he was so excited,

1482
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,320
ran to his room, grabbed his laptop,

1483
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,000
and started looking at r/girlsconfile.

1484
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,600
(laughing)

1485
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,600
And then he was like, oh, I'm so tired.

1486
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,000
- As we left his apartment, he like,

1487
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,520
Literally like we heard the padlock snap and we saw the shades get drawn

1488
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,920
Been doing cocaine like

1489
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:17,520
So late does anyone notice how late it got it was like 11 o'clock

1490
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,180
Yeah, it was so fucking awesome. I respected him so much for that. It really was a legendary moment, dude

1491
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,240
But I mean who can blame a man these commercials were hot yeah, I

1492
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,720
Mean is there even something to

1493
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:39,420
Jack off to the girls gone wild like it's just what they're showing their breasts. Yeah. Yeah, this guy's

1494
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,260
So are you so desensitized a female nudity at this point that you even?

1495
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,920
Have to assume someone's looking up here on reddit. He is like

1496
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,120
I

1497
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,320
I would believe that.

1498
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,620
It's not true.

1499
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,620
I think there's more than monster in those cans.

1500
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,620
Yep.

1501
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,120
I think that's where you shoot.

1502
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,120
In the cans?

1503
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
Yeah.

1504
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,120
Like what are those?

1505
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,120
Like a...

1506
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Like a spittoon.

1507
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,120
Ding.

1508
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,120
I don't think...

1509
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,120
I've never had that much aim with where it goes.

1510
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,120
Me neither, man.

1511
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,120
It just has a mind of its own.

1512
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,120
It just goes where it's going.

1513
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,620
This shit is disgusting.

1514
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,120
360 degree cone of danger.

1515
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
I hate it.

1516
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,120
You hate jizz?

1517
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,960
- Me too.

1518
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,780
- I hate jizz.

1519
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,040
- If I get jizz on my hands,

1520
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,580
I mean, my day's ruined, I think.

1521
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,420
- Yeah.

1522
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,400
- 'Cause every single person,

1523
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,160
and I meet a lot of people, you know.

1524
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,680
I'm out on the campaign trail.

1525
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,000
Every single person I meet, I'm shaking their hand,

1526
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,640
and I am saying to myself, like,

1527
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,040
"This is disgusting, this guy doesn't know

1528
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,080
"that I jizzed on these 14 minutes ago."

1529
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,140
(laughing)

1530
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,160
It's really nasty.

1531
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,180
- Yeah, that is nasty.

1532
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,240
- Not a good habit.

1533
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,660
- You wash the hands before you hit the trail?

1534
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,500
- Just rub them together.

1535
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,300
- Yeah, with really warm water.

1536
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,500
And then they're like,

1537
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,080
hey, did you like break your remote control,

1538
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,840
use some super glue or something?

1539
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,180
I guess something like that.

1540
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,020
- Yeah.

1541
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,860
- I've never understood that.

1542
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,340
Is cum sticky?

1543
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,580
Is that how it like dries or something?

1544
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,420
- Have you never,

1545
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,700
you've never gotten cum on yourself

1546
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,700
and then used warm water

1547
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,580
and it turns into a second skin?

1548
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,620
- It's never come with its entire life.

1549
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,820
(laughing)

1550
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,660
- I don't get it.

1551
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,020
Is cum white?

1552
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,940
Or is it bright, bright red?

1553
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,100
I really never got a clear answer on this in sexual education.

1554
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,180
I usually just--

1555
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,260
I usually just do it like yellow into the toilet.

1556
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,620
Into the toilet?

1557
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,980
Yeah, long yellow jizz.

1558
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,100
No, I mean, I just--

1559
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,420
I've never left it around long enough for it to be like--

1560
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,740
Hear no evil, see no evil.

1561
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,660
I like that.

1562
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,940
It's gone as soon as it's out.

1563
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,540
We're not examining it.

1564
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,340
This means you go in your mouth.

1565
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,180
This is what this means.

1566
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,620
- How would that mean that?

1567
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,500
- 'Cause you're like, yeah, I've never even seen this stuff.

1568
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,580
It goes in your mouth.

1569
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:57,660
- I've seen it for like less than a minute.

1570
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,620
- Yeah, of course, listen, I'm not sitting there

1571
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,260
watching it, seeing if it's gonna do something.

1572
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,100
- Well, that's what I'm saying.

1573
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,460
I've never seen it get sticky.

1574
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,860
I feel like that's one of those things

1575
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,380
that's just like a joke.

1576
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,540
- No, it is sticky.

1577
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,380
You are--

1578
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,860
- This is crazy.

1579
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,420
- You are infertile.

1580
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,260
- You have, you're shooting blinks.

1581
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,180
- No.

1582
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,020
- Yes.

1583
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,860
- No.

1584
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,420
- You're a complete alien from hell.

1585
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,440
- What does it look like?

1586
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,180
Describe to me Jizz.

1587
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,620
- Just right now.

1588
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,060
- It's white, it's gross.

1589
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,620
- This is like the--

1590
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,820
- Fills up your belly button.

1591
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,660
- This is making it so,

1592
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,900
he's never seen it his entire life.

1593
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,980
- You've never seen Jizz?

1594
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,180
- It's like an egg yolk.

1595
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,900
- Yeah, okay.

1596
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,660
That might be a little thick.

1597
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,360
That might be a little bit thick and clear.

1598
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,180
- Yeah.

1599
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,860
I like that I said egg yolk

1600
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,200
and you and I both knew what I meant by that.

1601
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,540
- Yeah, it's mucus.

1602
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,420
- Yeah.

1603
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,420
- Oh yeah, you did say yolk and you meant white.

1604
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,260
(laughing)

1605
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,820
Egg yolk.

1606
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,980
That's bad.

1607
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,780
If it looks like egg yolk,

1608
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,500
that is exactly,

1609
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,140
that's exactly a chart of like good, good, good,

1610
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,620
really fucking bad.

1611
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,220
Go to the ER right now.

1612
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,500
You have egg yolk jizz.

1613
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,180
Well I used to worry because you know I drink like two monsters a day forever

1614
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:23,340
that my cum would be like you know like if you left a lightsaber face down on

1615
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,300
the ground. You know how they say this? What are your descriptions to that?

1616
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:33,020
Nothing makes any fucking sense. Like if you just had like acid and just like ate through the

1617
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,740
ground. Oh like it's bubbling. Yeah like it's like in Breaking Bad when it eats

1618
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:43,700
through the the bathtub and the body parts fall through. Do you think you have a thing where you know what

1619
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,060
I hope people will say that if you drink pineapple juice,

1620
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,380
it'll taste good,

1621
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:51,020
but yours is just gonna give someone a lot of energy

1622
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:51,860
for like an hour or so,

1623
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,700
and they'll just crash it down.

1624
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,140
- Oh, that's a pretty good idea.

1625
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,620
Yeah, 'cause your body is,

1626
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,120
you're getting rid of the different toxins in your body.

1627
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,460
Caffeine has gotta be among some of the worst ones

1628
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,420
in your body.

1629
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,060
You have so much excess caffeine

1630
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,660
that it probably does go straight to your loads.

1631
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,020
- I do think it would be cool

1632
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,540
if I could somehow figure out the perfect cocktail

1633
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,140
where if someone interacted with my cum,

1634
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,240
they just had like a heart attack from all this.

1635
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,240
Oh wow. Yeah, that's really smart.

1636
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,040
You know, it'd be cool to get your jizz.

1637
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,660
You guys know like Pharaoh fluid?

1638
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,260
Yeah.

1639
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,060
They're like magnetic. It'd be cool to do that.

1640
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,980
Yes.

1641
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,500
Maybe load up on iron.

1642
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,580
Right. Oh, dude.

1643
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:34,660
And then you start, you know, or I mean, you could get the same results, I guess,

1644
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,060
putting it on like a subwoofer.

1645
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,340
I think that should be cool.

1646
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,940
I think that would be a very cool video.

1647
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,500
Somebody has some spare jizz sitting around.

1648
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,840
Yeah, just go ahead and try that out.

1649
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,980
That'd be terrible. Don't try that.

1650
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,580
I'd like to see it at least once before I pass away.

1651
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,240
Yeah, it'd be cool if you just came quicksilvered.

1652
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,620
That would be fucking cool.

1653
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,180
Mercury, just fucking.

1654
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,880
Yeah.

1655
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,660
Shoulda snot like this conversation.

1656
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,660
Yeah, I'm sorry. He's...

1657
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,560
Dude, he's so mad, bro.

1658
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,660
He's saying, "Please, no more."

1659
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,200
Shut the fuck up!

1660
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Why is this so pissed? This isn't supposed to be a sleep.

1661
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,700
Give me one minute, Phil.

1662
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,200
Give me one minute and I will take you wherever you want.

1663
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,200
[dog whining]

1664
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
Okay.

1665
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
No!

1666
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,200
Bastard dog, man.

1667
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
Isn't it his bedtime?

1668
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:30,200
Uh, he was in the crate for like two hours while I went to the show, so...

1669
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,200
I'm gonna leave him out until I probably go to bed.

1670
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Okay.

1671
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
But he probably does need to pee, so I do need to go.

1672
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
Motherfucking dog, man.

1673
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,200
I hate dogs.

1674
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,680
episode we're gonna open up Rex to see what's inside of him.

1675
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,640
Alright I'm down. Alright bye. Bye.
