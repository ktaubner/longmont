Yeah.

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,360
I've talked about the one that my brother had.

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
What was it called?

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Billy Bob.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,680
It was a picture of Voldemort and he just, he would like go on to kids' statuses like

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,840
on Truth Is Things and just say like fucked up shit.

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
Whoa.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,120
My favorite Facebook story is Neil had this fake Facebook profile.

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,680
- Jakey Dinger. - Jakey Dinger.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,240
- Yeah, and he added a whole bunch of his family members

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,280
and then he like overheard his dad talking

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,760
to another one of his family members or something

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,480
and being like, "This crazy guy, Jakey Dinger,

29
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,360
"is trying to add all of us, watch out."

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,200
- I just had one-- - Beware Jakey Dinger.

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,120
- I like deleted Facebook in high school

32
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,120
and started using one for Spotify called Jacobi Pimento.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,240
- Yeah, I heard that.

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,760
- And then I used that for a while

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,260
That was my real Facebook account.

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,680
- That's pretty cool.

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,680
- Yeah, I was never on Facebook very much.

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,000
It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
I was a MySpace fan.

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
I was a huge MySpace fan.

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,800
- I'm going through the Billy Bob page.

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,440
- Spit some heat from it, what's up?

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,320

How many likes did the status have?

48
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Four.

49
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Whoa, who liked it?

50
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080

51
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080

Yeah, well, yeah, he's asking to get raped on Facebook.

60

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,320
Well yeah he's asking to get raped on Facebook.

67
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,080
Here's a, oh man, it's a picture of like a fat woman and a guy touching her boobs.

68
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,320
It just says me and my wife doing it.

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,280
That's what's up.

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
My ass is covered in yogurt.

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,280
That's fucked up.

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Do it.

78
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Yeah, sign in.

79
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,200
No, it's just someone's grandma's name as a status.

00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,820
Yeah, it says grandma.

83
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,200
Someone's grandma's name.

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,440
Dude, I'm finally hitting it.

85
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm ready to be outside again.

86
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Yeah.

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,080
Yeah, it's getting fucked up.

88
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,080
I've run out of, I thought that this would never happen.

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,940
I don't want to play any more video games.

90
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,780
- Yeah.

91
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,620
- Yeah.

92
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,140
- That might be dangerous to admit online.

93
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,180
- I know that everyone's like is talking about

94
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,220
crazy quarantine dreams and it's kind of hack,

95
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,300
but like my, I had this nightmare the other night

96
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,980
that just like transcended what I thought was possible

97
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,820
in a dream.

98
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,340
Like, I just like, like being stuck at home.

99
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,420
Like I had this dream where-

100
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,420
You have to explain.

101
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,900
The dream was, I was just sitting like for hours in the dream, just sitting on death

102
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,220
row and just thinking, "I'm gonna die soon."

103
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,220
That was the whole dream.

104
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,220
Jesus.

105
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,220
Oh, fuck, dude.

106
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,220
I had a pretty-

107
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,980
It was like the worst dream I've ever had.

108
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,060
I didn't even know that was possible to have a dream that was just thinking.

109
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,620
I had a dream like two weeks ago, a dream that I don't remember what the context was,

110
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,880
but Anna Kachian was in my dream.

111
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
- Oh, okay. (laughs)

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,820
- And then, yeah, and then,

113
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,580
and then I was like, I gotta,

114
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,260
I have to change something about my life,

115
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,260
and I didn't have another dream for a week.

116
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,820
She like stole my dreams for a week.

117
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,180
(laughs)

118
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,740
- I fuckin', like the other day,

119
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,060
I fuckin', the other day I fell asleep,

120
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,900
and then,

121
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,280
oh, shit.

122
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,420
- What?

123
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,100
- I might be gettin' that stim check, boys.

124
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,540
- Whoa, what happened?

125
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,100
- I don't know, it says it accept,

126
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
I accepted my non-filer.

127
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,940
So.

128
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,780
Nice.

129
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's try and get--

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,440
I should probably check that.

131
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,220
Let's try and sue the federal government

132
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,660
to get you the money that you're not legally entitled to.

133
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,160
But I had a dream,

134
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,020
literally I fell asleep for like an hour

135
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,260
and then, this is what's been happening to me.

136
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,140
I fall asleep for like an hour, maybe like three hours.

137
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,820
I get up at like one o'clock and then I can't go back to bed

138
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,620
and then I just try to stay up for the rest of the day

139
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,860
like I did in fucking high school.

140
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,300
And I woke up because I had a dream

141
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,000
that I was younger and I was playing in the pool with my dad

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,820
and my dad turned into the Hulk

143
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,580
and beat the shit out of me underwater.

144
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,580
Dad dreams are always so fucked up, dude.

145
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,180
I used to have this recurring nightmare as a kid

146
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,460
where my dad would become a mime

147
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,820
and he would put me in a big invisible box

148
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,220
and I would starve to death.

149
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,940
Yeah, pretty scary, right?

150
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,980
Yeah, I'd starve in the dream to death. I had a dream recently, this is another

151
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:47,220
like sign that this that I just need to like go to Costco, but I had a dream that

152
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,620
I was in a Zoom comedy show. Oh no. Yeah, I had a dream that I was in a Zoom comedy

153
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:02,020
show and nobody could hear me. Oh my god. Pretty fucked up stuff dude. Yeah.

154
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,540
Here's the, oh I just found another Billy Bob status.

155
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,820
I'm super sad, I developed Down Syndrome over years of abuse.

156
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,820
I'm crying.

157
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,820
Nice.

158
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Poor Billy Bob.

159
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,820
Oh I'm crying and it's overflowing my home in the sewer.

160
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,420
That would suck if you, that would really suck if you could develop Down Syndrome.

161
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,540
It would be so funny if Pat accidentally, like he searched Billy Bob and he just found

162
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,380
a real account that he's reading from.

163
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:37,500
not the one that... A man who developed Down syndrome, Benjamin Button style. A guy that

164
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:51,020
looks like Voldemort. Yeah, he just looks like that. Yeah. I should make a new fake Facebook.

165
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,060
I'm gonna call it Cameron Patrick and I'm just gonna post about boys all day. Yeah.

173
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
I think it might just be, I don't know.

174
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
No, it wasn't.

175
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm going to try and log into it.

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,400
Okay, what's the password?

177
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I don't know.

178
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Yeah, you do.

179
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
It's definitely something he doesn't want to say out loud.

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Yeah.

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
Well, no, because it might be a very, I don't remember the email.

182
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,400
He's spelling out a letter with his finger right now on the screen.

183
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Oh, oh shit.

184
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Oh, yeah, don't say the password.

185
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Oh my God, yeah, don't say it.

186
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,800
No, I just, I don't know the email, but I think the password might just be.

187
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
The email's the same as the password.

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
He spelled email out.

189
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
Oh God, Jesus Christ.

190
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Oh fuck.

191
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
I didn't even, yeah.

192
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Wow.

193
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,200
I didn't know email addresses could be that long.

194
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Yeah.

195
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
We should.

196
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,240
I don't know why my brother made his email for that account.

197
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,200
We must secure a future for the white race.

198
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,640
The email is super-cadastralistic-expialidocious, but they slipped the n-word in there somewhere.

199
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,680
And you can't figure out where.

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
Yeah, and he can't remember which word.

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:29,720
I've been thinking about converting to Islam also.

202
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,280
That's what's been going on with you.

203
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,960
I told you man, I'm approaching the void.

204
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,560
I think I'm going to convert to Islam.

205
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Just because I'm...

206
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Brother Caleb.

207
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,440
Brother Caleb.

208
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,240
I was imagining growing up just the worst beard of all time.

209
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,720
I have a bald spot just like right under my chin and just growing out one of those big

210
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,200
like Philly Muslim beards wearing the square hat doing the other stuff.

211
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Doing whatever Obama does.

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Have you seen Four Lions?

213
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Um.

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Seen what?

215
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Four Lions.

216
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
It's this movie.

217
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
At the zoo.

218
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Yeah.

219
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Yeah.

220
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I only saw three.

221
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Four Lions at the zoo.

222
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,340
It's this Chris Morris movie, um, about like some, like would be jihadist or

223
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,460
whatever, and they're all just like bumbling, like the whole thing.

224
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,020
There's just like one white British Muslim guy who tells them all

225
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,380
to eat like their SD cards.

226
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,540
That would be Caleb.

227
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,580
Yeah.

228
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,580
That's going to be Caleb in like two weeks.

229
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,660
No, I'm going to be like Vinny Paz from Jedi Mind Tricks.

230
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,100
I'm just gonna become like a conspiracy theorist, a Muslim who, um,

231
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,660
hates gay people.

232
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Yeah.

233
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
That's what I think.

234
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
I think I'm going to lean that way.

235
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,940
I wanted to be Muslim in high school.

236
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
You wanted to be Muslim in high school?

237
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,900
You can just do it.

238
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
You don't have to.

239
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
I know.

240
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,900
That's what I didn't understand.

241
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Just go for it.

242
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
That's why I never made it.

243
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
I didn't understand that.

244
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
He's trying everything.

245
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
I've been trying everything.

246
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,900
I just can't be Muslim.

247
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,620
Yeah.

248
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,780
I don't think I've ever wanted to convert to any religion.

249
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,780
No.

250
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,780
No.

251
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:14,780
I think either atheism or Gnosticism or whatever.

252
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Gnosticism.

253
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
He wants to be a Gnostic?

254
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
He wanted to be Gnostic.

255
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
What does that mean?

256
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Gnosticism?

257
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
That's like this shit.

258
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,780
That's like the winged eye serpent shit.

259
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
That's like super esoteric.

260
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Now I want to do that.

261
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Yeah, it's sick dude.

262
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
You should do that.

263
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
I'm going to do that.

264
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
I'm going to do that.

265
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,780
I'm going to do that.

266
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
I'm going to do that.

267
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
I'm going to do that.

268
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,780
I'm going to do that.

269
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm going to do that.

270
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
I'm going to do that.

271
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
I'm going to do that.

272
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
I'm going to do that.

273
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
I'm going to do that.

274
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,940
- Dude, you should be a Gnostic.

275
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,320
- Might I suggest Islam.

276
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,740
Dude, we should just all become Muslim, dude.

277
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,940
- Yeah. - That'd be sick.

278
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,380
Yeah, man, we could be like, yeah,

279
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,940
you could, we'll all be brother Cameron Patrick,

280
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,920
brother Cameron Patrick, brother Caleb Cameron,

281
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,660
brother Cameron Caleb.

282
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,980
- The honorable brother Elijah Caleb Muhammad.

283
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,280
- Yeah, Caleb X. - The way that your

284
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,320
- Your virtual background keeps cutting out the headphones

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,680
on your head, makes it look like you have no ears.

286
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,640
It's really funny. - No it doesn't.

287
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,960
- Yeah, it's really great.

288
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,800
- No. - I'm gonna wait

289
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
for it to happen again and take a screenshot.

290
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,120
- You shouldn't.

291
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,040
- I'm going to.

292
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,860
- Did it do it?

293
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,080
- All right, keep talking about Islam.

294
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,280
- Yeah, dude, we should, I'm just saying it would be fun.

295
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,200
We get matching rugs.

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,800
We could print cool, we get like a Supreme logo,

297
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Supreme box logo rug. - Oh yeah, we could get that.

298
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,240
Yeah, that'd be fucking sick.

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
- You know, that'd be kinda sick, right?

300
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,000
- Yeah.

301
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,840
- We could, what else could we do?

302
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,240
We could, we get dreadlocks and nobody could be mad at us.

303
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,160
Yeah, okay, I'm in.

304
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Yeah, we could have, oh no, we should become Sikhs.

305
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,420
Yeah.

306
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,640
Dude, we could get that fucking sword.

307
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,700
We can become Sikhs?

308
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,980
That's what, yeah, S-I-K-H, the religion.

309
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,580
Oh, I thought you wanted us to revert to,

310
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,420
so what we're gonna do is--

311
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,680
Revert, he said revert.

312
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
We're gonna--

313
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,960
Oh, which way, which way is reverting?

314
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,960
We're gonna revert to six year old children

315
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,040
but also become Muslim.

316
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,080
No. No.

317
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,880
No, that's what this dude thinks

318
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,240
that the Sikh religion is.

319
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,680
(laughing)

320
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,280
I thought you said six.

321
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,160
No, well yeah, I did say six.

322
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
Six was a pretty good age. Plural of a Sikh.

323
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,800
Six was a pretty good age, I think.

324
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,220
Yeah, for you, 'cause you got to make out

325
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,320
with six year olds.

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
No. (laughing)

327
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, you did.

328
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,160
That's why you liked it.

329
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,440
Straight, no.

330
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I never kissed anyone.

331
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
Patrick, when was your first kiss?

332
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,680
I was 15.

333
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,320
To who?

334
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,360
My first girlfriend.

335
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,680
15 bro.

336
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,080
You late as hell, bro.

337
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,100
So?

338
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,120
I don't, I don't like sex.

339
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
That's what's up.

340
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,680
That's what I like to hear.

341
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,960
See, you're already halfway to Muslim.

342
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,760
Let's go.

343
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah, that's true.

344
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,320
Yeah.

345
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,160
Patrick's Patrick is a Muslim for two hours and he just starts, uh, everything

346
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,200
around him starts turning to giant cartoon pork chops and he's just drooling.

347
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,440
(laughing)

348
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,400
He wants what he can't have.

349
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Or we could convert to,

350
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,280
Hinduism would be cool,

351
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,360
'cause we could have multiple arms installed.

352
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,340
- What if we convert to Pastafarianism?

353
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,280
- Oh my God, that'd be so sick, dude.

354
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,480
Yeah, I'm converting to whatever religion

355
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,560
Is the fish with the legs on the back?

356
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,400
Yeah.

357
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,240
Of the car.

358
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,060
That's fish.

359
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,120
That's when you follow fish on Twitter.

360
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,800
Yeah, that's when you follow the jam band.

361
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,760
Yeah.

362
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
That'd be sick.

363
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,760
Reba's a great song.

364
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,400
I don't think I've heard a single fish song.

365
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah, I think I've avoided it pretty well.

366
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I didn't listen to fish until like this year.

367
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,280
But I did tell people I listened to fish when I was 12.

368
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,400
I did tell one of my teachers.

369
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:03,560
because she was playing a fish song and she was like I'll give out five pencils to anyone

370
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:11,500
who can tell me who it is and then she had to give me a hint but I was like oh this is

371
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,960
fish I've heard of fish I also listen to Primus and she was like oh my veteran brother listens

372
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,920
to Primus and I was like wow we're gonna be friends forever.

373
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
It's gonna be me someday. I'm gonna be your veteran brother.

374
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Yeah, I'm gonna join the Marines.

375
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
And I'm gonna join your family.

376
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Is Primus a Marine? I feel like...

377
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I don't know. I don't...

378
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,820
Primus to me is like... as far as a fan base goes, I feel like it's closer to like...

379
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,820
It's the same guys as like people who loved Tool in like 2006.

380
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
Yeah, I think you're right.

381
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Well, Les Claypool is an amazing bassist.

382
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
I still think that.

383
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Yeah, but it's just like guys who have like...

384
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
like buy shirts at Walmart.

385
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,740
and have like big beards and long hair.

386
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,620
- Definitely, like Primus definitely has like a fan base

387
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,740
of like dudes who are like--

388
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,140
- Guys who have a t-shirt that says,

389
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,500
don't touch my D20.

390
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,660
- Yeah, and also seven year old liars.

391
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,820
- Yeah, I was in the two groups.

392
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,780
- You were seven, dude.

393
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,620
You were seven.

394
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,820
You were in the sixth grade.

395
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,420
You were in the seventh grade, you were seven years old.

396
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,500
- 12 is supposed to be the age of truthfulness.

397
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,820
- I listened to Primus a lot.

398
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,660
- A lot.

399
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,820
yeah my name is mud now yeah seventh grade see he's lying he's trembling

400
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,220
because he's lying so he knows that Allah will punish him for eternity sounds like

401
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,460
you listen to Lymus dude what's the yeah what's the glue song yeah

402
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:42,780
Lymus and Lymus and Lucy yeah that's right Primus and Lucy yeah I don't know

403
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,780
what that would sound like. It would probably just sound like...

404
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,780
It's like the... all the vocals are just the...

405
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Yeah. Yeah.

406
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
So it's just like...

407
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,780
It's like the bass riff to "My Name Is Mud" and then once he starts singing it goes like...

408
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:11,780
Primus and Lucy. Alright, one in the bag. Four more.

409
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,300
Four more. Four more what? Four more awesome wordplay. Four more years.

410
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,300
How about instead of tool it's drool. And it's my cousin drool. What about instead of

411
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:32,420
tool? Yeah, yes it's drool and instead of pneuma it's pneumonia. And it's pneuma pneuma.

412
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,700
Instead of pneuma it's pneuma pneuma. Yeah that would be fool. And instead of stink fist

413
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
It's spit, spit.

414
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Stink piss.

415
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
That's doesn't fall, it's spit, spit.

416
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Links, links, fist.

417
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
And it's about, oh it's LinkedIn.

418
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah, LinkedIn.

419
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah, what if it's marketing tool?

420
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
And it's LinkedIn.

421
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh my god.

422
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
There, we did it.

423
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
That's fucking good.

424
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
We're done.

425
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
We can end the episode.

426
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
We don't need to do anything.

427
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
No.

428
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Yeah, it sucks that all my stim check is literally just going towards rent.

429
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,400
Yeah, dude, you live in a crazy expensive apartment.

430
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
You're a fool.

431
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,080
It's not that expensive.

432
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,160
It's so expensive.

433
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,400
I want to do the AI Patrick lunches.

434
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Oh, yeah.

435
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Go to TalkToTransformer.

436
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,600
Yeah, in the Discord people were sending.

437
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,320
I don't remember who.

438
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,960
There's this AI website, TalkToTransformer.com.

439
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
It's really great.

440
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,040
You type in something and it completes the text using AI.

441
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,920
That's where Kayla Pitt's peeing penis came from.

442
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
That's true.

443
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,240
Patrick say something.

444
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Somebody kept typing in Patrick colon I had the craziest lunch today comma I had and then

445
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,720
completing the text and it makes great Patrick lunches.

446
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,680
Okay here's one.

447
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,360
I had the craziest lunch today.

448
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,500
I had iced chicken nachos and a dip.

449
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
It was really great.

450
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,860
Oh, the old socks, a fresh pair of old socks with mint and ginger and garlic.

451
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,660
Could have eaten this again, my favorite place in town.

452
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,100
That is one of the funniest things about Patrick, like going to a restaurant with him, is that

453
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,660
he acts like he's been to any restaurant.

454
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,100
He's acts like he's been there a million times.

455
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,300
Like we went to some like Korean barbecue place and he had never had Korean barbecue

456
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:28,420
before and they bring out all like the like toppings for your like meal and he

457
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:34,300
just started eating those individually like all the like jellies and shit and I

458
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,940
was like what are you doing he's like it's just like all the just like all the

459
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,100
pre food stuff no cuz we did have Korean barbecue I've never had it on like the

460
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,140
thing we went to the place down the street from my apartment that's what I'm

461
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,500
talking about that's where you did that oh okay I thought you're talking about

462
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,740
about the time we got Korean barbecue in LA.

463
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,380
- No, that was like the--

464
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,220
- No, I asked you--

465
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,900
- That was the most dangerous place ever.

466
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,820
- I asked you what it was and you said that

467
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,660
that's like the Korean version of tortilla chips

468
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,240
at a restaurant.

469
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,660
- I don't think I said that.

470
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,780
- You said that, you said that.

471
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,380
- I don't think I said that.

472
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,860
- You said that.

473
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,680
- I don't think so.

474
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,180
- You said like the kimchi and stuff,

475
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,420
you said that that is like the equivalent

476
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,060
of getting chips and salsa at a restaurant.

477
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
- I don't think so.

478
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,180
I'm gonna have to disagree with you here.

479
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,260
I think your brain said that to you so that you could eat goo.

480
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Mmm.

481
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Patrick eats goo.

482
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Well, either way, I don't, it was good.

483
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,940
Patrick eats goo is good.

484
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,860
All that stuff stands on its own.

485
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,700
Man I fucking miss Korean barbecue right now, man.

486
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,660
I wanna- Make some at home.

487
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,020
That place in LA, well, at home it's not endless.

488
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,540
Yeah, how would you make- That's the fucked up part about-

489
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,660
You would have to have a dump truck of old meat that is frozen so you can't smell what

490
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,740
it really smells like and just cascading onto a hot pan because that's what Korean barbecue

491
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,900
is.

492
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
It's really good.

493
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
I love Korean barbecue, yeah.

494
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,980
I probably ate five pounds of beef that day that we went to that Korean barbecue place.

495
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Oh, that place in LA?

496
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,700
Yeah, we had to eat five pounds of beef because fucking...

497
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,700
Oh yeah, they charge you if you don't eat all the meat.

498
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,380
Yeah, anything that you don't eat, they charge you and you had a time limit.

499
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,380
I would try not to.

500
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,660
They start charging you after you're in there

501
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,860
for like an hour.

502
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,720
So we had to eat all that in an hour.

503
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,200
- Yeah, man, it was not,

504
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,140
yeah, we didn't know that when we ordered it.

505
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,380
So we got like four giant bowls of frozen meat.

506
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,220
- Yeah.

507
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,420
- And the thing, I don't remember,

508
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,260
my guess is that--

509
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,020
- There was like a family having a birthday party next to us.

510
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,860
- Yeah.

511
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,680
- And we're just like--

512
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,520
- It was just us and then a fucking birthday.

513
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,540
- We're eating half of a cow.

514
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,500
Yeah, dude, it was fucked up.

515
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,020
And it's just like the most disgusting place ever.

516
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,600
But it was it was like 11 bucks for all you can eat. Oh, yeah. No, that was the best part about it

517
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,820
Yeah, I dude I straight up I like

518
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,860
Maxed out my credit card just going to LA to go on a food tour

519
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,380
You did a good job. There's a good you saw it all. Oh, yeah, I saw I got everything I needed out there

520
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,620
I keep trying to generate Patrick lunches and it just over and over is saying I had the craziest lunch today

521
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,820
I ate iced tea every time I click

522
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Here, I got one.

523
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
You can't get to say anything else.

524
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,140
I had the craziest lunch today.

525
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,860
I had three big breakfasts of roasted chicken and then I had some cornmeal pancakes and

526
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,900
some berries and cinnamon sugar and then some healthy brown rice.

527
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,460
But the idea of it is you have an extra special meal like that and you don't know how to eat

528
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
healthy with it.

529
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,940
You don't want to put the calories in yourself but also you want to make sure the calories

530
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,680
aren't enough to put on your weight.

531
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,940
So I'm like, I think I need to learn to love baked goods.

532
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,820
But then Kelly says, yeah, I think so.

533
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,420
And then Patrick says they're better than pizza and then Kelly says oh man I'm like come on

534
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
pizza seriously.

535
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,620
I had the craziest lunch today.

536
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:01,340
I had iced tea and watermelon sliced soup in a bagel and sausage roll with balsamic reduction

537
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,620
and I know those two probably probably not together in my mind but they are together

538
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,260
in the same little bagel.

539
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,380
Okay, okay I added one word and it got way better.

540
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,860
Okay, so I made it.

541
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,360
Patrick, I had the craziest lunch today.

542
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I had poop.

543
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,660
So here's what it is.

544
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,140
I had the craziest lunch today.

545
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,820
I had poop in my vagina for five hours.

546
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,220
Audio cuts out.

547
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,220
American.

548
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,420
And you ate it.

549
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,140
Patrick, I ate it.

550
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
I ate it.

551
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,420
And I ate it in front of the toilet right in my bathroom.

552
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,720
And it tasted like poop.

553
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,100
And it felt like poop.

554
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,820
But I took a picture and uploaded it to my blog so people could see it.

555
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,580
I posted it to Tumblr too. I mean it's not quite a fit to blog about. It's definitely not fit to talk about it on Twitter.

556
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,080
American. It's actually kind of disgusting and a little gross. Patrick.

557
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,880
Yeah, I have a nice vagina so it's not so.

558
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
[Patrick laughing]

559
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I, uh...

560
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,380
That's just what Patrick said.

561
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,880
Alright, I typed it in. It's, uh...

562
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Patrick. I had the craziest lunch today. Caleb is a pedophile.

563
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
No, it doesn't say that.

564
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,880
It's a good time to be a pedophile in America.

565
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,000
Aaron, this thing is in so much trouble and the only reason it's still a thing is it because

566
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,440
Donald Trump gave it his stink eye.

567
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
I got it.

568
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Wait.

569
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,120
Aaron, do you ever get the sense that you're funny and creative and you can create great

570
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,120
material but nobody in Hollywood is listening to you?

571
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,760
Patrick, and the majority of people in Hollywood are white males.

572
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,320
Aaron, yeah.

573
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,760
Patrick, and white males seem to enjoy you being racist and misogynistic.

574
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I was joking about these pastel.

575
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Okay, listen to this lunch.

576
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Patrick, I had the craziest lunch today.

577
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
I had over 1,500 brioche rolls.

578
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
I love these things.

579
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
And other stuff.

580
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
And the brownies.

581
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Also got some ice cream and a Milky Way treat with the treats.

582
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
I'll have a hog platter.

583
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,760
This is the best.

584
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
I had iced tea and a bowl of that tiny, yummy, gelatinous, yellow food.

585
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,440
creating one right now. Let's see. So Patrick, how many of these lunches have you had? None

586
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,160
of them. I don't believe you. Whoa, this one knows that you don't drink coffee. What? It

587
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,040
said, "Today I had ice water with Nutella." That was amazing. Patrick doesn't drink any

588
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,200
coffee. You can tell because the car keys don't work. Last time I got drunk enough that

589
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,120
I was, and I ran out of orange juice, and I considered for a while just pouring the rest

590
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,240
to the vodka in with ice and then putting buffalo sauce in it.

591
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,200
(laughing)

592
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,920
So it's like a Bloody Mary, right?

593
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,880
- Yeah, pretty much.

594
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,700
- Probably.

595
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,760
- Here's a talk to Transformer I just did.

596
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,920
Caleb Pitts is a pedophile who traveled

597
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,800
across the United States helping men

598
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,760
who had sexually abused children.

599
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,480
He would open up his home to the men

600
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,960
in hopes that they would change,

601
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,040
giving them jobs and counseling.

602
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,920
It was only when he began abusing the 13-year-old boy

603
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,840
that he was caught and the Connecticut man pled guilty to abuse charges in October.

604
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,600
Now with the help of his wife, Brett Pitts, he plans to have his own therapy session at

605
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,280
the Millbrook Cancer Center.

606
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,240
Caleb's wife, Brett Pitts.

607
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,840
Caleb's wife is named Brett.

608
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,040
No, he's not a guy.

609
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,080
I mean, she's not, that's not true.

610
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Patrick, I had the craziest lunch today.

611
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,080
I had chocolate, creamy cake, cocoa, and I ate a lot of M&M's and a ton of coffee and

612
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,240
And I was like, if I die today, I want a full body funeral.

613
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,040
Full body funeral.

614
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,840
Patrick Doran is a famous rapist.

615
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,520
An Oxford University computer science student has claimed that he was raped by a famous

616
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,480
pedophile, Patrick Doran, and detailed a story that has shocked the internet.

617
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,120
That's all we got.

618
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,040
Dude, you can hear the sirens coming for that one.

619
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,200
They're coming for you, dude.

620
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
They're gonna get you, bro.

621
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,400
Oh, there they are.

622
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,760
Caleb Pitts is a big fat pedophile, but let's be honest, no one really cares.

623
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,440
How can we possibly know if his postings were from a full blown pedophile?

624
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
We don't have access to the answers.

625
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,760
How can we call him out as a pedophile when his articles are full images of boys and girls

626
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,680
in sexual poses?

627
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,760
Even worse, he's no longer able to keep his back turned.

628
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,640
We don't even know if this little terror is real or just an internet hoax.

629
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,200
To be fair, our crime branch isn't even able to tell us if Pitts is actively planning for

630
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,760
more pedophilia because his crimes keep escalating.

631
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,840
It's unclear why Pitts would go to such a little boy's penis.

632
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,600
Patrick Doran makes child porn.

633
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,320
Doran, the Rensselaer County Judge said, is now serving life in prison.

634
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,640
Sorry buddy.

635
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,600
This website is perfect.

636
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Yeah.

637
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
It don't miss.

638
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,240
Patrick Doran got pregnant from a genetic defect.

639
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
There you have it.

640
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Wow.

641
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,320
Hold on, I'm making one right now.

642
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,480
Oh, they have prompts?

643
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,200
What?

644
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,400
What do you mean they have prompts?

645
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
This is too much dead air.

646
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Yeah.

647
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,000
Patrick Doran can't find his penis in his own fat, but instead he found out that daughter

648
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,040
Natalia, now five, would be victim of incest by her stepfather, Patrick Doran.

649
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,640
Oh my god.

650
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,600
What is right- you are one of the sickest fucks of all time.

651
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,080
These are not- yeah that's deeply fucked up.

652
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,560
Everything I just said is true and everything that Patrick just said is a lie.

653
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,480
That's one of the disclaimers of the website.

654
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:55,160
Did you guys ever do, what's the, fuck, the smart bot or whatever?

655
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Chatterbot?

656
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,740
No, no, what was the one, Jesus Christ.

657
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,200
What's like the one that everyone did in like middle school?

658
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,000
Fat Caleb Pitt sucked a baby off, did more than eight ounces of water during a marathon.

659
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm thinking I'm talking I think I was arrested. Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

660
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,080
Yeah, we're both thinking of Cleverbot. Yeah, Cleverbot was one that I would just

661
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,940
go on Cleverbot all the time and try to get her to say that she wanted to suck

662
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,400
my dick. Hmm. I think I could jack off to Cleverbot. That's very clever. That's very clever.

663
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,560
That's right. Yeah, that's right. I outsmarted the bot. The bot's like, "Well,

664
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Well well well.

665
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
You've done it again.

666
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:41,760
I guess I have to do this.

667
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,120
You should have been able to make pictures too.

668
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,940
Pictures of humongous pussies and fat vaginas and little assholes and big ass boobies.

669
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,240
But they're all robot.

670
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
They're all computers.

671
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
They're square.

672
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Here's how much I'm regressing.

673
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,560
If a computer had sex, where would it put the computer penis?

674
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,840
The slots, the drives, and the jacks.

675
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,880
It would depend on the dimension of the penis,

676
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,840
or balls, or whatever you're putting inside.

677
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
Well, yeah, but what are you putting,

678
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,880
what is the computer's penis, first of all?

679
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
So all computers are girls.

680
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,080
Okay, and I thought it was boys.

681
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,520
Count the hodges and tell me that it's not.

682
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,760
Well, no, boys are boys, and boys can fuck computers.

683
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,280
And the way that you do it is you drop,

684
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,240
you put a condom inside the hole

685
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,360
in the middle of a DVD drive, when you like take it out,

686
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,880
you know what I mean, like the hole in the middle?

687
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,560
You put it right there and you fuck the condom.

688
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,400
And that, you basically, that's the only difference.

689
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,140
It sounds like you've done it before.

690
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,480
No.

691
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
Yeah, this sounds like you've done it.

692
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,200
No.

693
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,480
No, I haven't done that.

694
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,300
I think he's done it.

695
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,840
I'm just smart. I think you've done it.

696
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,000
No, I'm an engineer.

697
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
I think Caleb did that to--

698
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,760
Nothing weird about being an engineer.

699
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,400
He did that to an old Gateway PC

700
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,920
and he pretended that the cow print was a real cow.

701
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,000
- You actually did that?

702
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,320
- No.

703
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,680
- Sounds like you've done it before.

704
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,160
- Sounds like you've done it.

705
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,640
- No, I think you actually did it.

706
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,560
- You did it?

707
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,480
- Patrick walked into H&R Block and he said,

708
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,720
"Where's the block? I wanna fuck it."

709
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,520
And then they didn't let you and you went to my house.

710
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,320
- They don't even have H&R Block close to my house.

711
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,160
- Yeah, it was a long walk.

712
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,760
- You had to go on a very long journey

713
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,880
to try to fuck the block.

714
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,480
- Yeah, you went across the whole country.

715
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,520
You broke quarantine.

716
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,620
You did this yesterday.

717
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,900
You weren't wearing a mask and you infected a thousand,

718
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,140
thousand, thousand.

719
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,300
Don't care about it.

720
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,140
What if you--

721
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,960
Don't care about that.

722
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,620
If they get infected, that's their fault.

723
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,740
I'm immune.

724
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,020
Didn't somebody yell at you the other day?

725
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,340
Oh yeah, no, somebody, so I'm wearing the red hat

726
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,540
that you gave me.

727
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,180
The wheel of honor red hat.

728
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,300
The biggest prank I've ever played on you.

729
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,500
It's the only hat that fits me, so I try to wear it.

730
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,260
It's a red hat that says,

731
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,420
make America great again on it.

732
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,740
I can't read, so I didn't know it said that.

733
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,500
Yeah, it's a red hat, it just says General something company.

734
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,260
It says Federal Emergency Squad.

735
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,500
Federal Emergency Squad.

736
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,980
So I'm actually a--

737
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,340
But yeah, it's a red hat with white letters.

738
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,900
Yeah, red hat with white letters, so I'm wearing it,

739
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,900
and then this guy who just looked drunk walked in,

740
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,540
while Dom and I were shopping. To your house.

741
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,700
Yeah, to my house, no, we were at the grocery store.

742
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,100
I wasn't wearing a mask,

743
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,780
'cause we were only getting two or three things.

744
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,780
I don't have one.

745
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
I don't have one either.

746
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
I mean just put something around your face.

747
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,780
It's kind of...

748
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Yeah.

749
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,780
But...

750
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Whatever, I just wasn't wearing one.

751
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
And...

752
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
You can just like wrap a sweatshirt around your face or something.

753
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
Yeah.

754
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,780
I...

755
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,780
So he walked up to me and he was like,

756
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,780
"You're doing the right thing!"

757
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
I was like, "What?"

758
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:01,680
Like you're doing the right thing! No masks! Look at all these creep shows!

759
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,740
They're all wearing masks! And then we saw him in the canned food aisle and he

760
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,540
walked up to somebody like they were wearing like a furry hat like they were

761
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:19,220

00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:28,860
and then their mask and he walked by them and he went "creep!" I was like yeah I

763
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:34,860

764
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,540

765
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,660

766
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,880

767
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,840
if somebody gets within 10 feet no no he doesn't he doesn't get old man getting

Punch him dude. Damn dude. I would punch, I straight up

771
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,380
If an old I would punch an old person out

772
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,700
Whoa, I don't care. I would I would beat the shit out of an old. That's a skater attitude right there

773
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,920
I would go I would go to a retirement home and if any of them talk shit to me, I wouldn't hesitate

774
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,700
Yeah, yeah, it would be on sight before they even finish their sentence

775
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,420
They're just like can you get me a glass of water and then you just decked them in their fucking fake teeth

776
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,260
Yep, yeah, I take out their teeth. Call your grandson you fucking bitch

777
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:49,020
We're ooh, ooh, you don't have tires on her on her wheelchair. You don't remember where you put your

778
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,540
You don't remember where you put your your your teeth

779
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,820
Yeah, yeah. Yeah now I know why you don't is I a fucking stupid bit

780
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,420
I just beat I just beat your brain to blue. So I'll tell you what lady those tits look like dog shit

781
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,420
How about you take those tennis balls off your walker

782
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
and stick them in your shirt. I wouldn't punch an old woman,

783
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,420
but I would do some classic style pranks on an old woman.

784
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,500
Dude, you, no, you do not,

785
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,320
you should be worried about the old men.

786
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,300
So you're punching the old men,

787
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
you should be punching the old women.

788
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,220
The old men, they all fought in World War II, man.

789
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,300
They all have glass eyes.

790
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,940
Yeah, they all fought in World War II,

791
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,340
so that means they should be able,

792
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,660
if they fought in World War II and they can't take me down.

793
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,980
But why are you punching them, dude?

794
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
You should be punching those old women.

795
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980
They didn't do anything. They didn't even help.

796
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
They were making fucking boats in World War II.

797
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,980
If they, if an old, if somebody who has like a purple heart and is a decorated war veteran.

798
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,980
A purple heart sounds to me like a monster.

799
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,980
[Laughter]

800
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,980
There's an old person who has like war medals and they can't fight me.

801
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Then they're a pussy. I'm sorry.

802
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,980
But, but, but, so now it's like you're testing them?

803
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
I thought you were just beating them up.

804
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,520
Why do you have to give them some some tests is this like how they qualify for Social Security now?

805
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,760
Yeah, it should be there's no

806
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,060
Just a point where you can't beat up Patrick. That's when they start sending you the money, right?

807
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,900
Now dude, you got it. You got to get in there and that's a really good

808
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,120
I did cuz if you can't beat up Patrick Patrick's gonna rock your shit. You're gonna die. What are you gonna do to me?

809
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,980
What are you gonna do to me Eugene? Huh? Eugene Eugene Herman? He's gonna see you

810
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:34,620
Yeah, dr. Eugene goo. I'm gonna fight. Dr. Eugene goo with logic. I'm gonna fight you with my goo

811
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,980
Yeah, I'm gonna stuff you full of it and you're gonna suffocate

812
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,380
We're gonna play Splatoon. We're gonna play games with each other and I'm gonna put a mop up in you

813
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,540
I just I want to pump glop into Pat. I want to know I don't

814
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,780
Stop saying that right now

815
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,020
Yeah, I want to I want to go to various tubes and fill you with glop

816
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,340
I'm gonna put a thin layer of glop between your skin and the meat inside you just see what I'm gonna

817
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:19,140
Do you love you with glop? I'm gonna de glop de glop you I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna just glop you and then de glop you

818
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,020
You're not gonna. No, I'm going in and out. No, no, you were not putting glop in

819
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,420
You're gonna swell up like a balloon and then shrink down to an ant and I'm gonna suck you up.

820
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,380
Here's my impression of Patrick once I glop his face.

821
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:41,860
That's what it's gonna be like. I'm gonna seal your mouth like King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt.

822
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,980
You just wanted to do your Kenny impression from South Park.

823
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,820
That's all you wanted to do.

824
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,620
I got caught. You're right. That's exactly what I started to do.

825
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,620
Fuck, he got me again.

826
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,020
I am wearing an orange hoodie.

827
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,820
Cinched all the way to my eyes.

828
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,340
Don't you get to see Kenny in the new episodes? You see Kenny in the movie.

829
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,180
What movie?

830
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
Bigger, longer, uncut. Harry Potter.

831
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,900
Yeah. Whoa. Oh, Kenny's in Harry Potter? Yeah. Oh, he's every guy who dies.

832
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,060
Yeah.

833
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,620
He's Robert Pattinson's character. Yeah.

834
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,180
Cedric Diggory. Cedric the Entertainer.

835
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Cedric, I'm so sorry.

836
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,180
Cedric. Yeah, he was pretty entertaining in that movie.

837
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
Yeah, he was. Yeah.

838
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,180
I like that movie. Yeah.

839
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,180
Cedric the Entertainer. I think that's the best one.

840
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,180
My favorite movie is Cedric the Entertainer. No, the best one is the third one by far.

841
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,180
There's like no...

842
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,180
It's definitely the third one. I disagree.

843
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,180
The best one's the fourth. No, the fourth is the second best.

844
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,180
I'm gonna talk about Alfonso Cuaron. Fourth is the second best.

845
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Alfonso Cuaron can suck my balls, dude.

846
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,180
I don't like Alfonso Cuaron. I fucking hate Gravity.

847
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,900
Gravity can suck my fucking dick but the third one is the best one.

848
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,180
He did the one that's about two friends who have sex with each other.

849
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
E2 Mama Tambien.

850
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,620
Yeah, I don't care about anything, anything, I don't care about him at all.

851
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
I just think the third one is the best one.

852
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
Doesn't that mean, doesn't that mean and your mom, your mom too?

853
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,620
The third one is good because they put in...

854
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,620
What?

855
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,260
E2 Mama Tambien, doesn't that mean and your mom too?

856
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,260
Yes.

857
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
Wow.

858
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
Congrats Patrick.

859
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,500
Just a little Spanish lesson from Pat.

860
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
El Perro.

861
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Yeah, it means the parrot.

862
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,740
What do you like about the third one, Cam?

863
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,740
What do you think it's the best?

864
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,300
I think because they add jokes in it, it's funnier than the other ones, and it's also

865
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,380
scarier because they put in scary ghosts that fly and kiss you.

866
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,260
I think the fourth one's the scariest.

867
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,260
No, the best...

868
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
No, they all...

869
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,060
Okay, but one thing I hope we can agree on is the fifth and after all suck fucking ass.

870
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,220
They're all terrible.

871
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,220
After four.

872
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,220
I don't know.

873
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,220
I don't watch them as much.

874
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,220
Once they leave school.

875
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
I watched them all recently.

876
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,060
- That's the only reason I have opinions on that.

877
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,260
- Whoa, somebody is pro school.

878
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
- Yeah. - Yeah, whoa, uh-oh.

879
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,940
- He just said they get worse once they leave school.

880
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,380
That's when the real movie starts, buddy.

881
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,380
- You know why it's worse when they leave school?

882
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,220
It's 'cause there's no more disobeying the rules.

883
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,020
Harry Potter and his friends, they go to school,

884
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,140
they disobey all the rules,

885
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,260
they go into the Forbidden Forest, okay,

886
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,780
they go to the Chamber of Secrets,

887
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,180
they go and they get the potions,

888
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,140
they do it all against the wishes of the teachers, okay?

889
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,980
- That's actually a really good point.

890
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,700
- Once they leave school, they're working with the teachers,

891
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,780
with Dumbledore to defeat Voldemort

892
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,620
who is trying to destroy the school.

893
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,780
- I would never work with Dumbledore.

894
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,180
- They're trying to fight against Voldemort

895
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,260
to blow up the, he's trying to blow up the school.

896
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,980
- I've been bested, dude.

897
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,060
This is a serious Lincoln-Douglas debate

898
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,420
and you're Douglas, you won.

899
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,900
- Yeah, I know, I'm smart, okay?

900
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,740
- I know, man.

901
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,420
That was a, it is funny,

902
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,380
why would you name it the Forbidden Forest?

903
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,340
That would just make me as like a troublemaker

904
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,460
just wanna jump in that fuckin' forest so bad.

905
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,580
Name it the like Girl Forest or something

906
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,340
and I'll never go in there.

907
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,380
- Yeah, 'cause if you have like,

908
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,700
if it's like, imagine in your house,

909
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,560
there was an, it was called the off-limits fridge.

910
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,540
- Oh, you know my ass.

911
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,220
- How fucking crazy would you go for that fridge, dude?

912
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,960
You would do every, you'd do all sorts

913
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,900
of stealth mission bullshit to get to that fridge.

914
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,780
But if they called it like--

915
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,620
- You open it up and it's full of giant spaghettis.

916
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,740
- They called it the broccoli fridge.

917
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,380
Oh my, ooh, that is kind of the forbidden forest

918
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,220
of fridges then.

919
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,060
- Yeah.

920
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,460
- Yeah, it's just a bad naming device.

921
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:22,100
I don't know why I fucking started doing this but uh I didn't realize how many I didn't

922
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,220
realize how many games there were on the internet archive.

923
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,060
What are you doing right now?

924
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,380
You're doing that right now?

925
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,380
What the fuck dude?

926
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
Yeah I'm doing it right now.

927
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,380
I'm downloading some games.

928
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Oh my god.

929
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,940
On the internet archive?

930
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,220
On like the wayback machine?

931
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Yeah.

932
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:45,700
I just downloaded, I just found a Star Wars Renegade Squadron for PSP on there.

933
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,260
Oh I think I might get, I think I might get the Jedi Fallen Order game.

934
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:55,540
I need like a, I want to play a Star, yeah cause I'm just, I'm getting tired of like,

935
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:01,580
the only game I'm liking right now is Warzone, cause Doom is just getting boring and I want

936
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,980
to get the new one but I don't want to get the new one until I finish this one.

937
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,980
Yeah.

938
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:12,380
I just need something I need something different. I need something where I control it a child. I have a binding of Isaac

939
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,900
That's pretty good as you put your child in oh shit. Oh shit

940
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:23,220
Patrick they have Yoda's adventure - no they have

941
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,300
Yeah

942
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,220
- they have Lego Star Wars - on there for windows. They have leisure suit Larry

943
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,420
They have you ladies Patrick's Patrick's gonna see some some one pixel nipples

944
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:50,420
is

945
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,860
We're just gonna do a classic gap.

946
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,020
Yeah, you sit this one out, Pat.

947
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,020
What's up, bro?

948
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,020
Not too much.

949
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,460
I heard Patrick died.

950
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
I didn't die.

951
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
I'm still alive and right here.

952
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,460
So I'm not actually...

953
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
He's not too upset about it.

954
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
I'm right here.

955
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
I'm not dead.

956
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
Usually HIV has to turn into full-blown AIDS first before it kills somebody.

957
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
I'm right here and I don't have HIV.

958
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
Pat, you can talk as much as you want.

959
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
I'm going back to the pandemic.

960
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
Oh, he doesn't have HIV anymore.

961
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,460
He has AIDS now.

962
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
Yeah, it advanced.

963
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,460
I don't have AIDS.

964
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,460
Oh, and he also apparently has dementia because he can't even remember that he had AIDS.

965
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,460
I don't have AIDS.

966
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
I don't have AIDS.

967
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,460
I don't have AIDS.

968
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,620
You do, oh and he also apparently has dementia because he can't even remember that he has

969
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,620
AIDS.

970
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
I don't have AIDS.

971
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,020
Yeah you do dude, I'm sorry.

972
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,420
I see it, it's branded on your forehead.

973
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
I do not have AIDS.

974
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
I can see it under your skin dude.

975
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
Yeah.

976
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
You can't see anything.

977
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,220
Dude, I can see your blood man.

978
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,500
You can't see anything.

979
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
I can dude.

980
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,820
I can see the Ronald Reagan chip they put in your neck when you got the diagnosis.

981
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,140
No, I put the, you can't see anything.

982
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,780
Look at the screen right now, there's nothing.

983
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,260
Yeah, that's what it's gonna look like for you

984
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,820
when you die of HIV.

985
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,660
No.

986
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,780
Just gonna be pure black emptiness,

987
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,780
just nothing but the void.

988
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,620
Here you are.

989
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,300
And a little bit of gray too.

990
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,360
Whoa, he's giving the finger, man.

991
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,380
Yeah, he's giving the old AIDS finger.

992
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,040
I don't have an AIDS finger.

993
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,880
Yeah, it is, dude.

994
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,180
I do not have an AIDS finger.

995
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,160
You do and you chase around all the other kids

996
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,980
on the playground saying, I have the AIDS finger,

997
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,820
I'm gonna touch you.

998
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,660
I don't.

999
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,980
and they run away and they get the teacher and the teacher says the teacher says Patrick we

1000
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,820
understand you're having a difficult time dealing with your diagnosis but you really cannot be doing

1001
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,220
that you can't take it out on these other kids because it's actually it's super contagious yeah

1002
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,100
we would much rather um just kick you out of the school than have these kids scared at recess

1003
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,300
they're they're not going to kick me out of school they already did i just got a letter

1004
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,620
from your principal and i i yeah no you did not get a letter from my oh you're working with the

1005
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:52,620
the

1006
00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:00,620
I'm not friends with the principal.

1007
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,620
Who's friends with the principal saying you don't want to get kicked out of school?

1008
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,620
A real kid, when someone says they're getting kicked out of school, you say that's awesome,

1009
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
but you said, "No, they're not going to kick me out of school.

1010
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,620
How are you so sure, dude?"

1011
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,620
I'm just here to eat my popcorn.

1012
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
This is seriously good stuff.

1013
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,620
I don't want to get kicked out of school because, first of all, he admits it.

1014
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,580
school and also how did you know you weren't going to kick out?

1015
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,580
You talked to the teachers and principals.

1016
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,580
Because I would miss recess.

1017
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,580
Because I would miss recess.

1018
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,620
You fucking idiot if you're kicked out of school every day is recess all day.

1019
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,500
You are so stupid.

1020
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,700
Having AIDS every day is recess.

1021
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,860
Nobody is going to make you go to school.

1022
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860
That's messed up.

1023
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,300
That's the thing about AIDS is if you get it you can just play all the time.

1024
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,300
Yeah.

1025
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,900
That's not even true.

1026
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,900
That is true dude.

1027
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,940
Play with the lives of other men in the back house.

1028
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,780
If you have AIDS.

1029
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,980
You can't, yeah, but if you can't like,

1030
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,180
if you tell your manager at Subway,

1031
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,380
hey, Daryl, I have AIDS, he's just gonna send you home.

1032
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,820
So?

1033
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,780
So, what are you gonna do?

1034
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,940
You're gonna play on your home playground.

1035
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,780
Yeah.

1036
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,780
You're gonna play in the bath, at the bath house.

1037
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,340
You're gonna play at the friggin' bath house.

1038
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,280
Here we go, resorting to ad hominems, classic.

1039
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,120
Yeah.

1040
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,420
You guys are rude.

1041
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,060
Oh, we're rude?

1042
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,900
You're rude.

1043
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,720
We're rude?

1044
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
Do you remember who gave the finger to the camera

1045
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,780
just a few minutes ago?

1046
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,140
The ace finger at that. I would say that person's,

1047
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,140
yeah, not just any finger.

1048
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,860
You need a serious attitude adjustment, buddy.

1049
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,700
Yeah.

1050
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,520
You need an attitude adjustment.

1051
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,420
I'm gonna put you in Caleb's attitude rehabilitation

1052
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,660
program. You're not gonna do shit.

1053
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,900
I am, dude. You're not gonna do shit.

1054
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,780
Oh, okay, guess whose sentence just got bumped up

1055
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,140
from one week to two weeks.

1056
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,500
That's right. You can't do anything.

1057
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,340
You're doing all the chores.

1058
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,160
You can't do anything to me.

1059
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,000
You're doing all the chores,

1060
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,840
you're editing all the episodes.

1061
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,280
You have to keep your room clean.

1062
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,700
If I see a single empty can, we're adding another week.

1063
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,540
You are not gonna find any of my cans.

1064
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,360
If you talk back to me.

1065
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,460
If you talk back to me.

1066
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,620
You are not gonna find any of my cans.

1067
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,960
Okay, I'm gonna press the mute button.

1068
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,800
You can't.

1069
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,060
On real life.

1070
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,100
You can't mute me.

1071
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,940
I can.

1072
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,760
You're not even.

1073
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,200
And you're gonna have to,

1074
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,580
and you're gonna have to clean the toilet

1075
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,760
with your mouth and your tongue.

1076
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,980
Wait, I just found a.

1077
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,940
The toilet's clogged and you have to use your foot

1078
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:17,180
unclog it. I'm still on the archive and I found... Suck the dookie out of the

1079
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:23,040
toilet buddy. Yeah. I found a... Now you have two months. I'm on the

1080
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:30,740
movies section of the website and under sci-fi and horror there's a

1081
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:36,620
downloadable movie there's like an old like... Get to it. Old movie called

1082
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:50,180
the child molested. Yeah it's a biopic about you. It's not a biopic about me! It's not a biopic about me! It came out this year and it's just about your entire life. No it's not true.

1083
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,740
Yeah and then there's a prequel called the child molested and that's also about you.

1084
00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:00,100
With a comma? There are two about yeah the child comma molested and those are both

1085
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:05,260
about you and then there's one called looking for Bigfoot and that one's also

1086
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,980
about you. There's a one called the Philadelphia Project which is also about

1087
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,380
you. None of these are about me. There's one called I am Sam that's like kind of

1088
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:20,860
about you. There's one called Precious. That one's about... Precious is about you. Sean

1089
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:27,420
Penn. That's about Sean Penn, idiot. Precious is about you. Every John Candy movie. Precious is about Sean Penn.

1090
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,420
- Sean Penn.

1091
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,660
(laughing)

1092
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,260
Yeah, it's kinda like how Sean Penn

1093
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,000
played a mentally disabled person on I Am Sam.

1094
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,840
He played a fat black woman in Precious.

1095
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,920
- Yeah, that's right.

1096
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,680
It was all seed digital.

1097
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,220
They basically did Avatar to him

1098
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,840
and made him look like Precious.

1099
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,360
Made him look like Gabrielle Sidibe.

1100
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:01,760
director the director handed the CG artist a note and all it said was make

1101
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,920
Sean Penn look like crutches. And he just had to guess what that meant. And they did

1102
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,680
they did an amazing job. And they literally won an Oscar. Let me say yeah. Did you guys ever see

1103
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,840
The Artist? Yeah, that's that the silent film one? Yeah. Yeah I saw that. I heard about that. I did not

1104
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,760
I thought it sounded so boring that I never even gave it.

1105
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,520
Thought it was pretty lame.

1106
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,360
Yeah.

1107
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,180
Why do you ask?

1108
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,640
I think, just 'cause I think that's maybe the,

1109
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,000
maybe the maddest I've ever seen my dad be

1110
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,240
is somehow when that movie won Best Picture.

1111
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,080
Yeah, dude, that movie's a piece of shit.

1112
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,960
He didn't even see it.

1113
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,240
He was just walking around for an hour around the apartment

1114
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,520
just like, "Are you kidding me?

1115
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,440
"A silent movie?"

1116
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,280
What was it up against?

1117
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,800
That was 2011, right?

1118
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,200
I think it was like American Hustle or something.

1119
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Oh yeah.

1120
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
2011.

1121
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
I remember that.

1122
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,600
I mean, I don't like that movie at all.

1123
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,480
I mean, I think it's pretty lame.

1124
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,360
Let's see, 2011 Best Picture.

1125
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
It sounds so fucking stupid.

1126
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
Oh no, it wasn't 2011.

1127
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
It was 2012, I think.

1128
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,360
Yeah.

1129
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,360
I think it came out in 2011, so it was 2012.

1130
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,360
What are you doing?

1131
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
Best Picture.

1132
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
I'm singing my Oscar song.

1133
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,360
Oh, that's why.

1134
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Oh, okay.

1135
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,120
Okay, this makes more sense.

1136
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,000
My dad was so pissed because it beat out Moneyball.

1137
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
[Laughter]

1138
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,080
And my dad was like, "Moneyball is one of the most accurate sports films of all time."

1139
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,720
And he just was pissed about it.

1140
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,480
And then Brian Posehn put out that...

1141
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,240
The Fartist.

1142
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,960
Yeah, The Fartist, like a year and a half later.

1143
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,000
Yeah.

1144
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,360
Which is such a genius move.

1145
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,760
Yeah, I'm gonna make a movie...

1146
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,320
I'm gonna make a movie...

1147
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,680
Called Brian Posehn.

1148
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,160
Called Brian Posehn and it's gonna be a silent movie.

1149
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,660
Yeah.

1150
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:50,860
No, what's a, instead of Moonlight, I'm going to make a movie now called Moon Fart.

1151
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,820
And it's going to be a comedy special.

1152
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,580
Or My Moon, My Moonlight.

1153
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,860
I'm going to do, instead of the Florida Project, it's going to be called the Florida, it's

1154
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,700
going to be called the Fart Fart, and it's going to be my new comedy album that's coming

1155
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
out.

1156
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,900
People are going to love it, dude.

1157
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,140
The Farting Project.

1158
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,140
The Farting Fart.

1159
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,700
It's going to be called Willem Dafoe Farts for 20 Minutes.

1160
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,820
Yeah, it's gonna be a 20 minute stand up special.

1161
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,820
Wow.

1162
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,820
Willem Dafoe farting and shitting.

1163
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,300
Yeah, that'd be a better movie.

1164
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,540
Did you guys like that?

1165
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,540
The Florida Project?

1166
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,540
I haven't seen it.

1167
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,540
I watched Tangerine.

1168
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,500
I'm gonna watch the Florida Project someday soon probably.

1169
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,260
I'm never, dude I.

1170
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,260
Tangerine's cool.

1171
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:39,180
I think it was just going to Emerson but just like, god damn I just can't watch like movies

1172
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,180
anymore.

1173
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,500
I don't have the patience for anything.

1174
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,260
I just get mad kinda.

1175
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,260
You should re-watch the Departed.

1176
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,660
That's what I did yesterday.

1177
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,660
I did.

1178
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,340
I did re-watch the Departed like the other day.

1179
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,780
I've never watched the Departed.

1180
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,340
Oh, dude, it's so good.

1181
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,340
Yeah, I know.

1182
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,340
I didn't get to watch it.

1183
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:00,020
I just watch old horror movies and stuff like that.

1184
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,220
That's all I really care about.

1185
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,220
It's all you care about?

1186
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,180
I mean your friends Patrick and Cameron.

1187
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,500
He doesn't care about us at all.

1188
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
I know those are my friends.

1189
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Yeah.

1190
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Whoops.

1191
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,500
You guys, you guys.

1192
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,660
Yeah, I just don't care about movies that much.

1193
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,980
I don't know, except for.

1194
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,980
Yeah, I don't like, like people.

1195
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,060
I just care about the horror genre.

1196
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,620
I've been on this tip for years and not everybody talks shit.

1197
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:28,820
I said movies suck and you guys were like movies are good man.

1198
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,820
I've never said that.

1199
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,820
I like TV better.

1200
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,820
You guys should watch Iron Giant.

1201
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,820
I don't like TV better but.

1202
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,540
Dude, TV is, TV is far.

1203
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,220
I mean the dude the office parks and recreation.

1204
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,460
What if they made they couldn't make the office the movie?

1205
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,580
Yeah, dude, a caveman.

1206
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,180
Oh yeah, caveman starring Nick Kroll.

1207
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,020
Yeah, caveman, Kroll show, big mouth.

1208
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,700
Are you kidding? Caveman, Kroll.

1209
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,180
Key and peel but it's both. Caveman, Kroll.

1210
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,820
But it's Kroll and Kroll and it's two white Krolls.

1211
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,700
(laughing)

1212
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,140
Come on, dude.

1213
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,820
That's a fucking, that's T.

1214
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,040
That's a movie.

1215
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,440
- It's called Prestige Television.

1216
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,240
It's called that for a reason, right?

1217
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,240
And the reason is that Nick Kroll has billions of dollars.

1218
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,880
- Well, the reason, yeah, the reason is

1219
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,240
because you remember that part in The Prestige

1220
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,440
when he has a bunch of clones?

1221
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,600
That's what they did with Kroll,

1222
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,680
and that's why he's in so many different shows.

1223
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,520
And that's why it's called Prestige Television.

1224
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,880
- That's how that guy gets so much amazing content out.

1225
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,800
- They should have called that show Kroll's Shows,

1226
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,680
'cause there is a lot of shows in that show.

1227
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,920
- There's tons of shows, and that's a really good point.

1228
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,160
Yeah, they should have called it Kroll,

1229
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,080
They should have called it Nick Kroll's TV shows.

1230
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,960
They should have called it TV shows.

1231
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,160
They should have called it TV and you could flip through the different shows.

1232
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Yeah.

1233
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
Oh my god, that's genius.

1234
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,760
And if you don't like one of the shows on Kroll's show, you can change the channel.

1235
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,360
You can change the channel and now, guess what, now it's Nick Kroll giving the news.

1236
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:57,160
You know, it's Nick Kroll edited into Alexandra Daddario's scenes in True Detective where

1237
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,160
she's naked.

1238
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Uh huh.

1239
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
You know what I mean?

1240
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
See, that's all, I don't care about the other stuff.

1241
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,160
We get to see Nick Kroll's juicy titties.

1242
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,160
That's a great idea.

1243
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,280
I just want to see more of Kroll's shows.

1244
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,720
I just want to see Nick Kroll just absolutely getting railed in Monsters Ball instead of

1245
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,720
Halle Berry.

1246
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,720
Uh huh.

1247
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:20,520
I want to see Nick Kroll sucking off Hugh Jackman in Swordfish.

1248
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,280
Yeah, dude.

1249
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
That's what I want to see.

1250
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,880
I want to see all of Nick Kroll.

1251
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,880
I want to see his gross.

1252
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
I want to see Kroll's Hole.

1253
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Kroll's Hole.

1254
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:41,280
I want to see his version of holes with with yeah even Stevens and he sings the

1255
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:54,280
song he sings the oh yeah he sings that he says crawling up that hole crawling

1256
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:05,380
up that show yeah I'd like to I'd like to I'd like to crawl up his urethra yeah

1257
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,340
yeah like like that fish that we were talking about the other day yeah the one

1258
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:14,080
that did that that crawls up your urethra the one that gets in Sean Williams penis

1259
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,780
in the rundown yeah it can swim up your p-stream yeah it did and then if you try

1260
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:24,420
to pull it out it's got fins so it like cut your peepee open. Why would you slice

1261
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,820
it open like a like a hot dog sliced in half? Sometimes I question the

1262
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:32,900
great Muslim God's intentions with stuff like that but then I just got to

1263
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:39,020
remember he's got a plan for all of us and all of our penises. Mm-hmm. You know

1264
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,980
he's sitting up there and he's designing schematics of different little boys

1265
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,140
wieners and then he just sends them off to the and then the elves take care of

1266
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,140
rest.

1267
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,140
The Elves.

1268
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,140
It's true.

1269
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,140
Yeah.

1270
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:57,640
You guys are obviously not Muslims, but basically we believe that it's sort of a Santa's Workshop

1271
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,700
scenario up there, and he's designing little boys' penises all day, and then the Elves,

1272
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,460
they sort of put together the legs and the body and the head and stuff, but God, he's

1273
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,660
got the family jewels.

1274
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,760
Yeah, he's got Gene Simmons family jewels.

1275
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,200
And Jesus, a lot of people think that Muslims think that Jesus was like a bad guy or something,

1276
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,080
but we actually think that he's a prophet who designs the balls for God.

1277
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,080
Wow.

1278
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,480
Yeah, so he designs the shape of the balls.

1279
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,240
That's why some people have acorn balls, some people have packing peanut balls, but we all

1280
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,160
have balls, and you have Jesus to thank for that.

1281
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:42,120
I just did another talk to Transformer of Patrick Lunch.

1282
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:48,920
It's Patrick. I had the craziest lunch today. I had poop iced tea with and a condom. I mean, I'm sorry. Do you have AIDS?

1283
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:55,280
He does he's listening. I don't here's a transformer. I'd like to talk to

1284
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,640
