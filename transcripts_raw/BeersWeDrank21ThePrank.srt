This is me looking at you.

This is how you're looking.

30
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,400
You know, I got a text from...

31
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,800
I can hear myself through Rex's headphones,

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,040
which is bad news.

33
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,880
No, it's fine.

34
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,700
No, it's not good.

35
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,540
What about now?

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,380

Yeah, the guy is...

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,320
It's good that you said that.

41
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,520
I'm a brave, kind of, I'm a stepper.

42
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,360
Okay.

43
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,200
Yeah.

44
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,360
So I got a text from Julio, not that long ago,

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
and he said we should do, I can still hear it.

46
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,220
he said that we should do a modelo episode

47
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,020
and i said i don't know that i will but then i went into the grocery store and

48
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,220
i saw something that seems so amazing to me

49
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,080
so i got it and that is

50
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,400
a modelo

Suck it off, suck it off.

58
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,480
Suck me off, suck it completely off my body.

59
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
- Okay.

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
- 'Cause I'm drinking a Modelo, a Modelo auto.

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,500
- Okay.

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,160
- And this has different flavors than the normal Modelo.

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
- So now, you know how we've been talking about

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,960
how fucked our weeks are this entire week?

65
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
- Yeah.

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,180
- You are being part of the fucker now.

67
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,040
Because I just said in the afternoon,

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,960
before lunch I was like,

69
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,200
maybe we should do a Modelo episode.

70
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,240
We did the boat light episode.

71
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,200
I think that was fun.

72
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
Like that we all had the same beer.

73
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,680
I thought that was an interesting thing, but then he went, no, I'm getting

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,520
secret, I'm getting secret surprise beers.

75
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,240
So I was like, okay, I'll just do something else.

76
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
You said that.

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,460
And now you're coming in here and you just blew everything to pieces basically.

78
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,360
And now you're just gesticulating like a cartoon.

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,720
You're mad that I got you.

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,840
I reversed you.

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,880
How did you get me?

82
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,400
You just lied to me.

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,280
That's what you did.

84
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,600
- I got you.

85
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,080
- You just completely lied to me.

86
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,920
- That's what getting is.

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
That's what a prank is, is lying.

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
- How was it a prank?

89
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
You just lied to me.

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,640
- I don't know.

91
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,460
- You were in a close friend's house

92
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,300
and you lied to me.

93
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,140
You just stabbed me in the back.

94
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,720
- I just wanted, when I got into the grocery store,

95
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,980
I realized that a Modelo actually sounded quite fine to me.

96
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,560
- Well.

97
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,380
- So I got one.

98
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,900
And guess what guys?

99
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,400
It's not as good as a normal Modelo.

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,520
I should have gotten a normal Modelo instead of the auto!

101
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
And this one has...

102
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,280
3 grams of carbs and 90 calories per serving.

103
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,800
Looks like it's 24 ounce, 4% alcohol, pretty, it's on the low end.

104
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:44,200
Okay, so now, despite Caleb's lying, I'm putting it into paper right now that next week we

105
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,680
do have homework and we're going to have the real Modellos.

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
That's going to be the Modello episode.

107
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
and there's no line.

108
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,160
- Yeah, exactly, this isn't even a normal Modelo.

109
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,880
- I hedged it, I have a Modelo light beer in the fridge,

110
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
but I didn't grab it

111
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,220
'cause I thought we were gonna do Modelo next week.

112
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,320
- So you just spoiled your selection next week.

113
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,440
You're not even doing a Modelo next week.

114
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
You're doing a Modelo light beer.

115
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
- Well, no, I'll just do it.

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,960
We're doing Modelo.

117
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
No, this is stupid.

118
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,520
- No, we'll do straight Modelo.

119
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,600
- You have ruined the entire show for the rest of time.

120
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
- This is foolish.

121
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,160
- You're a fool.

122
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,000
- Whatever.

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,960
- For our ceremonial 21st episode.

124
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,240
- The beer we drank of getting beers.

125
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,080
- I don't even want to drink anymore.

126
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,660
- Okay guys, what is more 21, right?

127
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,360
Than drinking beer and acting like a mess, okay?

128
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,360
And that's what, this is in the spirit of turning 21.

129
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,560
I bought the wrong drink.

130
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
I feel-- - Don't like it?

131
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,200
- I don't like it at all.

132
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,140
I bought the wrong drink.

133
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm brand new to drinking.

134
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,120
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
Guys, tell me about your 21st birthday

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,080
or actually your 18th birthday, Julio.

137
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,920
- Okay, I'm gonna open this for you first.

138
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,680
- Because you live in a degenerate mud hole?

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
- It was normal.

140
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,320
- What did you do?

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
Did you go out and have a celebratory cerveza

142
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,820
or maybe a margarita?

143
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,660
- No.

144
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,400
- You didn't go drinking on your 18th birthday?

145
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,320
- I think like 16, 17, towards like literally 20s

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,640
is one of those times where I was like,

147
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,400
I don't care about my birthday.

148
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
And all I did was just go to my family and just have a lunch.

149
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,200
- Wow.

150
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:26,560
celebration that means that you are a loser I didn't know that about you I

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:35,680
didn't realize you were such a massive loser yeah yeah you just got knocked out

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,160
what'd you do for your 21st Rex I walked to the gas station I got to Bud Light

153
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
lime maritas and they didn't card me and it pissed me off.

154
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,960
They didn't card me and I was like I just this is the one day I want to be carded.

155
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,320
I told you about the time I got carded right in the US?

156
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,280
No.

157
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,560
I got carded two years ago when I was 26 years old.

158
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
Wow.

159
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,680
I was in Chicago with some friends and I went into this uh just like gas station.

160
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,280
Okay, it was in Chicago. I don't know where it was. Maybe Chicago, maybe Houston.

161
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,480
I do know that I was in my mid-20s and I walk in and I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna buy a thing of beers."

162
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,680
So I walk in, I grab a case of beers and I'm walking out to pay with my money.

163
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,280
And the guy who seems like he barely spoke English, but I'm not gonna get into that.

164
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
You don't like those.

165
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,280
He's like, "Oh, yeah, what's your... I need your ID."

166
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,420
I was like, okay, so I show him my ID, which is always a problem because my ID doesn't say when I was born for some reason

167
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,000
And he looks at it is like yeah, this doesn't I would announce a that at the machine. I don't know what this is say

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,260
So he's like I need one that goes into the machine. They need to like scan it

169
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,820
Instead of like looking with his eyes

170
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,400
So I couldn't buy beers

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,440
That's a saddest fuck it is said

172
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,300
Can you be fair you beer I want to open mine you do look like a middle schooler to be completely I'm hoping it may be

173
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Fair you look like a Mandela effect

174
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,940
Nets to classified he looks like a modella effect guys

175
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,660
That's racist

176
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,540
Again, I have a chatter again and I'm gonna be I know you are gonna say rule number one of the podcast

177
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,600
Don't repeat a beer the the next week

178
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,680
But I do I want to remind you guys that there is an addendum if you had a shit week

179
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,620
You got to just repeat if you want you get to break every single rule

180
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,580
Which I think I did so I think I'm gonna repeat and drink this thing whatever

181
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:49,500
Excuses I have a hearty snacks, which I like I have a

182
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,620
Succulent sipper. Oh my god. It's a cactus cooler

183
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,460
It might be it's a orange pineapple hard seltzer

184
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,180
My ex

185
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,780
Okay, wait is this

186
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,620
It has the same logo as cactus cooler. Have you ever had cactus cooler? It's my favorite. Yeah. Yeah

187
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,080
It's I think it's a knockoff of cactus cooler. Tell me if it tastes like cactus cooler

188
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,020
Which is would make sense why it's called the succulent sipper

189
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:23,040
What the fuck is a cactus cooler? It's a West Coast soda

190
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,040
High season that orange juice. No, it's like I would say it's closer to a Fanta

191
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:37,340
That's really good. It's like a combo pineapple orange Fanta. Well, you like it. Yeah. What's the flavor?

192
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,460
What he's saying it's a cactus cooler, but it's with alcohol in it. That is amazing

193
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:53,060
For my 21st birthday my older brother visited me in Boston, but it was a it was a school day

194
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,380
And so like we went out drinking that the that night and at like midnight

195
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,940
But all the bars closed in Boston at like 1 so we were only out for like an hour and then the next day we just

196
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,440
Heard drinking before my 930 a.m. Class at this bar. That was just open

197
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,460
So I was it was like we're just one of the worst days of my entire life

198
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,380
I was just like fucked up trying to do like an art history class for three hours

199
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,940
Not that fun. No, it sounds horrible. Yeah, wait, so what did you miss you?

200
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,100
just like he visited me for my 21st birthday so that we could drink that's

201
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,740
how big of a deal a 21st birthday should should be to you right and you seem to

202
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,820
be kind of disrespecting that tradition well I basically don't care about

203
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:44,900
anything because I am hold the phone that's cool that's actually fucking cool

204
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,700
as shit I'm sorry I said that I said that to like one of those what are those

205
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,300
like the guys who campaign, you see something, I forgot what they are.

206
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Canvassers.

207
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,340
Canvassers, yeah, there's a canvasser once that came up to me in Austin, he was like,

208
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,020
"Yo, you seem like you care about something."

209
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,300
And I just walked right straight past him and I said, "I don't care about anything."

210
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
I just went in my way.

211
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Wow.

212
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Wow.

213
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,300
That guy's probably still thinking about that and how cool you are.

214
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,260
He probably quit volunteering for probably a pretty damn good cause because you were

215
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,300
were so cool that it ruined this entire--

216
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,460
- Well, I can't do anything, even if I did care.

217
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,540
I'm from a different country.

218
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,380
What the fuck am I gonna do?

219
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,600
- All they just need signature is

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,900
you can just fucking write a name on there.

221
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,740
- No, they're gonna--

222
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,140
- No, you need their address.

223
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,820
- They're gonna kill me.

224
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,140
- It'd be funny to write an address that's just in Mexico.

225
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,020
- Yeah, see what they do.

226
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,860
- I don't think they would like that.

227
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,100
- One of your fucked up 14 line addresses.

228
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,940
Bro, I need to send you a Christmas gift.

229
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,620
- It's not 14, no, it's completely--

230
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,620
- And your phone number is 50 digits long.

231
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,020
It's really not.

232
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,420
When I type your phone number into my phone,

233
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,520
it literally, like the format is like two digits,

234
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
two digits, one digit, three digit, five digit.

235
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,220
That's yeah.

236
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,020
Put spaces between all of them.

237
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,920
Well, the only thing is you just have to add +52,

238
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,020
which is the country code.

239
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,220
That's it.

240
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,520
If you live somewhere with a country code,

241
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,620
you need to move because you don't have those here.

242
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,020
Yeah, they do.

243
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,220
You know what ours is?

244
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,720
One.

245
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,220
One.

246
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Number one.

247
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,720
Yep.

248
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,220
One.

249
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Easy to remember.

250
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,220
No, it's you and Canada and something else.

251
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,220
I think the Virgin Islands is plus one.

252
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,220
I think the Virgin Islands, isn't that a US territory or a Canadian territory or something?

253
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
Sounds like that, yeah.

254
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,220
So we still got that, buddy.

255
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
That's still us.

256
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
I do think that that's stupid.

257
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,220
I think area cards are stupid.

258
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,220
I think everyone should just move to using WhatsApp for phone-related purposes.

259
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,220
I think everyone should use email to communicate.

260
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,220
I love checking my email. I love seeing the number go up.

261
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,820
How many unread emails do you have on your phone right now?

262
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,220
Probably 20,000.

263
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,020
I bet you guys can't beat me.

264
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,620
Okay. Whoa. Okay.

265
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,580
I have 35,229.

266
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,460
Okay. So I have two figures, but I think one of them is up.

267
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,060
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,

268
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,020
it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,

269
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,020
It's being inflated because I also have the podcast account on my email apps.

270
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,020
So my Gmail app says 3,400 but my mail app says 29,000 which is insane.

271
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
I don't know what the discrepancy is.

272
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:35,020
My Gmail app, hold your breath guys, 49,834 unread emails.

273
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,020
Big fucking winner.

274
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
Yep.

275
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,020
Wait, okay, my mail app on Apple is 142,285.

276
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,220
- What the fuck are you guys signing up to

277
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,380
to get emailed?

278
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,060
- I don't even know how that's possible.

279
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,180
- New egg, I signed up for new egg when I was 15,

280
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,900
it probably ruined my life.

281
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,300
Like they send me 50 emails every day, at least.

282
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,160
- One of my old email addresses, I think I get,

283
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,460
I think eBay, it's a big email there,

284
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,220
they will email you every single day

285
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,380
about something that you cared about 15 years ago.

286
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,980
And I just, when I log into that email account,

287
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,920
just look at it, it's like, I don't want that anymore,

288
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,540
but I don't know how to turn this off.

289
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,380
- Yeah.

290
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,900
- So I just closed the window.

291
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,620
- I think I also, I think every once in a while

292
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,260
I get an eBay email that's like,

293
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,600
do you still wanna know about Nintendo 64s?

294
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,020
(laughing)

295
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,340
Do you still wanna know what Nintendo 64s are for sale?

296
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,820
And I go, I don't think so.

297
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,660
I don't think I need a Nintendo 64.

298
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,860
- You're trying to buy a Nintendo 64?

299
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,140
I bought one for $30 when I was like 11.

300
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,980
- Yeah.

301
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,020
- And then I still get the emails about it.

302
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,720
- Dude, what was your first gaming console you bought?

303
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,780
- I bought?

304
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,700
- Yeah, that you bought.

305
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,620
- Like I bought with my own money?

306
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,820
- Yeah.

307
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,700
- Probably an N64.

308
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,140
First one I ever had was an N64.

309
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,140
I had an N64, then I had a PS2,

310
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,780
then we sold the PS2, I got a GameCube,

311
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,620
and then we got an Xbox.

312
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,100
- I loved GameCube, you were so good at it.

313
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,400
And then I had the Xbox for a long time.

314
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,860
Then I had the Xbox 360.

315
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,940
And then I didn't have I haven't had one since then, except for a switch.

316
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,240
Yeah, I got a I bought a PS2

317
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,600
from a tennis instructor down the street from me

318
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,200
for $60.

319
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,340
It was all my birthday money, and it came.

320
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,660
He gave me Need for Speed Underground.

321
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,600
Man, I. Wow.

322
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,400
Yeah, and that's the only way you're getting manhunt by the way.

323
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Well, this is what really pisses me off.

324
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,600
My mom forced me, forced me to go to GameStop and sell manhunt.

325
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,600
No! For $3. Oh, I was just about to say $3!

326
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,600
And that is why I will never visit her in the nursing home.

327
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I remember when Halo 3 came out, I think I turned in

328
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,280
every game that I owned so that I could buy Halo 3.

329
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,600
And I think I literally turned in like 15 games to buy Halo 3.

330
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,880
And how much did you get?

331
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I think I probably got 40 bucks for it.

332
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,480
Yeah.

333
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,280
Okay.

334
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I think my first console was the N64.

335
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,080
But I talked about this all the time on stream.

336
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,480
I have like certain games that I used to play a lot.

337
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,880
Like I think I played Mario Kart a lot.

338
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,280
I played some like movie title games.

339
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,320
I played a lot as well, but I was I think I was too stupid to figure out how to save a game

340
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,060
So I just whatever I would just turn to get the game on I would play the first

341
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,880
Couple levels and I was like, okay, I'm done and then I would do the same thing every single day of my childhood

342
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,320
Well, that's what was so fucked about the n64 is you had to have the expansion slot first for like a Zelda game

343
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,560
Yeah, whenever I talk about that people in my channel, which I never ever had that

344
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, people in Chad were like no you didn't need that there's you could save them to the cart

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,520
And I was like, uh, no, I never I couldn't do that

346
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,960
I don't think which I don't know if I if I if I knew I didn't know how to do that

347
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,600
The first console I bought though. I think it was a ps4

348
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,680
Was a spoiled child then I got all my consoles bought for me

349
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,840
Growing. All right. Well, what's your top five games you played as like a kid?

350
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,920
Like until you know, you got into shooters and shit

351
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,240
Well, I mean lover

352
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,760
Glover, yeah Glover was an amazing game

353
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,740
I only played really fucked up games on the n64 because I also did not have the save thing

354
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,360
So I tried to play like Majora's Mask and it I just couldn't save it. So I just gave it to my friend

355
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,320
Glover

356
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,120
Star Force Gemini, I think it was called

357
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,720
That game was amazing. That game was sick. I

358
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,520
Love the first level of that game

359
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Conqueror's Bad Fur Day

360
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,760
You're an amazing childhood. I conquered bad for a day was my brother's friend

361
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,640
But I only had it I only had it for like a week because he left it at our house

362
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,300
But I played it all the time and I learned how to cuss

363
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,720
number three

364
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,240
The demo that was on the Xbox the original Xbox game that was called like something frenzy

365
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,040
Party frenzy or whatever. Do you know what I'm talking about?

366
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,560
I have to find this game

367
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,400
And then another game that I loved growing up that was not like a real game

368
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,680
hmm

369
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,880
That is - oh oh Kelly Slater pro surfing

370
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,120
Okay, cuz I oh so I won. I had an Xbox and then I won a raffle at

371
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,360
public pool and I won an Xbox and another Xbox and a

372
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,400
Copy of Kelly Slater pro surfing and instead of selling the brand-new Xbox. I thought it was cooler to have two Xbox

373
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:57,840
So I just we already had one and I just had the other one and if my brother was using the one then I would just

374
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,200
Plug the other one in downstairs, right? That's sick. That's dope. All right, Julio. I think my top five I think

375
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,160
Maybe two spots are gonna be occupied by movie games because I usually love Z. Sorry. That's the name of the game

376
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:20,440
I love the the Toy Story 2 game on the N64 and I also love the Bugs Life game as well

377
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,280
on the N64 but I never really got to finish them. I love Mario Kart both on N64 and on

378
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:34,160
the GameCube. I also really like Mario Tennis on the GameCube. I think my last one is gonna

379
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,880
be like one of the games I played the most that I can remember. It's on my PSP. I had

380
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,880
I had Burnout something, it's one of the Burnout games that was like ported from PS2 to PSP

381
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
and that shit was so good.

382
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Oh my god, that was so good.

383
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
The PSP was amazing.

384
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
It was.

385
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,880
I also had Sarge's Heroes, did you ever play that?

386
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
No.

387
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,880
It was like about being an army man, like a green army man, a toy.

388
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Nope.

389
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,680
And then a game that I loved on the Xbox was called Conflict Desert Storm.

390
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,040
And that was like a third person shooter. It was really really fire.

391
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,080
It was just about being in the Middle East in the 90's. It was beast.

392
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
That makes a lot of sense.

393
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Alright, ready?

394
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Mario Party 4.

395
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Yep. Okay.

396
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,880
Super Mario Baseball.

397
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
Oh yes! For Gamecube?

398
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
Yep.

399
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,520
Yeah, I'm so jealous.

400
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,640
I used to hit straight dingers on that game with PD Piranha.

401
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Yes, dude. Yes, and I used to just

402
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,640
choose all the power characters. Oh yeah.

403
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,400
You get a power character, you get PD Piranha to play pitcher,

404
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
and you get one other pitcher, and then you take the Koopas

405
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,040
so that they all have synergy in the field.

406
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,640
Yes. I could hit dingers with Goomba.

407
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,680
That's how good I was with that game.

408
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,720
With that thin bat.

409
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,520
Brother, the bat don't got to be so thin.

410
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Why you got that thin bat?

411
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,160
Hey, Monty Mole, why are you pulling up with the noodle?

412
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,640
Get a normal Louisville Slugger and hit that shit.

413
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
Yeah.

414
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,520
Yeah.

415
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,080
Real quick aside, isn't baseball like the best ever like arcade sport game of all

416
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,520
time?

417
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
Um, it's pretty fun.

418
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,280
I would say, for like years, and I just want to put it out there.

419
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,880
The 2005 to 2015 Madden games are pretty unbeatable.

420
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,680
And also NFL Blitz.

421
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,480
Y'all ever played NFL Blitz? That was another amazing sports game.

422
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,880
But speaking strictly like arcade,

423
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,680
like arcade-y type conversions of sports, I think baseball is the king of them.

424
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I would say Mario Superstar Baseball is the best sports game ever.

425
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Yeah. Yeah. It's unbeatable. I think I've talked about this. So for number three was Madden '06

426
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:14,680
where I spent three hours one day creating 53 players named like my name.

427
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:22,360
They were all 6'8", 300 pounds, perfect stats in every way, dark as night.

428
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,720
You had a 6'8" wide receiver?

429
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Yeah.

430
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,560
Well, here's the thing.

431
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,120
Two real players on the team.

432
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,880
Tom Brady, Randy Moss.

433
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Nice.

434
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,080
Everyone else, fuck it.

435
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,840
I would go, I would take the ball, I'd do a QB sneak, play one.

436
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,280
I'd run. Did you say they were dark as night? Sorry.

437
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Did I miss that? You said they were dark.

438
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,780
It was 50 black guys with Jewish names

439
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,280
running around.

440
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,480
Yup. Uh huh.

441
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,980
What team was it?

442
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,580
It was like randomly created. Oh, okay.

443
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,580
I think I hit the random button.

444
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,580
And same thing for the logo.

445
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,280
I would do a QB sneak, play one,

446
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,280
run all the way back to my one yard line,

447
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
Throw a seam route down the sidelines

448
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,160
99-yard touchdown to Randy Moss

449
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,300
Every play it was amazing. I had so Brady could throw 99

450
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,980
You can throw about 70 and Randy Moss

451
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,520
You would just a little spin move when he caught the ball press B and just Wow take off down the sideline

452
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:41,240
Amazing I think NFL blitz is probably why I never got into the NFL because I played NFL blitz before I really had

453
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,680
ever watched football and I was like, "Oh, this is cool.

454
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,440
You get to hear the crunching of their bones when they hit each other.

455
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,720
There's blood everywhere. People's arms fly off.

456
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,440
This is how football should be."

457
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,640
And then I watched it and it was all just people sitting around,

458
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,680
waiting on guys talking to each other.

459
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,600
It's a very boring sport to watch.

460
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
- I think I also had Madden 06 for the GameCube.

461
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,400
Riggs, wasn't there a section,

462
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,880
if you wanted to express on that game,

463
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,440
You could just watch like a trailer for Madden Blitz,

464
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,280
NFL Blitz.

465
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,400
- Yeah, yeah.

466
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,120
- I think I remember watching that a couple of times

467
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,320
and being like, wow, that game looks so sick.

468
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,840
- It was a sick game.

469
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,000
- You could import your character from NCAA 05.

470
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
Amazing game.

471
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,200
- I remember playing the NCAA games

472
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,620
more than the Madden games,

473
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,960
and they were just not as fun, man.

474
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,640
- No, no.

475
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,440
It's so fun to just put up 90 points

476
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,160
in a five minute quarter.

477
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,800
Yeah, just going just no defense.

478
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,880
Just all throwing the ball as far as possible.

479
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,740
There's no play.

480
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,680
You go for it every fourth down.

481
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,940
Never punt.

482
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,240
Never, never.

483
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
No.

484
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,880
And the only time you play is to do a fake punt.

485
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,120
And yeah, and I would always I didn't know what any of the plays meant

486
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,980
when I looked at them, so I would always just do Hail Mary every single play.

487
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,760
No, dude, picking a defensive play, it's like fucking whatever.

488
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah, I don't care.

489
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,460
The one, just a wall.

490
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,560
Yeah, I would just pick the one with the biggest,

491
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,340
like the most amount of circles on the graphic.

492
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,180
Yeah.

493
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,820
Do they still make Madden games?

494
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,660
They do.

495
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,500
Yeah, 100%.

496
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,940
But they've definitely been usurped

497
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,940
in popularity by 2K, right?

498
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,620
Yes, 2K24, Kobe Bryant on the cover.

499
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,860
24.

500
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,300
That's a different sport.

501
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,140
Yeah.

502
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,300
Did he play this season?

503
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,140
Did he play this season?

504
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
Kobe Bryant, that's what you just asked?

505
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,660
No, he didn't play, he retired in 2016, you moron.

506
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,500
- Oh, okay.

507
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,100
- And then he blew up horrifically in a helicopter.

508
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,140
- Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

509
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,820
- So what's the rest of your list?

510
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,300
- Original Harry Potter game for the PC.

511
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,140
- Okay.

512
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,380
- I'm getting girl vibes from your selections.

513
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,700
- You're getting girl vibes after Madden '06?

514
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,500
- It seems like you were kind of hedging your Harry Potter

515
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,920
selection with the Madden pick. I will say I do have a girl game for my sixth

516
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,100
spot which is Little Big Planet. Oh Little Big Planet was good. But you could

517
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,420
also develop a level that looked like boobs. Yeah but that's a

518
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,580
completely game for girls. That is true. Alright last game for me

519
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,240
Matrix Reloaded. Oh my of course that's the best game ever. Yeah that game is so

520
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,960
fucking fun when you go running on security level you go to the security

521
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,360
scene is the most fun I've ever had in a game dude I never amazing can you can

522
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,000
you just go through it in detail for the next half an hour it's basically the

523
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,160
mate you it's the it's one of the those first like gen 3 console movie games

524
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,880
that were all exactly how you wanted the movie game to be with like Matrix

525
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Reloaded and Spider-Man where you were like doing just everything

526
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
that you wanted to do when you watch the movie.

527
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah, right and nothing extra.

528
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,880
They understood the assignment.

529
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,180
They'd completely wanted to fight you wanted to press buttons.

530
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,780
So it was like Devil May Cry combat.

531
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,780
Yeah, you ran on the walls.

532
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,180
You did Matrix like bullet time shit did all that stuff.

533
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,880
It had cursing in it.

534
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,080
There's a scene at the end where the Wachowskis cursed.

535
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,680
There's a scene where you, yep.

536
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,160
Mm-hmm.

537
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,720
They're in it.

538
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,840
Yeah.

539
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,960
Uh, they, uh, you just, just fighting Morpheus in the clouds.

540
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
Yeah.

541
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,040
There's just so many twins.

542
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,640
Yep.

543
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,320
The twins.

544
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,080
Oh my God.

545
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,320
The twins, the twins, beautiful twins.

546
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,280
It's, it's truly one of the best games ever made.

547
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,600
It is an amazing, amazing.

548
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
And it does not hold up at all.

549
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,720
I'm sure.

550
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,980
But when, I mean, you can't, I don't, I don't, I don't get, I feel like every

551
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,340
once in a while, I'll see a YouTube video.

552
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,440
That's like super Mario.

553
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,060
Sunshine is not as good as you remember it being.

554
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,960
And I'm like, I'm sure it's not.

555
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,080
They've everything has gotten the worst game that comes out.

556
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,320
Now would have been the greatest game of all time in 2003.

557
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,960
That's a lie by the way, it holds up except for the intro.

558
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,440
The intro is so slow.

559
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,680
The intro, the unskippable intro is really, really annoying.

560
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,920
where they send you to fucking jail every single time.

561
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,080
- Yeah, yeah.

562
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,800
I also, that game needs to have a courtroom scene

563
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,880
where I can plead my case.

564
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,400
- Yeah. - That's my feeling.

565
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,520
- I think it should have that,

566
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,440
but it should still do the cut scene

567
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,680
where you still get sent to jail no matter what you do.

568
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,800
- Do you remember watching like old Flash videos

569
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,440
and they would be like, "Oh, Super Mario accounting?"

570
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
You know, like that kind of like.

571
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,320
And I didn't understand that

572
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,440
there's not that many Mario games.

573
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,500
He just plays all the sports.

574
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,100
and they're all good.

575
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
I would play Super Mario Accounting.

576
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,260
- They probably have not made a bad Mario game once,

577
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,100
I don't think.

578
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,940
Did you guys ever play Paper Mario?

579
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,860
- Nope.

580
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,100
- Fans of 2D rejoice.

581
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,900
This game is for you.

582
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Super Mario, Paper Super Mario and the secret door, right?

583
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,160
Wait, why is that door so secret?

584
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,620
Well, buddy, it's two dimensional

585
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,660
and you're looking at it from the wrong direction.

586
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,100
And what you have to do is you have to switch

587
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,600
into the three-dimensional world to see this door.

588
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,020
By IGN's review, nine out of 10.

589
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,220
- I think I played Super Mario for the N64,

590
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,380
that was like my first ever RPG,

591
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,060
but I didn't know what an RPG game was.

592
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,860
So I think it was in a hotel.

593
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
- Wait, you played Super Mario--

594
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,620
- Paper Mario, sorry.

595
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,060
- Oh, Paper Mario, okay.

596
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,540
- I think I played Paper Mario on like a N64,

597
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,780
one of those like hotel rooms.

598
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
I was like, "Please, can I play this game?

599
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,620
"I wanna play this game."

600
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,140
So they let me play the game.

601
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,540
- You played it in a hotel room?

602
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,580
My parents never let me play the N64 at the hotel room.

603
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,860
- It was so expensive, man.

604
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,740
- It was so expensive, but I would just do it.

605
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,580
- Yep, fuck it.

606
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,140
- Because I didn't know about money.

607
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,620
- Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.

608
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,620
- I did ask for permission.

609
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,940
And then I played it, and I was like,

610
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,260
I don't get this game at all.

611
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,620
I don't know what's going on.

612
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,900
Why can't I just jump and kill the enemies?

613
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,740
- Yeah.

614
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,340
- So I stopped playing shortly after.

615
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,180
- The best Mario RPG is Super Mario RPG for the,

616
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,780
I think either the N64 or the Super Nintendo,

617
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,540
but it had, it was the Super Mario RPG

618
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,460
and the Legend of the Seven Stars.

619
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,460
It was basically like an old Final Fantasy game.

620
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,980
It was so much fun.

621
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,260
- Yeah, that's beautiful.

622
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,100
- Yeah.

623
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,900
- It never occurred for RPG games as a kid.

624
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,060
I didn't care.

625
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,040
- Yeah, they were a little too slow for me.

626
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,660
- It also just occurred to me that when you were talking

627
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,140
about my HX reloaded, I was thinking to myself,

628
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:51,620
like I did really enjoy like movie games but I guess I just didn't under like it

629
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,580
didn't come to my mind that there would be movie games for movies are not like

630
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,140
picture game picture movies so we're only play like monster saying like the

631
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,980
Incredibles games was a picture movie even like animated movies yeah like an

632
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,100
animated movie oh I like your turn better yeah I thought you said picture

633
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:17,860
movie I said Pixar I said picture movie I said you motherfucker that damn picture

634
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,780
movie okay okay whatever man my week has been complete shit and are you making

635
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,820
fun of me yeah does that make you feel feels better now that I know that it's

636
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:36,540
working that's getting to you no it's not going to me but yeah I I do I miss

637
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,460
that kind of like like I feel like I've not in a while played a game without

638
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,420
watching probably five hours of reviews for the game mm-hmm and then I play it

639
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,460
for 20 minutes and I decide I don't really like it well here's the thing

640
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:57,460
video games are not fun anymore that's actually true what do you say about that

641
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,740
oh they're hard work you have to work like do you mean you feel when you play

642
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,340
any video game that it is work or you feel like the games they make now are work?

643
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,100
The games they make now are work but also it just feels like work.

644
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,180
Have you gone back and played Skyrim because I would say that there's no game that holds

645
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,540
up worse than Skyrim.

646
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,340
I never played it, knew I would not like it, and have no interest in playing it now.

647
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,660
It's been released like nine times.

648
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,420
It has been released nine times.

649
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:41,420
Speaking of Rees, we were doing crosswords the other day.

650
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,340
There was a fucking Rebus in the crossword.

651
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,940
Oh no no no.

652
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,700
I don't want to have anything to do with a Rebus man.

653
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
So this is why...

654
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,700
It pissed me off so much.

655
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,180
Uh huh, go ahead.

656
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
And then I got up...

657
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
What day was it?

658
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
It was Thursday.

659
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,060
Oh yeah, you got anything Thursday through Sunday, you got to expect once a month they're

660
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,340
going to put a Rebus in there.

661
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:10,340
they were they were two Rebus's next to each other and I didn't really I didn't

662
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,100
really understand the actual clues that had both Rebus's but I got it you know

663
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,140
like vertically and understood that there was like two Rebus's next to each

664
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,860
other and I got off with Julio because we did it on stream and I was telling my

665
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,860
girlfriend about it and then realizing the puns of the Rebus's as I was telling

666
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,780
her about it and getting like progressively more mad about the rebuses.

667
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah.

668
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,140
There was like a game.

669
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,300
There was like a question about Coolio song gangsters paradise.

670
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,860
Answer was gangsters.

671
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,780
Die, die paradise.

672
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,340
Parade die.

673
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,860
Oh God.

674
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,500
And I was like, Oh you pieces of shit.

675
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
I hate that.

676
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,820
Where do you get off?

677
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,700
So this is why in the middle of like nowhere, I texted you.

678
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,860
Caleb, how long did it take you to do the Thursday's crossword?

679
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:10,240
Because it took Rex with my minutes and that's almost like an hour.

680
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,700
OK, if you were if you were on your own doing that,

681
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,840
that would be not that bad of a time, I would say for a Thursday.

682
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,140
Julio doesn't really help me with the crosswords.

683
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,960
I know that's not a bad time at all.

684
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,400
I would say under an hour for a Thursday, for a hard Thursday with Revis's

685
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,160
is a decent time.

686
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,300
Yeah, if it wasn't for the chat,

687
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,100
I wouldn't have known what a rebus is,

688
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,300
which is an invaluable contribution on their part.

689
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,620
Yeah, I remember the first time I came up against what it just it just

690
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,980
I just never I didn't know what it was, and I just quit the crossword completely.

691
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,680
I think it's complete bullshit.

692
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,080
I think that shouldn't be allowed.

693
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,820
I agree.

694
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,280
There's a lot of things I don't think should be allowed in a crossword

695
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,420
referencing a Broadway production

696
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,960
should not be allowed in a crossword.

697
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,500
Well, New York Times.

698
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,620
That's what I mean.

699
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,800
Broadway's in New York.

700
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,360
Here's what we need, boys.

701
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,500
Broadway's everywhere.

702
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,900
We need a crossword that is done by the Daily Wire.

703
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,100
That's what we need.

704
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,400
We need the Daily Wire and the Blaze to do a crossword

705
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,560
because I can get that shit.

706
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
OK.

707
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,360
Probably five minutes.

708
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,000
OK, how about this?

709
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,360
New opportunity.

710
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,660
Me and Cam have been talking about this brand new

711
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,600
kind of like news agency type of deal.

712
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,200
We don't have to really get into it too much.

713
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,960
How about we produce our own crosswords?

714
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,680
I'm fine with that.

715
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,460
Yeah.

716
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,760
They're pretty weird to make though.

717
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,120
There's a guy who does the mini crossword.

718
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,760
You know what his name is?

719
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,920
Yes, I do.

720
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,620
Yes, I do.

721
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,760
Yes, I do.

722
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,860
He has a very...

723
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,760
Let's just call it... Here, wait, let's spell it.

724
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,120
Hold on.

725
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,420
I think it's John or Gus.

726
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,960
For people who are not

727
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,360
in my team games subscribers. First of all you should be.

728
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,480
Yeah. Okay here's the guy's name. Joel.

729
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,920
That's his first name. Nothing wrong with that. Here's the guy's last name.

730
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,040
F A G

731
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,000
L I A N O. That's a fucking fake name dude.

732
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,840
How? And this guy does almost every single mini.

733
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,200
Yeah. He's done the last eight minis.

734
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:28,060
I mean come on. Get it together New York Times. I don't understand how that guy

735
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:34,320
didn't kill himself. Yeah, going through middle school. Well because he probably went to the

736
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,640
kind of schools that groom you to be a crossword editor at the New York Times.

737
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,680
That's true. He probably was never bullied once in his life and it was all pretty easy for him.

738
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,360
Well, he was never bullied by by people at his schools. What about

739
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,880
You don't think Yale graduation or wherever the fuck he went. He's going up on stage

740
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,280
He's getting his diploma and they're like a fag Leono

741
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:06,200
Fag Leono report fag Leono. I mean that's his name, you know, yeah born 1992. It's an American puzzle creator

742
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,900
Okay, born 1992. He has to know he'll he went to Drexel guys

743
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Yeah, he lives in

744
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,600
So we could go visit him yeah

745
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,360
His hobbies include playing chess and

746
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,080
Basketball watching sports and jogging. I do like I mean, he's cool

747
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,420
Making the minute. I like him. He's easily the best friend. I

748
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,820
Would love to be friends with Joe Joel F my idea

749
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,840
He would be that in my phone by the way, he would be Joel F

750
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:46,940
He would be I I cannot risk the the the name getting cut off because it's too long

751
00:36:46,940 --> 00:37:01,400
No idea we come and visit him at his party where he plays basketball and we invite him to the show

752
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,400
And we say we know your story. We know what you went through. We want to give you an outlet to express yourself

753
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Okay

754
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,440
Would be here yeah, yeah, he has to drink a beer

755
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,580
Also, I if I had to guess I would say that the fact that he's still on the minis and not doing the maxis is

756
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:30,140
Do well though no, but it probably has something to do with some kind of prejudice against his name

757
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:37,400
Because he is Jewish there is anti Jewish

758
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,600
Sentiment I'm gonna say in the New York Times

759
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:47,840
Joel Fagliano is not Jewish. I just saw it on his Wikipedia. It says he is a Jewish writer

760
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:54,800
Okay, so you this is one of your boys and you need you have his back. It doesn't say that anyway

761
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,120
Oh my god, it's true. It's true. It's true

762
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,040
Imagine coming through Ellis Island and choosing Fagliano

763
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,000
Because you think that that sounds Italian. Yeah, right

764
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,200
Yeah, you're like trying to hide. I will say he did

765
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,000
Fool me. I thought it was Italian

766
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,860
The fact that you guys would think that we that anybody from Italy would have that as a last name and their bloodline would survive

767
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,680
Really says more about you

768
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,140
Then I'm assuming he like they're like his family just escaped the country

769
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,560
That I could believe if it was like they were the first

770
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,400
Italians to come to America because they were like, "We have to get out of Italy. We are

771
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,680
getting destroyed in Italy," then I could believe that.

772
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,720
I believe that.

773
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,880
He interned with Will Shorts, classic Maxi maker.

774
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,480
That guy is basically the crossword goat, so I might say.

775
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,720
Yeah. Three summers under Will Shorts.

776
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm so sorry that you came up against a rebus. That's sad. I have not done a crossword in

777
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,280
a while I've been dabbling in new kinds of hobbies.

778
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Such as?

779
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,800
Such as taking my cousin around New York City.

780
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,800
I've decided this is one of my favorite hobbies and I can't get enough of it.

781
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,240
How's that going?

782
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,840
Well, he just left yesterday so I need another new hobby.

783
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,880
But I do want new hobbies, man.

784
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,720
I did just pick up basketball again.

785
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
I've been playing a lot of basketball.

786
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
You should pick up reading.

787
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,800
I already read before bed.

788
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
What do you read?

789
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Whoa, what's a book you've read?

790
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
What's the last book?

791
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I'm not sure, sorry.

792
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Tone was wrong.

793
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Tone was wrong.

794
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Caleb, my fellow intellectual,

795
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
what's the last book that you read?

796
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
The last book that I read

797
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
was

798
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
The Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk

799
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
and before that

800
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
The History of Sexuality

801
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
by Michelle Foucault

802
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,760
And before that, the Norm Macdonald book,

803
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,920
and I'm gonna read the Norm Macdonald book again

804
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,760
right now, I think.

805
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,000
(laughing)

806
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,640
Actually, it's either between the Norm,

807
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,240
I'm gonna reread the Norm book,

808
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,400
or I'm gonna reread the Big Book of Basketball

809
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,480
by Bill Simmons, 'cause I love Bill Simmons.

810
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,440
- Yeah, yeah, that's like me, you know,

811
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,960
it's like Finnegan's Wake, Portnoy's Complaint,

812
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,280
Green Eggs and Ham.

813
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,520
(laughing)

814
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,680
I really, I like Bill Simmons a lot.

815
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,720
- You're coming in so hot right now.

816
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,560
- I'm sorry.

817
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,480
- Pull it a little bit.

818
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,720
- I saw a lady today on the, speaking of reading,

819
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,360
I saw a lady today on the subway

820
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,560
who was reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.

821
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,560
And I really, it really, I could not believe

822
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,960
that somebody still read that book.

823
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,300
Like was reading that book publicly for,

824
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,760
you have to assume the first time.

825
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,960
But it really made me feel very embarrassed for this lady

826
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,560
that she was reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.

827
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,640
- It's kind of, I can't wait to performatively read

828
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,600
on the subway.

829
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,040
- Don't, there's, nobody is actually getting

830
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,320
any reading done on the subway.

831
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,160
It's impossible.

832
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,600
Everybody smells like diarrhea.

833
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,440
People are poking you, asking you to buy lemonade.

834
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,000
There's no reason to,

835
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,160
I've never brought a book on the subway.

836
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,000
I never will.

837
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,960
That is the time where you get to look at your phone.

838
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,840
This is built into your life.

839
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,120
You can look at your fucking phone.

840
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,720
I think I understand now why you don't sit down in the bathroom

841
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,620
because you're sitting down to travel.

842
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,020
That's true.

843
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
This is insane.

844
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,520
What?

845
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,420
So it's just interesting, Rex.

846
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,120
So you're telling me that when you get in your car, you usually

847
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,420
stand up all the way?

848
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,520
Well, I'm not looking at my phone.

849
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,420
That's for sure.

850
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,420
You don't look at your phone when you drive?

851
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,820
What the fuck?

852
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,420
No, I have GPS up.

853
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,520
I don't know where I'm going.

854
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,020
Oh, I always look at my phone when I drive.

855
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,020
The entire time I'm looking at my phone.

856
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,200
- Hang on, can you explain your theory for me, Rex?

857
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,120
I just want to understand what you were, what you meant.

858
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,520
- He's saying I've developed a distaste for sitting

859
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,280
because I have to do it on the, although I very,

860
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,800
I almost never do it on the subway.

861
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,360
- It's not a distaste, but like, you know,

862
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,640
that's a built-in phone time to his day.

863
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,600
If he's going somewhere, he's sitting on the subway,

864
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,920
he's on his phone.

865
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,880
Whereas me, I'm not going anywhere on the subway.

866
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,000
- He's getting a screen time, okay, yeah.

867
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,400
- He gets a screen time during a sit down.

868
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,880
So on the train, honestly, screen time on the toilet.

869
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,840
Honestly, guys, I never, ever take the train.

870
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,680
I only take the train if I'm going to Manhattan, which is maybe once a month.

871
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,000
And I drive every other place.

872
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
I hate the train.

873
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,720
I love the train.

874
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,520
I hate it, man.

875
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,440
I hate that shit.

876
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,360
The other day I was with my cousin.

877
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,240
We were at the World Trade Center and there's a bus that goes

878
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,600
all the way from the World Trade Center directly in front of my house.

879
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,280
And it's like 20 minutes slower than taking the train.

880
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,420
And I just told him that it was faster and we got on it

881
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,220
and rode for an hour and 10 minutes so that we didn't have to get on the train.

882
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,580
That's crazy to me that you would rather take the bus than the train.

883
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,680
It's like a big it's like a Greyhound.

884
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,180
It's like a coach bus.

885
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,220
Whoa.

886
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,080
Yeah, it's got like comfy seats and iPhone chargers and stuff.

887
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,020
It's nice.

888
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,380
You got AC.

889
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:10,880
Oh yeah.

890
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
It's as cold as a fucking ice.

891
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,620
How expensive is that?

892
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,820
Four bucks.

893
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,060
Really? Mm hmm.

894
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:23,020
Yeah, it's anytime I'm at there's one at Central Park and there's one at the World Trade Center.

895
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,420
Anytime I'm near either of those, I'm not going taking the train and even at rush hour.

896
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,620
There's like nobody on it.

897
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,940
I love those fucking buses.

898
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
The QM buses.

899
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,940
Hmm.

900
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,940
Shout out.

901
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,540
Shout out to the QM 25 man.

902
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,900
You trying to find my house?

903
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
Look along the route.

904
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,540
All the way from right in front of one of the stops.

905
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
Yeah, that's kind of beast.

906
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,540
Yeah.

907
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,040
I just don't like any kind of public transportation.

908
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
I just don't.

909
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,180
I also just don't like going anywhere.

910
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,260
I don't like the the fact that the train like today I had to go to Manhattan.

911
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,720
Well, I didn't have to, but I thought I had to.

912
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,760
And I waited for the train for I waited for the M for like 25 minutes.

913
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,220
And the app kept saying it was coming in like two minutes.

914
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,560
And then it just wasn't.

915
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,460
And then it just wasn't.

916
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,640
And then I had to walk 15 minutes to another train.

917
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,200
That is bullshit, man.

918
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,320
If this was anywhere but Manhattan, I would have just hopped in the whip and I would have been gone.

919
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,300
Yeah.

920
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,740
Interesting.

921
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:27,360
I think it's funny that Rex has the idea of like a white girl of what it's like to live in New York.

922
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,200
So I'm like, yeah, I'm going to get on the train.

923
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm going to read my little book.

924
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,640
I'm going to go have breakfast with my best friends.

925
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,420
Yeah.

926
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:40,320
Buddy, your first day in New York City, I am literally making sure you get robbed.

927
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,980
I will do anything to make sure you get robbed.

928
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,980
You're going to be walking around with a messenger bag,

929
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,240
and that shit is going to get swiped off you by a 12 year old.

930
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,840
I will literally be putting a hit on you.

931
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,440
I probably wouldn't even be mad if I got robbed.

932
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,580
I have insurance on my phone.

933
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,640
I don't care. Robbers insurance.

934
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,380
Yes. Robbers insurance. Yeah.

935
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,980
I get it. Why are we not robbing you?

936
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,640
This is the easiest fraud.

937
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,200
- There's no benefit to being robbed.

938
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,320
- There's no benefit to robbing a phone anymore.

939
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,920
- Yeah, they just lock the phone.

940
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
- But then you could have two phones.

941
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,120
- Yeah, but it doesn't work anymore.

942
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,120
- It's completely locked.

943
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,320
You can't use it at all in any sorts of way.

944
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,600
- You could use it as a prop in a movie.

945
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,440
- That is true.

946
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,560
- So go ahead and, I don't know, I'm just saying,

947
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,640
if you move to New York and we maybe wanna make a movie,

948
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,720
then we will be robbing you in a fake robbery so that we can use your phone as a prop.

949
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,960
I mean you could just use my normal phone as a prop.

950
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,960
It's too dangerous.

951
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
It puts off radiation.

952
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,280
It's the same type of insurance.

953
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
That's true.

954
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,600
It puts off a high radiation when you put it near your head or your testicles.

955
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Did you know that?

956
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
I didn't know that.

957
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
Yeah.

958
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
Is that true?

959
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,360
Yeah, your phone puts off radiation.

960
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,840
It's basically why everybody in this fucking world has become such blue haired SJWs because

961
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,840
they've been keeping their phone near their damn nuts.

962
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,040
Yeah, and near their head and it's shrinking their brain and making them

963
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,520
incapable of thinking logically. Yeah, it's taking away critical thinking which is why

964
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:20,080
the people like, like what happened to Gary Johnson? Nobody talks about him

965
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,600
anymore maybe because people's brains are too small to accept his ideas. I put my

966
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,520
phone next to my butt and I think that's why I get so uncomfortable sitting for

967
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,000
too long. I think that's probably why your butt is

968
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,240
I make sure my wife used to do that and then I have made it a strict rule that

969
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,440
we're not allowed to have a phone in the bed. Why? Because I don't want to

970
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,400
have a developmentally disabled child. It's that simple. I think that's up to

971
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,520
chance no matter what. Wait what's going on? I don't want to have a kid with who has

972
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,160
like an eye on their forehead you know what I mean? So I make sure that the phone...

973
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,580
- Is she pregnant?

974
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,920
- I don't fucking know, you ask her.

975
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,040
- It's none of my business.

976
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,120
- Can you go ask her if she's pregnant right now?

977
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,160
- She's at the park with the dog.

978
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,000
- Can you call her?

979
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,920
- What's getting a little big lately, are you pregnant?

980
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,760
(laughing)

981
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,120
- Asking your wife, saying,

982
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,080
I think we really need to get a pregnancy test

983
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,460
because you are looking straight up like an orca.

984
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,760
You look huge.

985
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,960
- I don't think anything she does pre having a baby matters.

986
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,020
- That is not true.

987
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
- Things never leave your body.

988
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,640
- That is true.

989
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,920
- Something will never,

990
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,120
hey, and if you want an example,

991
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,280
hey Julio, you ever heard of something called bubble gum?

992
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,080
It doesn't leave your body for over seven years.

993
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,820
- Okay, wait, so it leaves the body then?

994
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,760
You just said never, and then you just gave me a time frame.

995
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,320
- Say she eats a bubble gum now,

996
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,040
and then in six years and three months,

997
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,600
I conceive into her,

998
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,720
and then we have a bubble gum baby.

999
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,440
- Okay, can I ask you a question?

1000
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,440
- No!

1001
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,200
- Can you Google what, can you right now

1002
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,140
go on Google and type poop?

1003
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,160
- Okay, I'm not sure how this is relevant,

1004
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,440
but yes, I can type poop.

1005
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,280
Okay, now what?

1006
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,760
- And search it.

1007
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,840
- I searched it, it says dictionary poop,

1008
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,720
the after most and highest deck of a ship,

1009
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,960
especially if it's a sailing ship,

1010
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,240
where it typically forms a roof of a cabin in the stern.

1011
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,640
- All right, all right, all right, hang on.

1012
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,200
Next step here, click images.

1013
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,600
OK, I'm not sure what your point is.

1014
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:32,700
Oh, it's a bunch of pictures of brown ice cream.

1015
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,160
Why'd you make me look at this now? I'm hungry.

1016
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,260
So I think stuff does leave your body. Hmm.

1017
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,560
It's just, oh, wow.

1018
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,700
Some of these are completely the worst things I've ever seen.

1019
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,660
There's I clicked on one that was in a diaper,

1020
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,640
and now I'm getting just pictures of black sludge in diapers.

1021
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,560
People asking, is this healthy?

1022
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,720
And it's literally like it's like slime from an alien movie

1023
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,760
on a diaper.

1024
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,360
And they're just like posting that. Yeah.

1025
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,000
That's awesome.

1026
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,320
He's a close that right now.

1027
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,280
On if you search poop on Google, the tabs at the top, you know,

1028
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,880
like images, news, videos, you have images, news, videos.

1029
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,000
Color is the next one.

1030
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,360
I hate that. I hate I hate the the moving buttons on Google.

1031
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,800
The thing is so stupid.

1032
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,720
We, I don't, luckily I don't use Google.

1033
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,440
That's the first time I've used it in over six years.

1034
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,740
I'm a duck, duck, go man.

1035
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,200
(sighs)

1036
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,040
- You can't escape, dude.

1037
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,820
Do you have an iPhone? - I don't care about any of that.

1038
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,200
- Oh, I can't escape?

1039
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,960
Okay, name one thing about my fucking life.

1040
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,800
- You are bald.

1041
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,440
- But Google doesn't know that.

1042
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,700
(laughing)

1043
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,360
- Have you never gone to the ad place?

1044
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360
- You know what we should do?

1045
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,360
We should look at our Google AdSense profiles.

1046
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,600
How do you know how you can see what Google thinks you are?

1047
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,960
No.

1048
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,140
AdSense profile,

1049
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,040
you can you can look at like what Google thinks that you're

1050
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,100
you are based on what you kind of stuff that you do.

1051
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,740
How do you like for this?

1052
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,700
People like for this on the tenure.

1053
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,600
Let me see if I can find it.

1054
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,700
Rex, what is this hat?

1055
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,480
It's from the Lavender Festival.

1056
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,920
Oh I see. You completely came in here with a whole new vibe and we've barely even talked about it.

1057
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,960
I mean, is the vibe that the camera is off-center?

1058
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,000
The camera's off-center, you have a stoner type weed smoker vibe.

1059
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,200
You're wearing a hat. You've never worn a hat in your entire life.

1060
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,400
My hair...

1061
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,080
What is even on the hat?

1062
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,080
It's a bear.

1063
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,360
Can you get really close to the camera so we can see it?

1064
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:53,360
Okay, go to your Google thing, then go to account, then go to...

1065
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
That work?

1066
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
Yeah.

1067
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,360
I'm going to my Google thing.

1068
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,360
Then go to data and privacy.

1069
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
Okay.

1070
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,360
And then go to...

1071
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,360
Hmm.

1072
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,360
My ad center?

1073
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,360
Let me see.

1074
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,360
Make a plan for your digital legacy.

1075
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,360
What kind of, what shit is this, man?

1076
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,660
This site is insane.

1077
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,960
Go to

1078
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,500
ad personalization.

1079
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Where do you see that?

1080
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,040
Yeah, where do you see that?

1081
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,600
You know, I don't know.

1082
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,640
This is probably a pretty old thing.

1083
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,640
Personalize ad, go to my ad center.

1084
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,420
OK, so that's where we have a problem because I have my turned off.

1085
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,380
All right. Wait. Oh, you have your turned off?

1086
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,680
OK, here's what it says about me.

1087
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,920
Gender.

1088
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:53,080
male. Interesting. That's a green circle for you Google. Age, don't like this, 25 to 34,

1089
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,840
which I was really expecting based on what the kinds of things that I look at that it

1090
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:05,520
was going to say that I was like 14, but no. Languages, two languages. That's right. People

1091
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,960
say I have a bi vibe. It's wrong. People always say I have a bi vibe. There it is. Wait, which

1092
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:34,960
I'm

1093
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,520
Whoa.

1094
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,400
I act like a single motherfucker online.

1095
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,760
Household income, moderately high.

1096
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,280
Whoa. Okay.

1097
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,400
All right, I'll take that. So you should get wrong.

1098
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,160
Education, not enough info.

1099
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,820
They're saying I'm uneducated.

1100
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,020
Industry I work in, technology.

1101
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,920
Okay.

1102
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,040
Employer size, large employer.

1103
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,140
Home ownership, not enough info, and I'm not a parent.

1104
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,420
So I would say they got, let's see,

1105
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,260
they really only got my age, my gender and my relationship, or no,

1106
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:13,860
I'm not single. Whoa. My gender. And that's it actually.

1107
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,060
You're a moderately high income.

1108
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,900
No, I'm not.

1109
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,180
You live in New York City.

1110
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,540
Average or lower income.

1111
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,860
Let's see. What is the, what is the median?

1112
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,140
The medium income is like $48,000.

1113
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,860
Then I'm right there or under.

1114
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,820
Let's see. Median American income.

1115
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,660
Is your, do you have your Google ads thing?

1116
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,620
Oh my God. I'm way less $70,000.

1117
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,220
Meet in the national median household income.

1118
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,740
Not household household.

1119
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,300
Oh yeah. I guess you're right.

1120
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:53,220
That's one earner is in Alabama is $52,000.

1121
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,020
$31,000 is the median income.

1122
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,300
Okay. Then I'm, I'm above that.

1123
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,220
So you're moderately to highly paid.

1124
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,860
I mean, this thing is fucking, I mean,

1125
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,380
This is getting scary guys.

1126
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,020
It's not scary.

1127
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,060
Do you have one Rex or no?

1128
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:07,860
I do.

1129
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:15,860
Male 25 to 34 language, English, single, high income, bachelor's

1130
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,580
degree, technology, large employer, renter, not a parent.

1131
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,700
So that one's almost completely correct.

1132
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,260
Yeah.

1133
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,580
Everything with the large employer.

1134
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:32,460
I think your employers can, your employer can be considered as large.

1135
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,980
A large employer is 250 to 10,000 employees.

1136
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,460
Yeah. You ain't that. Yeah.

1137
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,980
No, I term, I term right now because I am actually off of the,

1138
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,260
I didn't even know I could turn. Actually, I think I was, I have just,

1139
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,980
I think it's funny to do this once every couple of years, but you know what?

1140
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,100
I'm going to turn it off.

1141
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,700
That one's not as fun as having your,

1142
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,260
the one that I do like is having Google track everywhere I go. So

1143
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,420
Every, at the end of the month,

1144
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,820
it'll just send me like a notification like,

1145
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,900
oh, this is where you did this month.

1146
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,180
It's like, oh, you walked this much.

1147
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,340
Oh, you drove this much.

1148
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,540
This whole places you went to.

1149
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,180
And I think that's a little cool.

1150
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,560
- There's so much shit on fucking Google,

1151
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,620
the applications.

1152
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,140
What the hell is Jamboard?

1153
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,020
- I think that's like a music.

1154
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,420
- You don't have a jam yet?

1155
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,980
Well, let me create one.

1156
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,100
What the hell, I can make a jam?

1157
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,940
I've always wanted to make a jam.

1158
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,840
- I love jamming.

1159
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,680
- We've given him too many toys.

1160
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:38,680
the

1161
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,040
This sucks.

1162
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,880
Sorry, man.

1163
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,200
I thought I discovered a new app,

1164
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,700
but it basically just sucks like the rest of them.

1165
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,320
Yeah.

1166
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,040
Google Fi Wireless, that could be interesting.

1167
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,000
You know, I actually sucks to--

1168
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,320
I still have Google Fi.

1169
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,360
Is that when they,

1170
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,840
is that the like Google Fiber, is that that?

1171
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,440
What is Google Fi?

1172
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,440
It's a--

1173
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,280
Network.

1174
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,100
It's a network.

1175
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,200
Oh, it's like a cellular service?

1176
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,040
Yeah.

1177
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,860
Yeah, it's cheap,

1178
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,860
And it uses T-Mobile and Sprint at the same time.

1179
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,700
How do they manage this, Rex?

1180
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,340
Through some sort of carrier switching mechanism.

1181
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,800
I don't believe you.

1182
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,520
I think I want to switch to Mint because they have those funny commercials.

1183
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,520
With Ryan Reynolds?

1184
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,520
Yeah, with Free Guy.

1185
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,520
That's what I call him.

1186
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,520
Yeah.

1187
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,620
And he made like a hundred million dollars from that.

1188
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,940
Yeah, they didn't even sell out.

1189
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,420
He sold out his entire company.

1190
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,420
I think he...

1191
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,420
No, he started it.

1192
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,420
Yeah, he started it and he sold out.

1193
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:43,300
His thing is to start companies or buy companies then do all the ads for free so that they can like

1194
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,380
They have his name open value. Yeah, he did the same thing with aviation and

1195
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:54,980
Then he just sells them and makes him a hundred mil. They did that with George Clooney did that with

1196
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:01,540
Casamigos, I think they made like he made like a half a billion dollars selling Casamigos. Mm-hmm

1197
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,980
You know who also is like a billionaire

1198
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:10,100
Ashton Kutcher. Oh, yeah, he's like a like a tech. He's like an angel investor, right? Yeah

1199
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,260
What's the best

1200
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:20,500
Bullshit yeah computer. Yeah shark tank stuff, you know, yeah, he's

1201
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,340
He's got one, let's see

1202
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,700
See if there's anything good one password

1203
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,540
Well that seems like a bad idea one password I have one password for

1204
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,380
everything and I get hacked all the time. I shouldn't say that. Whatever I don't

1205
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,980
care. He invested in that company that made all the celebrities by bored apes

1206
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:51,900
Moonpay. He's a genius. That's funny. Did you guys know that Andy Milonakis is

1207
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,400
getting shit on because he he scammed like a million dollars off his NFT thing? I don't

1208
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,840
care about any of them to like look up what it was but what happened?

1209
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,520
He was basically taking pictures of stuff in his house and making them NFTs.

1210
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,320
That's dope, why did he scam them?

1211
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:15,640
Well because he said that there was basically gonna be metaverse incorporation and they were

1212
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:21,440
going to have virtual worlds and none of that happened.

1213
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,200
After the initial six months of people buying and selling and being like "oh these NFTs are

1214
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,100
gonna do something at some point and then nothing ever happening. I think if you

1215
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:37,060
get scammed on crypto on metaverse or NFT stuff current year and anyway in the

1216
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:41,320
future I think you're a sucker. I think these people were suckers from the

1217
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:45,700
beginning. Yeah you have that kind of money and you spend it on that you are

1218
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,580
you either have enough money that it doesn't matter or you're actually a

1219
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:53,340
a fucking idiot. Yeah. All right.

1220
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,500
I'll say the people who bought NFTs were seriously fucking morons.

1221
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,900
That's very not afraid to say that.

1222
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:05,540
So Spotify, Uber, Shazam, SoundCloud, Airbnb.

1223
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,980
Sounds like my damn phone.

1224
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1225
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,300
He bought my phone.

1226
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,420
So, yeah, those are just apps on his phone.

1227
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,820
What are you saying, Rex?

1228
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,820
Everybody has his ass.

1229
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,220
That's Ashley Kutcher investments.

1230
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,820
Yeah, I'm invested in a lot of stuff.

1231
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,820
Me and Rex had a funny Shazam adventure this week.

1232
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,820
What did you guys do?

1233
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,220
[laughter]

1234
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:33,820
I had one specific line that I knew was a Drake verse,

1235
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,820
but I didn't know what song it was from.

1236
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:40,820
And I tried to tell it to Hugo.

1237
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,820
It did have a certain word in it, so I'm not going to repeat it.

1238
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,820
Uh-huh.

1239
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:51,620
And he didn't know it and then he kept playing me Drake songs and then it turned out to be a legend

1240
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,320
You were just thinking I'm a legend

1241
00:59:54,320 --> 01:00:00,700
Yeah, but he just thought about he was misremembering like the lyrics in a really funny way

1242
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,860
And he was like, I can't find this song. I don't know what the song is. I was trying to help him

1243
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,860
I was like, oh, do you should just sing it to Shazam?

1244
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,140
And he said it and she was like no, I don't know what that

1245
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,700
to me. Well, Shazam did and then it kept going and I was like, that's enough. That's all I have.

1246
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:27,740
Yeah. So basically Shazam is bullshit. Shazam is not bullshit. Shazam is awesome sauce.

1247
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,580
What are you looking at? Nothing important.

1248
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:37,260
Okay. Okay. I was looking at big wind board because all this talk about NFTs made me want to gamble.

1249
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,500
Oh, let's do it.

1250
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,020
Yeah, I'm so down to do it.

1251
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,460
Oh, my God.

1252
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,820
That's what we need after this long week, guys.

1253
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:49,220
We do need a game session, one for the epic one.

1254
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,860
Yeah, we need an epic one.

1255
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,300
Maybe we'll even record it.

1256
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,380
Who knows?

1257
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,420
Probably not.

1258
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,540
I was up to Juvia.

1259
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:59,100
I was asked whether GWA was dead last night.

1260
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:04,620
I don't know, would you consider a Phoenix dead?

1261
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,140
If it was sitting in a bunch of ash that it had just exploded into?

1262
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,140
I guess so.

1263
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:14,500
Don't answer that question because the answer is no.

1264
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,020
The Phoenix will rise again and that's exactly what we're about to do by gambling probably

1265
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,020
$45.

1266
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,020
Okay, let's go.

1267
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,020
Alright, let's go.

1268
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,020
Let's go.

1269
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,020
Let's go.
