1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
come back and make a mess

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,120
and receive a black

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,240
okay

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,920
home myself but she really and and caleb bridges watching uh...

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,440
fear factor your factory or you got here and

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,400
uh... the thing that you know there are watching this something called the

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,920
submerged bug box well yes it's very

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
a emerged escape submerged bug box and it's very we're imagining somebody go

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,800
like don't going on fear factor me like yeah my greatest fear would probably be

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,520
escaping a submerged bug probably in a box full of bugs I'm finally that is

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,640
submerged and having to escape it with my partner from a different reality show

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
I'm fine with it but as long as they're not submerged or in a box yeah I mean I

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,160
like bugs I like box any okay I'm being submerged I'm fine with being in a bug

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,800
box and I'm fine with having to escape but all three at the same time I'm about

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,960
have to have a fear factor you're making me into a fear factory thinking about

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,280
this year a bug bag that's fine yeah a bug I'm in those all day I'll take a bug

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,160
bath right now I won't escape I got lost in a bug bog I say that was a girl I was

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,440
stuck in a big box that's fine I can breathe in there it's huge a bug

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,200
restroom yeah whatever a bug a bug restroom a bug parlor yeah I got a bug

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,280
the grass room. They got a rest room for bugs. I was just backstage a

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,000
little, but they have a restroom now there's these restrooms get so

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,160
complicated. They have one for box

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,200
the one there's a women's a man's and a rest room and it's small. It's on

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
the ground. Other bugs went on the floor.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,520
You walk out. I hope I peek my head and it's just a floor.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,720
There's not even a tiny toilet in there. I mean I'm terrified of a bug

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,640
box, but a candy store. Yeah, that'll be fine with me. That's fine with me as long

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,320
as it's not a bug store or a candy box or a bug box or a bug in candy or a candy.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,320
You try to get me to eat a scorpion lollipop. I'll smack you. Hell no. We're

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,000
gonna make you do these lollipops with scorpions in them. They put a scorpion in

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,720
a lollipop. This next this next contest is his next fear factor. Fear is escaping

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,520
a submerged bug box. Did you say staying in a beautiful candy room? I think he

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
I said staying in a most beautiful candy room.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
- Well that's what I said too,

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,520
is like yeah, you go in a fear factory and you're like,

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,560
you know, in case you guys are still developing any talent,

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
is my greatest fear would probably be

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
eating the best hamburger ever.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
- Oh, I'd hate it.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
- With extra mayo.

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
(gagging)

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
- I'm so scared of mayo.

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,920
- You know what I'm afraid of?

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
- What? - Bottomless fries.

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
- Yeah.

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,200
- Where do they end?

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,920
(laughing)

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,200
- I'm afraid I'm gonna put my hand in

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,160
and it's not gonna come back.

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,880
- That's right, I'm afraid someone's gonna reach out

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
of the bottomless fries.

52
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,920
- That would be a good fear challenge,

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,000
to fall in a bottomless at red robin yeah, that's a have a giant like

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,280

109
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,420
you look like a theater actor. You look like a black box theater actor.

110
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,260
Anytime you were all black. Yeah. It looks like the only reason you're doing it is

111
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,740
so you can better embody different characters. You're doing

112
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,180
dramatic improv. Yeah. Non-comedic improv in a black box theater. Can I get a

113
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,260
suggestion for a trauma please? That's what you're saying to the audience. Yeah.

114
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,780
Yeah. And one of them is saying, "Submerged black box and it's Jerry Seinfeld and he's eating fries."

115
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,000
that's hard to be dramatic in that way like that'd be an easy cause a layup of a

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,120
comedy I know but a dramatic if you if you play it well I mean it could take you

117

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,240
- Chain Hang Low.

157
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,600
- You know who was always my favorite was Hurricane Chris.

158
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,440
- Oh, A-B-B.

159
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,520
- Hand clap, A-B-B, drop it, give me 50 with Mike Jones.

160
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,320
And then he went to jail for murder.

161
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,160
- Yeah.

162
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,220
- Yeah, dude.

163
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,360
- There was a, there's like a YouTuber I watched

164
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,440
that did a Hurricane Chris parody video.

165
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,280
- That's it.

166
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,440
- And I didn't realize 'til like a year ago

167
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
that he's in like full body blackface.

168
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,000
- Really?

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,820
- Yeah, full, he's in full--

170
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,100
- Wow. - He's in black body.

171
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,940
- Black body? - Whoa.

172
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,780
- Chocolate body, dude?

173
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,260
- Dude, it's literally like,

174
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,860
he looks like the chocolate man

175
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,540
from the Axe Body Spray Commercials.

176
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,460
- Looks like he's about to perform

177
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,900
in a bodybuilding competition.

178
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,540
- But Hurricane Chris watched,

179
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,500
there's a video of Hurricane Chris watching the video,

180
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,620
and he likes it.

181
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,820
- Really? - Yeah.

182
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,660
- That's cool. - Good for him, dude.

183
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,020
- I don't know if that's-- - It's all good fun

184
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,780
for Chris, dude. - Yeah.

185
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,460
- He doesn't care.

186
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,060
- But yeah, it was very jarring to see.

187
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,100
- Everybody pretty much did black face until 2009.

188
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,660
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, fucking Bo Selecta.

189
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,420
I don't know what that is.

190
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,940
You know what that is? Oh, well, Bo Selecta.

191
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,700
Nobody knows what that is. It's a British thing.

192
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,300
Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Leo will know.

193
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,780
It's a British TV show.

194
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,620
They still are doing it. They don't have...

195
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,860
Well, dude, he does like prosthetics that are like crazy looking.

196
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,540
Well, dates work differently over there, so they're still in like 2003 or whatever.

197
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,940
Yeah, true. They're in the year 11 right now.

198
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,620
It's because, yeah, it's because of the fucking way they order dates.

199
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,780
That's what I said. Yeah. Dates work differently.

200
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,580
Fuck, I fucked up. God damn it.

201
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:35,940
the

202
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,420
does both selected. But if you do, put me in your will first. Yeah. What could you give

203
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:48,100
me in your will? Maybe a guitar. Really? Yeah, I could give you a guitar and then Cameron

204
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,740
gets maybe one of my skateboards. Can I have your computer? Okay, I guess. Can I play on

205
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:02,500
your computer if you die? In my will, you get 36 hours of time on my computer. Per week

206
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,220
make her forever forever what forever yeah you got it you got to choose that

207
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,500
she here that's I'm getting a lawyer who can read that as a loophole it says I

208
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,300
get to use this computer forever. I'm getting some white out and I'm changing

209
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,100
your will yeah

210
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,900
yeah and my bones will

211
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:25,300
I bequeath on you all of my bones to be used for Halloween at your house. That

212
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,900
would be sick. That's honestly worth it. Absolutely. I don't give a fuck if I get

213
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,680
buried. Just take have I wouldn't want to get buried, have them strip all my meat

214
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,200
off yeah, beat him to a dog and getting creamed to be cooler than getting

215
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,620
buried. Anyway, there's got to be a way because

216
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,800
because you permanently haunt your family. If you get buried, you're in a

217
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,100
your go to a cemetery. They have like you see you every once in a while.

218
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,780
They'll forget about you. They don't care, but if you cremate it, you're

219
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,700
literally in their house constantly and they have to remember that you're there

220
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,120
all the time, unless they try and scatter you in the ocean or something

221
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,020
those freak families do who disrespect their dead relatives.

222
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,060
The thing is, I don't want to be cremated, honestly.

223
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Yeah.

224
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,340
Because I want to still, I want there to be, if they come up with a reanimating technology,

225
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,740
I want to be, you know, a pretty good candidate.

226
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
Yeah, first one.

227
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
Well, I'd rather not get cremated either.

228
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,060
I'd rather just be alive.

229
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
There's got to be a way.

230
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
True.

231
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
I'd rather never die.

232
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
Yeah.

233
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,820
I feel like by the time we're old, there might be a never die thing.

234
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,380
There's got to be a way in the cremation oven.

235
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,420
Like maybe it's just like the amount of time you put them in, but I want to like, I want

236
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,820
my body to be cooked like a pizza.

237
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,220
- Yeah. - Like I wanna be,

238
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,540
like I wanna be taken out of the cremation oven

239
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,020
and I'm like roasted like a pig.

240
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,620
- Yeah. - Crispy skin.

241
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,660
And anyone can eat me.

242
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,700
- Yeah, anyone?

243
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,740
- Anyone can eat me.

244
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,500
It's a big feast of my dead body.

245
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,340
- You wanna be a feast of your body.

246
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,160
- Yeah.

247
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,100
- See, I wouldn't even know where to start on a person.

248
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,940
- I know where to start.

249
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,900
- What's the deal with these cremated Patrick's nowadays?

250
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,180
- What do you start on, the leg?

251
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,220
It's gotta be a leg, right?

252
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,060
- Yeah, I'm probably the leg.

253
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,300
I mean there you know there's one guy who's gonna go for the face right away

254
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,060
like the guy who takes the candy out of the middle of a birthday cake yeah yeah

255
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,620
wonder what a grilled eyeball would taste like probably like I saw I saw like a

256
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,660
like a picture of like an eyeball that got a cut on it and then they put

257
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,780
stitches on the eyeball yeah dude that's the worst shit I can't watch that video

258
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,940
of that lambs eyeball being sliced with the razor yeah okay oh yeah from the

259
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:31,100
shit that sucks. Eyeball stuff is the worst. Yeah, I like my eyeballs. Me too. I love my

260
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,940
eyeballs. I have beautiful brown eyes. There's no such thing as beautiful brown eyes. I do.

261
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,180
Not on a man. You have stinky poo eyes. I have the most beautiful eyes in the world.

262
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,700
Your eyes are just, they might as well be nothing. I have piercing red eyes. Watch this.

263
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,580
That's your face that you're doing. Whenever someone has brown eyes, I just, in my brain,

264
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,820
I can't remember what color their eyes are because my brain just like ignores it. Yeah,

265
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:15,280
are

266
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,040
really gonna get a kick out of it. I'm not allowed back there. Really? Did you try, did

267
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,000
you use all the time? No, I went in the back and I was laughing so hard. It's funny as

268
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,280
hell back there. Dude, oh my god, they have a nurse's outfit and like... Holy crap. Things

269
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,000
that a guy puts in his butt. Like what? Like a, it's a cylinder. Yeah. That a man puts in

270
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,040
his butt. Well he's probably trying to, trying to do some, trying to build a potato gun and

271
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,260
he just slips on the PVC pipe. No, it's a thing and it's... Or he's like on, he's on

272
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:55,200
roller skates. I can't imagine why I would answer this. He's on roller skates and his pants falls down and he trips over them and he flies onto a railing. It's balls on a

273
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:04,640
string. Balls on a string? A man puts in his butt. Hold on. Balls on a string? Well this has to be some kind of... I got balls on a string. You know what, he must be doing...

274
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,040
he must be doing some kind of Mardi Gras thing where he's trying to throw the

275
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,000
beads to a woman's ear and then he puts them in his butt.

276
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But they accidentally, he's really strong, he's in the MLB.

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh well he's doing Manny Ramirez and he throws it so hard.

278
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
He's doing softball windmill pitch.

279
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,520
And it accidentally catches another woman who's behind him, her vagina, and it flies

280
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,600
off, ricochets off, she's had surgery, into his butt.

281
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
That must be it.

282
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
That must be the point of those.

283
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Yeah.

284
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,880
I mean I don't understand why anything would ever enter a man's ass.

285
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Me neither.

286
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Unless you're cleaning it with shampoo and you're 15.

287
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Yeah.

288
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,000
And it feels funny.

289
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Unless it's a GoPro.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,640
The thing is, I put my finger in my ass.

291
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,720
It's like you get, I feel, I get why you would like it, but that's because I like pooping.

292
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,600
You know?

293
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,680
Like I really love to poop.

294
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,200
Like pooping is like one of my...

295
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
It just doesn't interest me.

296
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,440
(laughing)

297
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,500
- I put my finger up there before, I'm just not gripped.

298
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,340
- It just, it never caught me.

299
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
- I've done a lot more fascinating things in my life,

300
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,940
it's just nothing, it's not for me.

301
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,780
- Just never.

302
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,360
- I just don't find it interesting.

303
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,020
- Never stimulated my brain much.

304
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,480
- No, it just never clicks.

305
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,980
- I think it's supposed to stimulate something else in there.

306
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,560
- Yeah, it stimulates my I love poop neurons,

307
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,720
which like, I'll sit on the toilet,

308
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,040
I wish, honestly, I wish I could just poop all day.

309
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,800
- Oh dude, I gotta stop sitting on the toilet

310
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,640
for a long time. - I love pooping.

311
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,460
A really good poop though,

312
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,280
like one that's just like thick and really you feel it,

313
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,200
that's a good feeling.

314
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,360
- My stomach, my poop's been messed up lately.

315
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,960
I've been really constipated.

316
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
- I gotta hand you one of these.

317
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,640
- When I was at Disney World, I rode the Tower of Terror

318
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,000
and it felt like the poop brick in my stomach

319
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,600
was gonna fly out of my mouth.

320
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,440
- That would've been kind of funny.

321
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,280
- That'd be cool.

322
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,160
Just get rid of it all in one fell swoop.

323
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,480
- It would be funny to throw up a poop log.

324
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,320
- It would be funny to get--

325
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,600
I feel like that's the way that's like the the physically that's the way it

326
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,400
would happen to right a sudden drop yeah and it just it just inertia just it just

327
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:20,160
flies out as it came out it goes out the damn window yeah it's some kid places the

328
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,840
hot dog and a kid's hot dog but it's there right as you eat your crap and see

329
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh hell no. Oh hell no. That ain't gonna happen. Not on my watch. No. It actually derailed the

330
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,520
Aerosmith ride and killed 50 people. Come on dude. Oh no. I don't wanna hear about that.

331
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,660
You know I read today I was reading about those remember those Thai kids that got trapped

332
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:50,600
in that there cave? Oh yeah. That was a pretty funny story. Yeah. I just thought it was funny.

333
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,640
I was reading about it I was like they never explain why they went into the cave. Yeah.

334
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,280
once like I was reading the entire Wikipedia page.

335
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
General spelunking.

336
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,160
And it was just like no they were not wearing spelunking anything.

337
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,800
They were just like, they had just won a soccer match.

338
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,240
And they were like, let's go into the cave.

339
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,400
It's raining, let's go into the cave.

340
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
That's so funny.

341
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Yeah, let's go very deep.

342
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,880
Let's go really far.

343
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
Let's go miles into this cave right now.

344
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Oh what's that?

345
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,360
A very small passage that we can barely squeeze through?

346
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
Probably fine.

347
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Let's go in there.

348
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,120
we just want our soccer game we're on top of the world yet we can survive a week

349
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,960
ago

350
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,600
but i don't want that bill you know we can get out of any case

351
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,360
yeah there's not a word that would work for the civil war

352
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,600
yeah i'm gonna get out fifteen days later because we're seeing what is the

353
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,320
cave other than just a goal

354
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,440
you know

355
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,960
they were that's the truth they're trying to find the end of the goal yes

356
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,200
i find the goalie

357
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,520
yet maybe a soccer ball in the case

358
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,340
uh... chasing after it when i was in my own into the cave for sloping downward

359
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,640
true yeah and they didn't have another soccer ball what it okay what if there's

360
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:06,100
like the ultimate trophy in there oh yeah true kind of a rumple sportskin yeah

361
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,280

Any sports wish at all.

367
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
Any wish.

368
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Because they were like, "Can we get out of this cave?"

369
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,700
And he's like, "No, strictly sports."

370
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
No way.

371
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
No.

372
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Maybe, okay, well, what's the thing?

373
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,300
What if they weren't a soccer team before they went into the cave and they said like,

374
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
"All right, well, fine.

375
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,740
We want to be like the winners of the soccer tournament."

376
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,300
We want there to be any reason why we came into this cave.

377
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Yeah.

378
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,060
Well, they went and they saw a Rumpelstiltskin and he was like a Rumpelpigskin and they were

379
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
like, "Can we get out?

380
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
We wish to get out of the cave."

381
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,900
And he's like, "No, it has to be sports related."

382
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,640
and then they're like okay. Can we kick the soccer ball all the way out of the

383
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,400
cave and he's like okay wait a minute

384
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:05,020
no hold on now. So you guys got to feed me a baby one of the one of the four or

385
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,060
five of the kids when they were rescued from the cave. Turns out that they were

386
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,840
stateless and they belonged to what is that mean they belong to no country like

387
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,460
the movie terminal and then tie a tie water.

388
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Thailand gave them statehood after...

389
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
What the fuck?

390
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Or not statehood.

391
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
How are you statesless?

392
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Were they born over the ocean or something?

393
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
They were born, they never, they didn't even exist.

394
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Were they born in a cave?

395
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
I don't know.

396
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
They were created in the cave.

397
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
They were literally changelings.

398
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
They were like fairy folk.

399
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,360
We need four other people to have a full defensive line.

400
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
No problem!

401
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
I got that!

402
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
They don't belong to a country!

403
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,840
I can create as many boys as you want, but they can't have passports.

404
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
They all look Swedish.

405
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,720
That's when they rescued the kids, they were like, "Why is Tyler, why is all like four

406
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
of these kids blonde?

407
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,040
What is going on here?"

408
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,720
They're like, "It was Rumpelpigskin.

409
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,440
He's the cave spirit, but he only likes to give sports wishes, so you know, unless you're

410
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,760

447
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:25,280
strongly to the left yeah yeah not only strongly strongly how strong in the

448
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,040
You ever heard of a right angle?

449
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Yeah.

450
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
That's about it.

451
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Damn.

452
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Really?

453
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Yeah, that's because I have a Lego hand.

454
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,920
What does that Lego hand have to do with the right angle?

455
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,480
I just figured those were related, but maybe they're not.

456
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
I don't know.

457
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,120
Actually, that's a perfect jacking off hand, a Lego hand.

458
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
That is a perfect jacking off hand.

459
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,760
Until you realize, circular middle, a Lego man's penis is definitely a square.

460
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Yup.

461
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Yeah.

462
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
That's got to be it.

463
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
It's got to be like a...

464
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
They're making very little contact.

465
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
cutting his hand on his corners of his thing.

466
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Do you think a Lego man's penis would be a...

467
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Has to be a square.

468
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Right? Am I tripping?

469
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
I think what the Lego man probably does

470
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
is his business and we should talk about it.

471
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
So is a Lego man's

472
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
head is a circle and his feet

473
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
are squares. So is a penis

474
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
closer to a head or a foot? Foot.

475
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Okay, it's a square.

476
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
My head has eyes and a mouth.

477
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
What I think happens... My wiener has a mouth.

478
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Well I think happens...

479
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,080
- Well no, 'cause there's the lightsabers too.

480
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,920
The Lego lightsabers.

481
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,880
- Those are circles. - That's different,

482
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,040
that's not canon.

483
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,520
- Well those aren't body parts.

484
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,360
- Yeah.

485
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,180
- Well yeah, but then I feel like

486
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,020
it's the same shape. - We're talking,

487
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,860
we're talking, - In terms of Lego shapes.

488
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,640
- We're talking Lego here right now.

489
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,040
- But I think, I think all, - We're not talking Star Wars.

490
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,440
- Any Lego man has to like, basically wear a strap on.

491
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,200
- I don't. - A lot.

492
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,720
Well yeah, they have strap on heads,

493
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,240
of course they wear a strap on. - Yeah, exactly.

494
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,900
They would wear a strap on penis.

495
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,420
- Okay, yeah, I'm with you, what's up?

496
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,500
Well that's what I'm saying, so it could be anything.

497
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,740
I mean it could all be anything, they're Legos.

498
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,580
Yeah.

499
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,420
I'm just saying.

500
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,240
It is up to your imagination.

501
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,080
It also--

502
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,580
It is a Lego, it is up to your imagination.

503
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,420
Of course.

504
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,900
I would say it depends.

505
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,260
A Lego woman's vagina, is it a square or is it a--

506
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,660
Where, okay, where is that?

507
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,220
Under the pants.

508
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,180
Oh, so they have to get out of,

509
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
they have to put on new legs.

510
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,500
They have to take off clothes to--

511
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,660
They have to take off their legs

512
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,220
and put on their naked legs.

513
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,060
Yeah.

514
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,100
That have a vagina and a butthole.

515
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,940
Yeah.

516
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,900
Or just the butthole of--

517
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,660
Yeah, because they do have the thing of Lego.

518
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,060
Lego women got four holes in the back.

519
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,560
Damn.

520
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,980
[LAUGHTER]

521
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,660
And they got holes in their feet, too.

522
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,500
They flat as hell, though.

523
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,780
They got four holes in the back and some holes in the--

524
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,500
Well, I've been altering my Lego figures, so none of them--

525
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,780
they all have big butts.

526
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,780
Nice.

527
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,940

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,420
at how flat some of them are.

529
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,380
It's disgusting.

530
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,100
It's disgusting.

531
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,500
Even the men, I give them big pumper dumpers.

a gas station in North Carolina and get to just like, just spend the entire time fucked

560
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,180
up on fake weed watching Forged in Fire. That might be a good move. It's a great move, dude.

561
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,140
Just feel dangerous the whole time. I think one of the best moves on Christmas is drinking

562
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,980
eggnog. Eggnog hits different at Christmas time. Absolutely. Ornaments be hitting different

567
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:43,020

568
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,420
one foot on average so this is doing to be four or five feet probably yeah which

569
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,340
is hugee. I think I put it like right yeah that'd be nice and you know I like I

570
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,860
hate fake Christmas trees but I don't I don't feel like getting a real one.

571
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,560
They're prickly cleaning up after it. And they don't smell good. Yeah you gotta put the

572
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,900
smells in there. Yeah you gotta anything you gotta put in there. Oh and I'm putting plenty of smells in the tree.

573
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,260
That's right. I'm dusting it. You ever farted and feel like you have to run away from it?

574
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,940
Yesterday I farted on the way I it's like so hot and it smells so bad that

575
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,580
you're like yeah, I can't be in this and I it's gonna stick. Yeah, do you have

576
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,020
it's like a looney tunes shape of your body and green. Do you ever far in

577
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,340
public or with people and then you smell it and you're like I'm not even gonna

578
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,580
acknowledge it because there's no way anybody's gonna guess that that came

579
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,620
from a human. I'm like that people will assume this is some industrial smell.

580
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,780
Yeah, sometimes it's like it's like so bad that you like you. You can't open

581
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,100
your mouth to accuse someone of it. Yeah, yeah, I just have to let this one all

582
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,900

586
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,020

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,940
- All beans?

588
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,460
- All beans and corn.

589
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,820
And I just eat it every single meal.

590
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,460
I eat it with eggs in the morning sometimes.

591
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,740
- Whoa. - Christ.

592
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,060

- You know, there's a lot of--

594
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,940
- That's gonna take you down.

595
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,580
- There's a lot of YouTubers that you can watch

596
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,700
that can teach you how to make vegan food

597
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,940
that isn't bean salad.

598
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,620
- This is cheap and I like it a lot.

599
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,460
- Yeah?

600
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,300
- I like how it makes me smell.

601
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,580
- Oh, boy.

606
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,780
But I didn't shit myself. Thank God, but I was fully convinced. Well, yeah, there's like sometimes sometimes a gas will leave your body

607
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,660
That's so hot that it feels like it like pushed your underwear

608
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,620
Did I tell you guys about Jana thinking I shit myself the other night?

609
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,020
No, I already talked about this. Didn't you shit yourself?

614
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,020

But yeah, it was very embarrassing to me right in that moment.

I haven't shit myself, I don't think, ever.

625
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660

it was in a good italian sub

653
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,100
leadership myself in the middle of making it and i don't know the shit yet

654
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,680
the shower well yeah the showers are a bucket of yeah that's what i whenever i

655
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,040
should let me know if i can't and i saw my ass in the bath i came downstairs

656
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,560
after

657
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,440
showering from having shit myself and then looked at the sub and I was just like, "Hey

658
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,080
mom, there's a sub in the kitchen if you want it." And then just went in my bed and just

659
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,320
canceled the day out. That was the end of the day for me.

660
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,000
I think the last time I shit myself I was also puking. I don't know if that counts.

661
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's fine.

662
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It doesn't really count.

663
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
No, that's like a...

664
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's like food poisoning.

665
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah.

666
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,680
Like me, every time I've shit myself, I've made the decision to let something go and I

667
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,880
I just gamble it. You know, I'm a natural born gambler. I'm always looking for the next jackpot.

668
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,880
And it's usually I put a crap lot in my pants.

669
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I've told you guys about the time that I, the worst time I ever got food poisoning,

670
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
right?

671
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,680
No. I don't think I've ever had food poisoning.

672
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Oh, I've gotten.

673
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
No, I've had it.

674
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,520
I've had it. It's horrible.

675
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,880
I got food poisoning. The first time I ever got food poisoning was when I was five and

676
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,200
and I went to Burger King and I got the chicken parm

677
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,240
at Burger King.

678
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,080
- Ooh.

679
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,900
- Yeah.

680
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,740
- How was it?

681
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,160
- I got food poisoning.

682
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,840
- But usually the food is pretty good

683
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,280
if you got food poisoning, right?

684
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,680
- I guess, I don't know.

685
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,640
- Means it just got like, it was very juicy chicken.

686
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,800
- I just remember, I remember like,

687
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,880
getting ready for school and then like having like a fever.

688
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,720
- Or it means that the guy pooped on his hands

689
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,540
when he was making it.

690
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,200
- Yeah, that could have been it.

691
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,480
- Which I would like a lot.

692
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,080
- Having a fever and then like,

693
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,100

698
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,720

we're in a hotel we're like going to do something weird

700
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,020

- Yeah.

705
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,380
- Like the diarrhea hurts, it's hot when it comes out.

706
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,380
- Do you guys ever really wanna get sick for a little bit?

707
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,220
- No.

708
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,060
- Not really.

709
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,260
- When I was in elementary school--

710
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,100
- I kinda like that, couple days where you just like

711
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,540
can't even like look at, you can't even watch a movie,

712
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,380
you're so tired.

713
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,220
- Yeah.

714
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,040
- You just like sleep all the time.

715
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,820
- I got a stomach bug in second grade in the summer.

716
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,340
So I like was able to kinda like milk like three days

717
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,780
of not going to school.

718
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,100
Like the first day was really bad,

719
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,620
the second day I think I puked in the morning

720
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,980
then was fine and then the third day I was just like oh I can't go to school I'm

721
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,380
still so sick. Oh dude I used to stretch it out. Yeah yeah yeah. Long time I'd be sick.

722
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,860
I was probably setting records in middle school. Yeah I was sick for three

723
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,380
months. Yeah you were Ferris Buellering. I was I was Buellered up every day bro.

724
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:09,180
You know I had a dummy that played me. He's a damn good actor. That

725
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:14,300
emulator keyboard that plays burps. Yeah I had a burping keyboard. So what? Who

726
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,140
- You didn't.

727
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,780
- But I think it was like,

728
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,420
I've definitely talked about this.

729
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,600
I was moving back in to my parents' house,

730
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,900
or like we just moved to like a new house in New Hampshire,

731
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,140
and I like into my sister's house

732
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,660
with her and her like ex-fiance or whatever.

733
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,460
And like, I found a thing of bacon wrapped scallops

734
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,420
in the back of the fridge.

735
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,260
And I was like, oh yeah.

736
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,420
- Oh yeah, I remember this story.

737
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,460
- Yeah, dude.

738
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,100
That was the hottest something has ever left my body.

739
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,600
Like I've never like diarrhea and puked so hard in my life.

740
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,720
And it was like a tiny toilet.

741
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,560
- Yeah.

742
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,380
- Or like--

743
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,920
- Are you still on one of those potty training kid toilets?

744
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,440
- Yeah, yeah, I was on one of those.

745
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,600
- That you have to--

746
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,440
- Well I had to use that

747
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,080
'cause all the other bathrooms were taken.

748
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,200
- So you're just doing it in the middle of the living room?

749
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,040
- Yeah.

750
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,860
- Then--

751
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,700
- Yeah.

752
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,360
- Hey dad, this needs to be emptied.

753
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,200
(laughing)

754
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,020
- This needs to be cleaned.

755
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,720

(laughing)

757
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,920
Yeah, the dog did something.

758
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,200
I think a dog took a human shit in the baby toilet.

Did the dog learn to go to the bathroom, dad?

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,800
You have to clean it up.

00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,280
that's way scarier than anything that's actually in the show. With a bug as your

815
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,120
teammate. As your parachute yeah. Oh bug is your parachute that ain't gonna work. Yeah a

816
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,360
million bugs as your parachute. A million bugs stitched together yeah that might

817
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,280
actually work. You know when you freeze a bee and then you tie a string around it

818
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
then you can like use it as a kite.

819
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,280
What?

820
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
Did you do that?

821
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
No, that was in CKY.

822
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
Oh.

823
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
The bee just de-thaws?

824
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
You know what you do?

825
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Yeah.

826
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,280
Really?

827
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,280
I guess that's a, there's a bunch of videos of people do it.

828
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,280
You can cryogenically freeze a bee.

829
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,720
Yeah, you can capture a bee in a cup, put it in the freezer, tie a string around it,

830
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,560
and then when it gets like, when it wakes up, you, there's a tie, there's a certain

831
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,800
amount of time around the bee.

832
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,840
You have to like make sure that the bee doesn't die of freezing, of hypothermia.

833
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,880
but it does but it does freeze enough that into an ice cube yeah what really

834
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,240
yeah pretty cool that's gonna happen that's gonna that's what's gonna happen

835
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,180
to all the people who got cryogenically frozen because they have like double

836
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,400
cancer or something yeah like the idea aliens are gonna defrost them and like

837
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,880
I'm doing like a million years yeah they're like trying to go to work and

838
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,120
they're like huh all right yeah I can't seem to cross this street what's that on

839
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,560

840
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,360
yeah they're gonna free it make Disney my pet did hmm here's a hypothetical I've

841
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,320
been thinking of what let's hear it all right would you eat so the new animal

842
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:28,120
drops new animal comes out yes okay animal drops new in there new animal

843
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,000
drops it's one of the tastiest animals in the world but it's called the stink

844
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,240
wraith stink wraith yeah is it big it's a big and what does it look like it looks

845
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,160
- It looks like the stink wraith, it looks like--

846
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,000
- Is this a bug?

847
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,380
- It's like a cross between--

848
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,360
- A wraith is a ghost.

849
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,800
- It's a cross between a porcupine and a hog.

850
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,640
- So a hog.

851
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,480
- What's stinky?

852
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,500
- No, it's a porcupine and a hog mixed together.

853
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,980
- So there's already a stink bug,

854
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,600
so I feel like this should be a bug.

855
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,760
- This is a stink wraith.

856
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,160
- Yeah, but a wraith is a spirit.

857
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,360
- What do you mean a hog?

858
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,200
Hogs don't have--

859
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,420
- They're hogs that have prickles on them.

860
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,520
- Oh, okay.

861
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,360
- Some wild hogs have--

862
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,120
- So I guess it's a species of hog

863
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,000
It's called the stink wraith because it smells so bad.

864
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,160
- Durian smells bad.

865
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,280
- See, okay, that was my next thing.

866
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,840
- Is this a durian kind of--

867
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,720
- Would you eat braised stink wraith with durian chutney?

868
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,520
- Yeah.

869
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,340
- You would eat it?

870
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,180
- If it's braised and chutneyed.

871
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,280
- But it smells so bad.

872
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,240
- Yeah, it's fine.

873
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,200
If it tastes good, would you eat it?

874
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,440
- Does it taste good?

875
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,200
- It tastes exactly like fried chicken, every bite.

876
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
Every bite is a perfect--

877
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,280
- It's probably really expensive.

878
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,720
I'd probably just eat fried chicken then.

879
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:44,740
It's probably way cheaper than fried chicken cuz fried chicken smells good - durians really expensive. Yeah durians like $50 a fucking melon

880
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,840
Well, well, you don't need your durian the durian isn't what makes it the stinky boots country

881
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:57,600
Durian go on and where would that be? What's the stinky country? Is that planet stink?

921
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:24,740
we don't get yeah I guess the way they stand the way they talk mm-hmm

922
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:29,700
what's that special he did shocked and appalled it's a good name it was a good

school leave Comedy Central on your CRT TV I stay home from school I go to watch

926
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:50,700
DVD drawer pick out secretary with imagine Maggie Gyllenhaal yeah see if I

927
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,180
was correct in remembering that there was no boobs in that movie and then get

928
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,980
really sad there's no boobs and secretary there's a little bit of boobs

929
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,900
but I was basically hoping for a whole boob buffet and because of the cover of

930
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,620
it you know because it looks like a National Lampoon movie you know but it's

931
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,580
really just she's getting kind of abused to the whole movie which I didn't realize

932
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,380
I realized as a kid, then I got older and I was like,

933
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,880
"Those are some off limits Hughies to me."

934
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,920
- Yeah. - Yeah.

935
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,420
- We're not allowed to think about these Hughies

936
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,840
that are in movies like that.

937
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,800
- True. - Movie Hughies.

938
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,260
- Movie Hughies from a sadly movie?

939
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,800
That's not a Hughie at all.

940
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,640
No. - That doesn't make sense.

941
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,840
- A sadly Hughie is no Hughie to me.

942
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,600
- Monster's Ball.

943
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,600
That movie gave me monstrous balls

944
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,640
at Halle Berry's huge Hughies,

945
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,360
but then I realized that she's wanting to kill herself

946
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:46,940
movie and she fucks the guy she fucks you geez I made me bluey she needs she says

947
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:50,700
she needs to feel good she's like I need to feel good and then they fuck and I was

948
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,460
like well she just wants to put a penis in her and let him show her his huge ease

949
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:07,280
but then she actually your family's sick so it turns out it is sad movie now it's

950
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,720
got a happy ending if you watch the 90 minutes on either side of the huge things

951
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,060
and then cut out the huge ease and put them at the end that's a happy ending

952
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:18,320
but if you watch it in what they call chronological order then it's actually

953
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:25,120
terribly sad yeah you know as a happy ending you should you would I think

954
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,960
you'd be good if you started like a movie review site called like the huge

955
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,800
e report or something yeah I think mr. skin style yeah but no more mr. skin but

956
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,280
you know you actually do review yeah you talk through the okay it is crazy that

957
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:48,280
mr. skin I mean that's that's crazy that that exists still that crazy yeah you

958
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,500
think that's crazy that's no no more crazy than pornography I guess you're

959
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:57,240
right I would say but it's also like it's also like every mr. skin thing is

960
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,980
like some arthouse movie where it's like oh yeah Marion Cotillard is like nude in

961
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,820
this movie you got to check it out at this time this time frame and it's like a

962
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:10,740
movie about like it's like a really long French movie yeah it's about her son

963
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:17,100
getting divorced at five years old and she has cancer too

964
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,720
which actually shows the tumors are in her huge ease and they're flopping all

965
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,340
over the place like a flippy flopper yeah they're looking like duck feet just

966
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,220
Flopping all over the place Maria, not a Cote de L'Arde.

967
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,540

00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,820
Yeah.

975
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,660
When I say her name, I put a spoonful of marshmallow fluff

976
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,060
in my mouth so I can get it right.

977
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,220
That's right.

978
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,860
You look like I put salt on her.

979
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,180
She'd shrivel up.

980
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,100
Snail ass French ass mother fucking bitch.

981
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,620
Plus she got them Hughies on the low-do.

982
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,620
That's why I call her MC Hugh Jeeves.

983
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,620
Whoa.

984
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,620

985
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,620
The dark night rises, you know what else rises?

986
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,620
My dark night when I see those Hugh Jeeves.

00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,620
Inception, I'd like to incept those Hugh Jeeves

990
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,620

991
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,620
with my tongue.

992
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,620
(Laughter)

993
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,620

00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,620
and I'm in there hiding.

995
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,620
And then I dock my tongue

996
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,620
like a spaceship

997
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:25,300
between her Hugies. And she's okay with it. And she loves it.

998
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:32,000

999
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,800
thing when I see Hugies." When I see two sets of Hugies that I think they're

1000
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,660
attacking each other in the movie? Wait, this is some kind of Hugie battle

1001
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,860
between the four Hugies and the two thingies and they're eating each other?

00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:16,140

1010
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:38,860
is Brad Pitt. You know the original title for Snatch was a hairy snatch.

1011
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:44,860
Hairy stinky snatch. The most disgusting studio veto.

1012
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:51,860
We can't call this hairy stinky smelly snatch.
