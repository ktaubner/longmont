1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[Dramatic music]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, we're going.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
[Laughter]

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village, end of the E-Bombs world, you three finally reached the dreaded witch Albert.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Who is actually really sexy in a total no makeup way.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh yeah.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,360
love with girls have that no makeup look yeah who told you more about the

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:48,400
mysterious me from Drew Carey show told you more about the mysterious rune on

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Patrick Yoda's mom's neck it was a Quinta rune meaning it had five entities

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
associated with it. 1. The rune itself 2. Where the rune was applied, which was Patrick's

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,100
mom 3. The effect of the rune, which is having

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,800
a power word "kill" buried within another term, in this case "sticky fingers"

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,520
4. Which was illusion magic that masked the rune 5. The outlier of the rune's characteristic,

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,120
some kind of abjuration magic that, were Albert to guess, warned someone or something that

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,480
the rune was activated. In the midst of learning this new fact, Evil

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,680
Steevel decided to make up the mud mom they'd been carting around with them so

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,040
that she has four heads made up to look like the Mount Rushmore of comedy

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,480
themselves the Marx Brothers well no they're quadro mud creating water will

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,640
be the body that houses the soul it's not that they look like the four Marx

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,880
brothers no it's that it is one it's one person who looks like who looks like

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,120
quadruple mud marks yeah looks like no it's no it looks like quadra marks

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,120
because it's mud. It's mud. It's mud, right. You have to talk into the microphone if

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,680
you're gonna talk. I'm practicing the voice so that I don't... It's Quadro Mudmarks.

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,480
Quadro Mudmarks. So that no one who is creating the show gets mad at me for

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,640
changing voices midway through. So Quadro... right. They just need to head to the

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,760
Berry Berry Academy on the southern tip of the Terrifier Continent to get there.

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,240
To basically revive Quadro Mudmarks. Quadro Mudmarks. Not revive,

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:24,800
a vibe. I feel so revived. For the very first time. As they immediately left

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,160
Albert upon leaving, you also like literally just the second you made

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,520
quadruple marks and she said she couldn't do anything for you guys just

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,160
left without saying goodbye. Oh we're supposed to say goodbye to all the NPCs?

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,080
It was very funny to me. Fuck her. Yeah she sucks. She's a witch. Wolf Hailey Robin

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,640
them I'll crash that fucking airplane that that what no keep going

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,360
wouldn't you stab Bruno friendly friend friendly friend Bob was um they came

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,240
face-to-face with a giant yeth hound after you left oh yes I remember yeah I

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:09,360
remember oh yeah I remember the hound I remember the hound it seemed hell-bent

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,280
bent on stalking them. You all nearly died, but you managed to have mud marks sort of

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,400
preserved in like a like in a kiln to absorb the fire damage. So now it is

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,080
Quadro mud marks is you know perfectly preserved until you get to Beriberi.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,400
Okay. Since then you guys have been sailing for about a day. I'm getting your

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,520
long rest. So you guys are all healed up. So heal up all your stuff. I'm gonna heal my thang up.

43
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,520
But also, you guys get to level up.

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Oh shit, I forgot. Oh my god.

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Nice surprise then.

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Well yeah, well I'm changing my voice now.

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,520
So level 5 is a big level for most of the folks here?

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Mostly for... I guess mostly for Rodogon you.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Oh really? Damn, I wish I had remembered and looked at the options.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,520
It looks to me like all I get is an extra attack.

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
That's the big one.

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Okay, but I don't have to choose anything.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,600
I get nothing.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
You should get...

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,880
Oh, I get Uncanny Dodge.

56
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Yes, you should get Uncanny Dodge.

57
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
I get Destroyed Undead.

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,960
Yeah, that is now a spell that you'll have automatically.

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
So any...

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,720
Starting at 5th level, when an Undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
threshold.

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
I will determine that threshold.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah, I'm gonna ignore this.

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,320
It'll be useful if we have Undead fights.

66
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah, I only get extra attack here.

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
That's the big one.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,920
Extra attack, now you can attack twice.

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,320
Yeah, but I don't have to pick anything. I just get that.

70
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
No, no. You just get extra attack.

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,720
Alright, nice.

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,920
That's why it's a big one for you. Any martial classes, really.

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,480
And Pat, what are you looking at? I think you also, you should be able to-

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,600
I just have, all I have is Uncanny Dodge. I don't know what else I was supposed to edit.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
Yeah, I think that's mostly what you get, which Uncanny Dodge is very good.

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,040
You want to read it?

77
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
I didn't have anything else to edit.

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
Want to read Uncanny Dodge for the class?

79
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
Uncanny Dodge, I don't, I'm not going to read it.

80
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh, I think my HP went up.

81
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:07,700
Uncanny dodge if somebody that I can see attacks me I can roll out of the way and it'll have their damage

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,480
Wow

83
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,320
so

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,160
Sounds uncanny. Yeah, you can use a health to try that out. Sorry. I'm just feeling a little punny today

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,700
He drank on a white claw and he's acting like sorry a little few sips of this white claw. Give me a little punny

86
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,700
I'm ready to have some

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,320
you to twerk like a hoe yeah so basically you can use your reaction expecting a lot

88
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,280
of hoish behavior from Cameron today so it's a bit so ho no cuz like hell no

89
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,800
you would use your reaction maybe for an opportunity attack or whatever but you

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
can use it to lessen damage towards you which is very useful for a rogue that

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,760
likes to get up so I can use uncanny dodge I could use uncanny dodge on like

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,680
like a projectile like say like it's like like a missile like something like a

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,400
missile or like a cannon nuclear bomb say there's like a giant who has like a

94
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,720
poop attack and it's like oh yeah does it does it does it does it does it does it

95
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,920
technically be a cum shot or any kind of so a giant comes over could it also

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,400
dodge a minute it's gonna hurt a normal person's sized cum shot only if it's a

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,440
squirt a squirter shot to do damage against you you can have them I could

98
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
- I could dodge a man's squirt, but not a woman's squirt.

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,320
- It has to be a squirt shot, but not a squirt spray.

100
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,160
- One more question.

101
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,340
- The way to think about can he dodge in play is like--

102
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,320
- Sorry, let me rephrase that so it makes sense.

103
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
- Sure.

104
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,400
- So I could dodge a man's squirt shot.

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,520
- Oh, your mic just cut out.

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
Stop messing with the cable.

107
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,880
- No, I'm just so glad that you guys

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,200
are taking such interest in the rules.

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,800
- Okay, so I could dodge a penile squirt shot,

110
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,080
but not a vaginal squirt shot.

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
he can roll out of the way of a of a

112
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,920
Come shot or squirt shot, but could he also could he duck under a jizz load?

113
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,840
Well ducking under I don't wait. I do

114
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,040
So if it's like a someone who has a vagina if they're on if they're on cream team

115
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,640
Yes, you you can dodge all that I can dodge the cream

116
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,600
But you said that you have to see the person right to see the target. So here's my question

117
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:16,300
So if say that he's under a giant hole member his big white car or a glory hole right or he's in a glory hole

118
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,940
yes so in a glory hall situation is the is the cock the attacker and he can dodge

119
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,260
the cumshot? Is the cock the attacker or the glory load?

120
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,980
yeah or is it the person whose cock it belongs to? You also by the way you get

121
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,500
third level spells so make sure that you're... oh oh me oh my yes and he's

122
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,100
changing the subject also guys your proficiency bonus goes up too

123
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,900
I'm sorry I'm making sure that I'm managing all that you know that should

124
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,740
happen automatically though to answer your question I mean you should look at

125
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,780
it as the attacker is the the attacker is the penis is not the attacker it's a

126
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,260
person wielding the penis so it's what about attack what if it's like a

127
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,540
controller okay depends on the contact what if okay it's a glory it's a glory

128
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,300
listen it's a glory okay listen to this scenario it's a glory hole there's a

129
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,780
hole over the cock and it's shooting a squirt jizz shot load okay any

130
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,860
combination of those words and it's shooting you can't see the attacker right

131
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,660
but say there's an ice flat to reveal the eyes if you can see the eyes of the

132
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,020
man who is who is who's come loading on to you recognizes them and it's his

133
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:24,540
brother could dodge out of that or does he have to take the brother load yeah

134
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,860
do I dodge oh my god that's so I think we're gonna switch this cable I gotta

135
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,220
pause this real quick okay so okay we're back question remains am I dodging the

136
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:42,260
jizz or the man's member all right so what about a member slap so so I guess

137
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,500
basically the question I think is the member is a part of the person right

138
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,740
it's part of the target yeah so I would say that I'm dodging the jizz but you

139
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,100
can see the person if I can see the person in a glory hole situation where

140
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,420
you can see the cock or if it's like a jizz load buckshot of sperms of pearls

141
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,060
of sperm that scatter they go through maybe a showerhead if the pearls of

142
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,300
sperm are scattering in a showerhead in a sort of buckshot scenario yeah it

143
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,460
would really be dependent on what about

144
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,220
it what about a cock load and the head

145
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,340
cock could be seen what if you're in a

146
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,180
small room and from above you're hit

147
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,960
with a chowder dump could you leave the

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,580
room so could I leave the room how did

149
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,460
your brain do that sometimes I do hot

150
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,020
dog makes relish yeah what about if

151
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,060
you're falling down from a high high

152
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,260
height and you're landing on a on a

153
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,580
a pearlescent jello dome could you roll midair to land on the hard hard ground

154
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,300
instead of a soft and wet gelatinous mount?

155
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,600
um to have the damage if the damage is not the fall damage we're talking about

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,380
what if it's cold and the jizz load is hard like lard?

157
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,240
yeah what if there's a hot squirt on my shirt?

158
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,500
how much how much damage does baseline jizz do?

159
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,700
and can you can you dodge the can you dodge

160
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
Wait, we're saying nonsense then guys.

161
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
This is a fucking useless conversation.

162
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I thought this was all a metaphor for bow and arrows.

163
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,700
Can you dodge the mustard watered pre-cum but not the cum load?

164
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Or can you do both?

165
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,700
If it's two attacks, you can only use your reaction once.

166
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
So you would have to either choose to just dodge the mustard water...

167
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,700
So if a guy was attacking my back with his todger...

168
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,700
[laughter]

169
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Right, and then he pulls out...

170
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,360
- Is this still a metaphor for you?

171
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
- And he squirts his hot

172
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,660
(laughing)

173
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,580
on the small of my back and I roll.

174
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,540
- What if I'm falling into a dump swamp and I roll?

175
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,140
- If I meet a guy and we start hitting it off

176
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,540
and we start having maybe some over the pants stuff

177
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,340
and we don't ever go under the pants,

178
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,220
do I still have a risk of getting an STD?

179
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,820
(laughing)

180
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,660
Even though we didn't do any under the pants stuff

181
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,900
or at least none of the underwear stuff?

182
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,860
think if your jeans are dry you're good okay we have two wet jeans surfaces

183
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,940
so I'm in what if I'm in a full way there could be a there could be a transfer of

184
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,460
both yeah what if I'm suction cup to the ground teacher teacher I'm in a vacuum

185
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,980
sealed floor panel yeah and all you can see and I all I have all you can see is

186
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,780
the outline of my hard penis and I'm breathing through a tube I can't see a

187
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,420
thing because I'm completely covered in a vacuum sealed way you make I got

188
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:44,260
shrunk down to the size of a beetle and thrown in a plastic bag full of spunk and

189
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:55,140
junk can I bore a hole through the bag to get away from the attack okay yeah

190
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,940
you guys are so you guys have done your long rest you guys are sailing away from

191
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,480
from Hot Bay by Island, you're going towards,

192
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,240
well actually this is where I wanted to see

193
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,180
where you guys were going towards.

194
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,640
We're doing a little bit, a wee bit of a table setting

195
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,920
really this episode, I think.

196
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,340
- Okay.

197
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,260
- So let me look at, let me open up the map.

198
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,580
- He's looking up porn.

199
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
- I'm not looking up porn.

200
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,840
- He's looking up answers to our questions from earlier.

201
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,640
- The map is here.

202
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,220
I almost Googled cleric jizz actually

203
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,060
while you guys were talking.

204
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,100
(laughing)

205
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,580
I was trying to look up Caleb's level up table.

206
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,380
So, I'm on the super rolly chair.

207
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,060
I didn't mean to drift into you like that.

208
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,340
- It's okay.

209
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,180
It's okay.

210
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,020
- It's okay.

211
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,260
(laughing)

212
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,980
- It's all okay.

213
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,460
- It's okay.

214
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,580
- It's okay.

215
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,940
- So you guys are, I'll try to turn it a little bit for--

216
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,300
- Cam, get the iPad.

217
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,540
Oh no, wait, I can tell this laptop is ancient.

218
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,940
- It's 100 years old, yeah.

219
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,380
- Dude, you're missing a key.

220
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,220
- Yeah, I am missing a key.

221
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,040
- What is that?

222
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,400
the end. The end? You've been hitting that letter too hard? Yeah, saying no Patrick.

223
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:13,060
I'm not saying that word. So you guys are about here. To give you an idea of where

224
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,340
Beriberi is, it's like, I mean, you guys would have to travel. Like a reference?

225
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,920
It's like South Africa. Yeah. Oh, cuz Peri-Peri. It's on the very bottom. It's a season they use in

226
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,780
Africa. Yeah it's on the very bottom. It's gonna require like a few weeks of travel

227
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,600
to get to Beriberi so that you can revive Mud Marks. That's worth it.

228
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,680
Two weeks of travel, how much is that in game time? Yeah two weeks honestly is

229
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,800
probably what it is. Two weeks of travel in game time? Yeah. Is that like two episodes?

230
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,940
Two weeks. In real life time how long is that? We don't know yet.

231
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,320
We don't know. It's two weeks. It could be two weeks. Two full weeks of recording. Yeah

232
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,860
It could be less than that. It would just depend on how much is going on and how

233
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,380
you guys want to do this. Yeah. And we spend the entire episode discerning what a

234
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,340
cum shot does to a person. I do have a few more questions about cum shots. But we'll get to

235
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,900
them off mic so that we have more time to go to Barry-Barry. So you can start to go south

236
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,340
and hit a couple of the, there's a few towns along the way that you can hit for

237
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,400
restocking and resupplying. You can also go inland and dock in south

238
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,320
Israel and then travel through the dirtlands if you'd like to as well.

239
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,200
That might get you there in a shorter amount of time just because of where the

240
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,600
ports are, but you'll also have to travel over land which has its own risks as

241
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:42,760
opposed to going overseas. So it really depends on where you guys want to go.

242
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:49,680
okay so I feel like we should just I think we just go for it go for I'm

243
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,200
willing to travel any length to make quadra mud marks 5 - yeah and like our

244
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,680
entire the entire thing here is we're trying to do watch our mud marks 5 5 5

245
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,480
we're trying to do we're trying you meant like 5 like Quinto mud marks no but we

246
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,120
may then we might see I mean that's something we're really where the journey

247
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,840
Zachary Quinto and put it on top. Holy fucking shit. We will see where the journey takes us.

248
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,680
Okay, so I guess the entire point of whatever we're doing is just trying to avoid Sullivan.

249
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,040
So I don't really care as long as we just are I mean as long as we're having fun. Yeah, let's just go and

250
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,560
Let's make this mud marks just as as vibed as we possibly can. How about that? Okay, cool

251
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,600
So you guys want to go by if you go by land?

252
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,440
It'll possibly take shorter

253
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,680
You could get kind of sidewinded in the dirtlands if you go by sea I can you can pretty much guarantee two weeks no matter

254
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,940
What roll tables I have cuz I mean less I kind of want to I like sailing cuz it's a pirate. Yeah

255
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,760
Yeah, yeah

256
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,400
For the seven seas more or how many sit however many seas that we have this world

257
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,280
Seven seas and I want to just get it over with what I don't like is when I look at that map and I look

258
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,460
A right near berry berry that I see a dragon under the water. Oh, that's just I mean, it's just sort of like flavor

259
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,480
Is that flavor or is that a secret dragon because if that's a secret dragon I'm gonna tell you this much

260
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
But I want to go right there

261
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,280
Around that thing. Okay. Yeah, I mean there there are

262
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,880
Beasts, you know, okay, so we'll drive but they're not necessarily right there. Yeah, not necessarily

263
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,240
We'll see. Okay, we're gonna go by see but we're gonna steer around any beasts

264
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,840
Any random encounters what is go around

265
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
- Okay. - Let's avoid that.

266
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,880
And then as far as the route you guys wanna take,

267
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,160
just for my own-- - Swang and bang.

268
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,440
- So I don't know.

269
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,760
- Doors open. - That makes complete sense.

270
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,600
- Nice and slow. - Left to right.

271
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,480
- With the doors open.

272
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
- On the sides of the ship. - Swang and bang.

273
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,040
- Okay, so the ship doesn't, so they--

274
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,920
- Swangity swang and biggity bang.

275
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,400
- Do you want the doors open on the ship?

276
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
- Doors are open. - Yeah.

277
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,080
(laughing)

278
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,800
- And we're gonna drink-- - Gangplank is down.

279
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
- We're gonna bring that thing low to the sea.

280
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,080
- We're ghost riding the ship.

281
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,000
We're in the water swimming next to it.

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,040
holding on to the plank with our feet like walking on the water like right

283
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,800
ghost riding the ship but not riding the ghost ship that's true I don't like that

284
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,280
no okay so we're swinging and banging that's basically good but do you want to

285
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,640
so you want to go along the coastline yeah long because we don't want people to

286
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,640
see me god damn it okay cool all right that's just good for me to know we can

287
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,240
Can we play some lab music too?

288
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Yeah.

289
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Some really lab...

290
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Can we play a song that goes like...

291
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Is there any kind of dirty south...

292
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Medieval...

293
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Yeah, like seafaring music?

294
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Yeah, like seafaring lute music?

295
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Yeah.

296
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,040
Two, four, bardzia?

297
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
I don't know.

298
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
I'm trying to think of what...

299
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
"Sailing to South" by ESG.

300
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
"Sailing to South."

301
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Yes.

302
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Yeah.

303
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
I've been listening to "Sailing to South."

304
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
He really knows lute music.

305
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Put that into the episode, Julio.

306
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I mean, it's not a lute music.

307
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,040
It's not a lute music, but it is sailing.

308
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Sailing the south.

309
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Because we're heading down to that dirty south.

310
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Burry, burry.

311
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Alright, cool. So you guys are sailing south now.

312
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
You give this information to...

313
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Remember that song, that Aaliyah song?

314
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Dirty south.

315
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,040
[Humming]

316
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
We already have a song.

317
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Alright, you know what?

318
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I thought that was a good song.

319
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I actually had a great idea. What about Funky Town?

320
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,040
That's better. That's way better.

321
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Yeah.

322
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Okay, so you guys are listening to Funky Town.

323
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Change the song, Julio.

324
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Julio, change the song to Funky Town.

325
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,040
And you, um, so you told this to your, uh, Boatswain.

326
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Oh, not your Boatswain. Your, um, quartermaster.

327
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Let me see if I'm getting this right. God, it's been a minute since I've...

328
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
You guys have been docked for a while.

329
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:55,180
Yeah, your quartermaster Wayne, the half-orc, he begins to navigate south to make your way

330
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
to Beriberi.

331
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,940
So, a couple other bits of information you should know.

332
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,740
You have roughly two weeks of rations remaining.

333
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,180
Wait, I thought we restocked.

334
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
You did.

335
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,300
You had like, I think like one week or a few days if I last checked.

336
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,640
Well, are we, where are we right now?

337
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,780
Right now you're about two weeks out.

338
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
So you're good.

339
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,780
We're already on we've already left. Yeah, you guys left. Yeah, you guys left doesn't avoid the F

340
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,660
When you guys do we did get ref you did get really up to we are we doing we could have gotten more

341
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,260
But you guys were you always a lot of motto you always double everything you need. This is true

342
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,060
There's a scouts motto you have about five battles worth of cannonball and gunpowder. Oh

343
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:41,540
You know my god, I'm blowing that immediately you also have two weeks of miscellaneous ship repair supplies

344
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,720
That's useful for any sort of things that happen on along the way when there's an idea for the lore

345
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,900
Like a wado character like Star Wars episode

346
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:59,700
That is what water sounds like

347
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,060
Take it up with George

348
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,100
Like a Star Wars episode 1 podracer. It's like you go to wados junk shop

349
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,240
You go to the we have a junk shop where you can buy parts for the ship. I like the idea

350
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,960
Well, I mean I like the idea of there being a long

351
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,800
We can put like a big like a longer towel on the back of the ship so we can make it fly

352
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,220
Well, there could be on some of the towns that you dock there will be like like, you know

353
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,460
Ship like, you know, has that always been a thing there?

354
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,940
They wouldn't they wouldn't necessarily be like wado, but now they can't be you doing backseat dungeon mastering

355
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,860
Yeah, I mean we're just chatting about lore and I think that's a good idea

356
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,800
That we can buy upgrades for the ship you just want a waddle that you get to talk to that's so fucking obvious

357
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I just want I think

358
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,340
I want to actually just had an idea for for lore. I think it would be cool if my character had bling-bling

359
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:02,880
See what you're not saying anything like that, but it's more mad at it. No. It's lore my guy would let's a good idea

360
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,240
Yeah, you'd like bling one. Maybe Caleb's character is bling bling - yeah. Oh, no, I don't like that flashy crap. Okay. All right

361
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,080
I'll get double bling bling. I'll have a little thing. I ever I blink blink

362
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,180
We're gonna give to the whole thing. I'll get triple bling bling on my character, maybe yeah

363
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,520
No, that might be a lower thing that could help flush out the world if I had flashy flashy bling bling

364
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,300
I'll put it down. I when I walk it clanks and it looks fresh. It looks fresh - yeah

365
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,240
And then when we go to the upgrade shop, we can buy spinners for the boat. I'm with that. Okay

366
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,240
with that. So you guys can make your ship look fly. And so be free. We can custom that. And

367
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:45,640
yeah, so as you guys travel down south, one of the things you see while you're traveling

368
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:52,640
down is a large ship, similar to your own in size, that has the flag of the Brave Lions

369
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:00,800
on it. So as you guys approach, because you guys have been a little bit out of the coast

370
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,680
you start to get closer to the coast and you can see some of the structures along the coast

371
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:12,800
of the actual Trebuchet village continent, Terrafire Kingdom continent I should say.

372
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,120
And you start to see more of the Brave Lion Galleons.

373
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,560
This is a noticeable growth over the last six months, you know, they were not a nation before

374
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,800
this.

375
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:31,680
I will also say that like, you have some opportunities throughout this to be proper pirates.

376
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,040
If you guys want to go after these ships, you can.

377
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,440
You just have to let me know whether you want to do it during the day, during the night,

378
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
if you want to tail a ship.

379
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,600
So I just wanted to let you know that that is an option.

380
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,880
Obviously it raises your risk of angering the Brave Lions Nation.

381
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
How are we passing them?

382
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
It is real.

383
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
What?

384
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
How are we passing them?

385
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,720
You're not like passing them right now where it's like you're right next to them

386
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,840
I'm letting you know just that like that is a like you're pirates

387
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,500
Yeah, you're close enough to the shoreline that there are ships. I said we were like passing them were currently well

388
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:09,100
You're I guess I meant like you're starting to see there in our vicinity in your vicinity like so we're going towards them

389
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,680
You can if you want to right now. They're the most of them are so because their nation is north

390
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,600
Typically they will peel out and then head south but

391
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,840
towards the the archipelago of

392
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,040
Virtue good and so after we I guess my question is are we in a position?

393
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,760
Right now where we could play chicken with their boat

394
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,800
You could you guys want to do that you could do that play chicken with your butt if you keep doing this

395
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,920
I was suggesting is a part of the part of the virtue of doing pirating would be

396
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,920
or virtue. The value of doing pirating would be to get additional supplies so you could

397
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,520
travel for longer and follow under potential treasure and things like that.

398
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,600
We have to fall under pirating. Playing chicken with another boat.

399
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,000
Not necessarily, no. Alright, then never mind.

400
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,880
We just can't play chicken, it's just kind of like a...

401
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,200
You can play chicken with... Patrick should have a sidecar boat.

402
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,760
I agree. A little boat.

403
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,960
You can be in one of the rowboats, yeah. You can be in the dinghy and you can do whatever

404
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,720
you want with the dinghy while we sail the big ship.

405
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,520
Well not the big ship, the other ship.

406
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
You get the boring ship.

407
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,840
You can have the little ship, or the other ship that's just for you.

408
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,160
With flames painted on the side?

409
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,880
You can paint whatever you want on it, you can make it fly.

410
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,440
I have it roped up like Kip in Napoleon Dynamite.

411
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,440
You can, yeah, whatever the hell.

412
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,920
We have a big rope with the anchor is in the dinghy and it's making it like capsize a little bit.

413
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,080
Yeah, yeah, no that's all you.

414
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
This is exactly what I wanted.

415
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,600
Yeah, go ahead, knock yourself out.

416
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,160
And your ship.

417
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,880
And we have, we put a, we put a, a, a, a, a Maggie Simpson steering wheel.

418
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:04,240
Meanwhile the ship that you're riding has like a port, has a portrait of you on the front of it,

419
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,400
but like you're just like you want to be in the thingy so you can do your own thing

420
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,120
don't remind me of that

421
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,400
there's actually a

422
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,900
portraits actually in the dinghy

423
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,860
i just realized i think we put it in there just for you

424
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,960
what if what if the dinghy is in the front so they think that i'm

425
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,480
i think that i'm steering it

426
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,040
but the boat keeps

427
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,720
tapping the back of it. you can definitely do that

428
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,200
it's insane

429
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,640
but yeah of course you can do that

430
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Okay, roll our first random encounter. We're passing time.

431
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

432
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,140
Um, well, I don't have to roll for this one, actually, but um...

433
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,640
-This doesn't sound very random. -Yeah, that is, um, not...

434
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
-Sounds as if it's a bit unfair. -Sounds a bit unbalanced.

435
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,140
-I mean, it's just like something... -Better be good.

436
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,140
-It's just stuff that's happening. -It's better be the best thing you ever fucking...

437
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,140
It's not a random encounter as much as it's more stuff that's happening.

438
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,640
-Okay, then make it happen. -Okay.

439
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,640
So, um, Scurvyneck, who is your, uh, who is your boatswain,

440
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
He comes up to you and shows you-

441
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Who Wayne was.

442
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
No, Wayne's your quartermaster.

443
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Oh, okay.

444
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Yeah, yeah. I mean, your cook is Aeoli.

445
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Okay. I know that.

446
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,640
So, he comes up to you and says,

447
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,640
"Oh, boy! Lads! Captains! I've got something that I want to show you guys!"

448
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
"Where the fuck are you from?"

449
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
"I'm from... DAAAAAAAAMN!"

450
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
"Penifile Island."

451
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,640
"Penifile Island!"

452
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
"Damn, good guess."

453
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,340
Wow. This is the accent of people who are pedophiles. Okay, all right. Pedophilians.

454
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Pedophilians.

455
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
[Laughter]

456
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
So he's part reptile?

457
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
He's a goblin.

458
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,140
But he says, "I found a kit on board."

459
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
And he pulls up a...

460
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Oh, jeez, this pedophilian found a kit on board.

461
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,140
[Laughter]

462
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,140
He shows a cat that he found.

463
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,140
And uh, he said, "I just wanted to know if it was alright, I could keep it if you wanted to."

464
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,140
"No, you give that to me."

465
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,140
"Oh, alright. Yes, Captain."

466
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,140
And uh, yeah, he sort of forlornly, "No, I'd start, no, I'd put my hand in front."

467
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,140
"Actually, you'll give that to me."

468
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
"I am."

469
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
"I'm drooling and I'm baring my teeth."

470
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
"You'll give it back to me now."

471
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
"You're licking my lips."

472
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,140
"Nah, you're gonna hand that over to me. Actually, give it to Aeoli."

473
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,140
"Don't give it, no."

474
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,020
is and that over a little bit you know we can you guys see this cat is tearing us

475
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,380
apart and i grab it my

476
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,260
fully it up

477
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,820
it

478
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,380
he's

479
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,780
wing it overboard

480
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,060
as it lands in the dinghy maybe

481
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,020
yeah i think that i wrote a make it a little more in a uh... you're all

482
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,940
that's what it's check

483
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,620
okay

484
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,780
i wanted to happen by accident though i'm not trying to have it there but i want

485
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,380
there to be a chance that it lands in the dinghy

486
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,580
Roll a luck check? What do you want me to do here?

487
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,880
You're the DM, you figure it out.

488
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,280
Yeah, roll a luck check.

489
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,780
Okay.

490
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,880
I rolled an 18.

491
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
That's pretty good luck.

492
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,180
That's damn good luck.

493
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,480
That might be enough.

494
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,380
You hear "WOW!" as the cat flies.

495
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,980
Just in case it's a genie in disguise or something.

496
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,380
That's "I'm just covering all our bases."

497
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,480
Over the boat, it lands in the dinghy.

498
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,080
It's a genie in the cat's body.

499
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
A dinghy that's on the front of the boat, right?

500
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,380
Yeah.

501
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,780
So there's a dinghy that's in front of the boat.

502
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,180
You hear a thud as it lands.

503
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,980
I guess I have to roll for damage for the cat.

504
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,640
um...

505
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,900
just dies

506
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,540
from a new is better for the god damn

507
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,100
cooking pot

508
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,260
ocean

509
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,640
is fine

510
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,500
takes a few points of damage here

511
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,300
uh... misa

512
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,460
who's gonna name it

513
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,940
to name its quinn squalor ms

514
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,180
squalor ms

515
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,180
squidlums?

516
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
what the fuck is that?

517
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
you said like 5 different names

518
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
alright you know what?

519
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
cause you seem so attached to the cat

520
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,180
my vote is he can keep it

521
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
i don't give a fuck

522
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,180
no

523
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,180
if you can find it

524
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
if you can find the cat he can keep it

525
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
ok so that is 2 against 1

526
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
if you can get to it before me

527
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
if you wanna race him to the cat

528
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,180
sure

529
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,680
I'll roll, let's see.

530
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,560
That's a 17 and let me look at what my athletics is.

531
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,160
I mean I can tell you now you probably beat him.

532
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:27,040
Um, 17 plus 2, that's 19.

533
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Okay.

534
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,120
Um, you guys tie.

535
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,600
We tie.

536
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,080
And uh, you guys both reach the cat as it's sort of like licking and nursing one of its

537
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
wounds.

538
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
You're both on the thingy.

539
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Well, Captain Old Spade, it's your cat now, I guess.

540
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
I guess I'll throw it back onto the ship.

541
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Okay, yeah.

542
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Just a "meow!"

543
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
I guess I'll roll for damage again.

544
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
This cat is...

545
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Unless one of them tries to catch it, I guess you guys don't like it.

546
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
I will try to catch it.

547
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Okay, roll athletics.

548
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Alright, that cat took damage.

549
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Yeah, you try to grab it and you kind of almost...

550
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
You almost stuff it.

551
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
I try to grab it with my skin card.

552
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Slam it down.

553
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
You almost stuff it.

554
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
grab it with my sword.

555
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
Okay.

556
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,080
Yeah, so you guys have this cat now.

557
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,080
It sounds like you're just going to toss it around and I can rid of it.

558
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Now...

559
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
I will name you Squidlumps.

560
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,080
I'm going to name it after my grandfather.

561
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
Hitler.

562
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Hitler Yodar.

563
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
All right.

564
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
I like that name more.

565
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Now it's time...

566
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
No, it's Hidlar.

567
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Sorry.

568
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
I had something in my throat for a random encounter.

569
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Hidlar.

570
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Sorry, I had something in my throat.

571
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
For a random encounter.

572
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,080
He was very old.

573
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Older than my uncle.

574
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,080
I would think your grandfather would be older than your uncle.

575
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
They could be the same age.

576
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,080
In these times, incest is rampant.

577
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Okay.

578
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Alright. Okay.

579
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Trust me.

580
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
I guess, I suppose you're correct.

581
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:12,700
was my sister. Okay. Okay, so as your ship is sailing along the sides, you reach a

582
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:19,120
massive whirlpool. It seems kind of almost, it's incredibly powerful.

583
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,240
It's pulling in all kinds of debris and detritus that's surrounding it.

584
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,960
Who's detritus? Oh man, it's pulling in. Listen, take all the debris you want, but

585
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,160
Can we at least keep the detritus in motion?

586
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Alright, I'm an asshole.

587
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Ah, fucking come on!

588
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
You're wasting the detritus!

589
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Crew, batten down the detritus!

590
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Oh no, it's gonna suck all the detritus off the ship!

591
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,160
You see all the trash cans?

592
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:59,160
But take this opportunity, dump the debris!

593
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Get rid of it!

594
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
No, we need that detritus for food!

595
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Uh, and yeah, you see, uh, Wayne, uh, he kinda comes up to you guys, he says...

596
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Captains, if we... there's a... we have a whirlpool incoming, I'm apologizing we didn't get to quite catch it in time.

597
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:26,160
We have a few options here, we can either try to roll right through it, try to increase the power of the ship, get the sails adjusted, and try to power through.

598
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,800
Might be too strong for that, so we could also go around.

599
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,520
It seems like we just go around.

600
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,800
The risk of going around...

601
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
What if there's treasure in the whirlpool?

602
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,160
The risk of going around would be that if we don't execute it perfectly, we could capsize.

603
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,180
So...

604
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,080
So we have to go through...

605
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,600
So are you saying it's safer to go directly through the middle of the whirlpool?

606
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,480
Not necessarily.

607
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,000
So which one's safer?

608
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,960
They're both equal.

609
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,460
The point is...

610
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,680
Oh, they're completely equal.

611
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,680
You could roll a d20 and try to figure out,

612
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
to assess the situation.

613
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Okay, I'm gonna do that.

614
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Yeah, is there anything you want to investigate?

615
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I'm gonna investigate which is better to do.

616
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
I mean...

617
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
And I would like to investigate...

618
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
I'll investigate the strength of the whirlpool.

619
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Is that enough? Is that in-universe enough?

620
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
I would like to investigate whether or not we have...

621
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
I didn't really set this up that well.

622
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,680
I rolled an 18 minus 1, that's 17.

623
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Okay.

624
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,680
You're doing an investigation.

625
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,680
So, I mean, an investigation takes like a minute.

626
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,680
So you're approaching pretty quickly, so I would only allow really one investigation in that case.

627
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Can I see if we have a giant cork on the...

628
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
I can tell you you don't.

629
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
That would be detritus, and that is already true.

630
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
I'm going to try to just go right in the middle of this damn thing.

631
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
I'm also going to investigate.

632
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Well, he said he only allows one.

633
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Okay, well...

634
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
I didn't even roll mine, I was just fucking...

635
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Then I am going to...

636
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
I was fucking around.

637
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Fuck.

638
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
I feel like it would be crazy to try and go straight through.

639
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Let's do it, that's cool.

640
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm gonna roll survival to see well part of the way that you would go straight through and with this 17

641
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,760
You would know to some extent is you roll survival

642
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,980
You would sort of ride it and sort of use the momentum to sail out of it

643
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,760
If you go straight around there's a chance that you don't have enough give is there some kind of giant octopus?

644
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,240
That's gonna come out of the middle. I have no idea so then why don't I?

645
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,280
Well, let's just go right it sounds go into it

646
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
We're just going around that's already going around

647
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,680
You're going around I have directly trying to ride the momentum. I have really high momentum, right?

648
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,440
I really have you do that, and I've never rolled survival

649
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:35,880
So is there any if survival is that like rolling and being like our chances of survival or that's like when you find food in?

650
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,840
The wild yeah, yeah, it's like actions like that so you could do that you can for survival check

651
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,600
It would be I want to check the detritus to see if we can reinforce the whole

652
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,880
You could figure out what the chances of you surviving

653
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,160
Yeah, I thought it was like a Star Trek thing where like they had the computer

654
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,800
But I guess that only would work in gun city and not trebuchet village no and even then you know you need to have like a

655
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,120
computer

656
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,480
Well that means you could do that. We're going let's let's let's let's ride the

657
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,140
Momentum whoa and go around through it okay, but so she a belt so if you do this

658
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,300
The ship belts are gone. Oh fuck they were complete detritus

659
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,640
Dude, this is a number of checks you'd have to do

660
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:26,260
So one you're gonna have to do a charisma check one of you will do a charisma check

661
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:33,800
- do you have the highest charisma? Yes the highest everything I have high persuasion I could pursue roll he rolled everything

662
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,100
To get the crew aligned into performing the correct actions to all right in the right place

663
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,080
Yeah, but you definitely patched it roll all of this stuff. I feel like okay

664
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,680
All right, you pieces of shit

665
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,400
Get on the ship

666
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,320
We're all on the ship and do your job

667
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,920
You piece of shit. All right roll persuasion

668
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,480
Going with the

669
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,040
Coming with the tough love method. I guess I got a 29 for persuasion. See I told you dude

670
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,240
What is your push? My persuasion is plus 11

671
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,000
Fuck up your character

672
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,160
Yeah, I mean they they

673
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,800
Understood instantly what you were saying made complete sense. They all

674
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,200
Each of everyone goes to their stations to make sure the right to ship correctly to ride that

675
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,200
To ride that whirlpool

676
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,680
In the proper way. I mean, there's no really issue there. We're going in it like Bob Burnquist

677
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,320
Yeah, they know exactly what that means one of the greatest explorers of Trebuchet village history

678
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,360
Yeah, Bob Burnquist Bob Burnquist now. I'll make a note of that

679
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,640
and then

680
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
I'm gonna need also

681
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,040
At least a couple of you I guess all three of you really should roll

682
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,540
What should it be I guess really just strength checks - cuz you're all gonna. That's my worst

683
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,900
You're all gonna be tugging on rope. What's your strength? I mean, it's a part of oh, we're all we're all rolling

684
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,620
Yeah, okay. The crew is gonna be doing it as well. Like you're not gonna be strength is

685
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,380
11 I rolled a -

686
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,500
Okay

687
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,220
I got a 7. I don't want to I think we're gonna die

688
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,060
Can I have a 20? Yeah, I'll give you a 20. Oh, I got a 1 a

689
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,820
and that we are one natural one two and a five seven a seven or seven and you come

690
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,500
on

691
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,580
so that i'm not only of us we got a ten

692
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,620
come on come on so you guys i mean

693
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,020
scott's in

694
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,720
you perfectly like comic

695
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,580
your crew was there they showed up

696
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,980
the need everything ready to have a right

697
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,700
we came for you guys to sort of hop on and grab the

698
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,180
the sales grab the rope and why we do it any action only a andy's the cruise

699
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:04,180
was

700
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,980
situation of you guys just have not done this in a while I guess.

701
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,980
So it's kind of completely atrophied all the...

702
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Yeah, from Hoppe Island.

703
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,480
And so the ship is wobbling, like pretty heavily.

704
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,980
And it starts to, as you're trying to ride the momentum of it,

705
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,780
it's now just riding the momentum down, down, down, down, down,

706
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,980
towards the whirlpool.

707
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,400
uh... as your shinning is starting to you

708
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,380
uh... ship is starting to

709
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,880
most peculiarly it seemed to be

710
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,100
you know it is starting to disassemble

711
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,420
uh... is really anything

712
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,220
uh... it

713
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,340
all of my greatest and and try to plug everything

714
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,620
with tritus

715
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,380
okay

716
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,220
uh... that which is a little bit

717
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,980
we're dead

718
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,000
who are we all going to live a lot of those are over

719
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,360
we lost

720
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,680
we're going to be the world's popular around we're gonna go to our ship we

721
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,200
didn't even get to be a little longer quadra mud marks but mud marks is gonna

722
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,040
hit the pocket while all turn into a pocket of dirt that's it i'm my resolve

723
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,760
and i think that you're having a bad attitude so you have you know i heard

724
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
your or

725
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,200
they can create a wave to maybe help you get out of this

726
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,680
i'll get a little way is as well as i can i roll a religion and so as this is

727
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:52,680
is

728
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:59,680
or

729
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,200
no prayers good

730
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,760
uh... so i'm going to create my i think i'm gonna die so i guess blindness

731
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,240
deftness on myself

732
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,440
and make it less scary

733
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,320
you can still use or feeling if there's a going around in circles i'd find a

734
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
I don't know, I'm scared here.

735
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,320
You really only have one kind of element here that's helping.

736
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,320
So, I'm trying to think of how to roll for this.

737
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Wait, I guess, okay, I'll create water.

738
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
You can only really create like...

739
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
30 feet.

740
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
You can create water.

741
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,320
30 square feet of water I could fill up the...

742
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
Oh wait, create water under the boat?

743
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
I was just thinking you could do that.

744
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Or you could also destroy the water that's in the boat if we're starting to take on water too.

745
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Yeah, and right now I'm going to create a wave behind us that pushes us up.

746
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
That's already, that's what I already did.

747
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
What you can do is you can create...

748
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
You can't let him create a wave, that's my special ability.

749
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
You can't create a wave.

750
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
You can't take my only cool ability.

751
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
I've been doing that for way more episodes than you.

752
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
I have a wave, you can create water, you can't create waves.

753
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
He said that it's in a wave.

754
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
No, I did not say that.

755
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
I create a wave.

756
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Episodes ago he said that when I create water, that shit can be in a wave.

757
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
No, that was my wave ability.

758
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
You might be right.

759
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
When we made the ship go up and crash down on the other ship, that was all me.

760
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,640
That was not you so we have to it's really like you can create like water within range in an open container, okay?

761
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,520
I would like to use motivational speech on my crew. Is that a spell you have yeah, don't motivational speech

762
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,200
I'm gonna cast it right now

763
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,040
Yeah, motivational speech man. I gotta start here ye here ye you

764
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,480
boys and girls and when

765
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,920
women and children of all colors and races

766
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,560
Who live on this boat?

767
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:54,880
Even though we may all be different colors and races and genders, we can come together to survive this very whirlpool full of detritus.

768
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:09,880
So please, grab your neighbor, and grab your friend, and control the aspect of the ship that you have been assigned, and do it to your greatest ability. So help you God.

769
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Wow.

770
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,720
Wow you do have motivational speech.

771
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,280
And I'm going to roll persuasion and say, "And listen to everything he just said!"

772
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,860
I mean they're just going to get five temporary hit points and have advantage on wisdom saving

773
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,860
throws.

774
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:30,160
I really just picked it based on the name.

775
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:37,440
So I say all that and then they just keep firing at me.

776
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,520
If I rolled persuasion after that I would have got a 16.

777
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,500
So let's do the wave thing.

778
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,840
So for that I think really what that should be is...

779
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Uh oh.

780
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Why do we ever add sound effects?

781
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,840
We got Michael Winslow over here.

782
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
I think, I think, I think athletics.

783
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,840
You should be a drum machine.

784
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Probably athletics.

785
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,480
You should be an instrument.

786
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,840
It's like a magical ability so can I do like a...

787
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
I do a spell attack.

788
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Charisma?

789
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Ummm.

790
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
Or is my spell wisdom?

791
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,120
Cause the way I'm looking at it is you.

792
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,560
I think a wisdom check is fair.

793
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,520
Ok then I'll just do athletics instead.

794
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
I think either of those.

795
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
I'm looking at the numbers.

796
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Yeah I know.

797
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,660
I think either athletics or wisdom is fair because it's you being able to write yourself

798
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,720
on the ship, make the right move, and judge, and write judgment here.

799
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,720
I'm gonna do athletics.

800
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Let's say athletics though.

801
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,960
Ok let's see what's up.

802
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,200
uh...

803
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,260
that's a ten

804
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,360
total

805
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,280
this year and i guess the other ship is able to serve like push a little bit out

806
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,720
of the world pool

807
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,880
uh... but

808
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,120
not quite enough to really get it out of the world

809
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,080
i'm gonna try and lift the boat up

810
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,480
so it's world since morals and squirrels on the train with the boat up by guys

811
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,780
were dying right now i mean i am nobody i don't really know what it was me

812
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,500

813
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,900
the moment with us

814
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,740
patrick look at my eyes

815
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,780
we're looking at look at my eyes

816
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,300
right now we're drowning out i got a twenty-year-old really my i think we're

817
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,160
dying

818
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,040

821
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:32,320
different casting it right now just because you're pissing me off

822
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,200
Stop just so solemnly rolling all your dice.

823
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,920
We're dead.

824
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,920
You all take 36 damage.

825
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,640
Oh my god.

826
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,080
What are you talking about? I got 7 HP.

827
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,800
I threw the-

828
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,720
No, you're all full. You have full HP.

829
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,440
Yeah, threw the boat.

830
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,240
And now I have 7 HP.

831
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,360
I have 3 now.

832
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,120
I have no health. I'm dead.

833
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,760
Are you?

834
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,440
Yeah, I have 33 hit points.

835
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:50,840
Yeah.

836
00:44:50,840 --> 00:45:00,040
So you're dead. You're knocked out as your ship crumbles and sinks into the squirrel pool.

837
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,080
Oh my god.

838
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,000
We lost our ship.

839
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm

840
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm sucked to the bottom of this whirlpool. I'm completely dead.

841
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I will never let him complete.

842
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We can't recover my body. We can't recover my body.

843
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But in my last... I rolled a 23 performance.

844
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So in my last breath, I threw Quadro Mudmarks up to you guys.

845
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I died.

846
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
We're also in the water.

847
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah, Quadro Mudmarks...

848
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm completely dead.

849
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Don't worry.

850
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm completely dead.

851
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So maybe what happens here is we all die,

852
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,840
die and quadro mud marks watches up on the beach and three new guys are

853
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,000
discovering him and it's a completely new story.

854
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,600
That's what I was trying to think of. I was trying to think of maybe you two continue on and then I'm

855
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,600
quadro mud marks when you get her like alive.

856
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,000
Well hey guys we're not dead yet okay let's not get ahead of ourselves.

857
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm dead, you're not dead yet.

858
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You're knocked out.

859
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Not dead yet.

860
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We have a completely new campaign where it's three completely different characters and they see quadro.

861
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
we have to do it

862
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,640
we have to buy we have to buy

863
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,400
hasn't happened quite yet

864
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,320
ok we're getting close to a world where the entire campaign was we found out

865
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,320
that Sullivan was on one side of the earth tried to go the other way

866
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
instantly

867
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,640
One place we took 12 episodes

868
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:53,920
All right, but we don't know yet. Yeah, let's could go it could go anyway. Oh my god. You've been in bad situations

869
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,760
We may be down

870
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,760
Here I'm not out. I'm careful. We're not out. We may be down folks, but guys we're not out

871
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,160
You're deaf and blind right now.

872
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
Most of your crew is dead.

873
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
That is for sure.

874
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Who's alive?

875
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Squidlam?

876
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,660
What?

877
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,660
Who's dead? Name every single one.

878
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,660
Every single one?

879
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,660
Name who's alive.

880
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,660
Sorry, I'm just not that quick.

881
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,660
Wayne's alive.

882
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,660
Wayne's where?

883
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,660
Aeoli is alive.

884
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,660
The boatswain is alive.

885
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,660
No, just all the names.

886
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,660
He does not have that much HP.

887
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,380
with them alive

888
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,660
nine lives pay

889
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,720
yeah i'm less

890
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,620
you catch a flash of the cat

891
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,220
turn into a genius snake man

892
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,420
and then i do it

893
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,220
breath but he knew it

894
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,260
i knew he was something in disguise and i i didn't do it

895
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,780
you would not you would not make an event of us finding a cat and i wasn't

896
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,980
simply in this case i didn't hear you know you know you know i just knew he

897
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,620
was something in disguise. Why didn't you show us the twist then, you asshole? That's it,

898
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:07,460
to prove I'm right, to prove how smart I am. Yeah, to prove how smart Cam is. To cats, most

899
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,460
of what I do. It was a snake man, that's exactly what I said. It should have been something

900
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,780
different, it should have been a clay man. It should have been a genie, you should have

901
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,140
at least made it a genie. If it wasn't gonna matter, it's just a genie. Genies have snake

902
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:24,140
bodies. It was gonna matter. That's true. Who it was, but now he's dead. He died, okay.

903
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:30,140
And uh yeah you guys wake up, well you two wake up.

904
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,140
You don't wake up.

905
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,140
Lost at sea!

906
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,140
Not quite.

907
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:41,300
In a deep dark cave.

908
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,300
Cop out.

909
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,500
We're going to have to do that saving throw for you because you might be dead.

910
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,460
I had this plan from the start but I was not sure if what you-

911
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,140
Just killed a giant rope sorry.

912
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:01,140
you

913
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,740
I don't want to be in here anymore.

914
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,300
Pat, we're going to have to do some death saving throws for you right now to see if your character

915
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,300
makes it through this or not.

916
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,180
I got a 16.

917
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,180
That's one success.

918
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,740
You're going to have to roll all of them.

919
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,980
Oh my god.

920
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,060
This is, make it really dramatic Pat.

921
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,420
Because this is life or death right here.

922
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,420
Roll for real.

923
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,420
I got a 1.

924
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,420
That's a 2.

925
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,420
That is.

926
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,860
Wait, a 1 is an auto death you said last time.

927
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,860
Yes I did.

928
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,860
Your character's dead.

929
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,860
No!

930
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,120
(laughing)

931
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,080
- He got a one, man.

932
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,620
- Patrick Yodar is dead.

933
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,700
- He drowned.

934
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,540
(laughing)

935
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,340
- I can make a new character now.

936
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,300
I don't have to do this, I can make a new voice.

937
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,020
- We sailed our ship directly into a whirlpool

938
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,620
and drowned our friend.

939
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,700
(laughing)

940
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,420
Me and Caleb made the decision,

941
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,000
Patrick was the one who drowned.

942
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,100
- Wow, I did not expect this decision.

943
00:49:59,100 --> 00:49:59,940
- Oh my god.

944
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:06,940
and

945
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,620
you'll know he's dead in a second. Oh no.

946
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:17,620
So I wash up to shore. Oh my god, you're dead. I wash up to shore and there is no bottom half of me.

947
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,380
Oh my god. But I'm still alive. So where you are, you're not sure where you are.

948
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,780
There's no bottom half of me and I'm still alive and I look at both of them and I say

949
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,980
"meh"

950
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,660
"this is crap"

951
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,100
and then you die and then i thought all my god i'm weeping

952
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,020
i'm solving

953
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,540
so

954
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,580
it's a dark

955
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,980
uh...

956
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,220
over a word a cave okay so i'm part of the still act might

957
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,260
you here uh... some tinkering in

958
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,100
tampering and use you to sort of slowly kind of game

959
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,340
consciousness

960
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:59,700
the layout is you three are all laid on the ground right now quadro mud marks is

961
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,420
standing up perfectly.

962
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,180
I see- I think we do have to put Patrick's soul into Quadra Mud Marks.

963
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,380
Can I wake up a little bit and see that Patrick is dead?

964
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,940
Ok, I wake up and I see Patrick and I go "No!

965
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,940
No!"

966
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,740
And then I see Quadra Mud Marks is still there and I go "Oh my, thank God!

967
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:25,740
Oh my fucking thank- Oh my God, oh wow!"

968
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,740
And you, what about you?

969
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,340
What's your react- you're waking up from this?

970
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:38,340
Yeah, I'm in denial, because that's the first stage of grief.

971
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,340
And so I'm in denial, so I'm slapping him.

972
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:47,340
I'm smacking him. I'm teabagging his face.

973
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:52,340
I'm drawing dicks on his face with my quill and ink.

974
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,340
It's like the sergeant from Day of the Dead.

975
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,340
clear that maybe like I'm dunking my balls in your mouth.

976
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,840
I looked like a sergeant from day to day.

977
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
Is it clear that like uh...

978
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,840
I completely flayed all my green verdant blood is everywhere.

979
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,340
Did it, did it, yeah so like did it, did it...

980
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,840
How'd the water do that or is it clear that like a shark bit his body?

981
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,340
I feel like, yeah, maybe like a board from the ship come out.

982
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,840
No I got, so because we're in a cave I was fine and then I got...

983
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:23,340
Something happened where like a wave, a wave pushed us all in and I, my, my butthole got stuck on a stalag, a stalagmite.

984
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:38,340
I

985
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,860
the wave yeah I think that makes sense for the one to getting like a one and just

986
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,380
yeah no dying yeah yeah cuz you got one success it looked like you're gonna

987
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,260
survive and then and then you just oh man this is I'm so sad it's crazy this

988
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:55,380
is all this is always said I don't have to do that fucking voice anymore there's

989
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,980
so much built in he was a character with the most back yeah we had it's all it's

990
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,340
literally all about him this whole campaign it's all it's all based on who

991
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,220
it's gonna be we're gonna have to change it so we'll we can figure out guy cuz

992
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,860
we're gonna record again next week so we'll have to figure out oh man well I

993
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:19,220
think we have to discuss this yeah when this happens in a campaign the DM and

994
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,980
the player who died will discuss it especially in figuring out where they

995
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,700
where if they want to have a new character where they want them to come

996
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:31,820
in everyone can discuss it to some extent it goes you can be you can be a surprise

997
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,220
character too and like show up in the middle of this right but because of the

998
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:40,540
way we do this we should discuss it. So you're basically out for the rest of the

999
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:45,380
episode. Yeah. Yeah. He turns off his mic and goes home.

1000
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,340
He goes to Uniqlo.

1001
00:53:48,340 --> 00:54:00,180
That's good timing I guess. The wedding is in a day. I looked at the calendar. Wow.

1002
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,180
Wow, okay.

1003
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:10,740
You guys, you two slowly come to, and you see a, I guess I'm trying to get the arrangement

1004
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,860
of it really.

1005
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,820
You would really see, because you guys are all kind of laid out.

1006
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,900
You're laid out like by somebody.

1007
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,420
It seems very intentional.

1008
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,420
And as you start to come to, actually I should roll for this guy.

1009
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,980
Oh, okay.

1010
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,300
You start to pick up and like blurry out of the, Rod Dogen, like out of the corner of

1011
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:40,100
your eye, you start to pick up the movement of a gnomish looking figure.

1012
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,300
Who's tinkering and tankering with stuff.

1013
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,980
And he sort of like starts to hear you staring and looks over and sort of waddles over to

1014
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:56,980
you

1015
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:02,780
think I'm okay. Oh wait no he got... yeah I'm fine. And he's also talking to me, slapping

1016
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:09,900
my cheek. Oh shit. I was hoping this... I'm crazy. I wasn't sure if the Verdun would make

1017
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:18,380
it. That's too bad. He's alive. I'm still in denial. He's alive. See? He's yeah. I stick

1018
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:25,100
my hand up his open... yeah into through his esophagus. Damn I'm still alive. And I don't

1019
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,100
I mean I think it's gonna be like a puppet but really my hand is just in his throat.

1020
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,420
And I'm just shaking him.

1021
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,940
Yeah, I'm completely alive.

1022
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,220
Just shaking him, just bits of viscera just like plopping out.

1023
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,820
There's like a barnacle on his face.

1024
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,700
See, he's alive.

1025
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,620
My friend is alive.

1026
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,260
I'm sorry about that.

1027
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,100
My whirlpool machine seemed to...

1028
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,100
What?

1029
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,100

okay he is going to go first

1073
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,420
one second. I guess I have three HP. Yeah.

1074
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:55,420
I think I have an initiative bonus. I also got an eight but you can just count the seven.

1075
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,380
What did you get? I got an eight with my initiative bonus.

1076
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,540
You got the same initiative bonus and result?

1077
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,940
Plus one and I rolled a seven. Me too.

1078
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,780
That's just no count.

1079
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,580
You both got an eight?

1080
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:12,080
Who has the higher dex? Probably you, Rodogon, you.

1081
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,080
My dex is...

1082
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,080
What plus did you add to your initiative?

1083
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,080
Plus one.

1084
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,080
You both added plus one?

1085
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah.

1086
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,080
You both have 13 or...

1087
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,080
I have 12.

1088
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,080
One of you have 12?

1089
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,080
Mine just says plus one initiative.

1090
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,080
Let's see your stat.

1091
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,080
Your stat is also 12.

1092
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,080
I guess we can just take turn at the same time.

1093
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:43,080
time. Can we try that one time just for this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We could try. We could try.

1094
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:49,840
This gnome is going to, I mean, first he's going to try to cast a, he's not going to try

1095
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:56,840
to attack you right away, but he is going to try to suppress your magic. So I need both

1096
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:04,460
of you to roll a wisdom saving throw. Don't we have advantage on that for motivational

1097
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,460
speech wisdom saves or we get something.

1098
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,460
Oh you do yeah.

1099
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,460
You two have an advantage on that.

1100
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,460
That's stupid.

1101
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,020
It worked.

1102
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,020
I knew it.

1103
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,020
Okay.

1104
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,100
I got a 20.

1105
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,100
I got a also a 20.

1106
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:25,220
Yeah I mean you both he tries to basically create a suppression shield around you it

1107
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,180
doesn't work and now it is one of your turns.

1108
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,020
We have to both take a turn at the same time.

1109
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:37,020
I didn't mean to use my spell on you because I was actually holding a toast right out of

1110
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,080
the toaster and I had a hot finger.

1111
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,540
When I touched your nose it was supposed to be a nice gesture.

1112
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,700
But I do want to know why you made a whirlpool machine.

1113
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,020
And I also want to know why you made a whirlpool machine.

1114
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,060
And why you didn't turn it off when the ship was in it.

1115
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,180
And also stop copying me.

1116
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,620
Wait, am I copying you or are you copying me?

1117
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,620
Oh no.

1118
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,620
Jinx, jinx, jinx.

1119
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,620
You owe me a soda.

1120
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,620
You owe me a soda.

1121
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:00,620
You owe me a soda.

1122
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,620
You owe me a soda.

1123
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,460
you only a soda

1124
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,000
you know the gangs

1125
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,620
to date so i guess i guess it

1126
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:13,440
it's really it's kinda still deception could you definitely did need to attack

1127
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,280
him

1128
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,980
who knows who can say what the grieving mind does but you're all with advantage

1129
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,560
for sure because you're having assistance here

1130
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,600
okay and we changed

1131
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,560
you did should jinx

1132
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,560
so now we have to invent soda

1133
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,320
I got rolled a 19 plus something.

1134
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,320
Oh, okay.

1135
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,320
Yeah, that's a 22.

1136
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,520
I mean, he didn't believe you last time, but...

1137
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,840
Alright, he rolled pretty low here.

1138
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,600
It's because I added the detail about a hot toast finger.

1139
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,600
That usually gets him.

1140
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1141
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,600
He's like, "Ah, okay.

1142
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,600
I understand you."

1143
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,600
I'm holding my finger out again.

1144
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,600
He's backing up.

1145
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
Whoa!

1146
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
Whoa!

1147
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,600
My mistake.

1148
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,920
I lost my balance for a second.

1149
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,240
I'm sorry about that.

1150
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:16,280
My name is Flint Lateralis and I did not mean, I have been testing my whirlpool machine for

1151
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,880
some time.

1152
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,000
I did not know there was a ship involved.

1153
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,400
I do apologize for hurting-

1154
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,400
Apologize?

1155
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,080
You should be in prison.

1156
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,880
You killed some, you killed a lot of people.

1157
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,320
You killed like over a hundred people.

1158
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,320
And a snake man cat.

1159
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,760
Have I been killing snake man cats?

1160
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,760
Yeah.

1161
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,200
Where like only like three people survived.

1162
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,240
Oh god.

1163
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,920
I guess they never really thought about the ramifications of building a whirlpool machine.

1164
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,920
Really?

1165
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,440
In the middle of the ocean during pirate season.

1166
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,440
I didn't even think about you being pirate season.

1167
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,440
Was there anything I could do to make it up to you two?

1168
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,440
Gold.

1169
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,440
Lots and lots of gold.

1170
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,440
You're asking, sorry I'm just amazed.

1171
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,440
You're asking if there's anything you could do to make it up to us.

1172
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,440
We're at the bottom of the ocean in a cave.

1173
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,440
I'm about to die.

1174
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,440
He's about to die.

1175
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,440
I can make sure that you, well, okay.

1176
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,440
You killed our best friend.

1177
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,760
Can you put a soul into this quadro mud marks?

1178
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,040
- I don't think I can do that.

1179
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,160
- You destroy our ship, you kill our entire crew.

1180
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,520
We have nothing.

1181
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,120
You did it, you ruined everything.

1182
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,080
I might as well be dead.

1183
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,040
- In fact.

1184
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,760
(laughing)

1185
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,080
I'm having an idea.

1186
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,800
That gives me an idea what you just said.

1187
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,800
- I'm having a serious also idea.

1188
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,960
- I'm holding my glowing red finger towards Caleb.

1189
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,320
- We didn't do anything drastic.

1190
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,320
I can and is Caleb also holding his glowing red finger out towards me.

1191
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
I'm trying to put your finger to my temple.

1192
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,820
I can I'm not going to I'm not going to do it unless we jinx it.

1193
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:02,920
I can I can I can I can some what we jinx our death.

1194
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,220
I can't same death.

1195
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,320
Oh each other soda.

1196
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,320
I can I can.

1197
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,120
That's crazy.

1198
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:15,920
I can I can give you give you supplies and give you and give you you

1199
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,520
already gave us a huge surprise.

1200
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,520
*laughter*

1201
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,520
And we didn't like it at all.

1202
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,520
He's much more surprising than destroying our lives, asshole.

1203
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,520
I have an experimental machine that I've been working on.

1204
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,520
I can let you have it.

1205
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,520
What's this, an earthquake machine? You want to ruin the rest?

1206
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,520
You want to go to my house and destroy that too?

1207
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,520
He wanders over to a rock wall and he presses his hand along it.

1208
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,520
And a little glyph glows and the rock wall slides down.

1209
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,520
What you see is a very early prototype submarine.

1210
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,520
Okay, this is awesome.

1211
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:59,520
Look, I know that things... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1212
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,520
For what?

1213
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,520
This is great, this is perfect.

1214
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,520
Wait, we can take this, right?

1215
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:12,520
It's yours, but please let me make sure I explain how everything works so you don't involve any disasters.

1216
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,880
I'm already in there.

1217
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,380
Let me guess, there's a steering wheel.

1218
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,080
I brought Patrick's body, I brought Quadro mud marks, I got all my stuff, I'm in there.

1219
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,320
Patrick's body is detritus at this point.

1220
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,200
I don't want it, I'm bringing it with us.

1221
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,200
I'm bringing it with us.

1222
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,800
Okay, alright, well.

1223
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,560
Okay, Patrick, do you have any last words as we head to the episode?

1224
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,560
Is your mic on?

1225
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:38,280
Yeah, well, it is what it is.

1226
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,280
And uh...

1227
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,280
That's brave.

1228
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,280
Yeah.

1229
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:41,780
Yeah.

1230
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,180
It is what it is.

1231
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:46,680
And yeah.

1232
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,180
That's just about the best last words I've ever heard.

1233
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:51,680
Yeah.

1234
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,180
Okay.

1235
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:52,680
Bye.

1236
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,680
Bye everybody.
