1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,080
You guys it's officially the five

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,320
The five weeks of planets are coming to a

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,660
Please I don't want it to come to an end. I don't want us. No, don't do that. Keep it

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,880
keep it going. That's not right. Keep it going right invent another planet right

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,580
now. Right. I do is that we're doing a plan here today. We should have invented

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,200
another one. We have a full planet in front of us. Okay, well, just invent one

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,280
more the moon, the planet of the earth, planet of the moon, but just invent one

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,360
more. There's billions of planets in the solar. I mean, the galaxy one in our

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,240
solar system. I've said there's right now man, billions of planets in the

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,480
solar system. Just name a planet Sedna Sedna. All right, Ares,

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,000
that one sounded fake. Those are the two exoplanets. I know in the solar

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,660
system. What is an XO? Paris is the one that here's what I'm saying every minute.

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,900
Do we have to add another week of some people? Some people ain't never paid

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,220
attention to the planet reports and it shows do we have to add a bit of

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,740
attention? It's Alpha Centauri. Yes, that's exactly on man. Planet dingbat.

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,980
I know all about all this shit from every planner. One hundred and fifty

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,580
million from one hundred and fifty one moons by which one had that planet

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,900
dingbat that was Venus. Maybe no, it doesn't have a hundred and fifty moons.

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,760
that had to be one of the gas giants, bro. That's my Jupiter. That was Jupiter man. I

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,760
had probably hundred and fifty one moons, including Titan. Well, that's in the original generation.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,960
It's a different generation of planets and the second generation. They added more. Now

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,440
that's in Jupiter, gold and silver. What the fuck are we going to do after this? But we're

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,880
all at ideas. We have the five for the boy for the planet report. Oh crap. I spilled

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,800
a little bit of water onto my hand. This is one drop. Well, it doesn't seem so. Oh, that's

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,000
not a deal. Can we start over now? We can start the whole episode a little bit.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Look, my hand's shiny now.

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,000
Cameron's got a wet hand.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
This is not going to be a viral video called shiny hand.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,600
Shiny hand white boy. I'm giving my hand under the table the rest of the

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,400
episode. But then it looks like it don't do that man. Then it looks like you

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,100
got wet from something else bro. It looks like it's wet from Jess.

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,400
Your hand looks odder now that you're putting it so front and center on the

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,960
you need to learn what to do with your hand. It is a little bit more. Put it on

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,340
here, put it on there and then it'll look like you're DJing and the sweat

36
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,820
will be. Now this looks like you're a thinker. Don't think like this man. This

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,060
pisses me off. Yeah. What's wrong with thinking? Well, it just is too much. I

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,340
feel like anti intellectual. I feel like you might outsmart me at any second

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,140
here. I already have. We're doing what? You got spilled water on your damn

40
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,780
hand, you fucking fool. He spilled water in a Machiavellian way. If you guys

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,920
didn't realize I basically made the episode funny just now. Wow, wow, you

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,380
got us a good thing to start with up, man. You got us an amazing people. So

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,920
realize that sometimes the class clown has a lot going on inside his head.

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,220
Yeah, sometime the class clown actually does all that shit on purpose. Yeah,

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,420
instead of a bad home life. All right, let's go through the outfits. Okay,

46
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,620
well, you're looking at mine and I assume you guys probably are like what

47
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,760
the hell I'm thinking. Well, my initial impression is well, you're right. It's

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,400
it's what the hell yeah. So what you guys assume you guys don't know is that this

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,960
is an album cover and it's an album by they might be giants and if you look at

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,160
the back of my shirt, you'll see the name of this album. It will say that you

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,760
can read it off for everybody to hear

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,960
the might Apollo 18 tour Apollo 18. There was the last mission to the moon

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,120
was Apollo 17. That was the last time this in demand mission to the moon

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,880
today folks. We're doing Apollo. Where did you get this shirt from my dad? Oh

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,120
yeah, I can tell because this is an old this is a man is a shirt is a older

56
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,920
album. That's a single stitch that you can tell that's how you know it's a

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,760
real true because they stopped doing single stitch in like that's a good

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,220
shirt. Ninety-four. I think something around there. Okay. All right. So

59
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,420
that's a little bit of your shirt, but I'm still saying what the hell to your

60
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,260
hat, man, bro is bro. Does this blow up on the shirt? It's a circle like a

61
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,720
moon. Yeah, and there's yellow and there's a man in the moon. Yeah, or a

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,320
rabbit or Chinese believe there's a rabbit in the moon and is close to a

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,120
a rabbit. I read that is a rabbit. I think he's a he's not a he's a beaver yeah.

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,420
Yeah, beavers and beavers, a subset of rabbit or a type of that's true. It's

65
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,940
got buck teeth like one yeah.

66
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,020
How many different animals can there be with buck does it besides nerds and

67
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,880
beavers and rabbits, nerds, beavers, rabbits, they're all in the same genius.

68
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,180
Oh, because you guys know did you guys see that there was a kid who was

69
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,920
protesting the nerd emoji because it looks exactly like him. Yes, now I have

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,980
I have news to break about that. So there was a kid. He was a ten year old

71
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,840
kid. He looked just like the nerd emoji. So he said, please apple change the

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,760
nerd emoji and he drew a new one where it has a little smile, but what I noticed a

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,460
long time ago here, Julio pulled it up for us. I noticed this a while ago. If

74
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,200
you you know how you when you type on your phone, it will it sometimes gives

75
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,840
the option to to replace to replace the words with an emoji. I know predict

76
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,640
air. Yeah, yeah, when you type the word nerd, the emoji does not come up. You

77
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,120
have to type glasses. They're so woke that that is not even a nerd.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,560
I owe you anymore. It's a show me that emoji and tell me that's not a

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,360
fucking nerd. I know bro. It's got buck teeth man. It's crazy that you can't

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,520
that who would type glasses to get that instead of nerd right. Nobody talking

81
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,000
about yeah, you're not it's not. I mean who wears glasses is cool. Well,

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,440
nobody Harry Potter, Harry Potter, not cool. Jerry Potter is a nerd. Now Jeff

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,000
Goldbloom's a nerd Jeff Jeff Jeff Goldbloom's a nerd. Yeah, Potter's a

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,760
nerd. Everybody who's wears glasses is a nerd. I'm doing it ironically in which

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,100
because there's a loser there. A hipster yeah, they're a hipster and they want to

86
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,100
they want to wear glasses before it's cool. Anyway, sorry to derail the

87
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,440
the like an emoji to yeah, it does look a bit. It does look like the Bucky's

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,280
emoji, Bucky's emoji, yeah, the yellow shining. It was a big shining moon

89
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,820
to last night. It was a waning. I may be three quarters crescent. It was really

90
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,920
scary. I thought that it was bright, bright moon last night. Do you know that

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,120
the moon cycle controls why your girlfriend is mad at you? I heard this

92
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,600
Apparently, girls' bodies get attracted...

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,300
Okay, what do girls like more than anything?

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,800
The moon.

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,300
White balls.

96
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
White balls, depending.

97
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,900
So they look up at the moon, they see a big white ball,

98
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,800
and their downstairs starts getting all hairy and crazy,

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
like a werewolf.

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
They grow...

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,300
That's where their pubes come from.

102
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Yeah.

103
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,800
So if you want to make sure that your girl has no pubes,

104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
block that moon out, man.

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Block the moon from your house.

106
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Inside at night.

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Do not open the shades.

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Do not let her out, or else she will grow.

109
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,040
- A fro down below. - Movie night.

110
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,680
- Movie night. - Yeah.

111
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
- Wow. - Yeah, I just came up with that shit.

112
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,680
- Oh my God, I wish I had you on today's song.

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
- Yeah, you do, man. - Yeah.

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,080
- Yeah, I'm really excellent at rapping.

115
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,760
- I know, I wish I had you on today's song

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,120
that we will play in a little bit

117
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
after we're done going through our outfits.

118
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
- I think that only happens if women

119
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,720
are away from telephones or something.

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,660
- What do you mean?

121
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,200
- I think I saw this on Rogan some years ago.

122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,080
That women, if they're away from telephones

123
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
for a certain amount of time,

124
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,680
when they're in a gaggle a group, they start will think up with the moon.

125
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Yeah in a rhythmic. Well, what I was wondering is it true? Is it true?

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
People always say that, you know, when there's full moon animals behave crazy

127
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
and that humans are committing more crimes and acting more crazy. Is that

128
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,240
actually true? I know I was thinking about this last night. I don't know if

129
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,920
that's scientifically true or not. If the moon affects people's mood, yeah,

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,440
or their behaviour and animals, not just people, but animals to the moon.

131
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,300
people are animals. My Luna Luna see you guys know about that. Yes, Luna see wow.

132
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,840
I never thought about you didn't know that yeah. Holy that's like how dementia

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,420
and demented have the are the same thing. Well, that's the same word yeah. Yeah, I

134
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,700
didn't know that till a couple of weeks ago right, but that's literally the same

135
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,620
word. Yeah, well, that was a pretty you know, it's not like Luna means the moon

136
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,340
that's like the same that's not really at all. I did know etymology wise

137
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,500
running is like ran

138
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,140
is what you said. I didn't know that a Cornish game hen was a chicken. I

139
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,220
thought it was a completely new type of animal. How often are you thinking about

140
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,940
a Cornish game hen that that matters? I also until right now thought a Cornish

141
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,340
game hen was like a like a bird. I thought it was a completely different

142
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,780
bird, like how a turkey is different. I guess I could have thought that, but I'm

143
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,500
not. I can't say that I've thought about a Cornish game hen. You have never been

144
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,980
that's the craziest name for a fucking bird. Of course you think about that all

145
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,780
the time. I don't. That's the bird for like the one that was a fancy.

146
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,020
tiny bird food. I think the bird the the thing that you use in a restaurant

147
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,960
sketch quail, a Cornish, you see, I thought I would game hen was closer to a

148
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,980
quail. I thought it was a tiny bird, just a chicken is a Cape on a chicken

149
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,100
two. Is that a different bird Cape on? What the hell are you talking about? Oh,

150
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,340
it's a Cape on that's you bitch got you, you got your way. I'm sensing lunacy. I

151
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,420
am between you two right now. This kind of crazy is a Cape on adversarial nature.

152
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,380
I don't know what a small is I've never heard also a small food bird. Okay,

153
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,880
well, there's one that only you knew at this table. How do you guys not know a

154
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,980
capon? I've never had it. I never had it either. I know it. I know what is

155
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,980
though. C A P O N let's look it up. Maybe it's the same thing as a cap on

156
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,740
this shit. Yeah, ain't no such thing as a shit. Whoa, a capon is a male

157
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,980
chicken that has been castrated or neutered

158
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,900
and that makes it taste different. I guess capons cost more than hens,

159
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,740
because they're expensive to feed and not mass produce, which is why you won't see

160
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,840
them sold at a chain supermarket. Yeah. Why is it better to eat? I guess that's

161
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,780
why I've never seen one fattened for eating, so it's actually a bigger

162
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,640
chicken, like a wagyu chicken. Yeah, that's cool. All right, walk us through

163
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,540
your outfit, Pat. Well, I am some kind of a werewolf. I think I really tried my

164
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,380
best on this. I kind of just look like Howard Stern right now. You do look a

165
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,220
lot like Howard Stern. Yeah, kind of, kind of just look like Howard Stern. If

166
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,060
he got bit by a wolf. Howard Stern does have a bit of a, he does have an apish

167
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,860
kind of hair configuration. He is set up to

168
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,400
be in a movie where he takes off his sunglasses and there's some kind of

169
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,380
crazy animal eye underneath, like a werewolf like bloodshot eye. Like a

170
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,620
thriller. Yeah, exactly. Or a Judge Doom, who framed Roger Rabbit, some pop out

171
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,500
eyes. He has some silly eyes. But I could see him, he's like probably the

172
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,280
perfect specimen to be a werewolf. He has silly eyes under his glasses. He pops

173
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,480
them off whenever a woman gets on the Sibium. Yep, and he goes, oh, he takes

174
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,080
him off and he's got binocular. Wow. Wow. I'm looking at your butt. We need

175
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,880
to do more stuff like this on this show. Stern, just like having his voice

176
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,480
is because now that we have video, we need to get a Sibium is what you're

177
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,520
saying. Not a Sibium. It's outplayed, man. Yeah, we get a new thing. The

178
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,960
Sibium's washed. We have Juvio sit on. Let's just put an obstacle course over

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,960
there. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. A sexual obstacle course where it's like

180
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,240
wipe out, but you're jumping on the bad dragon thing. It's like a pit in the

181
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,600
pendulum, but there's a dildo on the- Why did he make the women ride the

182
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,520
Sibiu? He didn't make them, they wanted to fucking- Well, yeah, but why was that

183
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,000
his thing? 'Cause it was- It was a shock jock. Yeah, it was something different.

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,880
I guess they would make, I guess, yeah, but that's like, you know, that's just

185
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,560
the sound of vibration, really. And also this.

186
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Yeah, I have to say that's more the draw than the vibration. You think he ever got

187
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,360
on that thing. How it's a turn. You think he ever sat on that thing? He loved that

188
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,000
shit. Think he ever sat on that and put the whole thing up his rear? Hell yeah.

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,840
I would have shaken up his balls like a can of soda. Yeah. Yeah, then would have

190
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,720
shot a spray. Yeah, it'd be foaming out everywhere. Yeah. Coming out through the

191
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,760
cracks in his zipper. I just shot a huge rope. But I think they probably- No,

192
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,640
that's Alan Alda. I lost the- Why do you want to do this impression so bad?

193
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Because I'm dressed up like him. You're not dressed- you're dressed up like a

194
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
monkey was sung. You're dressed up like like

195
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
don't feel like doing anything.

196
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm Howard Stern.

197
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,180
No, this is the lazy song.

198
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Okay, should I dress like Bruno Mars then?

199
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,180
I don't know how he talks.

200
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
Filipino-y?

201
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,680
You are so yeah, you're whole because the mic is also covering your mouth.

202
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,680
You're like a shadow. Yeah, yeah, you look evil. I do and also you chose to

203
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,180
have a grim reaper. Yeah, I thought this would work better. No, it's not working

204
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,820
informing that much. Now you're resting your boob table. You look like a magic

205
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,340
trick. Yeah, yeah, you don't wait. All right, enough of your fucking outfit.

206
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,740
Yeah, let's let's hear we can talk about the show. I think I have a guess about

207
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,260
yours. What's the guess man that it's coloured like the moon? It's coloured

208
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,580
like the

209
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,220
yeah, it's not that deep for me man. It's coloured like the moon and the fit the

210
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,900
man in the moon, the face in the moon. I kind of just look like one of the Abu

211
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,940
Grey prisoners. Now

212
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,360
I don't really look like a monkey anymore. That's because the monkey

213
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,860
because you covered the monkey mask.

214
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,260
Yeah.

215
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,460
You can't do it.

216
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,160
I mean, of course you don't.

217
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,960
Yeah, you put a hood over your entire head.

218
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,360
Yeah,

219
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,260
I was stepping behind a wall and saying I don't look like anything now.

220
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,360
I'd look like nothing.

221
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,760
I don't even look like I'm here.

222
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,160
Yeah, we should get one of those.

223
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,560
Have you guys seen the invisibility panels?

224
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,360
No, I can imagine what it might be.

225
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
I think I've seen a camera through the...

226
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,360
No, man.

227
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,860
It's crazy.

228
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,420
it's like a piece of plastic that bends light in like from two directions into

229
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,020
the middle so that it just basically like you can if you sit in the middle of

230
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,860
it it looks like there you don't exist and you're invisible oh is that what

231
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,940
they use for that like have you ever seen that public toilet that's all like

232
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,660
what's it called is it invisibility panels or is it the two-way mirrors I'm

233
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm trying to think I don't know mirrors probably yeah, this thing's expensive.

234
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,540
Would you put that I'd poop anywhere? Yeah, I'd poop in a probably wouldn't

235
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,460
want to pee in. I poop in our bathrooms pretty often man. I just do that.

236
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Somebody told me that the fuck is the problem with that man? I don't toilet.

237
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,860
That's what I'm told me. They got yelled at. I think it was Neil. Neil went

238
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,140
into a bar into a bar bathroom was shitting in there and the bartender ran

239
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,820
over said he was in there for too long. I guess it was one of those ones that

240
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,960
you got to fight. It's a fucking turd. I guess they thought he was in there.

241
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,620
He was banging on the wall and going,

242
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,780
I guess they thought that he was shooting up, which is why they like

243
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,460
banged on the door at him, and then when he got out and said,

244
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,460
"Sorry, I was shitting," the lady went, "Well, you don't do that in a

245
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:16,900
bar."

246
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,520
That's one of those social norms that needs to be eliminated. It doesn't make

247
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,140
any sense. I've shitted in so many bars. Don't install a toilet in your

248
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,940
bar if you don't want people to use it. You have food at your bar.

249
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,340
I'm gonna crap. Yeah, and I digest food instantly.

250
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,640
I have I have I have your bells the thing, though you know how we can we

251
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,020
can prove show all these these evil bartenders, how that they're wrong,

252
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,860
yeah, how they're I just remember there's a curb your enthusiasm episode

253
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,700
where Larry is opening his coffee shop and he wants to have a bathroom. I

254
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,740
remember where there's no pooping allowed and you shows you show somebody

255
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,380
that they're doing what Larry David did in an episode. They're going to turn

256
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,380
around. They're liable to kill themselves. What if they say that he's

257
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,540
their spirit animal, though,

258
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,700
but he's supposed to be the kind of spirit animal where you like secretly are like, I

259
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,100
want to be like that. But in real life, you're like, oh my God, he's so me. He he acts like

260
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,580
me. But then you're like, oh, thank you so much. Like how people want to like, oh, thank

261
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,820
you so much. That's you. And this is Larry. I want a box of bear. It's honestly no worry,

262
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,420
but worries like if not, but like seriously, thank you so much. It's like a spirit animal

263
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,900
in the sense that like like oh, like say like a bear is your spirit animal. But like, you

264
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,780
know, you always have a thought like as a man, you're walking around acting like a bear.

265
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,740
a man you always have a thought like I could get in a boxing ring with a bear.

266
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,900
This fucking Larry the David guy, nobody needs to be acting like him. He's a scumbag.

267
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,140
He teaches you how not to act. Yeah. Isn't that fascinating? I think he has

268
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,720
actually sociopathic tendencies. I think I'm somewhat agreeing with you. I think that

269
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,980
we have an essay that we could make video wise. Here's what I noticed about

270
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,620
video essays yesterday. Why do they always have this parentheses at the end?

271
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,740
Like one about Larry David would be like, "Why Larry David acts like an asshole."

272
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,100
double and then princes and why he's right yeah. Why get that parenthesis

273
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,040
out of it's because of the argument that shit they want to hook it on yeah. Why

274
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,580
does it work? I want to hook you. I'm watching all these fucking videos man no,

275
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,760
but I know I know exactly what you're talking about. Shit man. I'm trying to

276
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,700
watch NBA highlights, not why Josh Giddy what he did was wrong princes or right. I

277
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,780
don't want to watch this shit. This is a fucking for all right. If you live in a

278
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,740
country where the age of consent is different now, they got him on some

279
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,820
bullshit man. What do you mean? Apparently the woman had a fake ID.

280
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,340
Oh.

281
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,540
So? Was he supposed to hire a private investigator? Maybe. I mean, if he's

282
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,820
got the money to do that. How old was she? 12? She was fucking four years

283
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,500
old, man. She's a four year old child, yeah. Well, I guess if she's that

284
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,660
young, maybe. And the fake ID said she was 65 years old. You're telling me

285
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,860
that a man named Josh Kitty was...

286
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,900
Yeah, big surprise. Yeah.

287
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,980
You're telling me that Josh Kitty

288
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,360
was hitting up kids. Here's the thing man, Josh, do you realize how much of a

289
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,140
fucking privilege it is to be a fucking just corn-fed white boy in the NBA? Is he

290
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,460
Australian? He's Australian. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think he's corn-fed, I think he's kangaroo-fed.

291
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:22,020
To be a roo-fed white boy in the NBA, that is such a such a mistake, a universal

292
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,820
just just crazy stroke of luck that you're in there. Don't fuck it up for us.

293
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,660
You're ruining the reputation of guys like Bryant "Big Country" Reeves or the other

294
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
guy Jokic.

295
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
Jokic?

296
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Jokic.

297
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Jokic.

298
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,500
I don't know how to spell any of that fucking Polish shit.

299
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,260
Well, you're not spelling, you're talking.

300
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,660
Or speaking it.

301
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,740
You put a J and it's supposed to make a different sound, I'm done with that.

302
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
I'm out of there.

303
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,340
That's any other language except ours pretty much.

304
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,820
Every single Balkan style language where you got the Y with the shit on top of it.

305
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,620
I don't like that shit. I don't know how to get that shit on top of the Y unless it's a

306
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:08,500
Zivic. I like those, but that got the Y with the shit on it. You just basically destroyed

307
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,940
your entire position. You're making a convincing argument and then you said you liked the most

308
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,380
insane one. Yeah, I know. I don't agree with you anymore. The most impossible to pronounce.

309
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,860
Well I'm a hypocrite and I'm a double crosser. Don't say you're a double crosser. Because

310
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm in business with you. I don't want that shit. I'm a complete double crosser.

311
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,960
Don't say that. You're not a double crosser.

312
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,460
Yep. And well, how do you know I'm telling the truth? How do you know that

313
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,780
my double agent status is even... Who would you be a double agent for, man?

314
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,180
Probably Poland. Maybe I'm spreading anti-Poland shit. There's no... You would

315
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,700
not be a double agent for Poland and podcasts about Lyft. That would not be...

316
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,580
You don't know that. We're not in any kind of conflict with any country.

317
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,180
We're about to be. You could be a double agent for... We're about to be the

318
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,180
Call of Duty five weeks of war

319
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,180
with Poland.

320
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,180
Oh, no war with you want to invade Poland. No, that's reminding me of

321
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,180
something that's reminding where you learn that as well. Where'd you learn

322
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,180
how to do that? Call of Duty five.

323
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:11,180
I learned it in Call of Duty five from playing the bad team, but the call

324
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,180
of Duty five is about invading Poland. I think so. I don't think so. No, I

325
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,180
never played. No, it's actually mostly about Japan. I just realized you're

326
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,420
World War Two in real life. Yes, that's what he's thinking. Yeah. Okay, so maybe we're not

327
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,740
going to invade Poland, but we are going to go to war with some country. I don't want

328
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,060
to go to war, man. We're not ready for this fucking disgusting war. We're going to go

329
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,780
to war with a country. We already finished the war, man. We literally appeased the Nazis

330
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,660
of Brooklyn. We literally lost a war. No, no, no, no. We appeased them. Yeah. I would

331
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,060
say that we appeased them like they appeased the Nazis. We waved a white flag and the Nazis

332
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,340
have taken over the trash Nazis have taken over everything. Yeah. Which in my opinion,

333
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,260
all Nazis are fucking trash. Holy shit. I just fucking amazing. Play Zombie Nation after that.

334
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:02,140
Say it again. In my opinion, every fucking Nazi on this planet Earth is trash to me. I

335
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,100
missed it so much. Yep. And it's back. We could not, I don't know why we haven't even

336
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,460
touched it in the five weeks of planets. I think every single... Because we're on a different

337
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,420
wavelength man. Yeah, but that's the best sound. That's an Earth song. That song was

338
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,220
was written on earth. Yeah, that's songs that were written on other planets.

339
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,460
Speaking of man, yeah, speaking of you guys,

340
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,100
this is the one to close it all out. The last song, the last OJ the alien song.

341
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,780
Unless,

342
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,940
I don't know, unless we discover a new planet, I don't know,

343
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:36,980
which we could. I guess we could. Unless there's a discovery of a new planet.

344
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,060
We could discover it.

345
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,460
Maybe there's gonna be a discovery of a new planet. You guys can't,

346
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,860
you can't be setting stuff up in the plan. You don't know what's in it.

347
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,580
You're going to disappoint everybody. There's no new plan in the plan report.

348
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,620
It's not right. You're setting expectations that can't be met. It's not

349
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,420
fair. I was supposed to maybe I guys. I think the painting is going to be a

350
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,060
hundred feet tall. It's actually way taller. It's way taller. Yeah, people

351
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,300
are going to be disappointed. Now I'm excited to see it. I was supposed to

352
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,100
make another song with Rupert, but Rupert was busy, so I had to make this

353
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,420
in under an hour before the episode. So what I further ado,

354
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
Nothing Looks The Same by OJ the Alien

355
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Nothing looks the same.

356
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,620
This is a song about my dreams y'all.

357
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,620
He looks fucking sad.

358
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,620
I guess it's more like my nightmares actually.

359
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
OJ the Alien!

360
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,620
Old man, water bear, rabbit or hare

361
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,620
These the creatures in my nightmare

362
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
I tried to run but I don't know where

363
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,620
Damn this shit has got me scared

364
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,620
I once had a dream that everybody hated me

365
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,620
They called me names like Pooh Head and Pee Wee

366
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,820
They wanted me dead, tried to hit me with a piece of tree

367
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,220
Until I showed them the Infinity Pea

368
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,220
Infinity Pea brought a bountiful harvest

369
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,820
I planted it and they said I'm the smartest

370
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,420
Had a portrait done by an artist

371
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,020
Till they realized what I had started

372
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,620
The pea grew wings and started flying like crazy

373
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,420
I was alive, the pea ate a baby

374
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,020
Then it maimed a sweet old lady

375
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,620
Then I woke up and I was doing 80

376
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,220
Behind the wheel of my Flora Explorer

377
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,880
I rammed into an old Toyota

378
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,460
This all happened in Minnesota

379
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,300
I killed a man and his name was Dakota

380
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,840
Wasn't the impact, it was the fire that killed him

381
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,460
The car was cracked and it broke all of his limbs

382
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,040
It was all fucked up, it left me feeling very grim

383
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,840
When I drove away, it was me or him

384
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,380
Every single day, I still see his face

385
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,040
I think of his blood all over the place

386
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,720
And how my car was the coup de grace

387
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,460
I ended his life with my car from space

388
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,860
Wait, that was a dream? This is all okay.

389
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,360
Okay.

390
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,400
Okay.

391
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,900
We learned.

392
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,940
We learned that the moon controls all nightmares.

393
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,440
Whoa.

394
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,300
When did we learn that?

395
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,020
And moon creatures like the werewolf or the water bear.

396
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:01,380
We learned that you can have a dream while you're driving.

397
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,700
But we shouldn't let the dream world control the real world.

398
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
*laughs*

399
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
When did we learn-

400
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:20,060
behind the wheel of my car is a dream and it didn't happen. Don't look up the case of

401
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:29,140
Epona Wellman from Minnesota, okay? Nothing happened. And if you're from his family and

402
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:37,060
you're listening, leave me the fuck alone. There's no reason for me to be penalized for

403
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,420
what happened in the dream world.

404
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,620
This is OJ the alien signing off.

405
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,380
Five weeks of planets, y'all.

406
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,620
Peace.

407
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:54,500
The fuck was that?

408
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,100
I had to make it in an hour.

409
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,740
What the fuck?

410
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,180
What the?

411
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,780
I mean,

412
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,660
why?

413
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,780
What did that have to do with the moon, man?

414
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,100
There is different kinds of lichen throat creatures that he says.

415
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
A werewolf?

416
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
A werewolf, a water bear.

417
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
A water bear is a real animal.

418
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Microscopic.

419
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
But it's powered by the moon?

420
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,100
No. I guess it lives in the water so the tides could...

421
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
They found a water bear on the moon.

422
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
That's not true.

423
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Is that true?

424
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Look it up.

425
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
They found a creature from earth on the moon?

426
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,540
What the hell they stop see that shit it's small as fuck. They say I don't

427
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,260
know what kind of telescope they use and see this fucking bullshit. This is

428
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,740
I'm pissed off. You're pissed off about the song? I'm pissed off about this

429
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:47,300
song. It's about the moon is at night time. So this song is about dreams.

430
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Yeah, no shit.

431
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,780
It's all about dreams? The song is about how the moon controls dreams.

432
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,420
Talk about that, dude, there's so much amazing shit to talk about on the

433
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,940
moon. First of all, the fake, the fake, the fake landing. The flag. The flag

434
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,720
that's on there. There's been a lot of creators, the people who you can see on

435
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,740
the moon, the tides, the tides man talk about any of that shit. Don't say I was

436
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,060
first of all one thing that did come out of this. It was good dreaming and

437
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,220
driving. That's good. I like that yeah. That's a good well dreaming and you

438
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,760
weren't even going for that. That's what I put together watching the song yeah

439
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,380
dreaming and driving. I'll never forget that fifth of dreams dare me to drive. I

440
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,740
just had a

441
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,860
I just had a five second dream.

442
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,300
I had a dream last night. I was hanging out with Taylor Swift. Really yeah, I

443
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,900
had a dream that I was at a party and Taylor Swift was there and I was

444
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,220
talking to a bunch of people and everyone kind of left and I was just me

445
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,620
and Taylor Swift and I was like this is really awkward. I don't want to be

446
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,380
talking to Taylor Swift, so I was going to try and find my fiance to be like

447
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,860
oh, you guys should talk.

448
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,900
I don't have to talk to Taylor Swift and you just talk to her man. Leave your

449
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,300
fiance fucking. I was having so awkwardness with Taylor Swift and we

450
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,420
had nothing to talk about. I was like, oh, I heard you set a record with your

451
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,840
latest concert or something and she's like oh yeah, that is honestly every

452
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,080
guy's worst nightmares being in a one on one conversation with Taylor Swift,

453
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,860
having no idea what she expects you to know everything about you getting

454
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,400
that's literally what I said. She expects everything from you and you're

455
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,800
just like

456
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,920
so I heard yeah. I guess you're really popular right now, so

457
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,280
really I have no I have no idea what I would even talk to that lady about

458
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,960
out. That's what I'm saying, but I think in the world of dreams, my dream self

459
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,040
we would have nothing in common. You know, the only thing the only thing that I

460
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,640
think that I guess we both may be Travis Kelsey. Yeah, the only thing that I

461
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,480
think I could maybe say, but I know that it would end the conversation

462
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,980
immediately is are the four chain rumors true. Are you really a beat hard? Did

463
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,600
you write that? She was on four chan and then she would go. She would walk

464
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,560
away. These these rumors, T swizzle was on four chance. That's what people

465
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,280
that's a claim, a claim, racial memes and shit like that. People claim that

466
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
she was on there on the random forum.

467
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Mm-hmm.

468
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,620
That, why would she be on there?

469
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,760
I don't know.

470
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,860
When you're famous and you got nothing else to do, you might as well go on the internet,

471
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,860
I guess.

472
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Yeah.

473
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
Why?

474
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
I guess you're fucking right.

475
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,820
You can't go talk about random crap with people in real life.

476
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,820
But why would you go on there?

477
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
You'd have to go on an image board.

478
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Because it's completely anonymous.

479
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,180
But I would get, but obviously not if people found out that she was on the fucking website.

480
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Well, she was sloppy.

481
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Well, yeah, she was sloppy.

482
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
What'd she say?

483
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
There's evidence.

484
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,580
It was something about, I don't remember.

485
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
There was something she...

486
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,460
cats and they're like a like yeah, my cat's name or some shit. It's nothing.

487
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,740
It's nothing. It's not a real thing. It's not real. It's all fake. But why

488
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,500
do you say it then? If it was fake? I think it's a hoax, but it could be true.

489
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,740
That's why that's the only thing that I would want to ask her about. Let's get

490
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,580
into it, bro. Guys, what's the big elephant in the room with? I think that

491
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,660
they filmed the moon landing.

492
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,860
There actually is a lot of stuff. I think they filmed it, man. I think they

493
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,660
I filmed it, man. Yeah. I think it was more than just a bunch of images strung

494
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,660
together. It was actual film that they used on this ship. I don't get how that

495
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,700
got back into the atmosphere without completely exploding. Isn't there a

496
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,580
radiation plane that you can't pass?

497
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,700
Yep.

498
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,260
Yeah, but should spaceships have radiation shielding? But that doesn't

499
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,540
really do anything. That's a myth. That's also a myth. Yeah, I guess that

500
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,780
probably doesn't do anything. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't do anything at

501
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,060
Oh, that's all crap. Okay. Well, let's break this down, though. Okay. What are

502
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,540
the arguments for it being real? Because that's what I'm working on. Obviously,

503
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,960
there are no or no. There are some arguments. The footage is crazy. It is

504
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,260
crazy, crazy footage. Yeah, that's not an argument for it being real. That's

505
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,580
just I think that's a middle thing. Argument for it being fake is that why

506
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,860
haven't we gone back? Right? That's what I feel like. Okay, I get the and the

507
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,180
argument people always say for not going back is that they say, well, it costs a

508
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,720
a lot of money and we already saw it's just rocks yeah, but that's stupid

509
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,300
something could have happened since then yeah could have changed up there. Well,

510
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,220
first of all the flat you guys know I was reading about this. The flags that

511
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,300
they put up on the moon, they weren't like special space flags. There's normal

512
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,780
flag yeah they're done. So they're done yeah they're gone. We gone as fuck, so

513
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,080
we need to go back and put more flags up there. We should put a new flag for the

514
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,340
five weeks of planets flag. Yes, these days, I probably put the LGBTQIA two

515
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,320
plus yeah yeah flag put that probably there. You can't you can't call them

516
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,340
guys. No, I'm no. They put said it in such a way. I was saying me and

517
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,880
Patrick both thought that that's not what I was saying at all. You said it

518
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,820
the way you I was the way you said that into me both of our minds that

519
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,020
simultaneously put that banner up there. You're going to ban them. You're

520
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,980
going to ban them from the moon. Sure, who cares you want to ban her days

521
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,780
from the moon. I don't care who goes to the moon. I want to ban her chaise

522
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,940
for shays no more. You shouldn't be able to. I agree. I agree. You shouldn't be

523
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,980
able to. No chocolate on the moon. No. We should have done a cheese tasting for

524
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,740
today's episode. Oh, my God, we're so stupid. We're so stupid. And I should

525
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,780
have dressed up like motherfucking Wallace. Yeah, you should have dressed up

526
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,860
like that. Wallace the dog. Wallace is the guy. Don't even try to start. I'll

527
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,340
mute you for the rest of the episode. We're not doing that again. I don't know

528
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,260
which is which, y'all.

529
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,100
I actually do know.

530
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,500
Okay, go ahead, talk whatever you know. No, I don't want to talk. We okay. Now

531
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,540
you just made me a bad. So yeah, I'm getting mad now because it's it's the

532
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,280
end of the five weeks of planets. Okay, and we're getting mad at me because I

533
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,340
got mad at your song where because yeah, I flopped and then what next is like

534
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,700
let me guess like your painting is like going to be digital to you already. You

535
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,260
already knew it was digital asshole. Yeah, you have a digital painting. You

536
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,320
can't even do a water. I was taller than a hundred feet. It was taller than a

537
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,700
hundred feet could be it because it's digital. It's not so I

538
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,760
mention okay. I know the song and then there's no to the painting. The

539
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,900
painting has no dimension. We're going out with a flop. We're not going out

540
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,320
with a bang. It's the end of the five guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,

541
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,280
guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,

542
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,560
Joe, the pressures, the lunacy, the pressure, where we're completely

543
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,540
where we're where we'll think not only that tunes, but I think I'm realizing

544
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,380
right now that this has been, I think for all three of us,

545
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:15,500
like the most fucking unbelievable experience I've ever had with this show.

546
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,300
Yes. You know, I think I speak for all of us when I say that. I learned music

547
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,780
production. This has opened our eyes to so many new things, and I think that the

548
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,860
fact that it's ending

549
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,260
is ticking us off. Alright, let's not start crying yet, 'cause we still have

550
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,220
half the episode to go. Okay, man. Yeah. So, here's my theory about the moon

551
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,060
thing. I think that the moon landing was real. They really did film it, but here's

552
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,700
my, my thing. I think that 2001, a space odyssey was actually filmed in space. I

553
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,740
agree with that. I think it's the other way around. People say that Stanley

554
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,420
Kubrick did the moon landing. And they were both fake. Because he knew about how

555
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,740
to do it from 2001. No, they were both real. Yeah. He really was on that

556
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,340
spaceship and he really went to the future. And he really had a computer. So

557
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,820
the year 2001. I believe that shit. Yeah, I believe it, too. But I think that, I

558
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,260
think that that was film in space. No doubt how did he do a loop de loop on

559
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,400
the ship and are you going to build a fake moon can rocks it's too big. What

560
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,620
a giant run a bunch of rocks in a sound stage. What you put I don't get is how

561
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,540
they got the footage of the moon landing.

562
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,440
They brought it back. They don't just leave it there. I thought that there

563
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,580
was a I guess they also trend. They did transmit it didn't they well. I guess

564
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,180
they had that work well. They can also can't be far away. They can transmit

565
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,020
their voice as well, because they can say Houston. We have a problem, so it

566
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,820
must not be that hard. How it must be the same as TV, I guess. Okay, here's the

567
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,220
so they want you to believe. Here's the argument for it being. Wow, I can't my

568
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,020
dad was born before humans landed on the moon. He only land on the moon. Nineteen

569
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,620
sixty nine. So it was my dad. Isn't that crazy that your my dad was my dad

570
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,700
watch that on TV, bro? My dad probably watched that to my dad. Isn't that crazy?

571
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,140
Oh my God, my dad was three. My dad was eight years old. It's my uncle. I bet he

572
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,020
I should ask him about that today. Yeah, my mom apparently she heard dad put her in front

573
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,620
of the TV and said even though she was like two years old, it was like you have to watch

574
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,140
you have to be in front of the TV for it's so funny how many and then he and then my

575
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,780
grandpa did the exact same thing with me with 9/11. Wow, he put me in front of the TV and

576
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,740
was like you got to remember this shit. My dad has to remember the moon landing because

577
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,620
he told me he remembered when Martin Luther King got assassinated. That was what 1968

578
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,620
something like that.

579
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,180
Yeah, I mean I guess it's true.

580
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,580
It is funny though putting your kid in front of the TV like that, I don't know.

581
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Why?

582
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,980
Just like a stupid 60's thing.

583
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Put him in front of the tube.

584
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,660
Just putting him in front of there for some kind of significant, yeah.

585
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,580
Here's the argument for why we didn't go back, okay?

586
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,860
So say 20 years ago you went and climbed Mount Everest and it was the hardest fucking shit

587
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,360
that you ever did right and you had all sorts of amazing Chinese food that you

588
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,820
never had before at the bottom of the thing right and it was great, but it's

589
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,300
very expensive. You're not going to do it again, but then you get a go pro for

590
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,940
Christmas and somebody's like why don't you go back to fucking Mount Everest and

591
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,060
kind of with the go pro. You get a go pro. Yeah, well here's a every no

592
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,140
yeah, here's what it is. You know it's because that's basically we invented the

593
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,180
go pro and they're like go do a go pro commercial, an apple commercial for an

594
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,100
eye. Yeah shot on iPhone on the moon suck on it.

595
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,900
but America is the only country that of where people walked on the moon. So

596
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,260
it's more like so here's what I think if ever you can imagine every country in

597
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,900
the world is brothers and sisters in a family. I like to think that yeah your

598
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,900
brother goes and walks. It goes and climbs Mount Everest yeah and then your

599
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,500
fam everyone you why does nobody else do it? Aren't you jealous? Well, your

600
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,340
brother be the only guy who did it because you're kind of been coasting off

601
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,980
the being the moon people right. Can you imagine that? I think that's it. I

602
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,820
I think when China lands on the moon, it's over for us. Yeah, it's absolutely over.

603
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,740
Well, because they're going to put cool stuff up. They're going to build some

604
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,540
shit up. They're going to change everything. They're going to eat a crab

605
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,860
up there or something. They're going to bring back moon rocks and then they're

606
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:05,700
going to use them as a source of fuel. Have you guys ever seen the fucking

607
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,780
spaceship part at the Air and Space Museum? No, I've never been. Maybe.

608
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,540
Where is that? DC. I did not go. I'm sure I saw it, but I don't remember.

609
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,460
their lander yeah, the lunar lander it's really small man. You know it's not. I

610
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,740
thought that it would be as big as a palace, but these guys they landed on the

611
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,800
moon as poppers yeah, it's crazy. It's really is unbelievable that you could do

612
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,220
that. I think I fully understand people who think we didn't land on the moon,

613
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,140
because how could you do that? I can't do that shit yeah, bro. I think it was a

614
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,600
six man think about their cars exactly. I'd be up there trying to hold my

615
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,340
breath. Think about the airplanes, the cars and how come every single spaceship

616
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,220
has looked the same since the they did not have Mario yet. No Mario was not

617
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,020
even invented, not even close. Nobody even had an idea of Mario in their head

618
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,220
at that point. Maybe they had an idea. Maybe one guy had an idea. I had an

619
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:02,120
idea. It was probably only one guy, one guy, one guy had an idea for Mario,

620
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,860
but then was was hit by one of those big 1960s like Chevys and was immediately

621
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,900
just just decimated. Yeah, well, it would have been the Japanese guy.

622
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Okay,

623
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,720
so he wouldn't gotten hit by. He's saying like an alternate thing. I had an idea

624
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,480
from Mario and then he didn't get to you, but I was saying yeah, maybe it was

625
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,660
whoever who's that Jigoro Miyamoto.

626
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,980
Is that that's exactly who it is? I don't know. I don't know if that I know

627
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,380
that's just a Nintendo guy in general. I don't know if it was a different guy

628
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,780
from now. He made up Mario and Donkey Kong. Well, then it was him as a child.

629
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,580
I guess he's probably born at that point. That's an and that's an idea you have

630
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,540
as a kid and then you grow up and you oh yeah, you think you refine it. Yeah, I

631
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,920
guess I should make this thing that I drew on a piece of paper when I was

632
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,660
all right years old. Speaking of drawing on a piece of paper, I have to show my

633
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,580
painting. Okay, even though it was not drawn on a piece of paper, it was drawn

634
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,060
on wood. It was not drawn on wood. Stopped hyping it up in a way that I

635
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,080
can't. It was burned into wood. You guys are going to like this shit man and you

636
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,160
spend ten hours on this. I spent a long time on it. Okay, I spent a really long

637
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,960
time on it. Wow, so guys, this is the moon right and this is this is Caleb

638
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,740
that's twenty twenty three digital. Here's the moon right here and from left to right

639
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:23,440
OJ the alien Cameron Patrick me and Julio and at the very top at the very top. I love you

640
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,700
five weeks of planets. That's I like that font to that's so sweet. It's very like kind

641
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,460
of loving font. Well, it's a digital very, very futuristic font. That's what I'll find

642
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,760
you're going to look like in the future. True it's true as fuck, but that's us

643
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,060
three. It works just like I did different head shapes for me and Patrick.

644
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,260
First, I'm saying detail on my hair man. Yeah, the hair looks that's insane.

645
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,660
You're welcome to how do you do that? Dude, I'm an amazing artist. What do you

646
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,100
mean? That's the most impressive piece of art you've done yet. No shading on

647
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,740
that hair. Is it beautiful? It's great. It's wonderful painting. I mean, I

648
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,900
wanted to nail it. You know, it's the last painting, so I told you I spent a

649
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,060
of time on it man. Our eyebrows, I gave Pat his mustache. And a hat and I guess some type

650
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,860
of hat. It's a beanie. It looks like me. It does look like me. It's just a beanie. Julio

651
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:18,380
is kind of looking like a chip. I like how you made Julio pale and white. He's white

652
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,940
man. He's as white as a ghost. He's whiter than any of us and he's got his favorite hat

653
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,580
on. He's the whitest guy I know. And I made OJ green. Classic. Everyone's smiling. Classic

654
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,620
OJ green. Yep. The moon, didn't spend that much time on the moon I'm going to be honest.

655
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,420
which is mostly about my friends faces looks good, though it kind of looks like

656
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,460
a close up of a hairy ball sack. This is a

657
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,120
microscope

658
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,580
exactly like a my

659
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,840
germs under a microscope on a ball. So

660
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,440
doesn't really look like this is a this is a dead guy's balls yeah and then

661
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,800
yeah dude. I love you five weeks of planets. This has been the pleasure of

662
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,220
my professional career, ten episodes, ten episodes, episodes, a complete

663
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,540
mastery. Exclusively about planets. I mean, it's been amazing, guys, and I

664
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,740
can't wait to continue my artistic endeavours into the future, whatever,

665
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,380
into the future, that future. For the future planet. Whatever comes next for

666
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,140
us, 'cause I don't know what comes next. I don't know if there's another planet

667
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,540
that maybe is gonna... Cameron's the leader, he decides this kind of thing,

668
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,300
man. I don't know why you guys are doing this. He's the leader and... If there's

669
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,380
maybe an extra day of planets that could happen, maybe, who knows? Maybe for a

670
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:36,720
planet called Poonam or something who no more cent or cent or something like that

671
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,180
cent or never. I'm never telling you guys that I'm doing something at the end

672
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,500
of the episode ever again. Okay, why as you're trying so hard to put build up

673
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,900
false expectations? I don't know. I don't know. I literally already told you

674
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,580
point blank. There's no other planet in the plan about it. Think about it,

675
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,740
though. What if there is a planet called cent that had a moon called Poonam could

676
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,320
like a day because I said a instead of something,

677
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,520
which is how planets get name. I guess it could be somewhere. It happens with

678
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,320
the universe is infinite. The universe,

679
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,880
the first universe

680
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,800
we could go. It can look into that. I guess we could look into that. Do you

681
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,520
guys ever? I just don't want it to end. I just don't want the five weeks of

682
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,880
planets to end. Let's talk. Let's get real about space. This space fucking

683
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,440
terrify you every second you think of it.

684
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,640
Yes. This month has made me...

685
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I'm fascinated by...

686
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,920
I think that humans, I think our brains... I was thinking about this yesterday when I

687
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,640
was walking my dog. I was seeing so many people and I was like, "I don't think that people

688
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,160
were meant to see this many people."

689
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,240
No, we were not meant to see this many people. I don't...

690
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,160
You're meant to know like 15 people.

691
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,360
Everything that I've learned about planets this whole month has fucked me up beyond all

692
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
repair.

693
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,600
I think that it's made me really happy I don't smoke weed anymore. If I was smoking weed and

694
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,240
doing five weeks of planets, this would be an entirely different. I'd be in the

695
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,080
mental hospital. Dude, I was watching a video of going inside of

696
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,880
Neptune and it's unbelievable. How'd they go in? They went inside? It's gas.

697
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,040
I mean it's... They sent a thing? No, no, no, it was like CGI. Oh, okay.

698
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,580
But they have... There is footage of Neptune where they fly by it and

699
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,200
that shit is... I mean, just any actual footage of flying by a planet is

700
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,460
actually so fucking crazy. I get why people want... I get why these millionaires

701
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,620
want to go to space. I wouldn't. I don't want to go up there, man. I want to go

702
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,820
there pretty badly. You know the thing where like everybody... I think that's

703
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,540
the... I mean to be real about it, I think that's how you have a... You

704
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,020
transcend. I think I agree. I would change into a completely different person.

705
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,780
I would shed my... I guess it would feel like the first time you do acid

706
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,580
in college. Was it Mr. Armstrong? Neil? Neil Armstrong that said that he thinks

707
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,260
that anytime somebody's elected president, they should send them up into

708
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,060
spaceships so that they have to see Earth from very far away.

709
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,580
I think, didn't SpaceX send like William Shatner up into space and he like had a nervous breakdown

710
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580
in his life?

711
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,420
Oh yeah, he had a nervous breakdown and then, or no, it was Bezos.

712
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,140
He went up to space with Bezos and Bezos, like he's telling everybody like, "Jesus fucking

713
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,300
Christ, this is so scary."

714
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,300
And then Bezos is just like, "Hahaha, Captain Kirk!"

715
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
Yeah.

716
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,300
Really?

717
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
It's a really good clip.

718
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,300
It like destroyed his brain.

719
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,300
Yeah.

720
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,780
is having like a real like moment and then Bezos is just like, "Who cares?" I get that

721
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,980
with the backgrounds of YouTube videos. Yeah. If somebody's talking and they decide to put

722
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,960
a space video behind it, I'd fucking close the tab, dude. I don't want to see space.

723
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,620
I want to see space. I want to see the planets individually and learn about them and what

724
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,460
kind of creatures they are. I want to hear raps from every planet. Yeah. I don't want

725
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,200
to see this space shit. It's too scary. I want to go to the South Pole. I want to wear

726
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,240
some South Pole and be a gangsta. Is that a type of clothing? I guess it is. You don't

727
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:54,320
remember the South Pole? No. It was like a brand from the early 2000s. Coca-Cola Polar

728
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,800
Bear. No, no, no. South Pole. You never wore South Pole? Coca-Cola Polar Bear. Coca-Cola

729
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,160
Polar Bear. Yep. We got to make a new wrap. We can use that in the next wrap. We got to

730
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,320
make a new one. No, but I think that this final one was such a flop that we got to make

731
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,320
the last like when we went to the Grand Canyon, I was attacked by large.

732
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
That's why I want to go to space.

733
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
But I think it would. I think I'm right.

734
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,520
I would read my humanity to the brink man brought me to my knees.

735
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,320
It brought me to the brink is too big.

736
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,120
That's what I mean. Don't you want to don't you?

737
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,220
Wouldn't you like to seek something greater?

738
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,420
Hell no, no.

739
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,320
Find it something new.

740
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,520
Actually don't I don't want to but have your brain destroyed.

741
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,120
My brain's already been my brain wasn't destroyed by the great

742
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:42,280
of existence. I saw the Grand Canyon and I was just like, well that's nice. You're built

743
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,600
for space. I don't want to think about it. You're built for space, man. Well, I think

744
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,320
that I was making myself not think about it hard. Because it's too scary and big. Yeah.

745
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,600
I think I'm good at that. I think I'm good at shutting off my brain to not think about

746
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,880
big things. Imagine seeing space. I would come back and I would start a cult. Imagine

747
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,300
missing Lizzo in real life.

748
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,500
Celebrities have a glow to them. They do you can tell why they're famous. Once

749
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,200
you see him in person, some of them have been taking Adam Scott in real life and

750
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,820
I was like this

751
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:18,580
yeah, you bit your no, it was hot as fuck yeah. Apparently, Paul Rudd came

752
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,160
into my fucking wife's work again. Paul Rudd stay away from my fucking wife. I

753
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,620
swear to fucking God, if you ever do this shit again, I will kill you

754
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,520
sorry

755
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,620
don't bring your kids around either and make my wife think this look at my

756
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,520
amazing family you would plug in as a perfect step mom don't do this shit man

759
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,320
funny here's a funny space thing okay I've been I've been reading the

760
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,620
Fantastic Four comics from the beginning the originals and do you guys know the

761
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,720
origin of the Fantastic Four yes they're all four friends and they go up into a

762
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,420
their spaceship together and they get blasted by cosmic rays and it mutates

763
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,880
them yeah and then they come down and they land and and they all get their

764
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,140
powers. They got and they're all like okay. We should become a team and the

765
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,480
human torch is like well. I can I can make myself go on fire, so I'll call

766
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,400
myself the human torch and then the invisible girl says well. I can turn

767
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,800
invisible. I guess I'll call myself the invisible girl and then the thing he's

768
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,640
become a mutant monster. He's like I'm not even human anymore. I guess I'll be

769
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,920
called the thing and then the last guy says and I'll call myself Mr.

770
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,680
Fantastic

771
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,120
and we're going to be the fantastic for wait. Wait, this is what we need to do.

772
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,760
We go up in space. We come back and stretch, so I guess I'll be

773
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:48,740
four of us will be fantastic for wasn't there. He wanted to be the leader so

774
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,240
bad. There is like a what if I think like a marvel, what if that was like if

775
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,400
they went up to space, but like their powers just like killed them.

776
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,200
that's a pretty short comic. That sounds like a boring. What is yeah?

777
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,000
What if someone died as soon as the story started? I don't know it's like

778
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,640
over a long period of time that they're like powers or like they just got like

779
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,560
radiation sickness or something. No, I don't remember exactly what it was, but

780
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,560
I think it couldn't have been that they just got it. Yeah, one there is one

781
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,800
and we're dead. There is one yeah. I think that might have been what it was.

782
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,760
I don't know. I don't really remember it that well, but we need to go up to

783
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,580
space, come back, become the thoughtful three. Yes, I was oh my God, yes, the

784
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,340
thankful three, the thankful three. What would your powers be in the thankful?

785
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,480
Well, I'd be I'd be Mr. Thankful

786
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,980
okay, and I would be a stretching ability. Oh man,

787
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:44,180
whatever I have stretch. I can't have a new power. Okay, I would have

788
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:48,060
acrobatic powers. Okay, that's pretty good and I would be Mr. Thankful. Could

789
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:53,620
I be late have laser beams? Yeah, where from where my hands, my fingers, ten

790
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,260
laser beams who and they come in ten fingers. That's too many ten figures,

791
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,060
mister ten finger finger

792
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:06,600
is good. Okay, I'll just shoot to from I'll okay. The thing I'll just do you do

793
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,360
this yeah just yeah you're the finger yeah, and I do this and it shoots it out

794
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,620
of my ring finger or it's lightning bolts yeah, and it's the shocker that

795
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,540
the shockers are real. I'm sure right, so the thing I would be is real. I would

796
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,180
I have like the like like the human torch, I would have water powers and I

797
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,260
would be the human drop

798
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,100
and that would be

799
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:35,940
the human job and I would I would turn into water. I do water guy. I'd be the

800
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,120
human drop. I'd be a water guy. I walk around

801
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:42,200
that's my whole power.

802
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,580
Basically, my power is that I give people cups of water. He's a super

803
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:51,120
still in in that doctor doom. Okay, so doctor doom comes up right, mister

804
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,960
thankful, I'm acrobatic, so I do a bunch of back flips to distract him and then I

805
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,840
finger him to death. You finger him to death and the human drop gets him wet

806
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,420
and what wets him. I just I put a puddle. You get him wet, you finger him and I

807
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,840
amaze or I could make I could just make a wave or something. I don't know. I

808
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,360
think, you know, the human torch can only just turn into fire. He can turn

809
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,660
into fire and shoot shit out of his hands fire, but the human drop can't do

810
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,280
the drop. You know, like when the Brita is like a little bit empty and you have

811
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,000
to tilt it to get the water out, that's basically what I can do with my hands. I

812
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,600
just do that tilt water. It just kind of falls out. It falls. I understand. Yeah,

813
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,560
I can mostly fill up cups. Yeah, I can mostly do the human drop filling. Is

814
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,840
your water need to be boiled before you drink it? Yes,

815
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:43,600
water. It is not. It is not potable. No potable. Potable. No, it's definitely

816
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,080
potable.

817
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,780
Well, it's not potable water. It's mostly like it's mostly rain water. I think you

818
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,360
drink rain water. You can drink rain water after you clean it. Depends on

819
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,280
what it hit more like river water. I feel like I think mostly what my power

820
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,280
would be for is helping people make ramen, helping people make tea. I can

821
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,680
boil it with my finger and you had a pasta and I could do a back flip in

822
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,320
front of them. Yeah, or I guess I could fight with it and we'd be wearing the

823
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,340
jumpsuits, the stretchy jumpsuits with a big three. I would I would basically be

824
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,320
we would be more of a Vegas act than really a super hero and we'd always just

825
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,500
be like we're so so thankful that everybody for supporting us. Thank you

826
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,880
so putting us in jail. Yes, well, he would for being criminal. I would turn

827
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,100
into a drop of water. I would back flip out of jail. He would escape. You would

828
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,880
cut the bars of every old superhero comic from the sixties always has at least like

829
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,860
five different issues where they are the whole plot of the issue is just that

830
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,660
they are going to Hollywood and starring in a movie and the director turns out

831
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,140
to be evil. So we would do that would be fully are the only thing for three

832
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,380
would only do that.

833
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:55,020
Only villains are always movie directors who are always going to star in

834
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,340
different movies. Well, who's that? Who's that guy who

835
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:03,100
that one director that Roman Polanski? Yeah, we go and it's Roman Polanski man

836
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,140
and he starts telling us he starts getting a little locker room talk with

837
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,960
us yeah and then we and then I

838
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,380
anger

839
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:17,840
that's our that's our thing. I was saying like a vendors assemble. I say

840
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,940
get him wet and finger him, get him wet, figure him a back flip right in front

841
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,260
of him.

842
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,560
Yeah, you wish you never fucked with the thankful three

843
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:30,120
bitch ass Roman. We have a we have a rap at the end of the movie. Yeah, yeah,

844
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,760
Thankful Three and I'm here to say we are the Thankful Three. I've been thinking about...

845
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,720
Get 'em wet in finger! We are the Thankful Three. Why is it you know all these rappers are getting

846
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,280
in trouble because they rapped about doing killings in their songs. How come that never

847
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:54,080
happened with Grandmaster Flash? I don't know. And that that is only a new thing. Nobody,

848
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,760
there was no attorney in the 80s that was like your honor Grandmaster Flash said that he was

849
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,460
not only not only here to say, but he was also wrapping in a thankful way and then

850
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,160
they put him in jail. He said that he broke glass everywhere. Exactly.

851
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,260
This should have been prison for life. He saw somebody peeing and didn't report it.

852
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,820
Straight up. I got in trouble for that as a kid. My cousin just started peeing on

853
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,240
his bedroom floor. My cousin just started peeing on the carpet on his

854
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:28,560
bedroom floor and then I just said stop doing that, stop doing that and then my

855
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,660
my aunt came downstairs, put him in time out and also put me in time out for not

856
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,400
telling her. Here's a what if what if the thankful three came up? What if the

857
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,500
way your cousin stopped that fingered him? Yeah, backflow,

858
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:44,080
wet him, finger him, back flip, wet him, finger him, back flip. Well, that's how

859
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,360
you stop all crime. Yeah, yeah. I mean, who's going to be able to power through

860
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,600
getting wetted, fingered and back flip? Oh my God, it's not Dr. Doom. It's the

861
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:57,440
it's Dr. Soon, ungrateful, all rich and he's he's not a doctor. He's not

862
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,820
thankful. Well, I don't think we're going to so grateful urologist.

863
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:08,500
That's a doctor. You're the urologist is a doctor, like a lot doctor doom, but

864
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,140
why are we going to what about us wedding him fingering him and back flipping is

865
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,620
going to make him? We're just called a thankful three because we're thankful

866
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,380
for our powers and yeah everyone support. Okay powers, but wouldn't the

867
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,500

868
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,260

869
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:31,700
Thank you mayor. Thank you. We get the key to the and now the thankful three have to comment about defeating the ungrateful urologist.

870
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,500

871
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,400
Thank you everybody.

Thank you everybody for watching.

873
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,100
Thank you for letting us put on like a little show and getting everybody wet.

874
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,500
And I'm all my God hundred backflips in a row.

875
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,800
We get to throw out the first pitch at a game.

876
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,300
Mm-hmm.

877
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah, that would be amazing.

878
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,600
Wow.

879
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,300
But then we but then dude we turn evil.

880
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,600
Oh God.

881
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,900
Yeah, like

882
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,160
like Magneto thankless three thankless three or that's a villain. That is a

883
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,160
copycat of us, so yeah, the evil version, the thankless three and they do the toe.

884
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,260
They get them hot,

885
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:10,520
yeah, they faced them, the human torch, the human, the toe, they told him and

886
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,420
mister thank you mister front flip is very inflexible, so you can't do it

887
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,260
yourself all the time.

888
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,220
So he'd be mister front flip, not mister thankless, but he can't even do a front

889
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,820
front flip yeah because he has why that's his villain or is a back. It's his real

890
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,940
name, Mr front. Yep, it's really just kind of born with that name is front

891
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,660
flip yeah and it just he's really mad at his parents and he's taking it out on

892
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,540
the world. That's what he does try to front flip a lot, but he got in a car

893
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,180
accident a long time ago. Dreaming, a wheelchair, it's just a guy in a

894
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,780
wheelchair. It's just not pretty mad about it.

895
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:50,140
That is a villain. That's a villain and unbreakable yeah. Oh yeah, I wanted to

896
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:56,300
that movie the other day, but I feel like it might suck. No, it's fire. It's really good.

897
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,900
You need to stop taking these. Why? You are not built for Zen. What do you mean? You spit

898
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,700
them out instantly. I didn't spit it out instantly. I was in there for like 15 minutes. But yesterday

899
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,380
you had to leave Phil's birthday party. Yes, because I had a few. Yeah, I had a birthday

900
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:17,900
party for my dog, okay? You had to leave because you had one. I had one and yes, after a couple

901
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,540
I'm not. You don't need this shit. This is not good for you. You don't know that. I do

902
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:27,420
know that. I'm saying you spit it out in pain and run away from obligations. You didn't

903
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:33,420
even sing Happy Birthday to Phil. Did you guys sing when I left? Yeah, man. Yeah, dude.

904
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:40,020
You missed out on an amazing moment of reverie. Damn. And music. There was music? And revelry.

905
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:44,660
And revelry. That's what I meant to say. You need to lift my spirits with maybe a planet

906
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,860
report reverie is like chill bro. You don't control the planet report. That's

907
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:53,860
not your business. Yeah, stay the fuck out of that reverie is music.

908
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:59,260
There's a bunch of songs called reverie in whatever a minor that kind of thing.

909
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:03,960
I believe reverie is like sitting around being like, oh, this is amazing.

910
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,560
Yeah, that kind of thing. So I suppose it was reverie as well. I think it was,

911
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,160
but I wasn't trying to correct you. I thought that that was what I did mean

912
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,460
revelry. Okay. I was just adding revel rebel. They got rid of it. Revel is

913
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,580
gone. There's no more mopeds. Really? They're getting rid of every cool thing

914
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,560
in New York. No more Airbnbs. Yeah. Oh, I mean, Airbnb sucks shit. All right, let's

915
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,960
get back to the moon. But we don't have any... Oh, yeah, okay. Sorry. Back to the

916
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,420
moon. So the Thankful Three were sitting on the moon. Yeah. Oh, a werewolf would

917
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:34,180
be a good villain for the moon. Yes. For a moon-based group. So the... Yeah. Because

918
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,660
a werewolf would always be a werewolf on the moon. I've never thought of that

919
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,620
before. Because of the rays. If you sent a werewolf to the moon, it'd be a zoo.

920
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,120
blue. Yeah, well, no, it'd be a werewolf.

921
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:49,680
Oh, would he be wearing a suit, a space suit? You can wear a space suit.

922
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,520
That's cool. That's really cool. A werewolf in a... I was imagining a

923
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,360
were... I always thought it'd be cool to have a werewolf and he's wearing

924
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,520
some type of glasses where the moon is like painted on or he has some

925
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,860
kind of like VR headset where like he's always sees the full moon. So

926
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,900
we always... And if you take it off, he turns back. Like Cyclops. So wait,

927
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,800
it's just a picture of the moon can do it. I thought he's a physical moon rays

928
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,200
and it's like a real that's what I mean. It's like Vr, so it's realistic enough

929
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,480
yeah, is it like influence? It tricks the psychology, the rays of the moon that

930
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,540
makes them werewolves. You know about them full moon, you know about monsters,

931
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,260
it's the full moon, so even a picture could do it, though, I think it probably

932
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,580
the jury's out because well it's not real. I'd have to test it. Oh yeah, it's

933
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:34,540
not real, so it's no, but why is nobody? Why is Robert Rodriguez never made a

934
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,660
movie about about a bunch of astronauts sitting on the moon and then they

935
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,880
become werewolves. I'm almost certain there's a movie about werewolves on the

936
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,040
moon. That's that's that has to be like

937
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:50,160
probably I'm sure that a million guys who love sharknado have come up with that.

938
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,920
Oh yeah, I feel like they definitely want to watch that movie. Yeah, I feel

939
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,480
like it probably isn't good. I'm sure there's at least three movies about

940
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,000
that. Whatever that was just the type wasn't that nazi werewolves on the moon.

941
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,880
They probably did that. They definitely did nazis on the moon. I remember that

942
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,860
Yeah, is that where they got off to dinosaurs on? No, that is a thing.

943
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,900
Where did those bloody Nazis get off to? There was a million of them.

944
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,540
Hell, hollow, your seat, oh, hollow earth between me and Pat. Oh, God,

945
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,100
yeah, kill him.

946
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,360
The hollow earth, the hollow. I think that's one that I would really on the

947
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,680
hollow. I would really like to believe in the hollow earth. Yeah, it's easy to

948
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,620
believe in. You just have to think about it's called faith. Yeah, well, now I

949
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,540
believe faith is about believing, even despite evidence to the contrary.

950
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,540
Okay, well then I'll do it then.

951
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,540
Alright. I suppose. There we go.

952
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,540
But how do they get sunlight in the Hall of Worth?

953
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,540
There's another sun in the center.

954
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,540
You're kidding. I'm not kidding. That's the theory.

955
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,540
That's what they said back when they thought that was it.

956
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,540
Oh, the molten magma core is actually a sun.

957
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,540
They thought it was a sun, yeah. And then it was like

958
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,540
the sun was, you know, it's all like

959
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,540
So is everything topsy-turvy? Yeah, I think so.

960
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,540
Is it reverse me?

961
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,540
I think there's, they said there were different layers.

962
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,540
I think there's also a bunch of different

963
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,540
people had different ideas.

964
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:05,500
ideas. There's different ideas there. Yeah, it was all based on a guy who

965
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,900
wrote a book. There was a science fiction book and then the Nazis did a

966
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,380
bunch of research in it to be like, well, let's see if this is real. They

967
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,820
were some fools. Let's take this book and let's see if

968
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:18,180
weren't they trying to summon the devil to yeah, they were all types of strange

969
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,860
stuff. They also were trying to murder thousands of millions.

970
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,980
I did not mean to say that. Oh, my God,

971
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,800
millions of people. Wow yeah

972
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,400
Oh God,

973
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,300
that's an honest that's

974
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:42,740
no. If you said hundreds, if you said millions of thousands, there we go

975
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:46,320
thousands of hundreds, thousands of hours, time, a still hundreds, a

976
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,120
hundred thousand

977
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:52,260
hundred thousand times millions man, I'm done talking on a million, two

978
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,620
million, millions, millions,

979
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,780
kajillion okay.

980
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:02,680
Something else to stop talking about I don't want to talk about this. I made a

981
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,220
mistake man. I just said you should have said kajillion.

982
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:11,300
No, that's not true either. It's not true, but it's less bad. Just so

983
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,460
excited to jump in. I said the word murder and you went yeah thousands. I

984
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,340
falling ill.

985
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,980
I'm falling completely ill.

986
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,880
you're sick of what you said. I'm sick of myself for making that kind of

987
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,660
historical

988
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:34,180
inaccurate statement, man. I'm sick of myself. Yeah, it's just well, it's good

989
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:37,360
that you're sick. I'm glad that you're setting the record straight. Yeah, it's

990
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,580
not right to say things that are false about history. I agree. It's bad to

991
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,180
miss a historical bullshit.

992
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:49,280
That's right. You know, gingus slash gingus con whatever his name may be.

993
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,420
People say Genghis, people say Genghis.

994
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,980
Dan Carlin says Genghis.

995
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,460
- Genghis is crazy.

996
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,300
- It's cool.

997
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,140
It's kind of cooler.

998
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,980
- Yeah, a little bit.

999
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,800
- Genghis.

1000
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,640
- Yeah, it is cool.

1001
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,660
- Hey, I'm Genghis.

1002
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,860
- I'm walking the other way.

1003
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,300
Genghis, what are you, a plant with a face?

1004
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,220
- Dr. Stephen Brewell style Jesus.

1005
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,060
- Genghis.

1006
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:06,900
- Yeah.

1007
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,580
- But apparently he didn't kill as many people

1008
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,620
as people say he did.

1009
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,540
He was a propagandist, not unlike Donald Trump.

1010
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,620
- Propagengist.

1011
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,460
- Propagengist.

1012
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,940
So he wanted people to walk around and say,

1013
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,580
Oh Genghis Khan's killing all these people and shit and he was killing some

1014
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,100
people sure,

1015
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,380
wasn't that crazy back then you everybody was killing people yeah. It

1016
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,780
really seemed like people didn't matter that much. No, no, what is that about

1017
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,320
isn't it funny to there's way less people way less. He won't be like I just

1018
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,840
fucking kill whatever who cares cut cut him into a trillion pieces. Let's just

1019
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,660
do that yeah nowadays you can't even kill one guy. Go to jail. You go to jail

1020
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:44,720
immediately for one for one back in the day for half of one for half of a

1021
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:48,880
the fucking guy could injure somebody and go to go to jail. You can go to jail. A

1022
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,540
guy recently went to jail for shooting other people who were trying to rob his

1023
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,220
weed store. Oh,

1024
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,580
doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me.

1025
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:01,120
Shooting shooting it's not shooting and not even killing. I mean what he shot

1026
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,500
him with what a BB gun right yeah, a BB gun that killed them instantly. No, I

1027
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,120
didn't kill anyone dude. He was just shooting at him. Can you imagine you get

1028
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,180
in front you shot somebody you killed them and you get in front of the judge

1029
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:16,580
and the judges like gathering papers and he's like okay you and you shot them

1030
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,620
with a BB gun right,

1031
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,620
yeah,

1032
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:24,140
yes, clerical air, yeah, actually, he's and then he's trying to catch you. He

1033
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:29,800
says lying, you just lied, perjury, double time in jail. You guys got to

1034
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,420
watch brawl on cell block. Ninety nine. Do you guys want to watch that tonight?

1035
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,420
I'm now that movie's fucking fire, all right, well

1036
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:42,280
give us a report. Join us. One yes, on a five week galactic. There's a big one

1037
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:57,380
So this is the report not about the moon.

1038
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,340
What the fuck are you talking about?

1039
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,440
I'm just going to go ahead and read it starting with the title.

1040
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:12,040
Five weeks a friendship report by Cameron Fetter.

1041
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:18,160
Five weeks, ten episodes, the greatest experience of our lives.

1042
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,060
We've done it all guys.

1043
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:28,080
Met up on Mercury, vanquished violent varmints on Venus, made love on Mars, jumped for joy

1044
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:37,540
on Jupiter, said silly stuff on Saturn, yelled yippee into Uranus or on Uranus, needed nourishment

1045
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:48,020
on Neptune, partied on Pluto, sang songs in the sunshine, but as much as the sun shined,

1046
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:53,240
there was one thing that shined twice as bright, and that was the three of us.

1047
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:59,320
We connected with each other by dressing in outlandish yet stylish outfits.

1048
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:05,860
We found points of similarity we never even considered before, our opinions on planets.

1049
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:10,460
Patrick blossomed into a talented musician before our very eyes,

1050
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:15,660
writing several of the catchiest songs that have ever been heard in our galaxy.

1051
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,860
Caleb revealed his hidden art skills,

1052
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,360
turning out some paintings that seriously belonged in the Louvre,

1053
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:29,460
and some haikus that belonged in the Haiku Museum in Japan.

1054
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,560
And I hit it big on the Powerball.

1055
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,760
Even Julio felt the love of the Five Weeks of Planets.

1056
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,600
He traveled to New York City all the way from his home planet of Mexico

1057
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,900
just to talk about the solar system with us.

1058
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,880
Our friendship is a lot like the planets.

1059
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,280
We built it off a strong terrestrial core,

1060
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,560
surrounded by the stormy, wild gases of mad romantic love

1061
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:58,160
and blanketed in an atmosphere of normal pleasantness.

1062
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,040
We stand strong for each other on our rotational axes.

1063
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,880
We all orbit each other at a speed of one smile per minute.

1064
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,320
And we all have moons, which represent our hobbies.

1065
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:16,200
Well, now it's time to return to Earth after our long space journey.

1066
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,160
I know I learned a lot, and I loved a lot too.

1067
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,920
I can only hope everybody else did as well.

1068
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,400
I wish the five weeks of planets could last forever, but there's a reason it can't.

1069
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:41,400
because it's five weeks long. Planets for every everybody. And now it's time for the four

1070
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
weeks of Christmas.

1071
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,400
YAY!

1072
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:52,400
I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need and that's

1073
01:04:52,400 --> 01:05:01,400
Santa Claus will make me happy With a toy on Christmas day

1074
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:08,400
I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need and that's

1075
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:15,400
[Music]

1076
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:22,400

1079
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,400
10th at the bell house with Girl God.

1080
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,400
If you like us singing, scrap the fuck in,

1081
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,400
because we're going to be the crier.

1082
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,400
The choir, rather.

1083
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,400
We are going to be actually elves.

1084
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,400
Elves.

1085
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,400
And that's the Five Weeks of Planets, everybody.

1086
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,400
And get ready for the Four Weeks of Christmas.

1087
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,400
This has been an amazing journey, you guys.

1088
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,400
It really has changed everything.

1089
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,400
[applause]

1090
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:05,400
*singing*

1091
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
I wanna take the mask off

1092
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
Take it off man

1093
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,400
*singing*

1094
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Woah

1095
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,400
Woah man

1096
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,400
I'll change your whole vibe up man

1097
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
Alright, alright, that's the episode

1098
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:31,560
A sandwich I ate the other day gave me indigestion so bad that my whole chest felt like it was

1099
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,560
jumping out of my chest.

1100
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:38,840
I feel like I can't even eat turkey ham anymore without the nitrates going into my system

1101
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,840
and just totally bubbling me.

1102
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,840
I feel like I got bubbles in my stomach and chest almost every day I wake up.

1103
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,840
Walking to the train station I feel this gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp.

1104
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,840
I shouldn't be eating that turkey or that ham man or the turkey ham.

1105
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,840
This stuff is destroying our planet.

1106
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1107
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1108
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1109
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1110
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1111
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1112
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1113
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,840
I'm not going to eat it.

1114
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,840
and this stuff is destroying our men and our women.

1115
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,680
- I've developed-- - Mostly men,

1116
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,760
men usually eat more cold cuts than women.

1117
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,520
- On average, on average, okay.

1118
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,520
I've developed an adult gluten allergy.

1119
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,880
I never thought it would happen, but here I am,

1120
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,640
close to 27 years old,

1121
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,560
and the only bread that I can eat is sourdough.

1122
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,840
Sourdough's good for breakfast, and it's good for sandwiches.

1123
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,360
I can't eat Hawaiian rolls anymore.

1124
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:29,760
Just the other day man I was cleaning out my humidifier, it had a heavy mineral scaling.

1125
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,680
Mineral scales were collecting onto the humidifier's heating element.

1126
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,300
I soaked it in a solution of vinegar and water for about 15-20 minutes and I started to scrub

1127
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,960
it with a soft brush so as not to damage the element.

1128
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,400
I was rinsing the brush under the sink so it wouldn't just have vinegar residue and minerals

1129
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,400
in it.

1130
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,400
I flicked back the bristle.

1131
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,400
The vinegar shot straight into my eye.

1132
01:07:50,400 --> 01:08:00,400
And you know, when you think about how men are treated in society nowadays, every single...

1133
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,400
The way that women make us feel is like we always have to act like Howie Mandel.

1134
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:15,400
We always gotta be thinking about putting a rubber glove on our heads and doing Bobby's World impressions and talking like Gizmo.

1135
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:33,480
is

1136
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,000
Graham.

1137
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,660
