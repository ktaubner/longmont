80

which is a Mexican 7-Eleven.

81

there's like, Amstel, there's Michelob,

- Santa Chicks.

It's clear that it was like a small amount of cans.

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,120
wasn't mass-produced. Yeah, but it was also like the most insane beards I've ever

91
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,040
seen in my entire life. And now you're living in New York, Brooklyn,

and now you're getting, you know, India Paleo, gay butt, grapefruit,

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,240
actually grapefruit is mine. Do you think that the scene has radically changed with

94
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:22,220
your move? So I was fortunate living where I did before where like you know 200

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,560
many of that of those here you kind of have to like go to a like a brewery and

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
and buy the beers there to get that kind of thing.

99
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200
- Yeah, so it's like, that's not as easy

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,760
to find where I am at.

101
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,600
- Right.

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,360
- Like it's like, you're limited by what's

103

we went to that one grocery store by Caleb's

107

and it was just, he had really crazy beers.

108

109
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
so much so that it was a little overwhelming.

135
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,440
didn't really notice, I didn't really read what any of this

136
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,120
said until just now. But it is it is a Stiegel Rattler. It's a

137
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,240
grapefruit beer. And it completely looks like a like a

138
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480

139
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,440
- Wait, all of us have gone with a fruity note this week.

140
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,000

They're like-- - I've never had a kombucha.

146
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,160
- Never had a kombucha? - Nope.

147
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,520
- Man, I drink a lot of kombucha.

148
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,680
It's probably one of my favorite.

149
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,760
- I'm very straightforward with what I drink.

150
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't even like mineral water.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,240
- Mineral water?

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,680
- Yeah, I don't like it much.

153
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,840
I can't tell the difference between any waters.

154
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,720
How do you tell? What's the difference?

155
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,620
It tastes weird for me.

156
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,260
Mm. So you don't like minerals, then?

157
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,320
Yeah, I kind of water.

158
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
I kind of hate mineral water. Yeah.

159
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,020
Minerals. Do you drink soda?

160
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,860
Don't drink soda.

161
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
What's your best?

162
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,240
What's your number one beverage?

163
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,500
Like if we if we looked at the after water

164
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,540
or maybe before water, if we looked at

165
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:33,340
If I'm at a restaurant that I've never been to or I go to often, most likely I would probably

166
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,260
just ask for like a lemonade.

167
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
Lemonade, hmm.

168
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:44,500
And at home I would just do like a sweet tea or just like anything with water.

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,740
Anything with water?

170
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Yeah.

171
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,900
Maybe like some minerals with water.

172
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,580
No, no minerals.

173
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,420
streets and tasties no disgusting rocks in my shit. Do you put chamoy in your water?

174
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,820
You ever done that? That is so so disgusting to my ears. I can't even parse I can't I can't

175
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,740
even look at you right now. You should put chamoy on your beer. Guys we're so weird.

176
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:15,420
Yeah chamoy is good on like I would imagine something more normal not so much like a like

177
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:21,420
a tasty taster. Well I like even more than chamoy on the rim I like those that really really

178
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,520
thick kind of chamoy that they put sometimes on like beers.

179
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
If you get like a like I had like a mango cart.

180
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,060
I think they're called chamoy at us.

181
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,260
A chamoy at a oh my God, it was so good.

182
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,660
You guys just stuff on it to my girlfriend.

183
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,700
Just loves telling me over and over.

184
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,960
She loves beating my head with with the fact that she keeps telling me

185
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,400
that you guys will just absolutely love Mexico City.

186
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,500
I would love that.

187
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,660
We're going to take him to the Pee and Poo Mart,

188
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,060
where you can just walk the street and you'll get the most insane drinks of all time.

189
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
It's called the Pee and Poo Mart?

190
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,340
Something like that.

191
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,900
Some Mexican-Spanish shit.

192
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,460
Yeah, it's like a lost in translation type of thing.

193
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
I see.

194
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,460
Anyways, speaking of Mexico.

195
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,540
That is why we are late this week.

196
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,140
We were celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month,

197
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,220
And Caleb and Rex have both prepared a poem to read to me for my heritage.

198
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,220
Yes I have, hold on.

199
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Yep, here we go man.

200
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,220
We're almost just loading up my award winning poem.

201
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,220
Rex has a brand new look.

202
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,220
I accidentally completely shaved off all my facial hair three days ago.

203
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,220
It was a complete accident. How did you do that by accident?

204
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,220
I was in a rush and I accidentally gave myself a complete uneven Hitler stache

205
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,220
and just said I need to just fully get rid of it all.

206
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Well, here's what I have to say about the beautiful nation of Mexico, the eagle and the snake.

207
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,220
This is a little poem by me called "The Woman from Mexico".

208
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
Okay.

209
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:18,220
There was a woman from Mexico who ate too much hot salsa in her burrito.

210
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:25,220
It colored her tresses flaming red and gave her too much energy, she said.

211
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,220
Now all she wants to do is the Fandango.

212
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,220
Whoa.

213
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,220
Yeah.

214
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
So Fandango...

215
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
I don't know what Fandango is.

216
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,220
It's a movie. You buy movie tickets on it.

217
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,220
So she's probably going to go see...

218
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,660
That was like a game, no?

219
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,500
That was like a game, a really boring game.

220
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,260
Fandango is a movie ticket website.

221
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,700
So this lady...

222
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,340
She drank too much sauce and she wanted to go to the movies.

223
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,500
And a burrito and it made her so hot that she had to go see a movie.

224
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,100
Because, oh, you know why?

225
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,420
Because a movie theater is always cold.

226
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,920
That's true.

227
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,540
Even in the middle of the summer, I'm bringing a hoodie to the movie theater, y'all.

228
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,080
True.

229
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
I like sitting in there.

230
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Cozyed up.

231
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
That is a...

232
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
It was so crazy going to Texas.

233
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I don't know if I talked about this.

234
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
But it was so awesomely cold

235
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
anywhere that was indoors.

236
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
And as soon as you stepped outside

237
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
you were like, "Oh, I am in hell."

238
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
But heaven is just...

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
You know, I just gotta park my car

240
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
in this awesome huge parking lot

241
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
and then just step right into heaven.

242
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
That's why everybody loves malls in the south.

243
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
in the south.

244
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Because in the south it gets so hot in the summers.

245
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,080
They're more like forums rather than malls.

246
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Yeah.

247
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,760
The little things where it's like the strip mall thing where it's just like different

248
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,280
stores and every one of them just look the same, every single one.

249
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,000
I have to go back to North Carolina this month because my brother got a speeding ticket in

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,860
a car that I thought I transferred the title to my stepdad but I guess I didn't.

251
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,260
So I have a court appearance at the end of the month in North Carolina.

252
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,180
So I have to like fly down to North Carolina and be like, I have to like transfer the title

253
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,260
and go to the DMV and say, "That ain't my car, dawg.

254
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,380
That's my bro's car."

255
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,060
But it's okay, I'm just gonna...

256
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
That's scary.

257
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,540
Well, it's not that scary.

258
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
It's just like annoying.

259
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,540
I'm typing a poem.

260
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Let him write it.

261
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Something similar happened to me recently.

262
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,540
My sister, she's just using a car that's sold to my name.

263
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Because I sold it to my dad.

264
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:00,040
And she got in an accident and all the insurance stuff is still technically under my name.

265
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,040
So I got an email like, "Oh, you rented this car."

266
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,540
And I was like, I thought I was getting my identity stolen.

267
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,540
But then I was like, "Oh, no. It's just a car thing."

268
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
Oh, yeah.

269
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,040
That shit just scares me. I don't want to be known by the government.

270
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Yeah, my mom is really pushing me to come down there.

271
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,080
But I guess technically I could just get it notarized

272
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,400
Of like oh, yeah, I don't own this car anymore. But here's why my here's how women and mom specifically are so tricky

273
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,940
She's saying oh you got to go to you have to come home and you need to

274
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:44,760
You need to switch this car title out and shit and specifically like the the court dates at like on the 5th of October

275
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,760
So you just should come like probably between September 30th and like October 7th like that'd be right

276
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,260
And I'm yeah. Yeah, sure and she's like, oh and now that I'm thinking about it

277
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,860
While you're in town, you could help me move into the new house. I'm moving into no

278
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,360
And so now I'm thinking

279
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,560
Doesn't even exist maybe there is no court date

280
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,720
Maybe my lying bitch mom is just trying to get me trying to not hire a mover

281
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,320
And she's trying to get me down there because she knows that I'm as strong as an ox

282
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,620
But that I screamed at her when she said that I was like you have to be fucking kidding me

283
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,800
This is so fucked up to make you do three of the worst things that a human has to do

284
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,600
DV

285
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,040
Yeah fly and hang out with your mom and also moving the for

286
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,680
Everything about it is terrible. Everything about it is actually like, this is one of the worst things.

287
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,720
That's like, that's literally the devil's whisper.

288
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
It's terrible.

289
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,400
You should take care of this task at the DMV and then spend the rest of the time with your mom.

290
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Helping your, not just with your mom, helping her move.

291
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,680
And you know that I'm gonna get all the heavy stuff.

292
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,600
And you're gonna be pissed and then you're not gonna be able to yell at her.

293
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,040
gonna be like I'll pay you in pizza. Bitch I can buy my own pizza. Shut the fuck up.

294
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm a rich and successful podcaster. I'm from New York City bitch. We're gonna pizza up

295
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,960
the ass. What do I need North Carolina ass pizza for? Here's the worst part dude. She

296
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:31,160
was like, she was like and I'll cover your flight. Up to $100. Up to $100? Bitch you

297
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
You got me on JetBlue!

298
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
That's what I'm saying, dude.

299
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
You got me on Spirit!

300
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Hell no!

301
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
You have to make something up.

302
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm about to have to pay to go help my fucking mom move.

303
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Oh my god.

304
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
She thought that she was like...

305
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
You have to make something up.

306
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
She thought she was so slick.

307
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
You cannot go through with this.

308
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
This is so fucked up.

309
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
She was like, "Yeah, my flight up to $100..."

310
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I check all the flights, $300, $400.

311
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
I'm paying to go...

312
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:59,560
I paid $300 because my brother got in an accident so that I can go help my mom move and eat

313
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,520
some batty Chick-fil-A that she orders at six in the morning

314
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
and then I wake up at noon

315
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,880
and it's been sitting on the counter for six hours.

316
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,760
- She doesn't even put it in the fridge.

317
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,600
- She doesn't.

318
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,440
- She doesn't even have an air fryer.

319
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,720
They don't have that technology.

320
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,120
- She does have actually an air fryer.

321
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,840
She has the same model as me.

322
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,960
'Cause she got it for me.

323
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,720
She bought five of them at Costco

324
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,760
in a five for two deal or something.

325
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,360
- That should not be a package they sell at Costco.

326
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,240
- That is a crazy package.

327
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,080
It was like a, it's like a Christmas.

328
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,360
It's like, if you just need one gift for a bunch of people.

329
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,200
- Yeah.

330
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,280
- Rex has like told us like pretty evil stuff,

331
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,440
pretty much evil stories about him and his parents,

332
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,940
his mom being the devil or whatever.

333
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,080
This is legitimately the worst thing

334
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,400
I've heard someone's parents do to them.

335
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,920
- Yeah, that is really bad.

336
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,800
- They threw Rex in a dungeon for a year

337
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,640
and it made him stronger and now here he is.

338
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,040
- This is the kind of shit that my mom does all the time.

339
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,080
I remember when I was like--

340
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,280
- Can you pull up the mic to like close to your face?

341
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,080
- When I was like 14 and my brother,

342
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,840
my younger brother was like 12,

343
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,080
I remember I got in huge trouble

344
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,440
because I had to write a paper

345
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,960
and I basically copied and pasted it

346
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,720
from like an article I found.

347
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,660
And my mom found out.

348
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,120
So she confronted me and I admitted to it.

349
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,440
I was like, yep, I stole it all.

350
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,300
She said, you're grounded for three months.

351
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,880
She said three months.

352
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,680
And then my brother walked down the stairs

353
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,040
and he had greasy hair.

354
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,520
And my mom said, when's the last time you took a shower?

355
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
And he said, I don't remember.

356
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,360
And she said, you are also grounded for three months.

357
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
She grounded both of us for three months,

358
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
me because I plagiarized an entire paper

359
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,080
and him because he could not remember the last time he showered.

360
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
(laughter)

361
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Dude, I got into the stupidest fucking Jewish argument with my mom

362
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
and it pissed me off so bad.

363
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
What are we going to make the weather today?

364
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Yeah, exactly.

365
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,080
So, like, when the movers were here moving my stuff in,

366
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,080
there was like a cool guy from like Brooklyn that was like moving my stuff.

367
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,820
and we were talking and like sometimes when I talk to someone with like a

368
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,360
really heavy Brooklyn accent, I'll like kind of slip into like having that

369
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,800
accent. Yeah. I've seen you do this. Mm-hmm. It's a code switch. He was like, "Oh, like are you like from

370
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:45,520
here?" Because my accent was so accurate and good and I was like, "No." When I was

371
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,520
growing up, when my mom would get angry at me, she would yell at me and when she

372
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,060
yells at me she loses the ability to talk with her normal accent from Brooklyn

373
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:59,120
yeah she just yells at me in a Brooklyn accent and she yelled at me all the time

374
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,920
because I was a naughty boy growing up and so I you know after taught like I

375
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,120
called her for a reason and then she talked about herself for an hour and

376
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,280
then for whatever whatever came over me in that moment I decided to tell that

377
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,440
story to her. She was like, "I didn't yell at you when you were growing up."

378
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,360
I was like, "Of course you did." "They just do that when they fly."

379
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,640
I was like, "Yeah, you did. And it's fine. I probably deserved it." She's like, "No, when you were

380
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,120
like four or six years old, I never yelled at you." And I was like, "It's so

381
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,960
obvious what I meant by when I was growing up." "When you were a single day old, I wasn't

382
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm yelling at you.

383
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,600
- And she was like, "Well, that's not what you said."

384
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,800
And I'm like, "To anyone I've ever said that to,

385
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,120
they completely understand what I mean by that."

386
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,960
- Yeah.

387
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,720
- But she was like, she argued with me

388
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,320
for 30 minutes about that.

389
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,480
(laughing)

390
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,040
- Dude, I've had this argument with my mom

391
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,000
probably every single Christmas.

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
Me and my brothers gang up on her

393
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,360
and then she starts crying and runs away.

394
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,080
(laughing)

395
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,640
- I wish I could make my mom cry.

396
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,440
I would feel bad, she's so stupid and pitiful.

397
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,600
- Yeah, my mom's gonna have my mom's.

398
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,800
It's pretty easy to punch that ticket with my mom though.

399
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,840
- The problem here is that Caleb has a gang.

400
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,000
He's a gang of brothers.

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,840
- That is true.

402
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,680
- It's just me versus the world.

403
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
- You're just a lone soldier, yeah.

404
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,040
You need us to come with you.

405
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
We'll just go over there.

406
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,440
- Yeah, you yelled at us too.

407
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,880
I remember you yelled at me, mom.

408
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,720
- Yeah, mom.

409
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,560
- Fucking bitch.

410
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,680
- No, but it will always be like me and my brothers

411
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,280
just sitting around laughing about something

412
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,420
from our childhood and then we'll be like,

413
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,580
oh yeah, and then mom got mad and my, or, or, or even like,

414
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,380
yeah, I remember mom cried and then my mom will walk in.

415
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,220
(laughing)

416
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,640
I didn't cry.

417
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,640
And then run away crying and lock herself in her room.

418
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,000
(laughing)

419
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
It's really awesome.

420
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,200
- That is fucking sick as fuck.

421
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,280
- You know, she's going through a lot.

422
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,360
She's, she's in her seventies or eighties or nineties

423
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,200
by now.

424
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,020
- She's moving.

425
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,860
- Yeah, who knows how fucking old that bitch is.

426
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,680
- She's trying to, she's trying to scam me.

427
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,920
So there's a lot going on.

428
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,300
Yeah, the eye.

429
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,800
Can I say my poem?

430
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,200
I would love to.

431
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Okay, why do you lose clues?

432
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,900
Steve towel?

433
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,200
That is a that's a that's a robe dude.

434
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,100
It's just oh my God.

435
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,700
It's a full Steve.

436
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,500
It is a full Steve.

437
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,000
All right, don't I wrote this in three minutes.

438
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,800
So you can't get mad about it.

439
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,900
I would never get mad at it.

440
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,000
So this is this is about Mexican heritage.

441
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,500
Mm-hmm.

442
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:45,000
There sat a man eating a mango and he saw a woman doing the tango.

443
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,900
That's Spanish.

444
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,700
He would have been hot.

445
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,600
Unfortunately, she was not.

446
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Wow.

447
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Oh.

448
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,500
She just had her quinceanera and her face was covered in red sauce

449
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
like marinara and also she was fat.

450
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,300
And she's 15.

451
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,540
(laughing)

452
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,820
- She's the fat 15 year old,

453
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,860
and she's being ogled by this Mexican man in a mango.

454
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,500
- Get mad at me, I told you I wrote it.

455
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,820
(laughing)

456
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,140
- Well, I have one about,

457
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,860
I have actually a Mexican poem as well.

458
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
- What the fuck is that?

459
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,980
- Here's my newer poem.

460
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,820
- Okay.

461
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,180
It's called "Trumpty Dumpty Built a Great Wall"

462
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,860
In my once great country, borderless criminals roam

463
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,940
Welcome to America, now go the fuck home

464
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,780
Two Bushes and Obama did nothing at all

465
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,060
Let's use our Trump card to build a great wall

466
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,780
Who will build this great wall?

467
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,180
Oh that's a no brainer

468
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,540
Thousands fill our jails with INS detainers

469
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,580
Heroin pot and cocaine arrive in bricks

470
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,900
Instead, let's have them throw mud in the mix.

471
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,020
Shady leftover cops from the failed war on drugs

472
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,260
reassigned to the border to supervise

473
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,620
these wall-building thugs.

474
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,020
America's being invaded.

475
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,900
Oh, wait.

476
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,780
America being invaded, we're under attack.

477
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,180
Illegal immigrants, a monkey on Statue of Liberty's back.

478
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,220
The Mexican side will be one big easel

479
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,260
for illegal gang members spray painting weasels.

480
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:39,000
to

481
00:23:39,000 --> 00:24:04,660
the

482
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,420
Wait, what?

483
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,900
By making illegal immigrants enemies of the state.

484
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Right.

485
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,100
So, that was my other poem that I wrote.

486
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:22,020
Is the "learn to masturbate because Mexicans have a hundred kids" is that the bit there?

487
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,860
Wait, I'm looking through this guy's poems.

488
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,340
This is Joe in the Box.

489
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,460
I don't know if we did this guy when we did our Poetry episode, but almost all of his things

490
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,360
Is there the cartel on the boat disabling

491
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,460
m'lady colorblindness?

492
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,580
What?

493
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,220
Malady.

494
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,980
Poets lives-- oh, you're right.

495
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,580
Malady.

496
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,980
Poets lives matter.

497
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,900
Oh my god.

498
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,140
That kind of sounds awesome.

499
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,380
Podcasters lives matter.

500
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,220
Coronavirus, parentheses scary.

501
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,500
I guess I've never given the thought,

502
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,500
but I guess they were completely exist racist poets

503
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,340
in these times.

504
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,660
- Even in these perfectly woke times?

505
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,860
- Yeah.

506
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,220
I would think that poem was like,

507
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,060
just like such an inherently female coded,

508
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,660
woke coded type of thing.

509
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,940
- And you don't think that women can be racist.

510
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,780
- Yup.

511
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,780
- The students never met a fricking white woman.

512
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,220
- Yeah, a Karen.

513
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,900
- Yeah, I met a Karen.

514
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,060
- Name one Karen you met.

515
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Name a name.

516
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,940
- Wait, hang on, I got something to say about Karens.

517
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,780
- Pop off.

518
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,660
- Listen up Karens.

519
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,940
Actually, listen up the world.

520
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,780
- Okay.

521
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,700
- I think we are over labeling people as Karens.

522
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,660
I think not every person having a meltdown is a Karen

523
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,880
and not every meltdown must be recorded.

524
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,500
- I think almost no meltdowns should be recorded

525
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,780
in all honesty.

526
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,780
It's usually recording somebody having a really awful moment.

527
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,420
that you're saying that because that is the now consensus take on that.

528
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,820
What?

529
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,420
That like, oh, they're just having a bad day.

530
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,140
Well, I'm not sitting down on a.

531
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,340
I mean, no, I'm not.

532
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,180
You are a mean Internet guy, though.

533
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,900
No, I don't.

534
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,980
You have a different brain than me and Juvia.

535
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,620
Yeah, I don't.

536
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,220
I don't think.

537
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,580
I don't have a lot of misery in a way that I don't find myself capable of.

538
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,580
OK, I don't enjoy their misery.

539
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,140
I never have.

540
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,140
You have.

541
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,980
There was a moment where people were anti-Karen and then there was a Karen revamption arc.

542
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:43,140
It all is from the video of the lady where she's just recording her and she like crouches down and

543
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,820
tries to like hide and like disappear. That is like this lady seriously has something very very

544
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:58,340
wrong with her. Yeah it has come around. But hey man. No one is is like oh yeah. The first Karen

545
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:13,620
and

546
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,920
was having it some kind of BPD powered break.

547
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
- Yup.

548
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,260
- Some synapse in his brain was not firing

549
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,940
in the right order and he just flipped through

550
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,260
the dictionary in his brain and just put his finger

551
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,060
on a random word and it was unlucky.

552
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,980
But it was a Karen video essentially

553
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,100
and therefore I'm against that video.

554
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,420
- Well I think that the Karen videos like

555
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,500
kinda came and went with COVID,

556
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,900
like all the COVID trends as well.

557
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,500
Because people pretended to care about the well-being of their employees.

558
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,700
Now I feel like search Karen videos from this week,

559
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,500
a lot of them are just people being insane at Walmart

560
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,100
and then the Chinese AI cotton farm generated voice,

561
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,500
like, this male racist Karen at Walmart

562
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,900
wouldn't let this man buy his items.

563
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,700
And then the video plays and it's just the guy being like,

564
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:21,300
I want to buy essentially like a thousand of this one item at the at the fucking at the fucking checkout of the self checkout when it's you can't do that.

565
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,540
And the guy's like, no, I can't leave.

566
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,100
You can buy a thousand paper plates at the self checkout.

567
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
It's not a problem.

568
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,060
It is a thousand bigger things that you are.

569
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,500
OK, you are being a Karen now.

570
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,660
You are being a Karen.

571
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,940
You're being an actual Karen.

572
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,500
I'm going to do a 360 degree turn and you're Karen now.

573
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,100
First of all, I have never complained about anything, ever.

574
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,060
Because I'm overly self-conscious about stereotypes.

575
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:51,220
And you bow to any sushi place that you've ever come across.

576
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,980
Overly self-conscious about stereotypes.

577
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:03,420
Full waist bow at the bowling alley because the guy's Filipino.

578
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,980
That's very funny you guys. I'm talking about one specific set of stereotypes.

579
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,580
Is that why you like gambling? Because you're the one Jewish guy who enjoys throwing his money away?

580
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:21,500
You don't even like it. It pains you so much, but you get this amazing rush of feeling like

581
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,900
you're not Jewish for one second. Have you ever seen how excited I get when I get the little

582
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,780
the rake back and it's like three pennies.

583
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,860
And I'm like, "Ooh!"

584
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,900
(laughing)

585
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
- That's when you get the cut of that,

586
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,820
the promotional cut of the house edge.

587
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,580
That is when it slips through for one second.

588
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,300
The veil is just lifted.

589
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,140
- Oh, $2.

590
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,580
What am I supposed to do with $4?

591
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,500
- Go ahead and transfer this one to the bank.

592
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,380
- That bonus is, those cuts that you get

593
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,420
from like the online banks have got to be like way worse

594
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,700
than you get at like real casinos, rather.

595
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,540
Online casinos.

596
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,040
You don't get like a break back at the casino.

597
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,540
I know that you don't, but when you're a person that goes there.

598
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:11,040
Yeah, you get drinks.

599
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:21,540
I feel like any of that is way more tangible than the 20 bucks that we have gotten.

600
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:29,020
If you go to Atlantic City or Las Vegas for like a full weekend and you like talk to one of the pit bosses

601
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:35,300
And like introduce yourself to like somebody and like make some friends. They will comp a hotel room. They'll comp your meals

602
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,340
They will comp at anything that you need to keep you gambling even if you're not gambling that much

603
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,540
Yeah, I think it's like maybe it's more like a social thing like yeah, I'm the only thing

604
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,940
It's just like a just a machine me like yeah, you get just gamble this much and we'll give you like five bucks

605
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,140
And it's like really not something that you can even like look look towards

606
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,500
They have to make it up, but real casinos suck

607
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,940
Real casinos are under attack as we speak by Vegas

608
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,540
I just was reading about this the MGM has been completely hacked

609
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:16,020
They're signing people in on a clipboard like it's Hurricane Katrina, and they're sitting in a giant football stadium guys

610
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,500
We need to go to MGM and we need to save them you need to get down there and save them

611
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:38,500
to

612
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,000
- Your black hat hacker brain probably would think to do that.

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
- I think that's your affiliates.

614
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,500
- And then you see a little kid pointing at it and crying because they've never seen a

615
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,840
human's asshole before, and you go, "Look at this Karen, I'm gonna record this."

616
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,140
- That is the Karen moment.

617
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,700
- It should be like, if you're inside that dome right now, it should be like you're in

618
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,500
the Matrix, and it should be all of the BME Pain Olympics videos.

619
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,660
With a thousand screens surrounding you.

620
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
- Big white room.

621
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,700
- What is the youngest age that a person could be labeled as a Karen?

622
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
Probably one years old.

623
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Probably one second old.

624
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
You know, you cannot.

625
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,700
As long as it takes to grow your hair to your shoulder length

626
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
from the day that you're born.

627
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Probably two years.

628
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
I think at least

629
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
around 30.

630
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
No. 30?

631
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,700
No. Yeah.

632
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,700
You cannot be a teenage or

633
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
infant aged Karen.

634
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Karen is a mindset.

635
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,700
It has nothing to do with age.

636
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,540
I

637
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:44,580
Know if you're if you're a fucking 20 years old and annoying at like a restaurant that is Karen behavior

638
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,520
That is true. I knew kids growing up who were very rude at restaurants. Yeah

639
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Her and my grandpa have a similar

640
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,700
That's why I'm very I'm like out of my way nice to a point that

641
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:15,940
Is annoying to my wife to like waiters and stuff. Yeah, and I feel guilty. I'll like I

642
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,260
Don't know. I I try to like clean the tables before I leave and

643
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,580
She's like, can we leave?

644
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,420
You actually left a problem. I'm mad at her because she dropped a crumb on the table at the restaurant

645
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,960
Well, I still have to do the dishes.

646
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,660
Oh, yeah, exactly.

647
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,760
But so the reason where this comes from is apparently my mom,

648
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,460
like a couple of months ago, she was at dinner with my brother

649
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:44,860
and he said that she actually ordered a piece of salmon medium rare.

650
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,820
Mm hmm. Oh, they were like,

651
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,660
you say medium rare.

652
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,220
So, yeah, medium rare.

653
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,960
They're like, we can't.

654
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,820
It's not like sushi grade salmon.

655
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,320
It's like a grilled salmon.

656
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,520
We can't just undercook the salmon.

657
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,680
It's illegal.

658
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,080
And my mom freaked out.

659
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,160
- That's so funny.

660
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,520
- I make the salmon medium rare at home all the time.

661
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,840
It's fine.

662
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Please, I'll give you an extra $10

663
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,200
if you just undercook it.

664
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,840
- Actual Karen moment.

665
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,000
- Actual Karen moment.

666
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,920
She got mad at this waiter

667
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,840
because he wouldn't put in an illegal order

668
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,600
for an undercooked fish.

669
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
So awesome.

670
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Alright, show me the crushing.

671
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,680
For those listening on audio, Rex has a can crusher that he's-

672
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,680
For those listening on audio, just, just listen up.

673
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Just listen.

674
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,680
[loud, high-pitched screeching]

675
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Oh my god! That is so loud!

676
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
[high-pitched screeching]

677
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Fuck me, the levels on this fucking episode are gonna be so fucked.

678
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Wow.

679
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Look at that. Oh!

680
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Oh, and he still made a mess.

681
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Wow.

682
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,120
So as soon as, okay, so this is how this went down.

683
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,800
As soon as last week's episode ended and we did, we did for a second week in a row,

684
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,440
we did a, what, let's see, Freck's disgusting can addled desk.

685
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,080
He immediately messages me a minute after we're done recording.

686
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,520
Oh my God, I am going to order a, a can crusher on Amazon.

687
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,240
And I'm going to, you said while you were speaking and I was like, that is so stupid,

688
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,320
but that would be so funny.

689
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,560
And now he's actually done it, and it's so funny,

690
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,360
but it is so loud and annoying that I hope he uses--

691
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,080
- That is one of the last things I've ever heard.

692
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
- I'm gonna show this.

693
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,520
(boxes clattering)

694
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,400
- Oh, nice, you've been-- - Whoa.

695
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,680
- The desk is clear, huh?

696
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,680
- I did it like two days ago. - Show me, show me.

697
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,760
- So-- - For the third week in a row.

698
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,120
Oh, eh. - Still four.

699
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,800
- It's manageable. - But you, oh, okay, six.

700
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
- Yeah, there's a few. - All right, come on, bitch.

701
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
And he has a mousepad!

702
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,160
I do have a mousepad.

703
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,440
Wait, you bust up.

704
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,560
You completely bust up.

705
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,240
Everyone was bullying me for not having a mousepad.

706
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,480
That's because it was crazy, man.

707
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,200
Everyone was like, "The cans are fine.

708
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,040
That's normal.

709
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,800
The mousepad is not."

710
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,000
Who told you the cans were normal?

711
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,120
There was a comment on the beers we drank.

712
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,720
There was a single one comment.

713
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,800
Everybody said the cans are normal.

714
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
Everyone was saying--

715
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,500
Okay, so this is the problem.

716
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,200
Everyone was saying it, no one was disagreeing.

717
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,960
I know, I love and thank everyone who comments on the episodes, but if you're just, you know,

718
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,440
"Oh, I like Rex, I like when he does this."

719
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,480
Don't, if you're even just the only person, don't do that.

720
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Don't support him.

721
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,320
Don't support him because he'll just do shit like this.

722
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,080
I'm seeing, I'm seeing a return.

723
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,080
So Chib says, "Cans normal, no mousepad, friggin psycho."

724
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,040
but then Smiler responds, "Two or three cans is fine.

725
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,460
27 is fucking crazy."

726
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,880
(laughing)

727
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,520
- So it was really-- - Clearly they don't drink

728
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,880
enough cans of liquid on a daily basis.

729
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,920
- Dude, I gotta tell you,

730
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,080
and I mean, I have my own little can collection right now,

731
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,080
I hate to say it, but it's not on my desk.

732
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,920
- Where is it?

733
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,760
- It's right here.

734
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,840
- Yup. - Oh.

735
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,340
I got a couple of cans right there.

736
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,880
- Well, I think that's different.

737
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,680
You have a can ledge.

738
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,520
You have a ledge.

739
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,340
- I have a can ledge.

740
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,180
It's not on my desk.

741
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,000
- Ledge made for cans.

742
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,600
- Okay, that's because Caleb has a desk

743
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,440
that is maybe a third the size of me.

744
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,200
- No, I could fit cans in the back.

745
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,040
- I don't know if you have a can ledge.

746
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,180
- I will say, after we record this,

747
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,080
two of these were from last night,

748
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,200
and then two of these,

749
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,320
or three of these are from last night,

750
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,640
one of these is from tonight.

751
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,520
After I record this, these are all going away.

752
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,120
There is no way that it will get worse.

753
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,680
This is the worst it's ever been, I think.

754
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,800
- Whoa.

755
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
- Yeah.

756
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,920
- Fine.

757
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,840
Fine, let's fix it.

758
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,840
- No, he's gonna, how do I mute you?

759
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,800
- Why did I do that?

760
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,760
- How do I mute you?

761
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,560
- No, the cancel the desk.

762
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,480
No.

763
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,520
- Go ahead, let's fix it.

764
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Come on, no, no, no.

765
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,200
- I'm gonna-- - This is what

766
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,020
you're talking about.

767
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,480
- I'm gonna put your volume at like minus 17.

768
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,320
- You're being difficult.

769
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,840
You're being difficult right now.

770
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,680
Oh my God.

771
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,520
(laughing)

772
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,320
This is so awful.

773
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,240
(laughing)

774
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
- Okay, okay, you have to stop.

775
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,560
- That's the last one.

776
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,240
- You actually have to stop.

777
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,600
- And you love it too.

778
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,880
You love it so much.

779
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,000
- Why can you buy this?

780
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,080
Why can someone just buy this?

781
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
What do you buy this at?

782
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,440
- Yeah, I bought this on Amazon.

783
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,240
- So. - He's ashamed.

784
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,280
He's ashamed.

785
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,080
- How much? - The soul of shame.

786
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,760
- It was $80.

787
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,600
- Oh my God.

788
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,160
- It was completely worth it.

789
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,000
It was $80.

790
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
- Yeah, it was worth it.

791
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,520
- I get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

792
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,360
It's fun.

793
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,320
Are you gonna bring it with you as a party trick now to every single party?

794
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,920
It needs to be plugged into a wall, but yes, I will do that.

795
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
That is actually a fucking great idea.

796
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
They make it over to people's houses.

797
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,920
They make a pneumatic one that's air-powered, that's a little less expensive, but you need a compressor.

798
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,420
Oh man, you don't wanna get... that's way worse.

799
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,420
I think that would be so dangerous now.

800
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,420
A compressor?

801
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,420
Yeah, I don't know.

802
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,500
it's going to be a lot louder.

803
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,260
That would have been a much, much worse experience.

804
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,780
There's three tiers of can crusher.

805
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,380
There's mounted on the wall, lever activated.

806
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,380
I love those.

807
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,260
$20.

808
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,460
I really like those though.

809
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,020
Those are great.

810
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:34,660
If you have a porch, there's like $60, but you need an air compressor pneumatic.

811
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,660
And there is one single electric can crusher.

812
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,020
And you got it.

813
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,700
And I got a premium tier.

814
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,360
- We could also, I mean, you could get a hydraulic press.

815
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,320
- I mean, that's basically what it is.

816
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,340
- But like a really,

817
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,580
- Those are literally a thousand dollars.

818
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,380
- I think they're way more than a thousand dollars.

819
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,660
I think you have to have room for it basically to.

820
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,340
- What kind of pressures or like forces is it rated for?

821
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,220
- That one?

822
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,060
- Yeah, just.

823
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,880
- I have no clue.

824
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,720
- What's the strongest thing?

825
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,420
- Can we get the world's strongest can?

826
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,640
- No, can you go, do you have any food in your house?

827
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,860
- No. - Oh.

828
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,100
He's not right now.

829
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,400
Actually, no, I believe that he doesn't have fruit in his house.

830
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah, there's no fruit.

831
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,060
It's been eaten.

832
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,900
Oh, yeah.

833
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,300
There's no fresh fruit.

834
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,900
Next time you go to the grocery store,

835
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,660
can you grab like an apple and put it in it

836
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
and just see what it has?

837
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,500
No, we do grapes and then like an apple.

838
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,420
It doesn't go low enough to do grapes.

839
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,180
Apple, though.

840
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,980
I really like those hydraulic press videos,

841
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,460
but I always do think that I would be--

842
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,700
If I owned one of those, I'd be fucking terrified of it.

843
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,080
- To put your hand in there?

844
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,500
- No, 'cause they put like anything in there

845
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,340
and then it just shatters into a million pieces

846
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,300
and shoots at the speed of light in every direction.

847
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,140
- I think by the point where you--

848
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,220
- Yeah, that's why you just do the cans.

849
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,220
- I think by the point where you own

850
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,400
a whole ass hydraulic press,

851
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,740
you're like kind of way past like worrying about anything.

852
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,780
- You're over the baby fear of it?

853
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,620
Yeah, I guess maybe.

854
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,440
- Yeah.

855
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,380
- I do think that this is a really awesome party trick.

856
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,180
Now, I'm thinking about it more and more.

857
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,180
I think this will be the complete legend of the party.

858
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,780
- It is very fun when you've got people over

859
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,700
and you're hanging out, you're drinking beer,

860
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,420
and you go, "Hey, watch this."

861
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,980
And you pull it out from behind the couch.

862
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,820
- And you crush a bottle.

863
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,260
- Everyone gathers around and you crush a can.

864
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,820
- Speaking of glass bottle, glass goes everywhere.

865
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,620
- Why has there been no invite to your house yet?

866
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,500
- 'Cause it's nasty right now.

867
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,020
Also, there's two people staying over.

868
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,100
I mean, yeah, I'll have you over.

869
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,460
- I wanna see your kitchen.

870
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,380
I just set up a pots and pans rack yesterday. Oh

871
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,260
And where did you choose to place this?

872
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,460
on the wall

873
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,340
Nice, you guys have an island? No. Well, we we built

874
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,500
Like it Brian's place like one of those. Oh, yeah

875
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,380
What's it like a little table on road?

876
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,420
Yeah wheels just went crazy

877
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,500
It's not on wheels it is just a regular table is it on the heart

878
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
It's a what

879
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,900
Do you have a bar cart we do have a bar stocked with every kind of alcohol that a guy like you could ever imagine

880
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:17,300
No, it just has cables in it and it smells like curry

881
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,920
I just smell like curry. That is a great question spill the uber eats on it or something. Oh

882
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,460
No, I want curry so bad. There's a Nepal place near me. That's really good

883
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,300
Yeah, it's like no no Indian food near me really

884
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:40,780
Which sucks. Yeah, the Nepalese place is good. Yeah, I'll have you over have some some jerk food some Nepalese food

885
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,740
Gamble on my base and we got into

886
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:52,200
Jamaican food and I'm thinking it's one of my new favorites. It's a the place sells like freshly made like in-house

887
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,000
Jamaican beef patties with like

888
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,020
every different type of

889
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,020
Filling what kind of footage Jamaican?

890
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,660
It's like jerk chicken, oxtail, which is basically like a slow cooked beef thing.

891
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,660
Rice and peas.

892
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,660
Everything has like kind of a, yeah, plantains.

893
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,660
Everything has kind of a like citrusy flavor to it.

894
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,660
It's like a, I don't know, it's really good.

895
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:27,660
I think like every Central American country's cuisine has like plantains in it.

896
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,060
Do you guys have plantains in Mexico or not really?

897
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,060
Yeah, like in the south.

898
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,560
You do?

899
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,360
Yeah, like Veracruz.

900
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,060
Mmm, I love plantains.

901
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,860
I don't like them at all.

902
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,360
You don't like sweet ones?

903
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,560
No, I don't like plantains.

904
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,560
What about green ones?

905
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,260
Nope, I like regular-ass bananas.

906
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,260
But green plantains are basically potatoes, man.

907
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,260
I don't like them.

908
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:57,060
Well, I think, was it you that gave me some plantain chips?

909
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,440
I think I like that.

910
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,560
Yeah, those are like the good.

911
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,640
That's like the most I've ever liked any plantain based stuff.

912
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,060
They're basically just like potato chips.

913
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,440
And but they have like just a little they're a little more like starchy.

914
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,740
Like you need like a glass of water to actually eat them.

915
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,940
Yeah.

916
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,440
Yeah, I don't know.

917
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,580
Not for me.

918
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,160
I'm still there's a

919
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,000
like Jamaican pizza shop that's

920
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,580
Instagram famous.

921
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,580
I have never been because there is literally a 40 person line at all times.

922
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,280
Really? To go there.

923
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,860
And you cannot order ahead.

924
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,700
You have to stand in line.

925
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,580
Oh, that's good.

926
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,040
That means it's really good. They sell a jerk chicken pizza.

927
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,420
They sell a chicken and French toast pizza.

928
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,420
They sell a chicken and waffle pizza.

929
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,500
They sell a jerk chicken black truffle Alfredo pizza.

930
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,040
Wait, I want to.

931
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,340
Can you send me a picture of this chicken and waffle pizza?

932
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,300
I want to I want to see this.

933
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,720
I it's just listed on their menu.

934
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,760
Let me see.

935
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,180
This is one of those things where someone just says like a way I want to go here.

936
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,620
I'm looking at a picture it.

937
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,820
I'm looking at the menu. I want to go here.

938
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,660
Yeah, I need to.

939
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,120
I need to get a crew together to stand in line for an hour with me.

940
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,620
Let's fucking go, man.

941
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,120
Oh, my God. The prices are actually insanely reasonable, too.

942
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,420
No, that's for one slice.

943
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,720
How much is my slice? What?

944
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,260
It's like $12 for a slice of pizza.

945
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,380
For the jerk chicken black truffle Alfredo, it's $11.96 for a slice.

946
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,580
That shit has got to be so good.

947
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,180
12 for a pizza? For a slice of pizza?

948
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,780
I bet it's good, man. Wait, I'm gonna look up the reviews.

949
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,280
It's gonna be so good and the slices have to be so big that it's almost like half a pizza.

950
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,780
There's no way.

951
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,880
Let's look at the reviews here.

952
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,280
Guys, four and a half stars on Google.

953
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,380
1,200 Google reviews.

954
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,480
Yeah.

955
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,180
Wait.

956
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,180
This is gonna be amazing.

957
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,740
We're going here.

958
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,140
To support black owned was great.

959
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,100
They are indeed black owned.

960
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,100
You're kidding.

961
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,100
I know.

962
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Imagine a white guy selling an oxtail pizza.

963
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:12,220
That'd be way, that'd be so bad.

964
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,540
I don't think that would go over very well at all.

965
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:21,060
If there's a white guy who made a pizza restaurant that's all Jamaican food.

966
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,420
I don't think a 4.5, like impresses me.

967
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,140
- 4.5 with 1,200 reviews is really good.

968
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,540
- Maybe the 1,200 reviews would like sway me over,

969
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,740
but I was thinking about this yesterday.

970
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,800
I think for me to think that the product is good,

971
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,540
it has to be like 4.6, 4.7.

972
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,320
4.8 is probably perfect.

973
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,620
If it has five, like a five or a 4.9,

974
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,700
it probably has like two or three reviews.

975
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:55,140
It's on New York Times Cooking from this year, and here's the title of their video.

976
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,620
There are over 8,000 pizzerias in NYC.

977
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,740
So how did a Brooklyn pizza shop with no deliveries become a celebrity destination?

978
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,740
They took notes from the sneaker world.

979
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:14,540
Watch to find out why Lil Yachty, Odell McIntyre, Sean Kingston, and Rich Hoving Kwan are lining

980
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,820
up for Oxtail Pizza.

981
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:22,780
I did see that little Yachty was there. I did just see that photo or that video of him.

982
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,140
That is pretty awesome.

983
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,140
They can say that.

984
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,220
Brilliant idea. Drop pizza like sneakers.

985
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,220
Jesus Christ.

986
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:41,220
I will say, there's just a little preview of what you'll see next week. I bought glasses

987
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:48,180
finally. Uh-huh. And I was at this glasses store in Soho and this woman like runs in

988
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,260
from there's like a bunch of people like down the street when I went in and I was

989
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,100
like huh I wonder what that's about and like the street was closed off like the

990
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,640
cops were there so I figured it was just like you know some shit and it was like

991
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,980
this woman like runs in like halfway through and it's like a takeoff is down

992
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,860
the street throwing 100s on the sidewalk.

993
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,860
Whoa!

994
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,860
Did you grab one?

995
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,860
Did you get one?

996
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,860
No.

997
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,860
Fuck!

998
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,580
It was literally, it was like a Kaisenat like, like street riot.

999
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:25,580
Oh, well he's, he, he was on Kaisenat's stream actually.

1000
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,580
Yeah.

1001
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,580
So...

1002
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,580
So you look foolish now.

1003
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,580
For not knowing your culture.

1004
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,580
Why do I look foolish?

1005
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,380
Why do I look foolish for saying that?

1006
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,820
What did I say that was weird?

1007
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,460
Tell me what I did wrong.

1008
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,460
So many things.

1009
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,460
Tell me what I did wrong.

1010
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,460
You're fine.

1011
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
Do I sound like a robot?

1012
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
You sound like a normal.

1013
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,460
Am I frozen?

1014
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,460
No, you are normal.

1015
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,460
You guys can see me moving left to right right now?

1016
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,460
Can you hear us?

1017
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,460
No, I can hear you.

1018
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,460
Yeah, but you sound like a jiggly robot.

1019
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,460
No, but that's fine.

1020
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,460
A jiggly robot?

1021
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,460
Yeah, see, you both sound auto-tuned to me.

1022
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,460
But that's okay.

1023
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,460
This is a really good website that we use.

1024
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,140
that's fine. A jiggly robot.

1025
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,860
Yeah, I see you both sound auto-tuned to me, but that's okay.

1026
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,780
This is a really good website that we use.

1027
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,540
Yeah. I'm using it for another a hundred episodes.

1028
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,820
Rex, do you want to go on an Atlantic city trip soon?

1029
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,420
I would love to.

1030
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,700
I thought you hated Atlantic city. I caught you.

1031
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,700
Here's the thing. Do I want to go to a,

1032
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,820
do I find a real life casino worse than online gambling?

1033
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,720
Without a doubt.

1034
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,120
Would I give up the opportunity to go to a casino with my

1035
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,620
friends?

1036
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,620
Of course not.

1037
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,720
Why would I do that?

1038
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,520
Would be foolish.

1039
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,120
I think as enjoyable as it was to go hang out with over their

1040
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,120
friends to another destination.

1041
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,420
Let's do like a little road trip thing.

1042
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,920
I do think that we somehow like just cooked the perfectly

1043
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,120
worse vacation day of all time.

1044
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,720
when we went to Titanic City.

1045
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,320
- We were all sick and hungover.

1046
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,920
- We were all so sick, hungover.

1047
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,320
We went out so early.

1048
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,000
- I don't remember that.

1049
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
- We went out so early.

1050
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,320
The vibes were so crazy the entire way there.

1051
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,480
You called me a child for my McDonald's order.

1052
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,320
- That is true.

1053
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,160
- Wow, that's tough.

1054
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,400
(laughing)

1055
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,240
What did you order?

1056
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,560
- I think just like a thing.

1057
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,440
I think you made fun of me because I had the OJ.

1058
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,280
- Yeah, you got orange juice.

1059
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,280
Oh, you got orange juice. Yeah. Yeah.

1060
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,280
You're hung over, you get a coffee.

1061
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,580
It was it was also like so

1062
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:36,080
cold and just so I don't know.

1063
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,340
It was just like really bad vibes.

1064
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,640
And we ate me.

1065
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,740
We ended up making Rex eat like a like a poop patty at the end of the.

1066
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,340
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:50,240
But I will not have to do that anymore because I eat now.

1068
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,920
Now you will eat a birria taco at Johnny also at Johnny Rockets.

1069
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,320
Yay.

1070
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,720
Actually, there's a really good sandwich place in Atlantic City

1071
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,620
that called like White House subs.

1072
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,920
I think we'll go back there.

1073
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,520
That sounds dope.

1074
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,420
Can you take a train to Atlantic City?

1075
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,820
I don't believe so.

1076
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,920
I think you they have like buses, but really we should just drive.

1077
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,220
Yeah, but we should not do a day trip.

1078
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,720
We should go for like a weekend.

1079
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,420
We're like two days or something because the hotels are pretty cheap.

1080
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,660
And Harris is like nice.

1081
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,300
And we get swimming a pool.

1082
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,560
And into a pool.

1083
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,560
Yeah, that's I love hotel pool.

1084
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,300
I love hotels.

1085
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,260
I mean, I am 100% convinced I love hotels.

1086
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,620
I never want to stay in a disgusting Airbnb ever again.

1087
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,000
Not that I could anymore in New York City.

1088
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,320
Yeah, I just found we find that out from Brian that

1089
00:51:48,320 --> 00:52:00,020
I told I got I found that out through a thing of video like somewhere I found out that they had that I told brain that New York is is deleting all airbnb's or some shit.

1090
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:08,860
They just made like some really strict rules yes like you need to be living in there with them you need to like.

1091
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:13,700
You can only have like two people in airbnb at a time.

1092
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,860
It's kind of funny because Airbnb didn't update a month or two ago.

1093
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:30,360
We're bringing back the, we know that everyone hates Airbnb now, so we're bringing back the classic old field of Airbnb a couple years ago, where it's actually someone's house.

1094
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:38,360
You have to go into this mode and you'll actually just stay at someone's room and they'll be there and you can talk to them and share their house.

1095
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,680
And then like a month later, New York's like,

1096
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,960
yeah, you can't be like a slumlord anymore.

1097
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,760
Like we have suffered a couple times.

1098
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,340
Now you actually have to live there.

1099
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,360
- There is, it sucks 'cause I'm in like the one neighborhood

1100
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,600
in New York where there's actually no hotels.

1101
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,920
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1102
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,960
- There's no fucking hotels.

1103
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,720
Oh wait, there's a red carpet in here?

1104
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,840
Nevermind guys, there's a red carpet in a two-star hotel.

1105
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,840
Guys, this is the place to be.

1106
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:15,960
$150 a night for what looks like the worst hotel room you could imagine.

1107
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,520
This is like a sex hotel. This is like one that you go to to have sex.

1108
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,280
Yeah, it's gonna be your only option guys.

1109
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:30,040
I will simply stay at one of my friends' apartments.

1110
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,000
Just go stay in Manhattan at the Trump Tower.

1111
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,800
I'm not gonna do that. I almost did that.

1112
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:44,280
I almost did that, when I came back from New York last time, I saw a...

1113
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,280
Okay.

1114
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:51,280
So, Rex has linked us a YouTube video of Jadakiss enjoys ordering pizza with just the crust.

1115
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
Just the crust?

1116
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,280
It's a TMC video from four years ago.

1117
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Oh my god!

1118
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Wait, I have to show this on video.

1119
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,280
What the fuck?

1120
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,160
I'm not doing this in post. I'm doing this on right now

1121
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,480
That's one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life maybe

1122
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,600
I

1123
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,280
Forgot what I was saying this is do you know what I think I

1124
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,760
Think New York pizza is the best piece in the world

1125
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,800
Chicago in the Libby Dam those are the only

1126
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,680
like

1127
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:47,800
and

1128
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,760
under construction right now so I have not been able to eat there in months

1129
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:59,120
really so sad I'm almost going to cry it really is making me so fucked up man I

1130
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,160
don't want to show it's just the into the video so people can actually see this

1131
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:12,360
this horrible pizza it's a pizza with just the crust yeah it is well not just

1132
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,640
There's that little bit of edge around that constitutes some middle

1133
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,840
It looks like the stay from logo

1134
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:26,920
Three slices of the middle as well. I think that's sauce

1135
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,380
Three sorry not three slices three things of

1136
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,600
Sauce I thought it was pepperonis when I first saw it though. Okay, so completely drunk

1137
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,600
So funny.

1138
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,320
I actually have had one and a half and I'm

1139
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,720
looking at some interesting work stuff that just came across my

1140
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,900
my your desk desk here.

1141
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,520
Yeah. Says.

1142
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,480
Yeah, I mean, this is a tundra's fortune puts a lot of its eggs in one basket,

1143
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,900
which can be a good or bad thing, depending on the outcome.

1144
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,080
Six point five fair from big wind boards on a pragmatic play.

1145
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,820
So this is this is the kind of work that it's

1146
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,380
I mean, hot off the presses right in front of me.

1147
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,480
Cash chips got a seven.

1148
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,280
Infected wild got a seven.

1149
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,040
I mean, we know what we're doing after this.

1150
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,520
I got to make myself a steak sandwich and a salad.

1151
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,020
And then all bets.

1152
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,580
Talk about how big wind boards was in hot water.

1153
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,020
Big wind boards is being targeted in a lawsuit.

1154
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,040
I think we did talk about this.

1155
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,720
They're trying to shut down the only honest journalistic.

1156
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,240
I don't think it's honest.

1157
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,440
I don't think I completely think it's not honest.

1158
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,220
You don't know what you're talking about.

1159
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:43,060
Dude, Big Ben will be like, oh yeah, this one is like it's 9.8 rated.

1160
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,860
You'll get your money back guaranteed, my friend.

1161
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,260
And you will play the demo.

1162
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,120
That's not what they would say.

1163
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,160
You'll play the demo.

1164
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,760
You'll play the demo and in five spins.

1165
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,700
Oh, my God.

1166
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,400
You got the you got the bonus.

1167
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,900
They would never be so.

1168
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,400
That's not the case.

1169
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,800
What are you even talking about?

1170
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,640
So crazily.

1171
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,400
Have you ever, do you even know

1172
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,900
The first thing about big wind board.

1173
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,140
The first thing big wind board says is, yeah, I never win.

1174
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,000
I never win when I gamble.

1175
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,540
And you know what?

1176
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,400
I believe him.

1177
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,440
Is it because he's real guy?

1178
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,340
I think there's a team, but there is one guy that runs the YouTube

1179
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,500
and he responds to people being like, this is fake.

1180
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,740
No one has ever won this.

1181
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,700
And he goes, Yeah, you're right. Yeah.

1182
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,400
Or he'll bitch about streamers.

1183
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,160
We should have him on.

1184
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,200
Speaking of journalists.

1185
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,040
What is streamers?

1186
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,840
Yeah, he hates gambling streamers.

1187
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,140
How come?

1188
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,040
Yeah, because he does all these exposés about how it's fake money

1189
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,500
and how they're getting paid by the casino, which one of the best things

1190
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,200
is that a lot of these guys have like these on their websites

1191
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,860
have like this tab called like verify or something.

1192
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,000
And they're like, look, you can see

1193
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,660
all of my Bitcoin deposits coming from my wallet.

1194
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,900
on this wallet.

1195
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,060
And like you see all my transaction history.

1196
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,420
But all of them have like the exact amount of money

1197
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,980
that they put into the casino

1198
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,420
coming from the casino in the previous transaction.

1199
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,260
- Yeah.

1200
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,260
- And then when they're like, well, why is it?

1201
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,300
And they're like, well,

1202
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,900
they pay me a stipend to promote their website,

1203
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,300
but it's the exact amount that they put back in.

1204
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,060
- Yeah.

1205
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,000
- It's so awesome, dude.

1206
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,180
- Yeah, Big Win Board rules.

1207
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,780
Shout out Big Win Board.

1208
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,620
- Shout out.

1209
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,440
- I don't know if any of these guys remember.

1210
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,540
- Probably my most visited website.

1211
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,140
- It's not even close for me.

1212
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:37,980
- Yeah.

1213
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,820
- It is overtaken.

1214
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,780
My screen time on Big Win Board is just above anything else.

1215
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,020
- I just always have a tab, either a Big Win,

1216
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,980
I check the YouTube channel every day.

1217
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,900
I have a tab of it open at all times.

1218
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,940
- Rex will have people over at his room

1219
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,580
and just make him watch him spin demo reels.

1220
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,980
- That is true, I did do that to Julio.

1221
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,580
- He did that to me and he poisoned me with his room.

1222
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,420
(laughs)

1223
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,620
- What does that mean?

1224
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,900
- Yeah, we talked about this before,

1225
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,020
but yeah, he, in his disgusting, humid room

1226
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,300
that would just poison him every single day of his life.

1227
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,780
I went to hang out in there and he was like,

1228
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,860
"Look, I'm doing a penguin boards demo reels."

1229
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,300
And I sat on his bed for a single second

1230
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,020
and I felt like I was, I just fell asleep.

1231
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,800
I just passed out.

1232
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,740
I couldn't stay awake.

1233
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,080
I didn't find out that he had mold and yeah,

1234
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,520
but then like that.

1235
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,060
Oh, speaking of you getting so sick,

1236
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:35,680
the your old Airbnb still has that.

1237
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,200
I walk by it every day on the way to the office.

1238
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,320
It still has that fucking sign in front of it

1239
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,520
that says that this is not fit for human life.

1240
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,700
That is awesome.

1241
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,840
It's so dope.

1242
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,860
Yeah, she can't contact with that guy.

1243
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,760
We should we should be like,

1244
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,740
yo, what's up, man?

1245
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,000
Just ask him to rent it to you guys under the table

1246
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,540
because you guys like that place.

1247
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,640
We don't.

1248
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,100
I don't.

1249
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,900
- Oh, that place is horrible.

1250
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,460
The smell is horrible.

1251
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,540
- The smell was always bad.

1252
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,740
- The smell is bad.

1253
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,260
There's rats in the walls.

1254
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,620
The cops will come in every single day,

1255
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:08,220
be like, "Yo, I'm gonna kill you if you keep staying here."

1256
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,220
- Yeah, I guess that's not so good.

1257
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,820
- Yeah, it's horrible.

1258
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,540
- But it was close and it was cheap.

1259
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,380
- Yeah. - It was close.

1260
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,780
- I wouldn't call it cheap.

1261
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,900
- Or maybe not even cheap.

1262
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,900
- Yeah. - It was around though.

1263
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,740
- Yeah. - It was around.

1264
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:28,220
But what I will say is that when I made Julio watch me play Big Win Board, I hit a nice 5000x

1265
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,020
on atero echo spins.

1266
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:36,240
I would not be able to recall because I was passed out due to being chloroformed by Rex.

1267
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
That's amazing guys.

1268
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:43,500
My only slot max win, you guessed it, on Big Win Board.

1269
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,500
Is it atero?

1270
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,780
No, it's true blood or whatever it is.

1271
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,780
True blood.

1272
01:00:50,780 --> 01:01:04,660
the

1273
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,500
- That is true.

1274
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,320
- That is a completely sucks.

1275
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,160
- That's what I'm saying.

1276
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,000
That's what I'm saying you have max win on that thing.

1277
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,580
- Oh, he thinks they're using a fake demo.

1278
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,260
Well, that's provided by the slot provider.

1279
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,700
That's no fault of Big Win Board, I would say.

1280
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,020
- Okay, okay, we're done here.

1281
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:18,860
We're done.

1282
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,300
- We're done, I'm so hungry.

1283
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,860
I have to go make this steak.

1284
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,700
- All right, goodbye.

1285
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,260
- Goodbye, my friends. - Goodbye.
