1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Oh, God!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
My leg!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh, God!

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,240
You have to move your leg.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,040
You have to move your leg right now to get it out.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,040
I can't move it.

7
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Well, hold on.

8
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,120
How can he move his leg if it's over there?

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
Okay, wait.

10
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
Ray, get his leg.

11
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,120
We have to put it back on.

12
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
Oh, shit.

13
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Oh, you call this a leg?

14
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,120
Oh, God, this thing's ugly as shit.

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,720
Oh, no, that's his penis.

16
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,280
Okay, his leg's over there.

17
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,680
Sullivan's back in heat.

18
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
No, no, no.

19
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,160
What am I holding right now?

20
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
I think that's an arm.

21
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,480
Okay, so he lost his penis and his leg.

22
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,080
Oh my god.

23
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,580
Freeze!

24
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,580
No, you freeze!

25
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,420
I move!

26
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,080
Yeah, we were just getting some second.

27
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Our friend lost his leg.

28
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,580
Okay?

29
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,580
Guys, can we focus up for a minute?

30
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,580
If we don't put him back together,

31
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,580
how are we gonna get through the Sullivan body scan lock?

32
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,080
That's on the vault's door.

33
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Very good point.

34
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,580
Does anybody have any glue or spit?

35
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,080
What limbs does he still have attached to his torso?

36
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
His mouth.

37
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Looks like pretty much an eye and a mouth.

38
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Those are not limbs!

39
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Okay, then nothing.

40
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
No!

41
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,080
I'll use my Kemp arm to disfigure the rest of him, and I'll each take one of his limbs and puppet him through the scanner.

42
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

43
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,080
There are dragons flying into the room, guys.

44
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,080
There's dragonflies in the room? Sullivan would love to eat those!

45
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,080
I can't really talk, I've been very disfigured.

46
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
I think we should just put him out of his misery.

47
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
No, please don't. Please.

48
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,080
But the only gun is inside the vault.

49
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
*laughter*

50
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,920
Okay, so we need to put him into his misery first,

51
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,160
scan his body, and then get into the vault so we can kill him.

52
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,880
Gary B, do you have any kind of like reverse bomb that would put somebody's leg back on their body?

53
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,020
No.

54
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,200
Aw, shit! You know it's a lot of soul!

55
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,260
Shit!

56
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,640
Wait, wait, wait, Gary B, do you have any-

57
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
Do you have any glue to make a bomb?

58
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,900
No.

59
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
What?

60
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Ow!

61
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I just killed all the dragons.

62
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh, thank you.

63
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Thank you very much.

64
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Yep.

65
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
You hear a voice over the intercom.

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
"It seems you've all fallen into my trap."

67
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh, no, it's that guy.

68
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
That's right.

69
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I thought we fell into the trap minutes ago.

70
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Is this a new--

71
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Why has he exploded if we haven't hit a trap already?

72
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Yo.

73
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Uh-oh, looks like there's more dragons.

74
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,100
There's more dragons and gargoyles now too, coming into this drinking room.

75
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,600
Luckily I have my gargoyle ray from earlier in the mission.

76
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,100
No, no, you don't have a gargoyle ray.

77
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,600
And I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

78
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It's right over there, it's the second door to the right if you walk down that hallway.

79
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Oh, they only have a girls bathroom. You have to go in the girls bathroom and there's little girls in there.

80
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
NOOOOO!

81
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Wait, I think we're losing Sullivan. Oh my god. Oh no.

82
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Sullivan, is this really happening to me?

83
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,960
Yes, and it's very, very bad and you're going to die.

84
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,680
I bet you're wondering how we got into this mess.

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,280
Well, it's a long story and people usually tune me out if I start talking for more than

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,600
a couple sentences, but I'm the only one left alive to tell it, so I guess it's gotta be

87
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
me.

88
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,080
Uh, well, right after we struck it rich from our last adventure at Te Tempola Dune, my best

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,580
friends, Blowtoss Piss, Patrick Yoda, and Ray William Johnson went their separate ways.

90
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,980
I still worked as their assistant, although I don't recall being paid, but I managed their

91
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,640
affairs after they got so rich from the last adventure. I tried to call them, but they

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,740
must have been really busy because they never picked up, except for one time they called

93
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,040
me and told me they were all hanging out and I wasn't invited. I saw them hanging in the

94
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,960
Matrix 2 one time too, I think, but when I said hi, they told me that they were just illusions

95
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,780
and I never knew them and I should probably go to an insane asylum because I seem so crazy,

96
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,540
stupid and ugly.

97
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,020
So I did my own thing for a bit.

98
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,600
I became a producer for XXX Contacion, formerly known as Husky Kitchener, and made enough tokens

99
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,820
that I could afford to move back to Gun City and rent a 5x5 foot luxury condo in the Lockheed

100
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,780
Martin District.

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,340
After about a year of living back in G.C., I was invited to a charity event for the Papichuco's

102
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,140
Techno Slime addiction treatment and recovery center by my cousin John Carlo.

103
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,100
He done well for himself since we last saw him.

104
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,620
Partnered with Garry's Enterprise on a huge expansion of Hot Soda, Cold Dog's restaurant.

105
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,500
It felt like giving back after being a Techno Slime pusher for so long.

106
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,580
Of course the charity was under Papi Chuko's Techno Slime Corporation so I didn't know

107
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,460
how much good it could do but I figured it'd be nice to go to an event.

108
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,700
Maybe I'll make some friends.

109
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,140
The event took place at the Belle Delphine Wonder Bread event space in Palantir HQ district.

110
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,020
So it was a bit of a drive for me, but boy did that venue impress.

111
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,260
And the venue itself is a single floor venue with a well kept lobby area, warm and red

112
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,880
in tone, with sparks of sleepy golds and yellows, contrasted with a super linoleum flooring

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,220
that spills out into the main event hall where things get interesting.

114
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,740
Sheets of neon shoot through the floor, creating dimensions and liminalities as you move through.

115
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,940
Colors gently shift between Pantone favorites, and you hear tinny high-pass versions of inoffensive

116
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,220
music snake up through the floor.

117
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,980
Different tracks loop at different points in the venue, sort of like you're moving from

118
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,580
the restaurant floor to the restaurant bathroom, a Sade joint fading out as the sounds and

119
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,420
smells of Uptown Girl fade in, but it's all in the same open space.

120
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,620
Otherwise it's a pretty fairly standard, you know, architecture for a venue.

121
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,020
High ceilings, baroque chandeliers, simple stage, raised, red curtain.

122
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,020
There are worm servers and chefs that move quickly in and out of the kitchen,

123
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,220
dressed in their party-down get-ups, taking the traditional abuse they deserve.

124
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,220
Sullivan walks in and is barreled down by a few of these worms,

125
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,620
but he recognizes the catering company to be Jamal the Worm's Wormhole Catering.

126
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,520
The program for tonight is as follows.

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,120
Keynote speakers, John Carlo the Bullfrog and Gary C. Enterprise.

128
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,560
Followed by a performance from Cream 3, the Jeff T. Dridge, Filipino Mr. Bean and Ray

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,640
William Johnson's Worm Band.

130
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Followed by closing remarks from the head of the charity, Fatima Von Kissyface.

131
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,960
Yeah, you remember Cream 3?

132
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I'm just remembering it.

133
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,960
And my worm.

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,960
and my worm. I forgot about the worm!

135
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Oh man, I should have done a re-listen to get the lore back.

136
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Oh fuck. Someone make a wiki!

137
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Someone made a wiki, they have to update it. I'm not updating that.

138
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Someone made a wiki, yeah. So Sullivan goes to walk around to try to make

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
friends. He doesn't really notice you guys yet. I'm not sure why.

140
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
But he doesn't. So he gives you guys an opportunity to tell me

141
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Why you why you at the charity event?

142
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,800
How are you guys doing? Where have you been? It's been a year since our last adventure. Ah

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,460
Well, you know, I

144
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,980
Love charity so much. I

145
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,300
Think probably after space skateboarding

146
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,560
What a hoverboarding I love I love space charity so much

147
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,420
Basically, I'm only here I

148
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,180
mean between you and I

149
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:25,180
I'm really only here cuz I got addicted to space cocaine and my dealers here

150
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,820
Yeah, I know I'm your dealer yeah, what's up

151
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,560
How you doing? I'm good, man. I'm trying to keep a low profile. We go to the bathroom real quick

152
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I really told you not to come to this

153
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,720
Why did you I told you I needed to pick up? I I know I said wait till after the charity event

154
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
And I'm not buying a ticket.

155
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
And then you said I'm buying a ticket.

156
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
And then you bought a ticket.

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
And I'm not wearing a wire.

158
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Alright, so...

159
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
You're putting the emphasis in the wrong place.

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm just letting you know.

161
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm not wired up.

162
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

163
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Because of something I did,

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm not wired up.

165
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I never got caught

166
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
with a lot of space cocaine

167
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
at the Terry Shiver Memorial Gate Park.

168
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
And that's not why I'm here

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Okay, I'm gonna follow you to the bathroom to purchase space cocaine

170
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,160
That's not what's happening. Can you walk off and you're saying that he keeps saying that that's not what's happening

171
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,440
And the yeah, we camera sort of whips around to the next one of you's guys

172
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,800
Wherever you's are in the charity event hall

173
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:48,440
My name is Blotas Piss. I'm a master con man. I've been in this dirty biz ever since I was little. When I was a baby

174
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,700
I was stealing candy from myself. I've played important roles in hundreds of highly successful Christmas heists throughout my life.

175
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,760
I was the teleporter when my team stole every bottle of Mrs. Claus's

176
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
1945 Burgundy eggnog from her nog seller.

177
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,160
I was the teleporter in the great art museum heist when we stole Pablo Picasso's Christmas list.

178
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,200
And my teleporting skills really came in handy when I helped rob the Santa's slots casino blind as the teleporter

179
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Yep, I had a particular skill set and I knew how to use it

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,820
I was one of the baddest in the game and I was and still am rich as hell

181
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,200
But that all changed except the rich part when my child came along Sullivan

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,320
Not the frog the cool one half penguin and half water bottle Sullivan was the light of my life

183
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,840
Once I started spending time with him, I realized I didn't want to be a teleporter anymore. I wanted to be a dad

184
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,920
He made me want to quit heisting and be a better man

185
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,380
I co-parented the little rascal with Ray William Johnson and it was a great experience

186
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,800
Now that my little Sullivan's all grown up and headed off to college. He's all I can think about

187
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,260
I'm sure Ray William Johnson feels the same way

188
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,520
And did you guys go to the event together?

189
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,860
Yeah, yeah, I got dragged by blowtoss and

190
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:14,440
Ray William Johnson is in he's in the kitchen of the venue right now. Mm-hmm. Yeah, like hey boss. He can't be back here

191
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,940
Boss, what are you doing back here? Just ignoring this guy completely and talking to himself under his breath says

192
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,720
One last job. That's my promise to myself

193
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,360
One last job before I retire the mark a turkey sandwich

194
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,320
But first I'm gonna need to put a team together. I'll start with my right-hand man mayonnaise

195
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,680
We've seen all you can't grab that. We've seen it all and he saved my ass more times than I can count

196
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,360
Hey Mayo, remember gas station tuna? Yeah, we were both so damn coked out who else?

197
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,860
Well, we didn't exactly end on good terms, but American cheese is the finest delicious expert in the entire fridge

198
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,820
After our last job, he went Hollywood on me, but I bet I could convince him.

199
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Of course, no sandwich would be complete without tomato, a master of disguise.

200
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,560
Put him in the right situation and he convinced even the keenest eye that he's a piece of smoked salmon.

201
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,480
Next, my brother from another mother.

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,780
Pepper. I may be a computer strapped to the back of a demon and he may be food,

203
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,740
but his black ass always has my back and you know I got his.

204
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,440
Then I gotta get the twins of course top and bottom slice to help her out the crew and of course the big man

205
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,620
Salcito turkey clock again at nearly 899 a pound. He's heavyweight rough and tumble spicy

206
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
Which is the right amount of sweet?

207
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,900
This is gonna be tough because I don't think they have knives in this kitchen, but let's do it boys

208
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:54,300
Okay, we did it now. I'm gonna eat sandwich also me and blowtiles raised a kid

209
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
*laughter*

210
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:03,300
After you reached for the mayonnaise during the speech and you started to mention cheese and were walking towards the fridge,

211
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,300
the other guys were like "just make the sandwich as he's saying it so he doesn't touch anything"

212
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,300
and they just made it as quickly as they could and gave it to you.

213
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I, as I'm, they hand it to me and I took the pieces apart and put them immediately together in the same order so that I felt accomplished.

214
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:33,260
the

215
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,780
down a bunch of money on the bathroom counter.

216
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:45,700
Look I, he's in the stall, you could just see his feet, he's like, "Okay, well, that's good,

217
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm glad you're not doing that, dude."

218
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,540
And he's not selling it to me, right now.

219
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,140
Don't have anything on me, we're at a charity event.

220
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,540
What did you think I was gonna do, sell you cocaine here?

221
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Yeah.

222
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,540
*knock knock*

223
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
Uh, can you uh, open up?

224
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
This turkey sandwich is really running through me.

225
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
Oh, who's that?

226
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
*knock knock knock knock*

227
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
Why does it matter who I am?

228
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
I'm trying to take a shit in the bathroom.

229
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Because I'm not buying drugs in here!

230
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Who cares what my name is?

231
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
Just let me shit.

232
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,540
Coke dealer like pulls up his pants and like just

233
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,540
washes his hands and walks out, opens the door

234
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,540
and yeah, Ray William Johnson, you and CokeToyota.

235
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,540
Oh, it's a multi-stall. Don't let him leave!

236
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,500
leave. As he walks out an alarm goes off above the door that says didn't flush.

237
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:43,820
Guards run over and grab him. I think that Patrick Yoda is telling me to stop him because he didn't

238
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:51,820
flush so I also aid in, I tackle the guy. I'm innocent, I'm innocent. No brown bandits getting

239
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,900
away at this dinner party. Oh thank god I needed that, oh my god. They had me on,

240
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,140
They were gonna book me for fucking ever

241
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:07,500
They're gonna throw me in jail. I bought I hid so many fucking bricks of coke in the terry shifo memorial skate park

242
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,180
One day some fucking little shit hits his head through the through the through the ramp

243
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,820
It was made out of wood and I don't know why he was ever boarding on a wood ramp. You're not supposed to do that

244
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,940
Yeah, his he went full speed through the ramp

245
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:27,820
Showed off my whole fucking stash. I don't know what the fuck. I I I got I got so much trouble

246
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
Anyway, how have you been?

247
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Uh, can we catch up after I shit?

248
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Yeah, do you got any blow?

249
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
You got any space blow?

250
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
I'm in the stall with him.

251
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
As you guys are doing this, I walk over.

252
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Blowtoss talks over us like,

253
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
"Oh, we having a little reunion, are we?"

254
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,820
And then instantly my face does the fish from Spongebob thing,

255
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
because I smell the poop that the guy didn't flush down.

256
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
[Laughter]

257
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:07,300
the

258
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:20,300
the

259
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,780
It's nice to see you man, whatever, you need to go flush that right now.

260
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
It smells horrible.

261
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:33,340
As he's running towards us, I quickly paint a photorealistic portrait of all three of

262
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,220
us with welcoming arms on the front of the toilet stall that has the shit in it so that

263
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,420
he runs directly into it and into the stall and his face goes into the poop.

264
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Oh somebody's gotta flush this and then I flush him down the toilet.

265
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,420
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

266
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Okay, okay.

267
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Well, how you guys, well.

268
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,420
How you guys doing?

269
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
What's that on your nose?

270
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
My eyes are really stinging.

271
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,420
Sullivan, what the hell is wrong with you? You got shit all over your damn face.

272
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,900
You look horrible man since the last time we saw you

273
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,900
Wait, is your name still Sullivan or is it nothing or poop?

274
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,420
I think it's poop. I think it's poop because of what's on his face

275
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,220
I don't remember

276
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,940
Are you guys, are you guys here for the, are you guys here for the,

277
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,580
I guess you're here for the charity event, it's a stupid question

278
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,460
I was here for, to not buy drugs

279
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,740
Because I'm still not wearing a wire

280
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,580
If you have any

281
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,980
No, I don't. I don't even drink tea.

282
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,500
Oh, that's code for I have space blow.

283
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,380
Officer, I mean, duh.

284
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,780
Shirt, Sullivan, you're talking to your shirt, right?

285
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,020
Sure.

286
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,100
My shirt, you guys give me all kinds of

287
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,620
days shirt now.

288
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,660
Long time, I'm glad to see you've reinvented yourself.

289
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,300
Your name's Shirt, you have poop all over your face.

290
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,180
His name is Shirt, he's covered in poop.

291
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,380
Oh, and you're on the ground.

292
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,980
And I kick his leg out from under it.

293
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,340
[LAUGHTER]

294
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,220
I see you walk on four legs now.

295
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,540
Very interesting.

296
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,060
I like it.

297
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,580
I missed you guys a lot.

298
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,980
We all sit on him like a bench.

299
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,380
And then we look at each other, and we all say--

300
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,220
I miss you guys too.

301
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,180
I miss you guys too.

302
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,440
(laughter)

303
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,060
- I just need to say that.

304
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,900
You hear a little like, ding, ding, ding, ding, like chimes,

305
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,340
but the event is starting.

306
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,300
You see John Carlo, the bullfrog,

307
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,700
not John Carlo the frog, all right,

308
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,540
so those keeping track of canon at home,

309
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,020
appears on the stage at the podium,

310
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,660
and he says, "We'd like to thank you all for coming.

311
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,980
It's an honor to be able to host an event such as this alongside my business partner Gary C. Enterprise.

312
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,580
I remember him.

313
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,860
The work that is being done by Papi Chuko's Technoslime Addiction Treatment and Recovery Center

314
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,860
is nothing short of phenomenal.

315
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:27,420
They have managed to save 17 addicts this year alone, up from creating 17 more last year.

316
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,140
How about a round of applause?

317
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,860
And you see like sort of a smattering of applause, you know.

318
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
You see Jamal Da Worm is sort of like,

319
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,220
I don't know how work how he applauds. He's doing it though. He's

320
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,720
He's hitting his head against yeah, but yeah, you see the worms are

321
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,380
Doing that they're just dropping the drinks. They're trying to serve. It's a certain clapping and just dropping shit

322
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,420
yeah, and he says

323
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,220
Now

324
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,900
Cold dogs and hot sodas is all about giving back

325
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,140
You know, the idea came from Gary C's interactions with three kind strangers who gave him the capital and the inspiration to build this Empire

326
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:14,540
That foundation means we're all about paying it forward. So they have any cold dogs here past things to my colleague here to give you

327
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,220
Some exciting news

328
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:23,060
Excuse me. Harry. I'm raising my hand. Yes. There's a worm a worm comes over. Yes, sir. How can I help you? Holy shit?

329
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
You came at me too fast

330
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:34,280

It's all white.

426
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:45,980
She's kind of like a prim lady, a bit older, and she says, "Thank you all so much for coming.

427
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,540
She's just been a wonderful event.

428
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,140
We're all so happy to have you here.

429
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,820
And I'd just like to say that I thank you for the three men who showed up.

430
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,380
These are the people who are responsible for our charity's independence.

431
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,220
One of them, I think it was the G-man, he punched the head off Papi Chuko and the company

432
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,860
Sort of dissolved and we got to have our independence. So thank you you three

433
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:15,660
Did she say the G man that she man the she man you can't say that nowadays

434
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,940
She says

435
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:25,880
And did she say a big announcement we're going to make we were renaming the charity to make an out

436
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:35,040
What I can't understand a fucking word you're saying that voice is called the independent charity of underprivileged persons

437
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,500
That's right. We are going to be servicing not just people who are

438
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:47,220
But everyone in gun city, hey, hey blowtorch spell it spell spell it okay

439
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,560
INDEP

440
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,340
DND

441
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,340
ENTC

442
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
HR I T

443
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,340
Oh

444
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:06,480
My god short

445
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,740
You hear a lot of rumbling about this. This is a big deal. There has not been a charity in

446
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:19,420
Gun City history, but has ever operated independently that cold dogs and hot sodas has given enough money to this charity

447
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,900
That they can operate independently is a big deal

448
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:29,640
People are going to be interested in that most charities are exists solely to be the arm of another corporation

449
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,440
This is one that is at the very least a tax write-off, which is a big deal

450
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,040
And she she says now we're going to be going around with donations

451
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,620
Please put down whichever number you think is you're comfortable with but just know that like we need a lot of money

452
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
so thank you so much and

453
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,060
let's have cream Shri play us out and

454

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,200
the

459
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,340
the

460
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,380

465
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:31,420

00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,380
*fart noise*

542
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,260
There's the extra money alarm again. I'm tellin' ya, we're too rich.

543
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,600
Hold on, did Sullivan give you guys my fuckin' wallet?

544
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,200
He says, "I'm sorry guys, it's not a..."

545
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,120
"Nothing's going through."

546
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,620
SHIRT!

547
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,640
Uh, but, what?

548
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,760
Did you give them my wallet?

549
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,520
Nah, I didn't give anybody their wallet.

550
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,640
What are you talking about? We're clearly using our card.

551
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,400
You're acting crazy right now, and you're ruining everything.

552
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,120
*laughter*

553
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:06,120
I don't know what could be going on with you guys cards.

554
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,120
I think you just put it on my head.

555
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Listen, if the cards don't work, I'll just walk over to the ATM and make a withdrawal really quick.

556
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Oh, I found my wallet. Sorry.

557
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,120
I'm not sure what you were committed to.

558
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,120
I like having cash on me too. I'll join you at the ATM, baby girl.

559
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Let's all go to these three ATMs right next to each other and query our balance at the same instant.

560
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,920
I'm definitely gonna check mine.

561
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,720
It's kind of impressive that they're all at our exact heights too.

562
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,320
Yeah, Sullivan starts to like protest and he doesn't want to go, but he just appears there with you guys.

563
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,720
He's suddenly like, "I didn't want to go!"

564
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

565
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,320
At the same time, guys.

566
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,720
One, two, three, four.

567
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:52,120
Oh, what the hell? All my money must have been lost after Sullivan, or Shirt, fucked it up.

568
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,520
And it wasn't before, and it wasn't before I didn't have any money.

569
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:11,480
the

570
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,080
the bank and take it out in person.

571
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,440
I think we need to go to the bank.

572
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,440
Here, let me try to do a withdrawal real quick.

573
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,520
I don't know what bank would be open at this hour.

574
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,800
I try to withdraw 100 million tokens

575
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,160
and a fly comes out of the ATM slot.

576
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,240
It's a fly where--

577
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
I don't remember depositing a fly.

578
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,000
You see a fly comes out.

579
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,760
It has like a cup and it's an expiration.

580
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,400
That fly must be worth 100 million tokens.

581
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,520
Grab it.

582
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,360
OK, I got it.

583
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,640
I'll put it in Shirt's mouth for safekeeping.

584
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,800
Oh, wait, he's a whole rock.

585
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,440
He likes that.

586
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,320
*laughter*

587
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,940
You know what, jerk? I'm gonna call you "Wallet."

588
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,220
I put the fly in his butt, and then I bring him to the bank.

589
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,460
Okay, you guys go to the bank, um...

590
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,660
We're in line, we're in three lines next to each other, going up to three tellers.

591
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,860
Okay, guys. Now we're at the bank.

646
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,780
but he's everywhere and he's white.

647
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780

Yeah.

670
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,980
Are you happy to know anything about this?

671
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:55,980
Uh... well, when, um... uh...

672
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,980
I seem to remember giving you a card and telling you to write a certain amount.

673
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:09,920
Yeah, I'm concerned that maybe you're too fucking stupid to even do that right well, yeah, I wrote down one zero zero

674
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,740
zero

675
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,740
You wrote you wrote four digits and then a comma

676
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:24,800
No, no, I wrote one and then a comma and then I wrote three zeros and then okay

677
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,020
How many zeros?

678
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:38,740
It's gotta be more than 12 if I'm being real.

679
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,300
And did you swipe my cards?

680
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,020
Only one, the guy made me do one of them.

681
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,620
But it wasn't the bad one, right?

682
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,580
It wasn't the one you weren't supposed to.

683
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,780
Was it the Kraymerica card?

684
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,780
The one with his face on it in the corner?

685
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Yep!

686
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,060
The one with my face on it in the corner

687
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,740
Dear oh

688
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:12,420
Fuck I'm ruined with my bad. I just want to be ruined. Okay, tell me

689
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,740
This okay for the

690
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:21,860
one and I kept paying for the other ones with with credit cards that I kept buying with all the other money I I

691
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:27,860
I tried to make it a cycle of cards that I kept paying off with other cards, and it didn't fucking work!

692
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,220
It didn't fucking work!

693
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,580
Church, look at me in the eyes and tell me, for the love of God,

694
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:39,540
that you did not do, on my account, the same amount as blow tosses plus one fly.

695
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:47,500
Then he flashed back and he's, the guy says, "Why don't you just add a fly for fun?"

696
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
[laughter]

697
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
[laughter]

698
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,020
Oh my god, Jerk. I'm sorry

699
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,620
You fucked us all. I'm sorry

700
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:06,280
We might as well kill you right now. Please don't please don't please don't I'd have to because I know why shouldn't we

701
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,700
Sure, I'm gonna give you a good reason not to pop your little head off like a frog's head jerk

702
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,660
I'm gonna kill myself with pills and alcohol and it's your fault

703
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,420
We can just get the money back

704
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:31,500
the

705
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Give me an idea.

706
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,020
One, two, three, four.

707
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,540
We--

708
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,900
Oh, one, two, three, four.

709
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,460
Maybe there'll be money in there.

710
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,620
Try it again.

711
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,220
We run over to the ATM.

712
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,220
We all put one, two, three, four in.

713
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,980
Yeah, you see two flies, and they're

714
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,860
having like a coy date now.

715
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,020
You're starting to get to know their life and their--

716
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,220
My flies.

717
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:56,720
Yeah.

718
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,380
Okay, guys, listen, I have an idea.

719
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,380
Alright?

720
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,380
Simple.

721
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,380
We start our own charity,

722
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,380
and we ask for a donation from this charity

723
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,380
for the same amount.

724
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
I've got an idea.

725
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,380
I've got an even better idea.

726
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,380
What is it?

727
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,380
I forgot the idea.

728
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,380
Can we...

729
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,380
Can we try something else?

730
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,380
Maybe.

731
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,380
Hmm.

732
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,380
I'm trying to think.

733
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,380
What are we good at that might

734
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:32,380
that might lay itself out for the future.

735
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,380
It could be archaeology.

736
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,380
It could be detective work.

737
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,380
Well, some of us are good at buying drugs.

738
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,380
Wait, are we elementary school kids who found a leprechaun?

739
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,380
I can't remember what our thing is.

740
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,380
No, no, we're here because we won a contest to become chocolatiers.

741
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,380
Oh, I think it could be that.

742
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,380
That could be it.

743
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,340
Wait, are we a bunch of, are we like pets that like escaped and were like lost?

744
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,340
Oh, he's a frog.

745
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,340
Wow, that's a good point.

746
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,340
You're a frog.

747
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,340
Hmm.

748
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,340
He's a frog.

749
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,220
I kind of look like a frog.

750
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,220
I am hungry.

751
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,220
Like a frog.

752
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,220
When is that shrimp cocktail?

753
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,220
Um, I don't want to say it.

754
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,220
Don't.

755
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,220
I don't want to say it.

756
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,220
Don't.

757
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,220
I don't want to say it.

758
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,220
Don't.

759
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,220
I don't want to say it.

760
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,220
Don't.

761
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,220
I don't want to say it.

762
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,220
Don't.

763
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,220
I don't want to say it.

764
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,220
Don't.

765
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,220
I don't want to say it.

766
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,220
Don't.

767
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
I thought anyway

768
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,660
No, go ahead listen shirt, yeah

769
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:35,180
I bet you have a great idea after you got us in this fucking situation you fucking idiot

770
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:40,180
What if we also you have a little poop right here? No, thank you

771
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:50,940
It's really gross his poop was really bad. Yep. Yeah, he was on drugs. Thank you. Oh was

772
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,880
That guy listen. Oh, yeah, tell us your idea so that we can forget it

773
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,260
Yeah, I want to make fun of it stole it back stole it back. What if we stole it back?

774
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,260
I just thought of that

775
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:12,620
Yoda that is genius. What if we deposited shirt into the ATM and see how much he's worth

776
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:21,100
I

777
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Deposit him into the ATM and it says

778
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,220
One fly

779
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,220
Okay, wait, well that's got it worth it I'll take oh

780
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:38,140
My god, there's a fucking machine need to be restocked. There's no flies

781
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,100
All right, whatever we'll take the frog back

782
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,780
Okay

783
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,220
All right, so you guys don't like my idea I guess so

784
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,940
Oh, we're gonna do Patrick's idea.

785
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,940
Yeah, that was a good one.

786
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,940
What was my idea again?

787
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,740
I came up with it earlier and then I forgot it and then I remembered it and then I forgot it again.

788
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,740
Oh, damn, wait, we all forgot the idea.

789
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,740
Oh, well.

790
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,740
Oh, we're gonna deposit shirt into the ATM!

791
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,740
Oh, that was it.

792
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,740
[laughter]

793
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,740
So as you guys are about to put it, put shirt back into the ATM.

794
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,740
It's half as much as before and then it says in parentheses "damaged."

795
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:25,740
His leg's sticking out. He says, "I think Patrick's idea was to steal the money back!"

796
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,740
"Hell yeah, that was my idea!"

797
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:39,740
"How are we ever gonna do that? There's only one, two, three, four of us. Wait, that reminds me of something. I'm gonna check my ballots on this ATM."

798
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:54,140
Okay, all right, I know a guy who can help us who knows his way around pretty much any

799
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,340
security

800
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,500
Anything that we could need to do to steal it back from our cup

801
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,260
James Barry Gee

802
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,940
And if we just go there

803
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:11,860
You talk to him and then maybe he can help us steal it back, okay

804
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:19,060
Just please stop whatever the ATM machine and I'm sorry about your money. I was very confused

805
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:24,360
Go back in the ATM machine. I think he did. All right

806
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:31,220
So you guys should have solvent back the ATM machine and as you

807
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:38,180
Smash him in there that we smash cut away from that to outside Barry G's mansion the next morning

808
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,040
You see that we bury these mansion has looks kind of like a Scarface replica mansion

809
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,960
It has sort of the massive staircase leading up to a white gate

810
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,140
You have a driveway on the east side of the mansion

811
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:02,760
But yeah, you guys can there's two guards out front of the gate and then on the east side of the mansion is

812
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,160
There seems to be some sort of wandering beast

813
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,100
That's probably also under employ by Barry Gee

814
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,160
but

815
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,460
You guys can try to go in through the front Sullivan seems to think he knows Barry Gee

816
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,160
If you guys want to try that or you guys could try to sneak in and try to talk to him

817
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,400
Mm-hmm. Am I feeling sneaky?

818
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,200
Yes

819
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,480
Okay, yeah, I might try to sneak to I think I'm gonna walk in the front okay, oh

00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,360
version. Clever. Yeah, I'll walk in the front. So you guys sneak in and let me in.

821
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,960
You and Patrick, Patrick and Sullivan walk up the stairs to the front and see the two guards

822
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,000
who say, "Hey, what are you doing here?" "What are you doing here?" "This is Barry Keyes' property."

823
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,160
"This is my property." "What? No, I'm a guard." "No, I'm a guard. You're the owner."

824
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Roll persuasion

825
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,520

There's like a fence and then there's like sort of this greenery around it and a driveway

839
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,160
Further off that you could follow to a side entrance, but that has

840
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:30,040
as a roaming beast. I'm tiptoeing directly towards the beast.

841
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,560
Okay. As you get closer and closer to the beast then...

842
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,200
Oh wait, I can become invisible. Hold up. I'm just going to cast invisibility on myself.

843
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,000
Yeah, you should do that. Okay, I do that.

844
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,280
Okay. Who's there?

845
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,560
You turn invisible. That's what it's called.

846
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,880
Yeah. Who's there? So you can turn invisible for one minute.

847
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,520
Okay, that's more than enough time for me. Yeah, so you can dash...

848
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,640
Wily little me.

849
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,920
Across, and what you see, the beast there, it is a Clombo, which has emerged recently.

850
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,480
Oh my God.

851
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,280
And it's said to eat just about anything.

852
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,720
Is there a special treat that they enjoy?

853
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,720
Yes, but nobody knows what it is. It might be a part of this adventure.

854
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:15,560
Okay, my character has studied Fortnite-ology, which is a really important field of study for

855
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,240
the past few thousand years.

856
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,480
When Fortnite became real in 2050.

857
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,600
Yeah. Well, that was what the Matrix 2 started as.

858
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,960
Yeah. So you guys know, well, you guys, you would know that it's a clomberry,

859
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,040
but there are no clomberry, nobody's found a clomberry in years. They said there's one

860
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,240
in the world.

861
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,040
I just think to myself, I know that thing likes clomberries.

862
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:40,680
Yeah. And you can walk right by it. I mean, if you're turning invisible and you get to the door.

863
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,720
So just you inside now, you see, it's a pretty dark

864
00:53:46,280 --> 00:54:01,240
the

865
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,720
So yeah as you walk by some of the guards

866
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,300
You realize that they seem two-dimensional

867
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,600
And that they are actually cardboard cutouts of regular guys

868
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,280
as you walk further into the mansion you see a

869
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:24,840
living room where a man a man made of magnets or tiny little magnets is

870
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,640
Sitting on a couch

871
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,840
My name is Barry Gee. I became

872
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:36,800
proficient in in the field of bombs making and reviewing and

873
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,400
testing

874
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,120
Mostly I

875
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,400
Test bombs the way I saw would test wines

876
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,480
So I blow them up in my house

877
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,720
Reaction to how strong they are and then I post my reviews online

878
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,240
So I did that for a couple years until I became very heavily invested in stocks

879
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,440
And

880
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,840
Stuff like that

881
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:11,320
So now I'm a huge business mogul magnet, and I'm also made out of magnets like in the new matrix

882
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:19,240
So yeah you blow toss

883
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,200
I'd say like you've kind of been you're kind of at the tail end of your invisibility

884
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,880
You're probably gonna return to visibility like in the next 10 seconds

885
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:36,120
Yeah, but you see this guy sitting on his couch and that is the Barry key as Sullivan described him a older man made of magnets

886
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:43,360
I mean, why is there anything really expensive I can grab and put in my pocket before I turn visible again

887
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:49,640
Barry geese or anything really expensive inside your living room. No, it's very barren and also it's very dark in here

888
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,640
So you can't really see what's going on

889
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,700
Anything but my face eliminated by my phone

890
00:55:54,700 --> 00:56:02,140
My favorite social media this year of the future is a m2

891
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:10,880
Inspirational business posts or for several hours. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, then I don't take anything

892
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,400
I'm dealing with a beast.

893
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,680
So if you'd calm down.

894
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,680
Oh, the guard tower?

895
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,680
No, he's outside.

896
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,680
My grandfather died there.

897
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,680
Damn it.

898
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Come on.

899
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
Damn it, you got the joke right.

900
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,680
What did you say?

901
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,680
Your uncle fell there?

902
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
Stupid ass.

903
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,680
Yeah, I mean, so we can cut back to Pat, you and Sullivan.

904
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,680
[laughter]

905
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,680
Stupid ass.

906
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,680
[laughter]

907
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,680
Um, yeah. I mean, so,

908
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,680
we can cut back to Pat,

909
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,680
you and, uh, Sullivan,

910
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,680
with the guards. They're about to start a fight

911
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,680
with you. Okay. Um, but also

912
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,680
Ray, you're...

913
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,680
are you sneaking past

914
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,680
the, um, the beast?

915
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,680
I'm trying to sneak right under

916
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,680
its legs. Okay.

917
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,680
Oh wait, it's a clombo. It's a

918
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:13,000
the

919
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:21,520
legs like a clumbo. Roll stealth. Okay. Hmm what is my stealth? You're going to need to

920
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:28,960
get a critical. That is still not good enough. You were trying to sneak underneath a guy?

921
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:36,460
It's a clumbo. It's an enormous creature. Yeah. No. No. But what if I just did? Patches

922
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,580
if an ant snuck between your legs you would notice it?

923
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,580
This is not...

924
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,580
I notice every ant.

925
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:46,140
Clombo's size to people's size is not me size to ant size.

926
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,820
Don't say anything about me being short.

927
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,300
Your ant is about to be fat.

928
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,420
Your ant would be way too big.

929
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,140
You would be sneaking under the ant.

930
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,620
Okay.

931
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,220
Okay.

932
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,220
The Clombo...

933
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,220
Fucking...

934
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,220
fucking

935
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,620
combo like notices you sneaking underneath but with a 17 like notices

936
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:17,760
you on the later side of it and starts a sniff the air and sort of catches I see

937
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:27,840
him oh what's that smell oh my god do you smell that man yeah um roll

938
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:34,840
initiative. Oh my god I have to kill this fucking... Just run away. Just escape into the house.

939
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:46,440
I got a three. Ah shit. Clombo's gonna roll for initiative. He got more than a three.

940
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:54,360
Clombo's gonna go first. Yeah, no way. He's going to shoot Clombo breath at you. So you're

941
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,560
you're gonna need to roll a dexterity saving throw.

942
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,160
Does he not speak English?

943
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,160
No, it's a combo.

944
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,760
Oh, pretty fucking good!

945
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,840
Nice, yeah, you're only gonna take half damage.

946
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,840
The combo breath shoots at you, and you are going to take...

947
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,160
Did you write combos before Fortnite put them in?

948
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,160
No.

949
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,160
What do you think?

950
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
Yes.

951
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,000
You should have fucking said yes, you idiot, we could have sued them.

952
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,480
Yeah, they would have believed that.

953
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,480
get

954
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,520
stream last night yelling about combos.

955
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,160
(laughing)

956
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,000
- That bond doesn't exist.

957
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,840
- He's missed me.

958
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,360
- That bond doesn't exist.

959
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,800
- Yeah, you take 12 damage.

960
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,320
- God damn it.

961
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,120
- But it's your turn.

962
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,440
You could use your full movement

963
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,640
and probably get away from this thing.

964
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,480
- I'm gonna do that.

965
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,760
I don't want the smoke with this combo.

966
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,120
- Yeah, so you use your full movement

967
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,240
and you run into the mansion.

968
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,640
You crash into one of the cardboard cutout guys.

969
00:59:51,600 --> 01:00:03,960
the

970
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,040
My friend I'm the God here

971
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:14,120
All right. I'm I'm just gonna step away Pat and he wants to fight both of you. No

972
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:20,700
And I guard all the all the crap in there and I and the guy

973
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:25,880
I'm a good guard the guard now takes out his phone and he calls you

974
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,640

Here, do you want me to I'm not deficient. I'm big-boned

978
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,440

01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,600
Okay, the number that he writes

So I'm gonna stop you right there Sullivan all that is bullshit and crap, okay, it won't work

1051
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,240
Okay, you need is I have no buddy

1052
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:19,760
I think he's some sort of chimp. I forget what his name is. I met him 20 years ago

1053
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:26,700
He's the only only guy who could probably crack this this sort of job. They're trying to do

1054
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:30,520
Do you mean Travis ocelot?

1055
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,340
Yeah, he means Travis. Oh what yeah, it's a

1056
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:41,940
Mm-hmm. Oh, he oh he was right. Oh, no. Well, okay. So where do we find this Travis ocelot guy? I

1057
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,400
Forgot

1058
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:54,440
As long as we don't have to go to some other planet

1059
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,600
Chimps or something

1060
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
Oh god.

1061
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,640
Alright, okay, wait, so.

1062
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:17,680
But uh, yeah, you would know that Travis Ocelot is a former, like, CIA type of guy, part of

1063
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:27,500
the Bureau of Mean and Nasty Spies, and also a prodigious shot, known for disabling security

1064
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,460
systems with his dual Golden Deagle technique.

1065
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:36,120
Um, as of now is whereabouts are, um, known to be only to

1066
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:42,840
Barry Gee as earth, um, where he is on a mission, uh, infiltrating

1067
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,300
chimp geopolitics.

1068
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,720
Um, and that's, that's what you would know.

1069
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,400
Uh, um, Barry Gee.

1070
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,800
I just said all of that.

1071
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,720
Yeah.

1072
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,960
And you also want to go meet my, my, my friend Tyler too, at the airport.

1073
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:02,340
He can see Tyler too.

1074
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,080
Yeah.

1075
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:09,520
I would also be able to give them, uh, the, the one of Travis

1076
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,620
Ocelot's golden guns, the other of which you lost, he lost in a job.

1077
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,580
Um, which made him swear off doing heists.

1078
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,440
Wait a second.

1079
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,200
Barry G what's that there golden thing in your hand?

1080
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,940
It's a golden deagle made for awesome shots

1081
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:33,000
Can I have it for no reason no

1082
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:40,720
Whatever she's name was this champ

1083
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,480
We go give it to Travis ocelot ourselves

1084
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,000
And save you the trouble unless you want to come along

1085
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,280
You're suffering from

1086
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,960
9,000

1087
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,560
Over 1 million so I can't really leave the house. I

1088
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:03,080
Take that and I put it in my fucking mouth

1089
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:12,320
They were all for damage

1090
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:17,780
No, no, no, I don't want to kill you unless you actually want to do that I didn't put it in my mouth

1091
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,120
He didn't let me

1092
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:29,340
No, I have 41 hit points so I'd be fine it'd be like the end of Fight Club

1093
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:38,720
Well, yeah, you guys would be giving that information

1094
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,880
Jubio, thank you for being a good sport. I know you've got covered 9,000, so a million,

1095
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:54,080
covered 9 million, 1 million. So thank you. And you guys would head to the airport where

1096
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:00,080
you would meet... Tyler 2.

1097
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,680
Oh God. Say it again?

1098
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,840
I have it written down. Tyler 2.

1099
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:14,080
So this is this area would be a it's sort of a field surrounded by low level like hangers iron and asphalt. It's kind of barren

1100
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:21,060
Uh, this place is dedicated to interplanetary travel, which is not really that popular in gun city. It's kind of a bunk investment

1101
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:26,240
Um, there are no really other planets to go to besides earth and earth kind of sucks

1102
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,680
Um, but there's some general tourism interest and some people just shoot themselves skyward and see what happens

1103
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,820
um the

1104
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,820
interplanetary travel in gun city

1105
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,460
at least this facility is run by Smith and Wesson.

1106
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,140
So what you do is you go into a bullet, you go into a gun container,

1107
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,980
but you get shot out of orbit.

1108
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:49,020
And then the pilot pilots you in the bullet to, in this case, Earth, which is like the only planet there.

1109
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:56,380
So you get there and you see a five foot three orc named Tyler Two,

1110
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:02,060
who's bald and wears a tank top.

1111
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:08,700
And, uh, Barry G what would you have told them about Tyler to his personality?

1112
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,300
So Tyler too, he's a very short guy.

1113
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,100
He has a weird shape head as well.

1114
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,140
Don't mention any of this.

1115
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,300
Don't call, don't call him short.

1116
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,380
Don't call him shorty.

1117
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,740
Uh, don't mention his height.

1118
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:23,700
He's going to bring up the fact that he's six, four, just go with it.

1119
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:28,140
If you want something from him, if not, uh, you'll, you'll get on it.

1120
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,700
And it's bad side is a very temper temperamental guy.

1121
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,100
You don't want to do that.

1122
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,980
And so you see, you see, as you're approaching this area,

1123
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,980
you see, hey, my name is Tyler, too.

1124
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,820
I'm six foot four.

1125
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:38,860
Nice to meet you guys.

1126
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,020
What's up, Shorty McBald Smald?

1127
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,460
Hey, short snack.

1128
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,300
Hey.

1129
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,460
He runs at you guys head first.

1130
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,500
Little snack of pancakes.

1131
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Roll initiative.

1132

I'll blow it to us.

1137
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,820
You go first.

1138
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:58,320

Oh yeah, a lot of love is on your body.

1162
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,280

01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,800
Let's just, let's get in the bullet.

1183
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,800
Let's get in the bullet."

1184
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,800
And uh...

1185
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,200
Just before either of us say anything else, just input the coordinates to where we need

1186
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,740
to go right now.

1187
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,740
Because I can't...

1188
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:32,920
I just need to make sure for no reason that this ship can operate without you.

1189
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920
Yeah, of course!

1190
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
And he puts in the coordinates.

1191
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,160
And he's like, "Okay!"

1192
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,520
Now I'll just press the start, the go button...

1193
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,520
Can you reach that button?

1194
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,520
Might have to go on your tiptoes.

1195
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,520
AHHHHH!

1196
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,520
Roll for initiative.

1197
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,520
*laughing*

1198
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
kay

1199
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,520
I got a 20

1200
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
alright everyone roll

1201
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
okay Patrick Odie you go first

1202
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,520
alright I'm gonna fuckin smack the shit out of him

1203
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
*laughing*

1204
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,520
kay

1205
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,520
you can roll for damage

1206
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,520
27

1207
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
*laughing*

1208
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,520
dude describe your kill

1209
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,520
10 damage

1210
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,520
*laughing*

1211
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,520
so

1212
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,520
how tall is he really?

1213
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,520
5'3

1214
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,520
oof

1215
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,520
on a good day

1216
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,220
and way smaller than him.

1217
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,720
I think we're all for the most part small.

1218
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,260
So I fucking I mean, you know,

1219
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,960
I'm swinging it like I got it like like how Rod Carew used to.

1220
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,060
Yes, I have it in bunt. Yeah.

1221
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:33,520
No. And I just go down and then up,

1222
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,860
up right into his into his balls.

1223
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:41,620
And because that happens,

1224
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:47,780
He throws up all of his organs, right? Like it's like a garbage pail kid. It's like inside out kind of yeah

1225
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,720
Yeah, it all all of his organs. It's like that part in that

1226
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,660
And nobody's gonna know that movie. Never mind. No, what's up?

1227
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:08,020
I do not support what he's been doing with the CDC. Okay

1228
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:26,420
the

1229
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:38,860
the

1230
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:48,220
that 27. I now have a Tyler 2 hoagie. It's just a little guy that I swing around with.

1231
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:59,180
And he's dead. He's dead. Oh, a five dollar foot long. You see your hoagie starts to sweat,

1232
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:04,940
it's getting angry, it's starting red. And yeah, you guys fly in this bullet towards

1233
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:15,580
Earth. So, for most people on planet E-Bomb, Earth is a footnote in your textbooks. Once

1234
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:19,620
the third cataclysm took place, all the poor people who were too stupid, lazy, or just

1235
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:23,860
too damn ugly to mean anything were left to fend for themselves, while all the beautiful

1236
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:28,020
rich people escaped to planet E-Bomb. Because the people who remained on Earth were so poor

1237
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:32,680
and stupid, the entire global human infrastructure collapsed in a week. Billions died and billions

1238
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:36,620
more were isolated from one another, clumsily adopting whatever remaining technological

1239
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:41,060
advancements allowed them to hydrate and feed themselves with some regularity, fend off

1240
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:46,420
especially harmful diseases, even cobble together the occasional urban center. Most of all,

1241
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:51,900
they fucked rapidly and indiscriminately with both man and animal and plants and objects.

1242
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,900
The interest in earthen affairs wavers on E-BOMB, with the powers that be generally

1243
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,580
airing on the side of "Why bother?" but not for the gun city bureau of mean and

1244
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:03,380
nasty spies. They've been targeting Earth for centuries, using it as a guinea pig

1245
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:08,020
for any ops that they want to do, they can't get clearance for at home. And so

1246
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:11,240
we arrive in a dense jungle of somewhere Earth where a chimp clave was under

1247
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:16,180
intense study. Chimp claves are formed all across Earth. In reaction to the void

1248
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:20,100
of intelligent and important people, chimps have risen up. Nothing substantial,

1249
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,620
but since there are no other nations worth disrupting, chimp geopolitics are

1250
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:30,100
all that remains. Whether the valorization of Chimp Claves is based on an actual observation

1251
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,780
of some semblance of organized political will among primates, or just an intergovernmental

1252
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:40,020
psyop courtesy of the Bureau and constant need to justify funding, no one can say.

1253
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:45,540
And as you guys land, you see this Chimp Clave, Mr. Travis Ocelot.

1254
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:52,540
I have built a perfect killer primate society. An outer haven for psycho apes, guarded by

1255
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:59,880
My 20 Gatling Gorillas, 200 sex-starved bonobos toil away in my 50-acre terraformed outdoor

1256
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:07,380
Xanax plantation, synthesizing dose after dose of high-octane alprazolam for my super-chimp

1257
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:13,480
soldiers to keep them disoriented and confused and ready to snap.

1258
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:19,120
My harem of eight orangutan wives work all day stitching and stuffing tickle-me-elmo

1259
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:25,120
dolls because soldiers need something to fight for. Soon our troop will disfigure,

1260
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:30,760
unthumb, and chew through this whole rotten world, and the title of dominant

1261
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,280
species will once again belong to the hairy knuckle-wobbler, and the upright

1262
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:44,440
tower of bipedal man will tip over. You guys arrive at this chimp clave, and yeah

1263
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,240
Travis, Ocelot, you see them as they land.

1264
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,400
Um, what do you do?

1265
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:54,920
Uh, I guess I recognize them faintly from my old life.

1266
01:17:54,920 --> 01:18:01,240
But I still, I still bear my, uh, my insignificant canines.

1267
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:05,320
In a chip display of aggression.

1268
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:09,400
One of your, uh, uh, Gatling gun gorillas says,

1269
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,080
"What do you want to do, boss? Should I shoot them now?"

1270
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,080
Let's hear what they have to say.

1271
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,080
Hi!

1272
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,080
Hi!

1273
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,080
He's smiling up there!

1274
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,080
Hi!

1275
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,080
Hi!

1276
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,080
Hi!

1277
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,080
Hi!

1278
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,080
Hello!

1279
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,080
Hi!

1280
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,080
Hi!

1281
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,080
I love you!

1282
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,080
He's smiling bigger.

1283
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,080
I love you!

1284
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,080
Hi!

1285
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,080
What a cute smile he has.

1286
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,080
Hi!

1287
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,080
I love you!

1288
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,080
We have a guy!

1289
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,080
He's just- Kosolin's waving around the Golden Deagle.

1290
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,080
Bring it in!

1291
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:42,080
Oh, so the light of the- What was he saying?

1292
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,080
I'm saying.

1293
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,080
Hi!

1294
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:52,320
Okay, so I guess the light of the gun is now glinting in my eye, and maybe there's like

1295
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,320
a faint recognition.

1296
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,320
*laughter*

1297
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:07,560
Rubio's trying so hard to distract me, he's trying to get the banana filter.

1298
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:15,000
Is- is Barry Ghi or- is he on the-

1299
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,280
No, he's not with us.

1300
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,280
He's got COVID-19 down.

1301
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,280
He's fuckin'.

1302
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,480
Alright. Um.

1303
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,720
So yeah, I guess now I definitely recognize the gun

1304
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:32,440
because my human arm, my left arm,

1305
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,600
is still clutching my gold desert eagle,

1306
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,240
although my right chimp arm is completely empty

1307
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,760
and tense with curdled anxiety.

1308
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:49,040
- Sounds like you need a Xanax.

1309
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,080
(laughing)

1310
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:57,800
Okay, so yeah, I reach over to the plantation and I pop a single Xanax in my...

1311
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,320
I get like the eyes from Naruto briefly.

1312
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,320
Yeah.

1313
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:07,720
You see one of your orangutan wives who's like,

1314
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:12,280
"Honey, I told you! You don't need Xanax! You have to stop!"

1315
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:17,000
I lift my chimp arm as if to say, "Relax."

1316
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And then she goes back to nursing four ape babies.

1317
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,020
(laughing)

1318
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,040
She has four breasts.

1319
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,300
She's like, she has the breasts of a four-legged mammal.

1320
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,040
- She agrees.

1321
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,800
- Yeah.

1322
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,660
I tell the gowling gorillas to put their guns down

1323
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:44,660
and I gesture for the trio to come onto my temple steps.

1324
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,520
Sullivan's supposed to-

1325
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,020
Can I-

1326
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:49,340
I'll stay here. I'll just- I'll stay here.

1327
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,520
I'm still waving.

1328
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,040
I'm- I'm just going-

1329
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,040
Hi!

1330
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,420
Hi!

1331
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,900
I love you!

1332
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:57,600
Hi!

1333
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,540
I love you!

1334
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:01,720
You guys, uh, approach the temple.

1335
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,940
Um, what does the inside of your temple look like?

1336
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,720
Um...

1337
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:13,080
It's decorated with the impaled heads of, uh, anyone who would ever, uh...

1338
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:18,920
Discontent or anyone who would ever be discontent with my society

1339
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,120
And there's also a few used diapers

1340
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:29,000
Disemboweled tickle me almost yeah, I'm waving to those two

1341
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,960
Mr. Asa rot

1342
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:41,880
We were sent here about Barry Gee we need your help. We've got a big heist we have to do and

1343
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:50,340
Only you and your golden double deagle trick shot is that's the only way we can do it. I feel like

1344
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,500
Hi

1345
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:57,880
Golden double dick you're that Travis awesome. I thought you were a different guy. I remember you

1346
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:02,180
Oh, oh the one with the giant chip fortress. Yeah

1347
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:08,360
It just all making so much I just processed it. What's up, man?

1348
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,580
What's up, hi and hi I love

1349
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:21,620
It's true many years ago the nation's Federation

1350
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:28,540
Began work on the list three months terry the project designed to create the perfect soldier

1351
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:31,940
Travis the chimps DNA was recovered to create two clones

1352
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:34,720
solid Travis and liquid Travis

1353
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:40,820
Hi, and Liquid Travis 8 saw the Travis's face in the test tube.

1354
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:48,700
And now Liquid Travis lives through me, through this arm. The man you called Gold Deagle Ocelot no longer exists.

1355
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:52,820
I have no affinity for that tawdry and gaudy weapon anymore.

1356
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:56,080
I love you! Why should I bother? I love- I- well, hello.

1357
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,380
Why should I bother with a measly firearm when I have a chimp arm?

1358
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:07,360
You think this hand would be more useful if its fingers are made to tangle about the handle of a gold-plated handgun?

1359
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,380
Chambered in 50 action express my hand must remain empty and open

1360
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:16,900
So that I may mangle about the faces and thumbs of my enemies now

1361
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:21,940
I will show you Travis's power hold out your faces at hand so I may rip them off

1362
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:29,040
I hold out my face in my hands

1363
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,040
Me too.

1364
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,040
I guess I'll do it.

1365
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:36,040
This is the first time I've ever seen such instant fealty.

1366
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,600
No one has ever...

1367
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,600
Do you like this?

1368
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,600
I love you!

1369
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
Hi!

1370
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:50,840
I now am remembering the friendship of these individuals who I've gone on many heists with.

1371
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:56,440
I've never seen actual hairless human faces in 30 years.

1372
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,440
And my fused form face factor is-

1373
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,440
Yeah, no one else can hear us!

1374
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,440
Yeah.

1375
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,440
I just thought about it.

1376
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,440
Fused form face factor of my brain is

1377
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,440
undergoing the same transformation as, like,

1378
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,440
as it would under an

1379
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,440
ayahuasca trip.

1380
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,440
I remember who I am all at once.

1381
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,440
And my eyes-

1382
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,440
Have we got ice cream?

1383
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,440
I- Now I'm remembering I got ice cream.

1384
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,440
*laughter*

1385
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,440
After a yoga.

1386
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,440
Um.

1387
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,440
And yeah, I guess now my eyes

1388
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:31,120
are just sort of fixated on the on the golden gun. So what do you say? My

1389
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:39,000
chip-bomb starts to vibrate. What do you say Travis? You up for one last job?

1390
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,200
Question mark?

1391
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:55,400
So now I pick up the gun. I remember this feeling. The balance. The ambidextrous

1392
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:04,880
union, the akimbo stability, the pure shiny symmetry of the dual-wielded weight. I remember

1393
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:11,640
my time as a special operative trickshot expert, my across-the-map bullet drop kill on JFK

1394
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:18,080
at Dealey Plaza, my reload-canceled triple headshot on Paul McCartney, Avril Lavigne,

1395
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:25,000
Dave Chappelle, my double 360 no scope with two gold plated heart attack guns on Bernie

1396
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Sanders.

1397
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,880
It's all coming back to me.

1398
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,880
And it feels right.

1399
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:35,480
And then I remember we got we got taco tacos.

1400
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:43,280
I do it over the shoulder juggle both desert eagles while I remember the taco truck.

1401
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,280
That was awesome.

1402
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,960
Yeah, that was the only chocolate truck I've ever seen that had ice cream tacos

1403
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:56,040
Is it gonna be hard for you to say goodbye to your kingdom that you have built for yourself here

1404
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,880
uh

1405
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,800
the magazines of my golden desert eagles extend into

1406
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,020
uh

1407
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,020
infinity and I

1408
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:09,400
instantly do gun kata on my whole chimp tribe and

1409
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,400
I killed them all in three seconds

1410
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:14,880
Whoa!

1411
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,520
That was so cool!

1412
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,240
Now I remember why I like you.

1413
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,480
Cause you kill monkeys!

1414
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:27,480
Yeah, and he did that to the taco truck on us too!

1415
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,440
Wait, is there any monkeys involved in this heist?

1416
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,440
I can't remember.

1417
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,960
Are we like attacking a monkey chariot?

1418
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,600
I don't think so.

1419
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,080
But you should be okay.

1420
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:41,000
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

1421
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
This is a magic- when you get nervous, close your eyes and imagine everyone's a monkey.

1422
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Don't- please don't do that.

1423
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Um, are you in?

1424
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds fun.

1425
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
[laughter]

1426
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,360
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1427
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,360
I'd burn it probably.
