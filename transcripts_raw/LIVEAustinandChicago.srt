1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Come here come here come here. Let me see your butt

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:14,840
What the fuck is up

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,680
Hi

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,440
We are so glad to not be in Fort Worth right now. Oh my god yesterday

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,440
We opened for a Led Zeppelin cover band. Yeah, not a joke. We opened for a fucking Led Zeppelin cover band named so so

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,480
Show went well. I was gonna go nuclear option and say Google Laurie Maddox, but

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,640
Didn't have to do that

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,400
Yeah, I've never opened for a Led Zeppelin cover band before I think it may we just start playing Led Zeppelin music just on stage

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,520
Yeah, before they go up. They were so good though. They were fucking

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
They were so sick. They were so good.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,520
We did the show in Fort Worth and the guy was like,

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,520
he was like, "Dude, that was great. That was such a great show."

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,520
And it was so great.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,520
You guys can like stay for the Led Zeppelin band for free if you want to.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,520
I really wish we did.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
We should have, yeah.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,520
I wanted to share a green room with them like so bad.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Me too.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,520
They would walk by and like look in and just be like, "No."

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,520
There was a guy with, he had like bright green hair and a motorhead shirt on

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,160
And he kept like dropping every drum. He picked up like you pick up a piece of a drum to just break it

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,240
Yeah, he was fucking awesome. It was really cool sick. Yeah, we like Austin a lot more. I'm really glad you guys came out

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Thank you. Yeah

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,440
For keeping it weird yeah, it is I did notice. It's a bit weird here

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
There's a kind of a weird vibe.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm seeing some odd people with funny shirts on.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Seriously, some funny shirts and some odd hats.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Maybe, yeah, kind of baseball or dad hat style.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Yeah, why would you wear that? And big pants too.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
What's going on in this weird-ass city?

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah, that's weird.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
[laughter]

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
That's really weird.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Pat's been on a bit of a shopping spree during this whole tour.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Oh yeah, yeah I have been.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
What are the things you bought?

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,800
I bought, well, so the venue we went to yesterday was downwind from the Dickies factory.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I could smell the pants.

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I could, oh, I sniffed them out.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I sniffed them out almost immediately.

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
It was, I bought some really big shorts yesterday.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Some terrible birth defects in the communities downwind from the Dickies factory.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Yeah, they're all wearing coveralls and shit.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,080
Yeah, but I made us go 20 minutes out of the way getting here because I found it.

46
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,800
Do you know what the whole shebang is?

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,200
The whole shebang is a type of chip they only sell at this specific private prison.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,760
So they make like three types of chips.

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,200
There's like whole shebang, there's like whole shebang fully loaded and then there's these

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,000
ones here which are called delicious.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
>> Really? >> Yeah.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,340
>> Let me see those. >> I figured make it special.

53
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,580
>> Live taste test. >> Do you want a live delicious chip taste

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,460
test? >> I've done it enough on the show.

55
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,020
>> What's on the side? >> It says chips original flavor.

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:36,040
>> It says chips original flavor and it also says ingredients.

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,360
says ingredients. >> Well, fuck, pop them open. I'm hungry.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,480
>> Yeah. >> Here. I'll hold your mic for you.

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,240
>> Okay. Thank you. >> Oh, my God!

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,240
>> I really thought that was going to jump out into the audience.

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
>> I thought that was going to do a lot better. >> I really thought that was going to kill

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
somebody. >> I thought it was going to pop out.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
>> It's going to be awesome. Somebody is going to have the snake with them. They get to take

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
it home. >> It's going to fly into the ceiling.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,800
>> I thought it was going to fly way higher. >> Going to shoot a hole right in the ceiling.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,520
>> Whoa! How weak are you in ways? >> We had a whole joke written about how it's

67
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:19,880
the only joke we wrote. And now it's ruined. Why even do it? I don't know.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,640
>> Well, that's the end of the show. >> Thank you. Good night.

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,360
>> We are doing a list. We're going to do the podcast actually. We're not just going to do

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,540
props. No, that's for the Vegas show. We're opening for Carrot Top, very big.

71
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,860
We're doing it for six months straight, that's all we have. Yeah, we're doing the thing that

72
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,060
bands on tour do where they share gear. We're sharing all of Carrot Top's props.

73
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,460
Yeah, that was one of them. That was one of his props, the snake in the gym. He updated it for

74
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,020
the modern era because no one's buying peanut brittle anymore. Yeah, so we're

75
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,580
doing a list and we actually do have a special guest with us. You

76
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,580
may be familiar with him. He was just on stage. Please give it up for Pierce Campion everybody!

77
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Keep it going for Pierce! Keep it going for Pierce! He's from before! Hi! Hi Pierce! Turn

78
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:24,580
his mic on please, hi! Hi Pierce! Yeah! How do you like Austin so far? This is awesome!

79
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,080
That? I don't think that was here before us.

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,580
This is my favorite city I've been to.

81
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,080
You think it's... okay.

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Dude, I wish that they sold those in prison.

83
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,580
Me too. Those people deserve one more thing bad happening to them.

84
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,080
If you ask me.

85
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
I wish the snake was real.

86
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,580
Yeah.

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,080
So, we're doing a list today.

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
People in prison should just get pranked.

89
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,580
That should be the whole sentence.

90
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,080
Maybe you should have an option to do half as much time,

91
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,580
but you get pranked at least once per day.

92
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,120
If you get pranked every day.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,040
Like you'll just open a door to the bathroom,

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,580
you've been fucking stamping license plates for 19 hours.

95
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,400
Caleb, I do think a lot of people get really badly pranked in prison

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
when they go in the bathroom.

97
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,300
It's so interesting.

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

99
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,540
Prisoners prank each other. Can you imagine such a thing?

100
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,580
They don't even get paid to do it.

101
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,260
They do it for the love of the game.

102
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,860
Well then, all is well in this beautiful world.

103
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,100
I'm fine with it then.

104
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,540
Yeah, we're doing a list today.

105
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,100
It's called Top 10 Deadliest Big Cats from thetop10s.com.

106
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,620
you guys like big cats or something what's going on with you

107
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,860
across america europe asia and africa all over the world the top ten deadliest of

108
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,540
the amazing family the big cats

109
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,340
i would say the uh... kennedy's might be the most amazing family personal

110
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,940
well okay i might say the card action s

111
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,340
uh... all right so number one here

112
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,740
bengal tiger

113
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,300
yeah okay

114
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,820
what i think

115
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
uh...

116
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,820
It's orange, right?

117
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,100
Why did you pick this list?

118
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,820
I picked it because...

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,500
Tiger, biggest cat on earth, very agile, fast enough to hunt in wild, thunderously striking,

120
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,060
fearless roar of tiger, often used for voiceover of lion in cinema.

121
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,140
His most scaring noise can hunt anything that come before him, live lonely while lion hunt

122
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,140
with its pride.

123
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,540
Most sharp teeth and strong jaws, tear off easily, fur of brown bear or lion.

124
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,860
My favorite tiger.

125
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Wow.

126
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
Fur.

127
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,860
Wow.

128
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
Yeah.

129
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,260
of people who feel really really strongly about a lot of different big cats. I had

130
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,700
no idea. I didn't either. I don't think I've ever even seen a big cat in person.

131
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,660
I've seen, yeah you did. We went to alligator adventure. Did they have a lion there?

132
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,340
They had a bobcat. I thought they had alligators there. A bobcat barely counts as a big cat.

133
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,620
That's a big cat. That's a medium cat. A bobcat's a big cat. Well fuck you, no a bobcat is a big cat.

134
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,060
It's a medium cat. It's three versus one little guy. That's bigger than a house cat. What are you

135
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,260
talking that doesn't mean it's a big cat is a small... fuck. Would you call Garfield a big cat?

136
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,300
No it's not real. He's bigger than a house cat though. A house cat is a small cat. Yep. What about a dog? Would you call that bigger?

137
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,300
A big cat? No it's not a cat. Bigger than a house cat though. What about a giant rock? Would you call that a big cat?

138
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,980
You probably would. Yeah a bear. Yeah what about a bear? What about a cat the size of the universe?

139
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,060
Yeah that's a big cat. That is actually a huge cat. That is probably the biggest cat ever.

140
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,460
I don't count a bobcat or a lynx. Those aren't big cats. Yeah I don't think I would count them either.

141
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,260
>> Then you're stupid. >> Huh?

142
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,060
>> The beast! >> Sorry. The beast.

143
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,500
>> The beast. >> That's a comment on tiger?

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
>> The beast. >> Okay.

145
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,980
>> Yeah. The beast. I don't know if they're trying to say the beast or the best.

146
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,420
>> I didn't even consider that. >> Could be both.

147
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,780
>> The beast. It's funny. Bengal tiger kill many people. In British India, one female

148
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,460
tiger killed 400,000 people. They are deadly as cats. They can easily kill a lion. Lion

149
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,740
is a baby in front of Tiger. Learn something new every day. I didn't realize 400,000 people.

150
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,740
400,000 people. One tiger. The same tiger? It was one female tiger. One female tiger killed

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,740
400,000 people. They're so awesome and strong they can kill the tiger equivalent of a baby.

152
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,060
That's true. That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually that's really logical of you.

153
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,060
Yeah. Yeah. We need you for the logic. Right. It's actually not impressive if you can kill

154
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:20,480
a baby. Even a baby lion? If you're a tiger, it don't matter. It says lion is a baby in

155
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,980
front of tiger. Right. So to a tiger, killing a lion is killing a baby. Oh, yeah, it's not

156
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,060
that impressive. It's cruel. Yeah, it's actually really mean. Thank God they don't do it. It's

157
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,180
like doing a backflip for tigers. I think doing a backflip is harder than killing a

158
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,700
a baby. Like a human doing a back flip is like. Listen, I could not do a back flip. I could

159
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,460
probably kill like a hundred babies in a minute. I'm just, I'm trying to find an equipment here.

160
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,740
If there are babies above you and below you. If I had some kind of machine that I don't

161
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:04,220
have. Um, two lion. Yeah, the lion. Some woos and some boos. Some tiger fans, I mean it's

162
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,020
>> Very polarizing. >> Controversial list.

163
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,940
>> What's this legal tigers, what's this fucking, I keep seeing these billboards that say like

164
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,940
law tigers. Yeah. >> Was it illegal to be a tiger at one point?

165
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,540
>> Oh, okay. >> I keep seeing, you know what? I saw that

166
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:38,940
in Virginia. That's not here. I love loin. I do too. Please vote for the king, I am just

167
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:48,820
a child. He wishes he could do more. He wishes he could be out on the street corner. He's

168
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,700
not old enough to vote for it. Yeah, that's exactly. That's really rough. But when he

169
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,000
grows up. He'll vote for loin. It's going to tip the scales. Lion's going to be number

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,840
1, not tiger. Disgusting Bengal tiger. Lions are born killers and will always be killers.

171
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,260
My most favorite movie is a Lion King movie called The Lion King 1, 2, 3 by Rahul S. the

172
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:15,220
Dinosaur Boy. I think the Dinosaur Boy might be number 1 deadliest. Yeah. That's all the

173
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,180
evil in a dinosaur and in man yeah yeah that's that I mean it's not a cat but if

174
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,500
it was a dinosaur cat boy yeah that'd be really it might be really deadly and

175
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,620
terrible who will name Rahul I feel like if you're a lion fan you have to hate

176
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:40,220
Lion King mm-hmm cuz that's why cuz they talk they eat all kinds of they love

177
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,580
little toys did you guys think that Nala from the Lion King was really attractive

178
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:55,340
growing up? Yes. I actually rooted for Simba. You are fucked up beyond all repair. No, I

179
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,100
rooted for him to get Nala. Should I have rooted for myself instead? You thought I had

180
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:10,700
a cuck fantasy. Yeah. What's the S in Rahul's last name? Stegosaurus? I don't think it's

181
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,140
>> I want to go over there with them for the rest of the show.

182
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,700
Number three is Siberian tiger, different tiger.

183
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
>> Yep.

184
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
>> Looks the same to me.

185
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
I don't know.

186
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,340
>> No, actually there's snow in front of it.

187
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
>> Oh, yeah.

188
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
Yeah, that's a good point.

189
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
>> That's just the projection.

190
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
>> I like this tiger.

191
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Third place is great.

192
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
I'm glad first place is a tiger.

193
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
I love them.

194
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,980
Go, go, tiger.

195
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
So nice and sweet.

196
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
That one's just nice.

197
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
>> Yeah, that is very sweet.

198
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,900
>> Made me smile when I read it.

199
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Also this one.

200
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:44,900
the tiger is 500 times stronger than a car. >> What proof? A car?

201
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,980
>> What proof do you have? >> I feel like if you hit a tiger with your

202
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:55,300
car ‑‑ >> If you hit 499 tigers with your car, your

203
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,300
car would break. >> I think the 500 ‑‑

204
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,980
>> If 499 cars hit a tiger, they would all break. But if 500 hit a tiger, they would both

205
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,980
break. Okay. Now I get it. I get it now. I love it. I can watch you two do math all fucking

206
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,260
day. I can just sit here. I'm actually like so good at math. I can tell. Four. That's

207
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:27,260
what comes after three. Oh my god. Jaguar. It's looking at you guys. It's coming for

208
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,820
you after the show. I hope nobody hears a bad weather. It should have been a jaguar,

209
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,820
hotter. Oh yeah. Or a house cat. Or a woman. What? What's, yeah, the thing that lives with

210
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:44,780
you, what's sexier than that? That's a very good point. You covet what you see every day

211
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:51,440
folks. Especially when it's showing off like that. I just saw a video of a jaguar jumping

212
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,780
into the river, going underwater, snatching up a crocodile and dragging back up out of

213
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,620
the water and into the jungle. A crocodile has to be one of the top ten baddest water

214
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,900
animals and a jaguar went to his turf and won and it's like it wasn't even a big deal for

215
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,420
the jaguar. Me and my friends used to argue who would win in a fight, Superman or the

216
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,780
Hulk but now we all agree that if we watch them fight a jaguar would just jump in and

217
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,860
snatch them up and drag them off into the jungle. I don't believe that. The scenario

218
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,900
is so funny to me that you're imagining a fight between Spiderman or yeah, Superman and

219
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,980
the Hulk and your friend's like no a jaguar would just come out and eat them both. Yeah

220
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,060
those two characters are fighting next to a jungle.

221
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,820
Yeah.

222
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,540
Just outside.

223
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,220
It's the same as saying like, like Spider-Man versus Batman,

224
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,540
but the police would stop them.

225
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,700
Yeah, exactly.

226
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,860
Obviously, the police would win the fight.

227
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,020
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,740
Then we got--

229
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,780
Which they would.

230
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,180
And also they should, like, I don't

231
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,140
know why they let them do that.

232
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,540
Yeah, it's actually really not nice.

233
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,780
This baby has something we call total control overnight.

234
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,500
I had no idea.

235
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,900
I say that all the time.

236
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,620
Five, Liger.

237
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:01,620
>> That's a cheat code on them. >> Yeah. So it's a crossbreed I guess between

238
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:11,060
a lion and a tiger and as this person says, it halved tiger, halved lion. And I don't like

239
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,780
crossbreeding but the ligerism makes them my favorite animals.

240
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,660
>> I think you should analyze that. >> I want to hear more from this person.

241
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,180
>> Yeah. >> But you don't have anything from them?

242
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,940
>> We don't have anything from them. A most moronic animal.

243
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,380
>> Come on. He's out there trying his best. >> Yeah, he can't help it.

244
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,020
>> Yeah, he can't help it. He's a freak. They're infertile, right?

245
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
>> Yeah, I think so. >> Ligers?

246
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,820
>> Yeah, I don't know. >> I saw a liger when I was a kid. They had

247
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,860
one of like a renaissance. Yeah, I saw Napoleon Dynamite II. I saw a real liger.

248
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,980
>> You said you saw the liger? >> I saw a liger. I don't think there are

249
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,620
that many of them though, although that could have just been something they said at the

250
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,460
renaissance fair. I think it's like blimps, I think there's like three in the US. It was

251
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,380
so fucking big, it was probably like ten feet long. Do you think the lion, is the lion,

252
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:08,380
it stood up on a ladder. What's up? Did it juggle? What? Did it juggle? No. Did it eat

253
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,300
something? There was a guy who juggled, but it was separate. I don't believe you saw a

254
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,300
liger at the renaissance. They probably said it was a liger. It probably was. I was a child.

255
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Yeah. So it was big and you were a child. They called it a liger.

256
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Okay. They said this was a liger. Do you think the lion is like stoked to fuck the

257
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,300
tiger? Maybe. Yeah.

258
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Um. Yeah. They're never going to do that unless we make them do it. Right?

259
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Yeah. So they might be like, well, fuck. I guess they probably don't cross paths

260
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,300
that often in the wild. Do you think, okay, well, do you think the mom

261
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,420
Was a lion well so the dad's the lion the dad has the head the cool hair yeah

262
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,060
So what if okay, so here's what I'm thinking they probably painted the lion

263
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,660
No, cuz feet okay hold on what I forgot no

264
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:01,620
I forgot what it looked like I thought they would paint the lion to look like a tiger no

265
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,700
They put a wig on the on the tiger. I think I think that's how they you're getting hung up on

266
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,120
Which one is the boy and girl it doesn't I don't think it matters. I'm not sure I think it matters

267
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,480
I think it matters a little bit. I don't know if it matters at all.

268
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,680
But I think what does matter is whether or not they painted them.

269
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,520
Yeah, I think it might be easier to paint a tiger.

270
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,960
Because it's just one dip. You could dunk them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's actually such a good point.

271
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,880
Number six is a snow leopard. Great.

272
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,160
A lot of snow leopard fans here.

273
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,440
You guys love every cat. Yeah, what's up with it? All right.

274
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,480
>> Snow leopard mostly live in snow. Just a little background information for you guys

275
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,680
about the snow leopard. Same as leopard because same spot.

276
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,800
>> Again, another important fact. >> Another really good point that I didn't

277
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,440
think about before I was looking at this list. But number 7 is normal leopard.

278
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,440
>> Boo! >> Nothing but normal leopard.

279
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,640
>> Fuck this leopard. >> It's a less cool snow leopard, I have to

280
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,080
say but this person says, leopards are very fast, dangerous, smart, clever and cunning.

281
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,640
They have no respect for lions. They are found in most of the places. They are mostly night

282
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,120
hunters. They have very sharp teeth. If it attacks you, won't survive. In fact, journal

283
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,380
will die in few seconds. Mostly they are not afraid of bears. They attack gorillas but

284
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,880
nothing can kill them. They have a good power of smelling and has a sixth sense. They have

285
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,800
very deadly nails. They can attack four people at a time. They are good swimmers, excellent

286
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,080
climbers and best hunters. >> What's the sixth sense?

287
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
Telepathy, I think.

288
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,780
Oh, okay.

289
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,580
It might be telepathy, yeah.

290
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,380
That makes sense.

291
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,980
Yeah, it could either be telepathy or maybe cat sense.

292
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,680
I would say the cat sense, yeah.

293
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Whiskers.

294
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,980
Whiskers might be whiskers.

295
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
The sixth sense is whiskers.

296
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,680
I like that it can attack four people at a time.

297
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,380
Let's do it.

298
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,680
Yeah, it's like the...

299
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,180
Let's go, there's a zoo here, right?

300
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Let's get a leopard in here right now.

301
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,480
Mythbusters, we should reboot Mythbusters.

302
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,680
Trust me, I would take one down.

303
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,380
Every myth is, "Can an animal attack four guys at a time?"

304
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,980
It's just us four walking into an animal's cage.

305
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
No, we only got two.

306
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,780
It doesn't say it can win against four people.

307
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,280
That's true. It says it can't attack.

308
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,080
I can attack four guys, you four.

309
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,980
It's because it has four legs.

310
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,880
Yeah, it just spreads out like this.

311
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Yeah, as long as the...

312
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,480
It can jump up and do like a matrix kick.

313
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,180
Yes.

314
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,080
Yeah, but with all four legs.

315
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,880
It's like the Mike V of animals.

316
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,680
Oh, okay.

317
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,480
That I... There's one person who laughed, thank God.

318
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,880
That's all I needed.

319
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,080
Number eight is a different kind of leopard I never heard of.

320
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,360
of an Amer leopard. >> That's not real.

321
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,680
>> I don't know. Might not be real. I'm not sure. But they say, I think they are the most

322
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,720
dangerous cats on the planet. Even though they are endangered, they still have the same

323
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,840
right to earn a top place. I read online and saw a picture that an Amer leopard killed

324
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,120
15 birds, five wild cats and two humans. Trying to make the third.

325
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:02,720
>> Let's make it three tonight. Let's go. >> I misread that. I thought that it attacked

326
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,560
two humans fucking. I thought it was they attacked two humans. I like that it's ambiguous whether

327
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,000
the leopard was trying to kill a third person or if this guy really wants to get killed by

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,240
a leopard. Yeah. I'm trying to make it a third. He's talking about how many kids he's had.

329
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,320
He's like two, going for three, I don't know. We'll try it out. I don't like this leopard.

330
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,820
Yeah.

331
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,520
I don't either.

332
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
It attacked two people trying to make a third.

333
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,020
Leave them alone.

334
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,820
Number nine is Cougar.

335
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,220
Yeah.

336
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,320
Yeah, these are pretty cool.

337
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,820
I don't know.

338
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,920
Was responsible for Feathertail's death.

339
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,420
Rose Weasley.

340
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,620
Who's Feathertail?

341
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,120
Don't know.

342
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,620
Warrior Cats.

343
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,320
What's Warrior Cats?

344
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,120
Oh, he doesn't know Warrior Cats.

345
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,920
What the fuck are you?

346
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,320
You're making shit up.

347
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,420
Did you write this?

348
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,660
(laughter)

349
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,160
(audience member speaks)

350
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,000
- Oh, that furries were--

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,820
- I don't think they turned,

352
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,980
I think they were born that way.

353
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,380
- I thought concussions turned people into furries.

354
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,900
(laughter)

355
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,060
I didn't know it was a book.

356
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,340
- Or poor home life.

357
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,180
- Yeah.

358
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,000
- Yeah.

359
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,060
- I thought divorce made people furries, not books.

360
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,340
- I thought it might be poor boundaries with pets.

361
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,180
- Yeah, that too, probably.

362
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,780
- That turned people into furries.

363
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,820
Poop, they poop a lot, that's what I think, ha ha.

364
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,100
- Yeah, true.

365
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:28,940
probably true number 10 smilodon what that is a saber-toothed tiger it's an

366
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,940
extinct big cat this isn't real now this is not really was real it's not real

367
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:43,340
anymore now you have to draw a line somewhere cuz if you can just add stuff

368
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:51,220
that's not real do you say you have to draw a line somewhere no let's go the

369
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,860
The Smilodons are probably extinct because they killed sometimes their own kind.

370
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,900
If you look O images of them most look very unfriendly, so I am Hwessing the Smilodon as

371
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,260
most dangerous cat.

372
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
That's Hussein.

373
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Hussein.

374
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,660
So I am Hussein.

375
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,380
I am Hussein, the Smilodon is most dangerous cat.

376
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,120
Can't be that deadly, it's extinct, LOL.

377
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,000
That ain't nice brother.

378
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That is kind of fucked up.

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
Yeah it is, it is kind of rude.

380
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,380
I think they were very deadly back in the day probably.

381
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,380
I don't know.

382
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,020
Is that not the same thing as a saber tooth?

383
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,300
I think it's the same thing.

384
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
From the Ice Age movies?

385
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I think saber tooth...

386
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Yeah, that's Dennis Leary.

387
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,340
I think saber tooth tiger is like a colloquial name.

388
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,740
Because Smilodon wasn't like good enough?

389
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
That's the best name I've ever heard.

390
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
It's a cool name, yeah.

391
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,780
Because it makes me think it smiles.

392
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,340
It kind of does.

393
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,740
Okay, so this is the contenders, the ones that didn't make the top ten.

394
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,180
There's a few of these here.

395
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,780
Number 12, the cheetah.

396
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,240
Cheetahs are beautiful, lovely creatures.

397
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,140
My friend and I are both very fast.

398
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,540
Therefore, Cheetah is our shared nickname.

399
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,860
Does that mean there's Cheetah when it's the two of them?

400
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,660
Yeah, but if it's only one of them, they don't say anything.

401
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,140
You can't say, yeah.

402
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
There's Debbie.

403
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,140
Fast Debbie.

404
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,740
She's fast, but if she was with her friend, they would be Cheetah.

405
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Yeah, she's fast by herself, but you should see her be Cheetah with one other guy.

406
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
That would be awesome.

407
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,980
They get into like a Cheetah costume.

408
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
It's like one half.

409
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Oh yeah, yeah.

410
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,820
It's like one of the horse costumes.

411
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Yeah.

412
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,820
Number 13 is Tigon.

413
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,820
These only exist if it's a female. The males are ligers.

414
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
If I'm wrong, these don't exist.

415
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,820
My dad's an animal sensitist.

416
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,820
I believe them.

417
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,820
Yeah. I think this person might be an animal scientist, too.

418
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
- Yeah. - Sensitist.

419
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
- Sensitist, yeah. It's different. - Sensitist.

420
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,820
Yeah. It's someone who's sincerely interested in animals.

421
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Number 16 is Jaglion.

422
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,820
A hybrid between a jaguar and a lion, a very, very strong cat.

423
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:51,820
strong cat. Sounds interesting. Suck me off! >> Yeah.

424
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,380
>> Suck me off! >> That's just rude.

425
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,180
>> Are they saying suck me off like this would never fucking exist.

426
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,740
>> What I want to know is why somebody went on this list, scrolled all the way down to

427
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,660
number 16 before commenting suck me off. You could have done it right at the top.

428
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,940
>> Do it at the first two, yeah. >> What is it about jag lion that makes you

429
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,700
want to get sucked off. >> Because you're jagging your line.

430
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,340
>> That's a really good point. >> Because you're jagging your line off.

431
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:29,460
>> And they're like suck me off. >> Number 19 is saber tooth cat. These aren't

432
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,980
cats. Sorry on top tens it's hard to get the period key on the keyboard to work so I use

433
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,540
exclamation points. They're not cats. I looked it up too.

434
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,500
Isn't that only use one exclamation point they'll use to

435
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:50,120
Better math it's Caleb was better math. Not me. He can't even get to - he's very stupid. Yeah, you're not gonna clap for me

436
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,380
Okay, fine

437
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,380
Yeah

438
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:59,640
That happened nowhere stupid that was crazy. Oh my god. All right this next one's the last one

439
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,140
But it's probably my favorite one on here. Is it white tiger? What is it?

440
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,980
Guessing I that was my first guess

441
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,940
Stop stop. Okay. Okay. Wait, actually you get one more guess. Yeah, one more guess. You're not gonna I promise you won't guess what it is

442
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,220
black panther oh

443
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,820
No wrong. Okay, here it is. Number 20 is giant cheetah

444
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:28,220
People you need to stop adding random cast of this list. There is no such thing as a giant cheetah

445
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,260
There is a giant cheetah search it up. No giant cheetahs exist

446
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,000
There is giant cheetahs check your facts check in the net you people yeah, it's fake

447
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,460
There's no such thing as a giant really I was I got so excited

448
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,860
I really my heart skipped a beat well the biggest cheetah in the but that's like a

449
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,600
Like there's if there's like a record for like biggest I'll say it every fucking cheat is giant to me. Yeah, also that

450
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,320
Cheetahs actually aren't that big so you must be really small. I think maybe the coolest the coolest cats actually probably the blue blue line

451
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,660
I feel like that I think that blue lion might have been on there and I just

452
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,800
didn't put it in because there was definitely there was a bunch of ones

453
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,720

[laughter]

472
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,680
I feel like a rapper.

473
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,920
[imitates rap music]

474
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,680

Fuck, dude.

00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,720
Couldn't even hear him. He's the fastest rapper in the world.

479
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,960
That's a good idea.

480
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,480
You'd be the best battle rapper ever because you rap so fast.

481
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,720
They don't know if it was good or bad.

482
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,920
They gotta slow it down. It's like that guy from the Micro Machines commercials.

483
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Who's old here?

484
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
[laughter]

485
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,560
Who's the oldest person here?

486
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,800
What are you talking about?

487
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
It's, I, you know, it would be fast.

488
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,320
I love the eighties on VH1.

489
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,680
It'd be like, you're like, you're like a samurai

490
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,560
where you you're doing a battle rap.

491
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,320
You hold the mic up to your mouth and then nothing happens.

492
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,360
You put it down and then all the rap comes out

493
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,720
after you put it down really fast.

494
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,500
The screen flashes red.

495
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,340
That's smart.

496
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,160
Yeah.

497
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah. They'd have to slow it down

498
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,820
to even know what I'm talking about.

499
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,520
So they might just declare me the winner at the battle

500
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,920
before they even listen.

501
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,840
Well, he's probably.

502
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,480
All they'll have, they have to like go to the back room.

503
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,200
Like they have to, they have to like rewind.

504
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,300
Yeah, big referee comes out. I have to hear what he just said.

505
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,500
They're like circling your mouth with like an arrow.

506
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,400
It's an instant replay of the projectile, like the path of my

507
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,900
tongue.

508
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,400
Yeah, like a golf ball.

509
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,300
Well, at this point in the rap, he said that his mom was gay.

510
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,600
They weren't supposed to hear that part.

511
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,800
That was supposed to be mixed in.

512
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,200
Oh, man.

513
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,500
We came here to rap.

514
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,700
Yeah, we're mostly here to rap.

515
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,000
We hear this is a great rapping show.

516
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,400
Yeah. Yeah. So we're excited. I ate an Italian beef last night.

517
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,200
We went to Portillo's. I had so much diarrhea.

518
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,400
Is that like a good place?

519
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,200
Yes!

520
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Because I feel like fucking shit.

521
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
[laughter]

522
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,800
I feel... It was so... It was perfect, but I'm paying for it.

523
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
Yeah, it was a bad decision.

524
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,400
Yeah, I know. I'm feeling really, really bad.

525
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,600
And then they had the gall to put hot peppers on top of it, too.

526
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,400
I was like, I'm already eating two whole cows in one sandwich.

527
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,200
Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,360
this is bad

529
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,600
i think that also maybe you feeling bad might be because you're in a closed

530
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,520
bathroom with fumes for an hour i don't think that was it i don't think uh...

531
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,000
i did have a tied trash bag on my head to keep the bleach from getting anywhere

532
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,860
uh... my mouth was in the trash bag

533
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,120
as the bleach is sitting on my scalp it was a full trash bag

534
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,000
i forgot you're supposed to get like a shower cap or something

535
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,440
not for me i had a walgreens bag

536
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,840
yeah no it wasn't it was a it was a green bag

537
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
it was i was worried that the bag the dive from the bag

538
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,920
the only other thing i would rather bag it had a green bag they don't have a

539
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,880
green bags and walgreens thanks i don't like it with ball greens pretty thankful

540
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,880

541
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,280

542
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,360
uh... much we had to hop into the list unity uh... uh... yeah i guess we have

543
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,200

544
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,480
i don't know

545
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,940
do you have any anybody else and i think we need to talk about

546
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,820
that i think we can do the show i think that's a lot of our we got a list

547
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,480
everybody

548
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,320

550
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,260
yeah

551
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,700
uh... when you hear me the quicker okay here you go

552
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,300
right uh... are you know how to use it you just press the next but i guess it's

553
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,180
uh... cool

554
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,580
so who did this one

555
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,900
I don't think it's not. Is there is it not working? It's not going to read to 80%

556
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,980
of the people in the room. Pat, you're putting a green light on my. Yeah. All

557
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,460
right, then move. It didn't even read to me. And you guys see this, this crass

558
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,780
thing. He's doing has a green laser in it. Yeah. Holy shit. No, but seriously,

559
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,780
what is that? Where did that thing go? No, where does that though? What is it?

560
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,180
Let me grab. Let me hold on. Wait, where'd it go? I don't know. Where is it?

561
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,020
It's right here. It's right here. It's, um, can you get that?

562
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,020
He got it.

563
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:27,100
So this is the top 10 worst last names. Uh, so number one here is,

564
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,380
uh, I mean, I feel like this is probably obvious. Okay.

565
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,380
Uh, Bieber. Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,820
Yo shots fired. Um, I don't know if we got, got any believers in Chicago. Is he?

567
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,060
Yeah, I know. I think he was born here.

568
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,260
Well, is he? He was?

569
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,360
I think.

570
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
She was?

571
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,460
Damn.

572
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,360
That's right.

573
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,860
That's right, dude.

574
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,060
No, thank you.

575
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,460
So, first one is Bieber.

576
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,160
Here's what somebody had to say about this.

577
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,060
"Yuck, this reminds me of Justin Bieber. Too much."

578
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
And, "I think he sings like a little girl."

579
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,760
I think maybe Caleb wrote that.

580
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,660
I know.

581
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,160
I didn't because it would have sounded like...

582
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,960
Due to my rap ability.

583
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,620
You know anything that reminds me of Justin Bieber reminds me of Justin

584
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,400
Bieber too much. Am I right? That's right. Yeah, fuck you. I do like that.

585
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,920
They didn't think immediately like oh yeah,

586
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,660
it's not that's not who this is named after right off the bat. This is not

587
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,400
who it's about. I got this reminds me too much of him

588
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,480
that couldn't be him. There's not another Bieber that I know of except for

589
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,600
his hot mom. His

590
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,520
does he have a mom and his and his wife.

591
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
She at least acts hot.

592
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Yo, imagine marrying Justin Bieber and taking his name.

593
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,680
Hell no, it couldn't be me.

594
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
That's right.

595
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Worst last name ever.

596
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Number one, it's on the list.

597
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,320
Yeah, it's the number one worst last name.

598
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,920
That's the only reason I wouldn't marry you, you fucking beautiful ass.

599
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Yours too.

600
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,600
Here's something somebody else said.

601
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,160
I think someone is called Jamela Bieber.

602
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,800
Not the best name to have.

603
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Ha!

604
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,840
They're right.

605
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,240
I think Jamela Bieber might be the best name to have.

606
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
I disagree.

607
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
It's got the...

608
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
I think maybe a little better.

609
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,240
His name was Jamila Bieber.

610
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,240
We would probably be doing Lincoln Hall instead of Shoebus.

611
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,240
[laughter]

612
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
We'd probably be doing the freakin' bean.

613
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Yeah.

614
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
That's right.

615
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
You guys know the bean?

616
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
Yeah!

617
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Yeah!

618
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Yeah!

619
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
The bean!

620
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Yeah, that thing is awesome.

621
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,240
What is there to say? It's a perfect thing.

622
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
It's big, it's round.

623
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
You can see your mom, but she looks 30% fatter in it.

624
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Uh-huh.

625
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
It's fuckin' cool.

626
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,800
still haven't seen it. >> What were you expecting to get for that?

627
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,760
>> I was expecting a sympathetic -- >> The entire crowd --

628
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,560
>> I was expecting the entire crowd at unison to say go see the bean.

629
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,160
>> See the bean. >> See the bean.

630
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,440
>> See the bean. >> See the bean.

631
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
>> Okay. >> Bitch ass.

632
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,920
>> You guys have malleable brains. >> Next one here.

633
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:03,160
>> I'm still not sure how to pronounce it. >> Bi-aber?

634
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,860
be Iber be Iber be Iber be Iber a be up your something like that yeah

635
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,480
something along so that was the last of the way you the way you pronounce it is

636
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,320
paper, because that's how he sounds okay. That's fucking fire plus that's gay to

637
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,640
sound like that yeah yeah I'm have to add you to my rap crew. Yeah, that

638
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,400
sounds fun, so the next one, not you, you're not. I know I'm just saying it

639
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,920
sounds fun. Yeah, the next next worst last name any guesses

640
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,040
>> We're starting really high. >> Bieber's number one.

641
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
>> Hitler! >> Yeah.

642
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,040
>> You guys are cheering for Hitler, yo.

643
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,040
>> What the hell was that? >> What the fuck is wrong with this city?

644
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
>> What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

645
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,040
>> You immediately -- >> We're releasing only that clip.

646
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,040
>> Yeah. >> You guys are not us.

647
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,440
>> Yes. >> Individually we're going to January 6th

648
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,480
you, we're going to fucking -- >> Go to their house.

649
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,680
>> Full combat gear at their house. >> Each one of your houses.

650
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,080
>> I call being the shaman. >> So the first comment here, I feel so sorry

651
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,920
for any Germans who have this as a first name or a last name.

652
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
No I feel sorry for anyone who has this for a first name or a last name.

653
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,380
And then another comment here, anyone with this name would be taken as a joke because

654
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,380
he has a he was a German dictator during World War Two. This last

655
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,480
name is just sad.

656
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,980
Hitler is a first name. I think we can say now just from this

657
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,080
list. The worst name possible is Hitler Bieber.

658
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,880
Yeah.

659
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Yeah, that's because I never considered Hitler as a first

660
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,580
name because like I mean anything can be a you don't need

661
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,580
a lot of Hitler's you got a good point that yeah, anything

662
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,380
could be a first name.

663
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,280
If you have weird enough parents is the thing.

664
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,180
Yeah, that's true.

665
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Yeah, that would be I feel like that just be top 10 worst

666
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,180
his parents. I think I've talked about this on the podcast, but there's a guy

667
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:07,260
in my hometown. His name is Branch Leaf Olive. Oh yeah. I think I also told you

668
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,500
guys. Oh, he killed a guy. I just remembered.

669
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,300
He was breaking into a guy's car and the guy was like, "Can you knock that

670
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,860
off?" And he stabbed him and he killed him.

671
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,700
That's sweet. Branch Leaf Olive. Yeah. Imagine poking him. I told you guys about

672
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,660
that. That's such a peaceful name. I know. The guy who ordered from the

673
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,700
store that I worked at named Swastik Car.

674
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:35,940
>> Here's another comment here. I knew some bastard would make Hitler number one. I guess

675
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,600
it was number one at some point. I've heard way worse than any of these such many American

676
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,100
presidents and several commies, scumbags, not to mention Churchill, also Jackoff, and

677
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,980
he was a captain, so Captain Jackoff, also Buttram, who was a sports announcer on a local

678
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,780
television and Mr. Fox, my physics teacher.

679
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,780
You cannot go into teaching if you're your last name's fun.

680
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,880
Yeah, now they should literally they should that should be like

681
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,980
they should say no, you can't do that.

682
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,080
They should have a bar from entry like an occupational.

683
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,580
Like it's so easy to change your net.

684
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,280
Yeah, you should know like the test you they make you take in

685
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,380
in high school and guidance where it says what job they need

686
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,980
to like screen for that and it should say if your last name is

687
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,380
like fucks or I had a math teacher in high school whose last

688
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,780
name was cow sick. Oh, yeah, they should literally just tell you

689
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,180
you can't it's like a litmus test because you're already so

690
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,100
stupid. You didn't change your name by Yeah, it's for their own

691
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,540
good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,620
Somebody replied to this and said, the three names you

693
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,340
mentioned jacked off fucks and butt ram are unfortunate

694
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,500
sounding but Churchill Are you serious? Hitler on the other

695
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,420
hand is a hideous name to have what can I tell you?

696
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,420
Yeah, which yeah, no, they're like what? What kind of what innuendo do you get out of Churchill?

697
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,300
What innuendo do you get out of Hitler?

698
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Oh, well, hold on. So he was a dictator.

699
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:07,900
And it's a sad, it's a sad, it's a sad name. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Number three, number three

700
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,700

701
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
It's a cool name.

702
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
It is kind of a cool name.

703
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
It's like Captain Hook.

704
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,700
Yeah, with that ER. It's even cooler.

705
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
I guess that's true.

706
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Isn't there a blues city?

707
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Yeah, I see a lot of blues fans in the audience.

708
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
There's a lot of blues fans here.

709
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
I can tell you guys are blues heads.

710
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
John Lee Hooker? Yeah.

711
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Holy shit, there actually was one.

712
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
I didn't even have to say it.

713
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
Oh my fucking god.

714
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Huge blues fan here.

715
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
The city's as stupid as people said it was.

716
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
[laughter]

717
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,700
This is awesome.

718
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Um, what else did they say about this?

719
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
"How just what a hooker really?"

720
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,700
Yeah, pretty exasperated.

721
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,700
That's what I thought too when I saw that.

722
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
Yeah, "How just what a hooker really?"

723
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
"How just what a hooker really?"

724
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
What?

725
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
"How just what a hooker really?"

726
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Oh, okay, I see it now.

727
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
There's supposed to be ellipses here.

728
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,700
"How just what hooker really?"

729
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,700
Yep.

730
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
You didn't see that before?

731
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
No.

732
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
You thought it was a full, complete sentence?

733
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:17,500
that was a normal sentence here. The next one here is brown.

734
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,100
Oh, okay. Wait a second here.

735
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,100
What the fuck, Pat? What the hell's going on, man?

736
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,540
It's not a bad last name. Not as good as white. Not white enough.

737
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,420
Read that shit out. Last name equals mass name,

738
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,700
which what the fuck does that even mean? And then, because Evan is a dick.

739
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,100
Nick I like to think that this is a conversation that they were having.

740
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:51,900
Yeah, yeah, last name equals mass name. I think that that's that's a what is

741
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,700
that I can't even guess actually. Yeah, yeah, I was gonna put that in there

742
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,300
because I was really fucking confused. That's a good reason to put something in

743
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,300
a live show. Yeah,

744
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,200
and it confuses you. Yeah. Why'd you put the one through two and three?

745
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know.

746
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,280
>> Okay. Just checking. >> What's the next one here?

747
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:22,560
>> That's good but if you're making up names. >> Yeah. They should have a filter that cuts

748
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,120
out spam of people just mashing their keyboards. >> 15 more Zs and people are going to believe

749
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,720
it's Polish. >> I think there was a comment on this one

750
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,720
or no it's another Polish last name. They're not really, not really cool the Polish last

753
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,180

00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,780

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,600
- Yeah. - Who was it?

825
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,440
- My Uncle Paul.

826
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,720
- Wow.

827
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,560
- Yeah.

828
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,120
- Pretty. - What'd he graduate with?

829
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,720
- Not the top of his class, but.

830
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,880
He was there for an art major.

831
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,720
- It's a bad art school.

832
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,400
- Yeah, it's a terrible art school.

833
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,440
This next one here is Fokker.

834
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
It's pretty gay.

835
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,240
Yeah.

836
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,640
Yeah, I've never heard that last name.

837
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:15,940
Yeah.

838
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,540
Well, there's a couple movies.

839
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,740
I want you to see really.

840
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,640
Yeah, I might have to check those.

841
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,540
And let me tell you one of the guys first names.

842
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,540
It's pretty out there too.

843
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,140
Yeah, I can't wait to see you.

844
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,740
Here's a hint.

845
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,140
I hope it's poop or something.

846
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,440
That'd be really close.

847
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,040
Really?

848
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,240
Oh man blooper.

849
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,640
Is that what you said?

850
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,040
You hope it's blooper Fokker.

851
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,940
I said poop.

852
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,340
Oh,

853
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,040
all right.

854
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,040
That's better than that's better than blooper Fokker.

855
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:52,040
>> Here's the other one here. Pingas. >> We got the pingas clam showed out tonight.

856
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,440
>> The whole pingas family. >> Edouard pingas as usual I see. Everyone

857
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,480
will be embarrassed by this sentence. >> It does also remind me of a YouTube poop.

858
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,520
I can't remember which one. >> Here's another one.

859
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
i don't like the amount of stars on this one

860
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,520
yeah me neither

861
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520

862
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,520
at first i was like oh ok that would be a really bad name

863
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,520
it's obviously fucker

864
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,520
that's

865
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
i think you're right

866
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
i don't know

867
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
and i want to know what their last name is

868
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
they thought theirs was bad

869
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
yeah true

870
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
this guy must have a really bad last name

871
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,520
hitler

872
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
yeah

873
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
ah

874
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
drew

875
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
yeah

876
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
here's another one here

877
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,520
coin

878
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:44,360
If somebody called you coin, then you must change yourself into a coin.

879
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,480
I never thought about that before, but that makes a lot of sense.

880
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,480
And that's the last one I could find on that list.

881
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Okay.

882
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Well that's the list, ladies and gentlemen.

883
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
That's the list.

884
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:53,480
That's it.

885
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
(audience cheering)
