1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
Alright, we're on this real quick. Hold up. Why did you give me this small? What do you

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,440
mean? There's no small chair. It's just your is a you are not we are you or me. You and

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,120
me are the same height. No, this is not our height. I'm taller than you. Clearly. Yeah.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,160
What do you mean? You're sitting down in a higher chair. I'm in a chair. I'm in a normal

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,160
size chair. This is not acceptable. What do you mean this is not acceptable? Also I need

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,560
to get better mic stands because I keep having to lean down a little. Yeah. I don't think

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,560
that this is like a good mic stand at all. Maybe a little taller. Do you think we can

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,200
get ones that are a little taller? We complained about how tall these were. Does he have a

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,040
different one because that's like lined up to his face. This is perfect for me. This

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,000
this is perfect.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,420
This is amazing. It is actually perfect. It is literally a pro setup. This is

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,980
what you guys need to be doing going all the way down on the chair, which is

13
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,660
what the position that I'm in right now. I'm going to go down on a chair, go

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,600
lower. How would you go down on a chair on a buddy? Wait till I'm on stage.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,660
Okay, I'll show you go down on a chair. Show us how you would go down on a

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,560
go down on a chair chair right now.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,020
Well, usually usually you know the comics hump the chair right, but you

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,540
go down on it. Like where would you go down?

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,860
Okay, where do you go down on a chair?

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:39,020
You fall, you fall. Oh shit, he's doing it. Oh my God.

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,180
Oh dude, stop.

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,540
Put it in your mouth and kind of swipe the lip of it like a credit card.

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,020
They put it goo on me, dude. Oh shit, dude, you made it. You made it bus.

24
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,680
made the work. Look at the

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,940
the grease. That's not I

26
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:03,040
that's nasty chair bus. Can I come back up? I'm going to go down. I guess we're

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,860
going to go down yeah. All right, let me see this

28
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,100
not that much of a difference. You guys are still higher up. Yeah, I'll meet you

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,540
in the middle.

30
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,140
Okay, this is a good radio.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,260
It's very good. Really good radio. Yeah back for another one back for the

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,540
we're back. My girlfriend sent me a photo this morning and the caption just that

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,640
that never is the in beginning. We have stories explain this and I was like, oh

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,820
dear, what happened? Did I leave like a bunch of shit out in the kitchen?

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,000
Fucking sex that's so funny that kitchen completely gross and and every TV show

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,220
a movie someone gets a text from the girlfriend and says explain this and

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,060
they're like oh fuck. Oh, no and for pets like oh, no, I left a bunch of shit

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Yeah, I probably left a bunch of shit out. I probably did something like that.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Literally, identical fear as your mom texting you, "What's this?"

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,080
She said, "Explain this." And I was like, "Okay."

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
I opened the phone, look at it. It's a photo of me completely asleep.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,080
And somehow my cock has gone through the dickhole in my underwear.

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
While asleep.

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
While I'm asleep.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
That happens.

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm in my bed and I'm just rock hard in the morning.

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Rock hard.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,080
It's me in the bed and it's a really funny photo.

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,500
you had a rock show me all right.

50
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,420
It's really funny. I have to see this. We won't show the world. No, we can't

51
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,720
show the world. We can't show the world. This is not for the world. This is for

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
this is really three friends.

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,440
It looks like in my sleep.

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,400
You're jacking off. That's what it looks like.

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,600
It looks like you're good.

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,380
you did a thing where you were wet, you were jacking your shit and she walked in

57
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,860
and you're like I pretend to be dead. I was going to say you don't look like

58
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,720
you're asleep. You look like

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,720
you look like you're dead in the gutter. I always look dead whenever I'm asleep,

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,500
so for me to have like a yeah, it's like it's like when

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,860
like there's like a corner in a movie, it's like yeah, like one of the like if

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,060
a if a person dies when they're dead and they have a boner, they're going to

63
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,540
have the bone for the rest of their life. If a person dies when they're dead and

64
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,680
they have a boner, they're going to have the boner for the rest of their life.

65
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,740
You know what they say that in the movies. Well, how do they call him a

66
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,420
corner? Yeah

67
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:33,180
yeah yeah, wait a second. What is right? I think it's because that made Joe and

68
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,540
Alex leave yeah. They were asking that they did not like that at all. It's

69
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,620
okay, because core means body right yeah

70
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,980
now. Well, body means by a young little, little, little, little, and

71
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,480
in a

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,680
core. You're fucking blowing my mind right now. Yeah, sorry, learn a little

73
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,700
thing called etymology. Edamame. Oh yeah,

74
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,900
buddy, you have a lot to learn. I can teach you a thing or two about it. Well,

75
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,560
edamame make me grow breasts because of estrogenic. Does it have as I can even

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,540
think about that? Yeah, because of it's okay, but tell me that tell me at least

77
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,520
that the estrogen is on the shell and not on the bean inside, because I like

78
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,120
eating the bean inside and I'd I would honestly if I couldn't eat the shell on

79
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,740
that's that I wouldn't complain that much. Okay, all right, I admit it. It's

80
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,440
only the shell.

81
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,780
It's only the shell. I wouldn't be too mad if I couldn't eat the show. What's

82
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,060
the best shell? The best shell is the most tempting stuffed shell for show.

83
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,780
I'll say this, Tanny's shells, a sunflower seed shell. You can still eat

84
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,060
them. Sometimes I eat that. I eat that, too. It's just like you not every time,

85
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,540
but sometimes a little beaver. It tastes like wood, pistachio shell, pistachio

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,700
not a good one. Not good. It's too hard, but you can boil to suck on the shell.

87
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,920
Yeah, you can suck on it. Those are the show. Yeah, you suck on anything. Yeah,

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,380
but a pistachio shell is pistachio. I just suck on pennies. When I was a kid,

89
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,720
we all did. We talked about it. Ten thousand hundred. I'm pretty sure we've

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,200
all we all had Pica at some point. You are obsessed with Pica. My little I

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,760
thought my little brother had. That's like my mom always mentions Pica. You

92
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,080
thought you had your little brother at Pica because he was chewing on a

93
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:15,300
teething toy? No, he would eat my toys. I had these Star Wars micro machines and they came

94
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,140
with little action figures that you could put into the head. It was like a head of Chewbacca

95
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,060
or the head of Darth Vader. Wait, are you talking about the ones that flip the heads?

96
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,260
Yes. I missed those. And he would take them and pick them up and just eat them like they

97
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:35,260
they were M&M's. That's a funny thing to do. I lost all of them. Wow. That's funnier than

98
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,500
tearing the head off of your sister's Barbie or something is to eat it. You're never getting

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,780
this back. If you want this back, it will be poop. You have to look through my poop

100
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,380
to get it back. It's plastic, so it will be burned by my stomach. My poop stinks. My poop

101
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,460
is stinky because I eat ribs all day. I'm a baby that eats ribs. I eat ribs and toys.

102
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,020
those are the two things of a toy. Yeah, that's always like a Smokey Robinson song

103
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,060
ribs of a toy. Yeah, well, I mean there's tears of a clown and then so probably

104
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,580
of a sequel song ribs of a toy

105
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,780
sperms of a mime sperms.

106
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,820
That's probably the last bodily fluid. I want to see especially from a mime

107
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,900
specifically. I don't mind the thing. I wouldn't mind seeing a sperm from a

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,600
firefighter or someone who contributes to society, a police officer, but a mime,

109
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,900
a mime, you know that also is probably the first time I've ever done it. It's

110
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,080
probably black and also would act they would act like they don't know how to

111
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,840
jack off. You won't stay in there going like they would. They do it hands free.

112
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,920
They jack off far away from their body and then they squirt anyway, and if I'm

113
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,180
coming, if I'm if you're sitting looking the other way and I'm shooting a load

114
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,740
into the back of your head, you're going to hear

115
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,860
with a mime completely silent. Yeah, you're going to have no idea. Look,

116
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,380
you're going to look back in the mime. He's going to go

117
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,320
Yeah, you don't even get to join in laughing about because it's your head

118
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,740
and you know, by the way, the normal guy. I don't mind if you come on me. I'm

119
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,620
not made of sugar. All right, it's not a big deal, but a mime. I do not want

120
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,220
that. And you know that the mime is uncut because they like turtle neck

121
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,420
French French and turtle necks. Also, yeah, I guess. Yep, that makes sense.

122
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, man, fucking mind is

123
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,300
these days, fucking sick, all this fucking mind is everywhere. Whose cup

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,820
is this

125
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,360
waffle house? Oh yeah, there's twenty two yeah,

126
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,860
made in China. Guys are starting to have to think about politics again. No,

127
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,100
we're starting. What about politics? We're getting back into politics, right?

128
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,500
We recently or just everybody, the world, the world or the United States.

129
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,340
Yeah, it's a whole we're in a move again. Earth United is despicable machine.

130
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,060
you know the gears are turning. You guys voting for the Santas yeah,

131
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,660
because I love Twitter.

132
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,960
He is awesome.

133
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,960
He is I feel like he's the first guy where maybe not the first guy,

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,360
you know, probably the 100th guy where I see people on Twitter talk about

135
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,060
him and say it's so funny how he's acting like this. I'm like I don't

136
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,960
care. Yeah, I don't know who this guy is and I don't think he's funny.

137
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,460
I think it's a guy who's walking around. I agree. He's he's great as

138
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,600
strikes me everyone. Mrs trump's so much he strikes me as a general manager of

139
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
like a restaurant. He's nothing he's not funny. No, he doesn't have the only

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,940
funny thing about him is his eyes. He would that's how you know somebody's

141
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,640
really evil as if they're not even funny. Yeah, so if he gets in that'll be

142
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,760
bad news trump again. We've already done that it was cool. Yeah, it was fine, but

143
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,760
him and vaccine yeah exactly stimulus check that was huge. That was beast and

144
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,200
they blamed it on biden uh-huh adderall plentiful yeah. We had always so oh my

145
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,400
there was so much. I was falling out of my ears. But as soon as we get

146
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
where you're not supposed to put in your ears,

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,960
this is the like, there's nothing really that funny about him. Like people keep

148
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,800
trying to post that picture of his face where he's like, yeah, and that's his

149
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,000
like,

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,240
laughing or whatever. Einstein. Oh, yeah. Oh my fucking God. Yeah. I thought

151
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,920
that I was like, it's happened. It's been so confusing because every single

152
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,560
time that I see a photo of who I thought was Ron DeSantis. I was like they only

153
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,000
had fucking black and white cameras. Yeah, well he's kind of you thought maybe

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
it was a style. That would actually if I was running for president I would only

155
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,120
let people take black and white photos of yeah yeah that would be a cool like

156
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,920
gimmick. And I'd dress up like Hitler. No I wouldn't. You would. What if a Democrat

157
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,160
what if Bernie Sanders dressed up like Hitler all the time? He wouldn't because of his

158
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,600
faith. He doesn't have any faith. He does. No I don't have any faith in him anymore.

159
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,680
He's an atheist. He's a fucking atheist. Why do you think he lost?

160
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,880
That's why he's got a bad back.

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Yeah, exactly. He's been cursed by God.

162
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,320
Yeah, he's been carrying the weight of sin.

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,360
Yeah, his entire life. Hundreds and hundreds of sins.

164
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,440
Yeah, but there's that video of DeSantis at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester.

165
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,240
Remember we went there?

166
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,800
I remember.

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,640
And he is completely robotic, but there's nothing really that funny about it.

168
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,440
That video of him at Red Arrow where the guy's like, "Hey, how's it going? I'm Mike."

169
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,920
and goes okay, not that funny see, but if you went okay, okay, a little john or

170
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,840
if you or if he went like okay, here's what we're doing now. We're going to

171
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,960
we're going to brainstorm ways to make we're the

172
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,680
campaign team. We're going to get it. We're going to get his memes up. We're

173
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,280
going to get his me or my way to make him funny like this is easy. Yeah,

174
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,140
this is fucking easy. First off, he should funny. Well, he needs yeah. He

175
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,240
needs something about his appearance is what I was going to say. So I was going

176
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,500
so either he has to get a crazy haircut or shave his eyebrows. Mohawk Mohawk bleach

177
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,780
the okay Rhonda sanders bleach the eyebrows get an undercut. Yeah, mesh

178
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,780
shirt, mesh shirt and underneath the shirt, another shirt that says real men

179
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,420
wear pink. Yep, and then we're going to get you in Daisy Dukes. Tell me rocker

180
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,100
tell me rocker. Tell me rocker. This is yeah. Oh my fuck the bullshit. Tell me

181
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,900
rocker. Fuck the bullshit way too many letters just around his stomach. It's on

182
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,800
three lines. So it goes all the way up to his neck. Basically, it's

183
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,740
what's on the fans tummy rocker. What's the fucking the car name or whatever

184
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,240
the yeah the kerning it's really close. So if you have to like re you know

185
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
you know what it is, it's one of those things where it's like the tall

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,940
letters and you have to look at the page. Oh my God, so you can only

187
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:29,560
you can only read it. If you're sucking his cock, it says fuck the

188
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,620
bullshit, but everybody else got running for office. Nobody can tell what it

189
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,620
says they're like. What is that and and he's an early say? What is that tattoo

190
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,900
saying? He says well, if you want to know better suck my day, yeah, you want

191
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,660
to know come to the bathroom and people are like well, you can't say that he's

192
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,740
like no. I literally stating a fact I got it so you can only get only really

193
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,940
if you're sucking my dick yeah wow okay. I've never even thought of that yeah

194
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,020
and I thought of fucking everything. If he does all of that actually, I just

195
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,700
realized you can also maybe read it. If you're doing going forehead to forehead

196
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,420
with him yeah well, no,

197
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,460
the fuck yeah that's true yeah yeah

198
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:15,100
yeah, so if the Santas does all of that, maybe he has a shot, maybe yeah, but

199
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,920
that's only a that's a that's literally just as a parents and I don't even

200
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,420
touch on his one. He's just he's just eye candy. He's not even

201
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,700
and he just looks like a hot slut. Yeah, he's everyone's going around sucking his

202
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,420
Dick and nobody even knows he's running for president right yeah, yeah,

203
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,460
fucked, but okay, politics it will be that would actually be ingenious right,

204
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,940
because people if you wanted to get his Dick sucked because it would be like

205
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,380
someone suck his dick and be like you know that tattoo. It actually says fuck

206
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,380
the bullshit people like this fuck the no, it doesn't there's no way that's

207
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,660
what it says he's running for president. I got I got a second, I can find out

208
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,300
for myself

209
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,500
and you know you need two hands for Ron. Oh yeah doing this yeah

210
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,640
crab claws yeah dude crab claws. That's new. You like go right

211
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,300
doing this

212
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,500
to the world's most medium missed violins yeah.

213
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,800
I think

214
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,300
he needs also he needs to he needs to

215
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,220
changed his politics become a liberal. No, not a little no, not something new

216
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,840
yeah, some new thing liberal when he gets when people hand a great fucking

217
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,740
reason. He just needs to be trying new shit. I would just encourage him like

218
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,380
whatever your first instinct is do it. If somebody hands you a baby to kiss,

219
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,420
throw it at the fucking just yeah, throw it as hard as come up with things that

220
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,500
maybe that people haven't just your whole platform should be things that

221
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,420
people haven't said yet. You should feel like you should be like your campaign

222
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,500
we expect the unexpected. Yeah, that should be the thing. His campaign right

223
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,620
now, his campaign right now is we're going to make America Florida, I think

224
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,140
is his slogan. Yeah, go all in, make it Florida, start doing meth, start doing

225
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,420
crazy shit. He should be doing mix and match stuff and he should be doing like,

226
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,620
he should be like, we're going to cancel the student debt, but we're going to

227
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,740
take all the, we're going to take all that money and we're going to give all

228
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,940
that money, we're going to take all that debt and we're going to transfer that

229
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,500
set to Ukraine and they yes, he should be walking around with a heroin needle

230
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,200
just stuck in his arm. He should have a right there. He should have an

231
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,220
alligator. He should have an alligator. He should become basically Joe. He

232
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,240
should outlaw animals. He should become a morton joe exotic. Yes, that is a

233
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,260
good one. Yeah, more can you say that again? A morton joe exotic

234
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,280
excellent edition, extremely

235
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,100
yeah, that's good.

236
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,180
I do like that

237
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:04,220
now the sound board now it's like complete. There used to be that little

238
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,700
spot there. Yeah, and just so you guys know, I will be cycling stuff out. Yeah,

239
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,300
I would think pretty soon. This is leaving. We never use this. I don't like

240
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,860
you know, we never use it and I have to, but I'm not just going to be doing it

241
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,300
willy nilly. I have to wait until I think of something that's at the level

242
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,940
of zombie nation. We need to keep, oh, maybe a whistle. Yeah, maybe like

243
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,380
the other thing is I'm not going to tell you guys. Yeah, maybe that whistle song

244
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,340
from White Chicks, though the one where Terry Crews is dancing, blow the

245
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,860
whistle

246
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,820
yeah, too short song, maybe I don't know. I haven't seen what it's going to

247
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,300
surprise you guys. I got to rewatch White Chicks. I was before fine to not

248
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,200
watch it. I didn't think it was that so funny when I saw it on TV. When did you

249
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,300
see it? Like probably in the last two years for the first time. Yeah. Yeah, I

250
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,740
guess that makes sense. I guess it is one of those movies. I was like this is

251
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,740
so we can on the other hand, this is raunchy. On the other hand, little man,

252
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,180
what are you saying? Little man holds up. I know little man does not hold up.

253
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,020
Little man holds up in a major way. Little man was a flop. Nah, little man

254
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,820
I flop. You're a little man and you flopped. I don't flop anymore. You flopped your wiener

255
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,700
out when you woke up. I did. Yeah. My wiener was flopped when I woke up this morning. Yeah.

256
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,180
You got flopped. Did that get picked up on the cameras, Jubio? Yeah. It did? Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,140
It fully got perfectly picked up. All right. My girlfriend's full name and... Yeah, that's

258
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,540
what you're worried about. My girlfriend's full name is on camera and a picture of my cock.

259
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Is it tattooed on your cock? Why would it be on camera? My girlfriend's full name is on my cock.

260
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,500
really and she and I don't know that in she does a lot of property stuff about

261
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,940
me.

262
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,900
Look, would you date a bitch named Leonardo da Vinci? Yeah, yeah, sight

263
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,860
unseen yeah

264
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:55,460
no, she's dope girl Vinci. No, she's no, no, no, she's a girl named girl. I

265
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,260
probably would you come in and be like hey guys, I'm I have this. I'm doing

266
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,700
this new girl named girl named girl. Her name's girl. You would what was the

267
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,040
time that we were saying that it was like it Jeff is Jeff or Steve or a girl

268
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,720
named Steve. I'm dating girl.

269
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,700
I'd believe that

270
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,840
it's really funny that it's not that funny. It's funny. The idea you would

271
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,340
date a girl. It's not funny that it's not funny even to me and that you would,

272
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,380
but just the idea of you coming in and saying that and that being your life.

273
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,540
Yeah, I just like I'm going on a date with Steve later girl named Steve, who

274
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:37,020
like just normal hair boy named sue wow wow that was an abused kid it was

275
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,580
abused yeah right that's what that's about yeah he got abused he got abused

276
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,860
well actually I don't remember much about that song yeah it's a song boy

277
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,780
named sue yeah I don't know Johnny Cash what do you think it was I didn't know

278
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,460
I thought it was just a thing is it a book yeah it's like a book about a kid

279
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,060
who got so abused that they were able to write a book about it I think boy named

280
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,200
name. So maybe it's about the or maybe it's based off the Johnny Cash song. They named

281
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
it after that.

282
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,180
But Boy Name Sue is just about a guy. It's about a little boy who's like, my fucking

283
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,940
dad named me Sue. How fucked up is that? That's the whole song. That is abuse. It is. And that

284
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,020
is abuse to name your son Sue or your daughter Sue. That's a terrible name. Sue Bob. Have

285
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,980
you seen the Wild World of the Whites? That documentary about that family? They're like

286
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,860
a family where their dad was like a really good like Appalachian tap dancer or some shit.

287
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:35,660
And because he got a bunch of money from doing fucking tap dancing shows, they also, they

288
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:42,220
talk about it in the movie, how he taught their whole family how to fuck over the disability

289
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
checks and stuff.

290
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,020
So they live off of disability checks and just smoke pills all day.

291
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,980
They smoke Percocets and shit.

292
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,980
They smoke pills?

293
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,460
smoke percocets off of a

294
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,620
fucking tin foil. Oh wow, and then there's a there's a lady named Sue Bob

295
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,960
in it.

296
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,660

304
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Millipede? Yep. Because I got a million legs? A million fucking titties. Damn. Okay. All

305
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,600
All right, damn bitch ass. I'm not a bitch ass. I cooked you today. You didn't I

306
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,680
brought just broke your ankles. I showed you my penis and you're making fun. You

307
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,640
show me your hand covering your penis. It was hardly your penis unless that was

308
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,580
your been trying to make me show it to him for years. Yeah, that's why I was so

309
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,660
excited when you said you're going to show it to me. That was a little

310
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,980
disappointed by the photo. Yeah, because I was hoping that you disappointed. Yeah,

311
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,700
because you didn't show your whole fucking. I thought I was going to get

312
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,360
like great. I thought it was going to be like a yeah. I know. I know why my

313
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,580
girlfriend took the picture. There wasn't enough of she was disappointed.

314
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,340
It's not enough shaft because it was hiding between my briefs

315
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:25,300
obviously between yet two pairs of briefs on yes, in case I piss

316
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,220
obviously what's wrong with you. I'm sorry. Yeah, that's me being insensitive

317
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,660
about. I know how you guys are fighting and I think even though I don't really

318
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,580
want to talk about it. I think I need to bring up the elephant in the room on

319
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,540
what happened a couple of days ago. What happened a couple of days ago? Oh, we

320
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,480
I've already talked about this. I've already blocked it out of my mind, but

321
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,360
I'd like to talk to him. Okay, so you all right, right now we don't have to

322
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,740
talk about. So if you listen, no, no, I'd like to talk to him about it. So

323
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,520
if you listen to beers, we drink on Saturday or on Friday, this is a day

324
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,040
you will have heard you will have heard this already, but basically we did an

325
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,920
extreme betrayal and yeah, I'm going to say that it was one third me one third

326
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,680
Cameron one third Julio, because the only fair way to do it and it wasn't

327
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,940
even just to me. It was also to Rex, maybe like one half Caleb and one

328
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,440
or no, maybe one half Cameron because he's the one who said it first. No,

329
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,380
you say, do you know, no, no, no, no, no, hundred,

330
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,620
try and talk,

331
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:28,120
so it was Caleb who suggested it. He said, do you guys want to go to Fogo

332
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,100
to Chow? I said sure, and then he did a U turn like the mean

333
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,120
turn me up. I'd like to say this in my defense. I wasn't going to go,

334
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,360
that I put in Fogo to Chow just for S and G's and I was fucking three

335
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,600
hundred and eighty one feet away.

336
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,480
Well, how can I say no less than five hundred feet away from Fogo? You could

337
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,560
say hey,

338
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,780
hey, let me go for me, call you a car, let me call you a car, call yourself a

339
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,160
car. It was also also good to here's the other here's the other piece of

340
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,500
it. You be closing in. It was it was that he was coming to dispute

341
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,680
something. It was closing in

342
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,520
that you're coming in to defend yourself. It was closing in one hour,

343
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,500
so you guys physically was not got it was one hour. They close for lunch from

344
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,740
lunch to get ready for dinner. You would know if you remember watching those

345
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,900
videos about Fogo de Chal, I don't watch many of them. You've seen the I F with

346
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,660
Ryan video where he goes to Fogo de Chal. You know that you know that goes

347
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,780

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,940

352
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,260
If you want to learn how to intermittent fast.

353
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,980
Have you guys ever done a fast?

354
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,100
I do a fast most days by accident.

355
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,060
Have you ever done a multi-day fast?

356
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,060
My dad used to.

357
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:58,620
I guess the longest I've done is probably a little over 24 hours for like a doctor or

358
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,620
something.

359
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,660
24 hours you get you feel amazing. Yeah, and then I think you if you keep going

360
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,680
you feel really bad. My dad was doing juice cleanses and fasts and P90X and

361
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,880
Diamond Dallas Page yoga. I was doing orange juice cleansing like he's bathing

362
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,460
in it. Yeah. My dad looked good though. I saw an old picture of my dad when I was

363
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,060
like 16. And now he looks like a fucking piece of shit. No, he looks like the same.

364
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,900
No, he looks like I... Your dad honestly looks like a cartoon mountain. Yeah. Yeah, he

365
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,140
he looks like he looks like he should be on a run. It's like the Rock Titan from

366
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,740
Hercules. He does that's cool. That's what a dad should look like. Your dad

367
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,380
looks like a golem, not a golem. What are you talking about? My dad doesn't look

368
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,260
like a golem. Sorry, that's not okay to say about my dad. I have a good

369
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,780
relationship with my father. You can't just make fun of him like that. You do

370
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,300
have a good relationship with it's going to end today. I think it's a jealous

371
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,140
thing from the both of you. I don't give a fuck about your dad. You guys care

372
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,860
about my dad. You guys hung out with my dad. Yeah, I mean I care about him. We

373
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,720
young out. We got drinks with him that one night and then he drank like eight

374
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,560
beers. I've gotten drinks with millions of people in my life and I don't give a

375
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,680
shit about them. You don't care about how many beers my dad drinks really fast?

376
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,160
No, I actually do think, I think that drinking, you don't care about my dad's

377
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,080
burger with the onions in it. Drinking alcohol is so special, it almost makes me

378
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,160
want to cry thinking about it. Yeah. Did you watch that movie with Mads

379
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Mickelson where he dances at the end? No, you should watch it. Is it about

380
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,120
drinking? It's about how drinking brings us together, but it also can kill us.

381
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,680
yeah, I don't care if I die from fucking good and that the end Mads Mikkelsen

382
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,640
amazing thing. I used to have a really bad problem with it. We've been getting

383
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,840
back. We've been getting back into having and do you know what the best?

384
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,440
Do you know what the best part of that movie is? What is that? Whatever

385
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,240
country it's from, whatever I think, sweeping Danish or something that

386
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,840
foreign title of breakfast is is I think I wish the American title. I assume

387
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,340
it's a translation. The American title is another round, but then the foreign

388
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:56,340
whatever it is title is drug. Yeah, okay, that's sick. You know, it's cool

389
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,940
I'm drunk about I'm drunk. I think it's a

390
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,940
poster is him drinking like champagne, so out of the bar.

391
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,480
It's

392
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,740
there's the Swedish title for every single Mel Brooks movie is spring time

393
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,260
for blank really. That's funny. It's like spring time for frankenstein. The

394
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,340
way the way they localize tiles is so fun. They do that with all the old

395
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,180
Godzilla movies when they were like that nobody like cared about them. There's

396
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,100
making them in Japan and they were like localizing them for Germany and stuff

397
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,740
like in Germany. Every Godzilla movie is called King Kong.

398
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,980
It's all stuff like that now in the poster that is put like a picture of

399
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,460
just like rain. I just mean the big monster, yeah, King Kong, yeah, King

400
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,560
Kong and Conan. Yeah, that's yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, all the put it's so

401
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,980
great. There's a there's a bunch of stuff like that. What do you think the

402
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,620
localization of this podcast is going to be podcast about who is King Kong?

403
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,620
King Kong, yeah, yeah, I wonder what we're going to start a podcast called

404
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,620
King Kong, it would be cool to get a name. I think you get in serious trouble.

405
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,160
The you're not making money.

406
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,160
We should get like a list. I don't want to do nothing. I'm not making every

407
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,900
single localization of the podcast name. Well, we're ready to hire some

408
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,260
translators. We should get like and also we want you to localize it in the

409
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,900
way that they localize Pokemon, where they're going to call that coffee.

410
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,180
You're going to say that he's drinking like sake or something. Yep, because

411
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,540
coffee is like when they said the only giri was donuts. Exactly. Is that what

412
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,400
they said yeah. They said jelly, this jelly donut and it's and clearly I'm

413
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,700
so hungry. I'm gonna eat this hot dog and it's a piece of sushi. That's so

414
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,500
awesome when they do the dub and then they like yeah. They what would these

415
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,500
fat Americans because there's no way the line was I'm going to eat this hot dog.

416
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,160
Yeah, he's probably saying something else, but they had to make it so clear

417
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,600
that it was awesome because the kid is watching that and if they're holding a

418
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,120
thing that looks like Onigiri and they don't know what it is that I have, I

419
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,440
needed it yeah. It will break their brain for they'll be like what Pokemon

420
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,180
with them exactly yeah. Why are they eating a Pokemon? Do you think they eat

421
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,760
the Pokemon in the show? No man, we've been talked about. We talked we've been

422
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,300
talking about this. We love talking about eating Pokemon is yeah. Which one

423
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,340
would you not eat? That's that's the opposite of the question we've done

424
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,000
before. Mr. Mime,

425
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,280
I wouldn't know that I would eat the fuck out of him. Are you kidding me? I

426
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,620
want to eat. I want to beat it up

427
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,540
jinx

428
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,980
drinks. I beat it up, which Pokemon is the most I'm beating that we did that to

429
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,980
fuck. We did a whole episode about that. We're looping around. You're a looper

430
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,500
right now. I'm looping. I'm loopy. Do you guys remember that movie looper where

431
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:33,740
yeah,

432
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,220
that movie so bad? Why we got amazing reviews when I came out movie was shit.

433
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,900
What's because everyone was impressed that they made that they look like

434
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,140
Bruce.

435
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,500
That was all they did. They

436
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,920
yeah. Why is that cool? Like shit? Yeah, I look terrible movies. The Anna was in

437
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,660
it, though right great. It's a great movie. Yeah, it's a great movie. I don't

438
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,460
know what to say. That's exactly what I think every time I see Paul Dan. I love

439
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,460
that yeah, you know, I can't be that bad. I saw when I was a kid, though,

440
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,540
Miss on I saw him in New York City walking down the street when I was a kid.

441
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,780
I visited New York City when I was thirteen. I saw you say to him my I just

442
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,140
looked at him and my entire and I told my family. Nobody believed me. Yeah,

443
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,340
they were like why would he be walking around on the street and I was like it's

444
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,880
That is such a fucking...

445
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
In New York City, they were like, "You're a liar."

446
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
That's so...

447
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
You fucked me up for years.

448
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Why would a celebrity be walking around New York?

449
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I know, dude.

450
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Yeah.

451
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Nowadays, I would love to run into him.

452
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,880
You ever walk with your girl down the street in New York City and she's like...

453
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,880
And they walk, somebody walks by and she's like, "That was Cody."

454
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Yeah.

455
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
And you go, "What?"

456
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
And they're like, "That's Cody.

457
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
He's a musician."

458
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Yeah.

459
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
And I'm like, "I don't know who the fuck that guy was."

460
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Yeah.

461
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
I can't even doubt.

462
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Uh-huh.

463
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
But I do, then I chase after him.

464
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,080
after my holding down take a picture of them. I did see my first celebrity on

465
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,040
the street. Who'd you see? It's not even that cool of a of a

466
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,760
seeing because it's probably just his every day. I saw Jim Jarmusch. Who's that?

467
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,920
I don't think I would recognize him if I saw him. Who's Jim Jarmusch? He's got a very

468
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,840
recognizable face. He's a director. Yeah he directed. He's got a camera in front of it.

469
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
uh-huh

470
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:22,440
that's so funny. It is the funniest thing we've done in so long. We did it years.

471
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,240
Me and Patrick. I think no, I think as a as a collective podcast right yeah, we

472
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,080
all did it together. So we actually put podcast collective podcast. We are if

473
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,800
when you're a podcast, not so much to New York in 2016. I saw I got dinner or

474
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,500
lunch. I don't remember you got dinner with it's the same with my dad at a

475
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,700
restaurant and at the table next to us, two guys were eating and guess who they

476
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,600
were. They were Laurel and Hardy, Ben Stiller and Martin Freeman. Wow, really?

477
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,500
That's actually crazy. That's fire right next to us. And I was like, New York,

478
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,500
probably you go here. You see celebrities every day and I've never seen

479
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,700
another celebrity here in my entire life. We should get men still have been

481
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,140

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,660
did the Ben Stiller show, read our productions, read I production that I

483

484
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,340

492
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,940
literally everybody knows this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

496
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,620
I literally will be like oh shit and fill my dog will see because he loves Noah

497
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,180
and he'll see girls on the street and try to walk up to them because he thinks

498
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,820
they're no. Yeah, yeah, messed up, messed up. Noah, cut your damn hair. No

499
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,540
man should have any hair. I'll say that look like men shouldn't have hair. It's

500
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:21,740
a feminine. I want to get Noah's haircut while he's sleeping. You want to get it

501
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,300
because I live next to him in a wall by a wall that separates us. I could go into

502
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,220
to his room. You could go through. I just had the most incredible vision of

503
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,980
Patrick in like ten years from now, teaching like an English one on one

504
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,880
course, like a two hundred person public university English class and how amazing

505
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,980
your lectures would be. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you'd be teaching them funny words. I'd

506
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,140
be teaching them how to talk in a style that is. What books would you put on the

507
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,900
I know, I know, I know what your first your first slide would be.

508
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,700
Screenshot of a drill tweet.

509
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,580
yeah, study this a lot of people would say this isn't this is the study. This

510
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,100
class is about the study of brevity. This is a text. You would say that this is

511
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,540
text. Yeah, this is text. This is and this is photos

512
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:12,580
and now this is yeah teaching an English class and is showing photos. This is a

513
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,900
photo photos. Now learn how to look at these. You think that texts that look at

514
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,660
this line of text thinking that they don't line of text six words. Look at

515
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,340
photo that accompanies it. One thousand and six. Wow. You would be such an amazing teacher.

516
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,640
I wish I had there was more professors like you in this world. I'd be such a good teacher

517
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,180
for people with adult ADHD. No normal people. Normal people. Good people. Completely normal

518
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:43,220
people. I could teach the syllabus one line. I wish I could. I wish. Fuck the bullshit.

519
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,420
I wish I could go back in time and make you older than me. I want to look up to you so

520
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,220
bad. Yeah. I want to look up to you in every way and I want you to teach me everything

521
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,380
thing that you've ever learned this. I showed him my penis and now he's being

522
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,420
very kind to me and I want to look up at it. I see you different is being very,

523
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,760
very yeah. I think you don't realize, but you completely changed your

524
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,700
relationship with us forever. I looked at the cock through the cracks in your

525
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,100
fingers and now I can't poetry. Oh, my God, the English teacher, I

526
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,900
right at the cock through the cracks in your fingers.

527
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,020
That is a rupee power poem, the most incredible line of poetry I've ever

528
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,500
someone say say it one more time. I've peered at your cock through the cracks

529
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,300
in your fingers.

530
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,820
I could listen to that forever. Keep going and what I've seen cannot be

531
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,340
undone.

532
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,540
That's not as good as no, but how can you beat that first line? That is truly

533
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,780
the best first line I've ever heard. That's an amazing line. That's

534
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,300
incredible. I'm kind of writerly in that way. Do you guys think I'll ever

535
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,540
write a book? No, no, no. You said yeah first, but I don't think I have. I

536
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,000
I don't think you're I think that is the hardest right. I could definitely write

537
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,740
a chapter. I think you could write a chapter. I don't think you're right. I

538
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,220
think I think a book is probably the hardest thing to do in the world is

539
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,860
write a book, but people do them all the time. I don't think that's true. I

540
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,820
think I think I think if you're actually trying, I think it's really hard, but I

541
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,180
think people I think it's really easy to write to just write all the way through

542
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,980
you write a chapter a day and you don't care and then you put it on Amazon and

543
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,740
rack up that money. Yeah, right up that five cents from an old lady who

544
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,620
I accidentally bought it because I was like trying and she's trying to jack

545
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,820
off. What would I write? What you guys are in works about when I was ten years

546
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,700
old, I tried to start writing a book. You would not believe how many books I

547
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,100
wrote as a kid. Yeah, you got sure you can guess and then thirteen knowing me.

548
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,980
Yeah, I halfway through just started listing all of the skateboard companies

549
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,820
that I knew about

550
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,340
your book would be a hero. You would make a coffee table book about

551
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,900
skateboarding. I guess with pictures, the worst that is. Yeah, that is such a

552
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,000
cheat code to make a coffee table book. Yeah, all you have to do is just hire

553
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
someone to license all the pictures for you. It's easy to like yeah, I wrote

554
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,360
that's a great idea for a cocktail book is just pictures. I like yeah, you just

555
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,800
license the photos from that's the future. Is that a fuck with just cool

556
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,800
ass pictures? Yeah, that's a great we should put out a coffee. That was what

557
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,880
David, we're just selling these ideas. David Beckham's kid did we're going to

558
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,040
have another NDA today and we're actually going to have a QR code on the

559
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,720
screen this time like we asked and like I generally a QR code for and did a lot

560
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,460
he had a QR code and you didn't put it in the show because he's he was to you

561
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,140
know. He told me you know what he told me. He told me he had the QR code file

562
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,820
downloaded. He had it on his computer. He had the thing up and then he was like I

563
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,040
just don't want to do a lot of editing. Fuck me. You put a picture. It's a

564
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,760
picture. He's on. He thinks that we don't know how to use premier. He's on

565
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,680
vacation. He's barely on big. It would take point five seconds and he's not on

566
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,840
vacation because he didn't get approved. Well, I thought of after effects never

567
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,480
And he's going to be putting in a cool slimy logo right here.

568
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,560
You wish he never just shook his head. No bastard.

569
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,440
Did you guys already talk about the police to what police basically burned all

570
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,280
the material stuff? Yeah, yeah. But we got, it's okay. That was, but that was,

571
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,840
what happened? I was there. I was the one who was there. Yeah.

572
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,960
But he was there twice.

573
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,120
So this is a thing that you talked about on beers. We drink already.

574
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,480
Yeah. So we can't even, I need to stop getting the scoops on beers. We drank.

575
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,880
Yeah. Yeah. It's not really the way. Yeah. I really should.

576
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,280
This matters a lot more. You know what I guess we can talk about. I guess there's

577
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,640
nothing. Yeah, why don't you bring up the next topic that you because we don't

578
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,360
know what you talked about. So just bring up something new. My favorite

579
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,600
vegetables. Okay, let me guess.

580
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,520
Coriander. Brussels sprouts. I know he loves Brussels sprouts, but I feel like

581
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,440
you would also like them. I definitely like them, but not your favorite. My

582
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,680
favorite vegetable is also cruciferous though. Cruciferous? Broccoli. Yes.

583
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,360
That's my favorite too. That's my favorite. Yeah. They're all

584
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,440
sons of mustard.

585
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,640
Bloody, what are you talking about?

586
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,560
The mustard plant. It's the father, the mother.

587
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,560
The broccoli is the son of a mustard plant?

588
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Of Brussels sprouts.

589
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Really?

590
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
The son of a mustard plant.

591
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
They're all sons of mustard.

592
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,440
But mustard just makes these little seeds.

593
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Yeah.

594
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,240
With the angle in it, you can turn those seeds into different kinds of seeds through selective

595
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,400
breeding through millions of years.

596
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Millions?

597
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Brussels sprouts, broccoli, I think arugula. I don't remember.

598
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,640
you guys should as I call it, you guys, but there's a bunch of stuff that

599
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,440
mustard is responsible for speaking of millions of years, you guys should be

600
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,360
razzles, you guys should be watching prehistoric planet season two. Yeah, it's

601
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,700
coming out right now. It's so I don't understand how somebody could be so

602
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,080
irresponsible as to focus on pre history when we're living through some truly

603
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,320
know what the best part of the new post, open your eyes and watch the historic

604
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,340
planet, the new prehistoric planet season, which what's the guy's name

605
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,800
at and burrow? It's his first David David at and burrow. I have him narrating it

606
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,380
of course, and every episode starts it opens it's a it's black. It fades up to

607
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,940
him standing in a study and just the first word he said he just he just goes

608
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,660
nine. This

609
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,260
I

610
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,480
my phone

611
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,420
like you saw what now there's a pterodactyl coming into the room to

612
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,740
attack. So that's what every other starts and it makes me laugh every time,

613
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,680
and I have a video of it on my phone. Listen to this

614
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,940
I just believe

615
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:28,020
you're exaggerated. No, it's exactly what he fucking says. Holy shit! Oh my God,

616
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,220
so good

617
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:35,060
this is wow he's so he's lost it yeah he's so fucked up dude. He's past. He

618
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,260
does the thing he does the old guy thing where he moves his head too much to

619
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,180
compensate for the probably doesn't know what he's saying and he goes like the

620
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,100
t rex is a

621
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:48,180
noble animal and he's like wobbling all around. He rexes are not noble to their.

622
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,220
he doesn't say that it is made that up right now.

623
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,760
- The dexterity is mean.

624
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,540
- They have funny dinosaurs on this season.

625
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,900
They have one with a one horn that looks like a,

626
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,100
he's fat too and he's got--

627
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,460
- It's all made up.

628
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,060
- No, well actually one of them,

629
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,180
it was blind in one eye.

630
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,140
- It's all made up.

631
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,320
- So you're actually right.

632
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,900
It wasn't, it was red.

633
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,820
- They're all made up.

634
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,180
- Red, marooning.

635
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,420
The show is completely made up

636
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,740
'cause they don't know shit about these things.

637
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,140
- These are human bones.

638
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,740
These are human bones that they have been moving around.

639
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,060
- He was researching the one eyed one horn.

640
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,900
- Yeah.

641
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,720
- Not, don't even say it.

642
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,160
the fly. Okay, thank God. That's why we got an indoor office. They can show the

643
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,480
dinosaurs fuck a bunch and they show their things and their poop. There's

644
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,080
babies that eat their mom's poop and that's like, you can't know that they

645
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,240
did that. Yeah. There's, what do you, went into their stomach and you found...

646
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
We call them Dorans. You found...

647
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,560
Yeah. You went in these, you went into baby... I'm okay with it if it plays

648
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,240
the sound effect. You went into baby dinosaur's stomachs and you found their

649
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,640
mom's poop and I don't think so. There was not enough dinosaurs. There's no

650
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,960
way. I think they just made that up for the TV show to be gross and nasty.

651
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,400
they're doing these shows about dinosaurs, then yes, they should be

652
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,720
they should be also doing the show about big foots one on one horn flying purple

653
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,680
people. Yes, Loch Ness, I'm one hundred percent in agreement. Brownies,

654
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,720
Pajama Sam, Pajama Sam,

655
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,520
Freddy Fish, yeah, I Fox those games. I replayed all those about four years ago.

656
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,440
Yeah, I was in college. They hold up. It was fun as fuck. I is good. I played it

657
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,560
I was like we talked about the put put speed run. Have you seen that we are

658
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,600
yeah? Yeah,

659
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,160
well, they just click. It's just it's just a game of osu with no no circles.

660
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,960
You just click everywhere really fast and then the guy messes up and he was

661
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,520
fuck.

662
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,000
Those are fun, man. Those were my earliest gaming memories. Probably I

663
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,640
never played those. I they only they had those at the at the at the library, the

664
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,080
town library. I never had time to play a full one. I would just play whatever the screen

665
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,600
was up on when I got to the library for a little while. But I cared more about Adventure Quest.

666
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:58,600
We had a game on my computer. It was a Star Wars game where you put a Millennium Falcon

667
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:06,960
peripheral on to your keyboard and then you put your action figures in the thing and then

668
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,120
supposed to press the button through this like stupid peripheral, but we couldn't get it running

669
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,960
like an amiibo. No, it was like literally like it is the chair pushes down onto a key.

670
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,480
So you like the control key or something? Yeah, yeah, like it's like WASD. You could have just

671
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,560
sat there done this. You could have played it with the thing, but like, you know, it's like here is a

672
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,200
Millennium Falcon peripheral that you have to strap to your keyboard. Man, old like playing,

673
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,560
I think finding computer games actually ran on the family computer was such a

674
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,040
strong. They're always dude. I

675
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,840
can't play for two weeks. Surely Tempo

676
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:52,000
Nancy Drew. Oh yeah. I remember ordering games off ebay. That was like a used

677
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,720
disc that was like five dollars. I'd get it and be like oh, this is power PC.

678
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,000
You can't run it. I remember

679
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,880
man game I got on cd. I bought it somewhere on like a like a yard sale or

680
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,200
and it broke my heart. I crashed my computer. The biggest come up in my life was finding

681
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,280
a Half-Life game of the year that included Opposing Force. If I had had Half-Life, because

682
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,960
Half-Life was old enough that it would have ran on anybody's computer probably, right?

683
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,320
So I wish I'd had that. My parents wouldn't have let me play it. Oh, but my computer didn't

684
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:29,320
have a graphics card. This was before integrated graphics, too. Yeah. I found that at the Goodwill

685
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:35,360
and Derry, New Hampshire. Then I came home and then installed it on every single

686
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:41,800
computer in the house. Dude, two of the computers. Every single computer. My

687
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,600
computer. I think if I had been into... Do you ever hear people talk about stuff that

688
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,600
they were into at an age where you didn't even know what that was? And you're

689
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,680
like, "I would probably be a different person if I had that exposure to that

690
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,840
media." I think Half-Life is one of those things where that's... I don't think I

691
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,120
did I experience anything that could be considered a good piece of art or media

692
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,660
until I was probably fifteen years old? Oh, absolutely. Like I just had nothing

693
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,560
going on. It was all just YouTube videos and the worst music ever. Mine is

694
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,440
definitely anime. If I had actually figured out how to watch anime as a kid,

695
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,760
it would have been completely over for me. Thank God I was too ADHD to fucking

696
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,360
pay attention to the subtitles, because I got, I got, I watched the first season

697
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,080
of Gurren Lagann. Dude, that's exactly what I was about to say. I remember in

698
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,280
middle school hearing about Gurin Lagan like going to watch it and like big dog.

699
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,740
I don't even know if that's right. That's just how I always have. So just

700
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,940
keep going in Gloggin Gloggin. I think it's I don't even know to be honest. I

701
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,560
just said that yeah, but you could be completely right good and like that, but

702
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,280
I remember watching it and being like this girl's boobs are too big. I can't

703
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,060
watch this and she's thirty. Yeah, I think she's old. She's thirteen in that

704
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,820
show. I think the thing is she's an adult old adult and the kid is young and

705
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,420
it's like she has big boobies. Oh yeah, that she's yeah, that's like a

706
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,560
first, you know, she could be like eleven. I don't know the first scene in

707
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,780
the show is him like

708
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:08,120
see like they they do like a like a like a glint like a like a star shows up on

709
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,080
her boob. Yeah, they did. Turtles are insane. She had those are the most

710
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,640
insane. Have you never seen these? I never even heard of you would have gone

711
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,960
cray. I went for it. I went cray for sexy jitsu in Naruto. Yeah, I think

712
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,720
Naruto is the big thing where if my parents had let me watch that, I would be a completely

713
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,720
different person.

714
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,440
I got into Naruto in the third grade for the summer. I bought all the action figures on

715
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,400
my birthday and then stopped watching it completely because I was like, "This is the worst part."

716
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,160
As soon as they switched to being teenagers, it was too scary for me.

717
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Shippuden?

718
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah. No, I didn't watch any of that.

719
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,720
I didn't even know there got to be teenagers.

720
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,480
I think Shippuden, they started airing it later on in the day or something because you

721
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,940
he wanted more blood and so I couldn't watch all that, but I had the headband.

722
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,020
I would walk around with a headband and my really I wanted the head. It was my

723
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,140
brother's friend, Sam Hacker, who played the slap. He slapped the bass guitar and

724
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,660
he left at our house one time and so I had the headband. Yeah, I saw I wanted a

725
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,600
Yu-Gi-Oh! dual disc. I had, though I had no you, your cards. I had things are

726
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,020
fucking expensive. Do you still have that you can see I did not I destroyed

727
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,700
that thing. Why do you those are because I was got in a jackass when I was nine

728
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,180
and I was don't make those anymore. I feel myself breaking it. You can sell

729
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,780
those for hundreds of dollars. Now I think I fucked up so many toys as a kid

730
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,920
that isn't that I'm not so funny and that you could everybody bet on the

731
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,740
wrong thing. You beg for a dual disc as a kid and your mom's like fucking fine.

732
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,220
Okay, whatever I need a little kid and then you grow up and you're like fuck

733
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,380
you mom. Somebody I know it's worth something. There's somebody that we all

734
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,100
know just recent. I talked to him yesterday. No, no, no, no, don't try to

735
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,700
guess what it is because I don't know if they want to have this publicly.

736
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,800
with their name. They got a bunch of calls from their home state and they were like about

737
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,720
like some taxing. They're like, "What the fuck is this?" And they looked at their like

738
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,800
first bank account they opened when they were like 15, and there was $6,000 in it. They

739
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,320
have no idea what it's from.

740
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
That's crazy.

741
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:07,000
Isn't that amazing? That would be the best. And it made me so jealous. Yeah, because I'm

742
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,560
a guy, every man sits around all day thinking about what they're going to do when they eventually

743
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,560
win the lottery.

744
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,920
That's enough for me. That's about what we're, that's pretty much. Yeah, $6,000.

745
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,080
That's what I imagine. I think that I forgot to close. They would cancel all of my medical and credit card debts.

746
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,240
I'm pretty sure that I have a, I still have my childhood bank account that I stopped using

747
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,400
because it was only in Massachusetts. Yeah. I think I forgot to close it, but I think

748
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,560
instead of $6,000 in there, I'm pretty sure it was like negative $150. Yeah, it's way overdrafted.

749
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,920
I think something, I don't want to ever think about it. That's right. You get a call from the bank,

750
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:42,480
you're like, holy fuck, this is my thing. They're like, yeah, you have $1 million in overdraft fees.

751
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,480
please it's possible shut down. I think I just turned off all the emails from

752
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,520
them and just never close the account. I don't know how much I left in there

753
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,560
when I was in when we were in college and I was like really broke. I would

754
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,760
always like optimistically open a savings account, but then it would get

755
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,040
overdrafted fifteen different times because I never put any money in it and

756
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,920
I had the fee. If you have less than three hundred bucks and then I would

757
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,080
just close it and I probably did that like six different times and I kept

758
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,400
letting me open. Yeah, I probably am really over. I should check that one. I

759
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
don't know. It doesn't matter. It's not going to do anything. It's kind of

760
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:17,040
got a dollars in my savings every month and then it takes it out really, but I

761
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,440
have six cents in there.

762
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,680
I have six cents in my savings. We need to get serious about our money guys. I'm

763
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,760
serious about money. You guys aren't you. I'm the move here with one million

764
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,000
dollars. Yeah, that's because you like cereal. Yeah, I can't do cereal. I need

765
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,120
champagne for breakfast every year. Cereal is fucking expensive. Now don't

766
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,160
even talk to me. I'm serious. Eggs are getting expensive. Everything's getting

767
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,520
so expensive eggs are when we when I lived in Boston eggs or one dollar fifty

768
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,840
nine cents. Now I get a six thing eggs. The cheapest one at the store is four

769
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,360
fifty when I lived with my parents, it was more expensive than that really

770
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,640
yeah eggs were free when I lived with my mom and dad and I don't buy that was

771
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,240
food and so is the roof over my head. We should just move back in with our

772
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,920
parents. I so much money man. I would love to move. We should move in with

773
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,920
each other's parents. We should do a rotation. I could hang out great idea.

774
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,520
Yeah, you're your dad and I would he would look through my record collection.

775
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,820
he'd say that's what I honestly think that I could show with either of your

776
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,960
parents. My dad's you guys could not chill at my parents houses. No, my

777
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,820
parents are, my parents are easy mode. Yeah, his is medium and then yours is

778
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,480
legendary. Yeah, I have the legendary difficulty home life.

779
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,060
No, it's fine to visit. They're good people. If you stay with my mom, it

780
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,060
would be a little easier, but also you have a 13 year old running around

781
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,420
hitting you with nerf bullets all day. That's why it's hard mode. That's why

782
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,100
legendary is that there's a child kicked out for saying shut the fuck up. Yeah.

783
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,660
And then my dad is just like,

784
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,260
my dad is just like kind of wandering around kind of asking you when you're

785
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,260
going to leave suddenly. Hey, so I'm leaving. What do you got going on today?

786
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:56,900
Oh, I think I'm just going to sit and watch TV. Okay. Cool. I'll be back later.

787
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:02,060
No plans. Okay, cool. You guys asking to borrow my dad's car all the time.

788
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,140
I can't fucking do it. I'm about to do it.

789
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,580
Yeah, I'd be asking your dad for rides everywhere. I'm about to just so you

790
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:14,780
guys know it's coming up this summer. I'm leaving the city revenge tour. I'm

791
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:20,880
leaving. Where are you going? I'm going home. What? Definitely okay, that's okay.

792
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,340
We'll make it. We're going home until I learn to drive. Wow wow that's actually

793
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,740
and you're making a documentary about it. Also sure I can do that. Yes, please

794
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,440
that's fine. I will have nothing because

795
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,340
I won't be able to drive when I go there and my mom does not live close to

796
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,900
anything. So I will have nothing to do all day.

797
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,860
I'm going to make a DMV appointment. I'm going to go and I'm just going to do

798
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,020
it until I'm doing the train spotting

799
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:50,180
thing where he tries to lock himself up to get himself off the heroin. I don't

800
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,380
give a fuck about that movie. I never seen it. Never will. Me neither. I don't

801
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,900
like, I don't like darkness. That is one of those things that you were talking

802
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,340
about earlier, like a thing that you see when you're younger and it fundamentally

803
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,900
like changes you that for me that was a matrix. I saw that when I was seven and

804
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,740
I or seventh grade and I thought this is the coolest thing in the world. You were

805
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:12,380
seven in seventh grade. I would believe that. Yeah, I was in seventh grade. I

806
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,500
they started doing some. They did they did testing on you and they're like this

807
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,660
kid needs to start in seventh grade. Yeah, and they're like actually we need

808
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,820
to hold you back. He's actually chill. He's actually a chill kid. You can hang

809
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:27,300
out with the twelve year olds. I saw that when I was twelve and I was like damn, I

810
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,800
want to listen to house music so bad. I want to listen to that. Is that what they do in there?

811
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,980
I still think house music is scary. Doesn't somebody shit on a baby?

812
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,140
So a baby dies of heroin. But whenever I hear someone listen, I... He deserved it.

813
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:43,020
I listen to electronic music. I feel superior to them. You don't like that song

814
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:43,940
"Born Slippy"?

815
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,500
Don't know it. That song is so good. Sing it.

816
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,540
Sing the drums.

817
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,420
I'm more into UK Garage and Dubstep myself.

818
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,420
But whatever burial

819
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,660
Was it called Kanye West?

820
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:08,740
Flashing lights drumstep remix remember that no oh that actually that's actually after my time in terms of music

821
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:15,260
I had that I had a Verizon blitz. It was like this little blue phone that slid up and I bet you had virgin mobile

822
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:21,160
For a long time really yeah, that's not even funny then yeah the virgin mobile oyster

823
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,220
virgin oyster

824
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,860
No, that's not funny.

825
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:32,940
But I had this little blue phone that slid up and it had like the keyboard and I found

826
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,780
out that you could put mp3s on it.

827
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,740
Not mp3s, it was its own proprietary file format.

828
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,460
So I converted all of my music to that and then I would listen to it on the bus and it

829
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,460
would be like.

830
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,460
Yeah.

831
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,460
I didn't know how to use mine.

832
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,460
I was like, yeah.

833
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,980
I didn't know how to download a ringtone.

834
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,980
Yeah.

835
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,980
And I wanted a ringtone.

836
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,420
I wanted numb, Linkin Park numb on my phone.

837
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,580
so I played Lincoln Park Num out of my clock radio and I recorded it with my

838
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,040
flip phone and I said it to my ring tone and it was like yeah. I was like

839
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,300
that's what I

840
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:06,320
speakers could not before set of speakers could handle. My brother did

841
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,900
line wire, but I did, but you guys remember playlist dot com now. Oh wait,

842
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,580
yeah, playlist dot com was you would put on your my space and the thing yeah

843
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,120
that you could just download songs from that, but I didn't do between those two.

844
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,660
I didn't know what to do, so I would

845
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:25,440
my dad's house. I would play a song on YouTube and record a video of the

846
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,980
speaker with his camera, and then I would download I would I would export it

847
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,960
into an MP three and windows movie maker. Wow yeah, it's probably sound amazing.

848
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:40,140
It sounded so so good yeah, yeah, so so I want to find an iPod sound. I

849
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,800
remember that numb sound recording, because I remember as soon as the guitar,

850
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,300
you know, it plays the synth thing and the synth rip and then the guitar hits

851
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,540
like as soon as the guitar hits the set like at the end of the ring tone,

852
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,540
there was just one like half second of just like

853
00:53:52,540 --> 00:54:00,640
because it could. I remember that I had songs on my on my iPod that it would it

854
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,720
would be like DJ Khaled. All I do is win and you'd hear it. I was when and then

855
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,660
you hear my dad on the phone in the background,

856
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:15,840
and it was just to me. It was part of the song yeah yeah, but I was in I think

857
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,360
sixth grade I had this app on my computer called A-Tube Catcher and it could download anything

858
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:28,780
off of YouTube in any file format. It also had all these other things, you could convert

859
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:37,200
videos with it or whatever, do all that shit. But I would also use that to blame if I ever

860
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,160
accidentally downloaded something that my mom didn't want on the computer.

861
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,680
Oh no, like Pwn?

862
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,680
Yep.

863
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
Pwn?

864
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
It's Pwn!

865
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:50,620
it on the computer downstairs and I remember I didn't have my headphones

866
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,860
plugged in one time and I thought that it was really loud. I thought that they

867
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,220
could hear it upstairs but I realized I went ran upstairs and I was like what

868
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,940
the hell was that? I just tried to download an mp3 and then I think you

869
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:08,140
told that story like less than two weeks ago. Wow that's crazy. You are a looper. I

870
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:12,100
think that was your looping. Yeah I think that was the shortest time between

871
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,300
between stories told maybe ever on the show. That's insane. Well, we were

872
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,300
talking about files. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I'm talking about files. I can't blame you.

873
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:26,100
Yeah, yeah. Man, files. I miss that shit. Miss files. What was the first time you

874
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:32,100
guys set your own desktop wallpaper? What was it? Ooh, ooh. Got my own like profile

875
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,700
on the computer. I figured out how to do that and then I made my wallpaper Rage

876
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,500
Against the Machine Evil Empire. I'm trying to remember. That big yellow Evil Empire.

877
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,960
I remember a few different. I don't know what the first one was. I definitely had

878
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,420
a binding of Isaac one at one point. I think I probably I think I had a doctor

879
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,600
who won sway at one point. I think I had the you know the one where the awesome

880
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,460
face isn't the me. Yes, I definitely had that one. I had that one. I want to say

881
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,340
I probably had some type of rage comic one at some point. I had one when I

882
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,180
first I want it. I was like teaching myself how to use a pirate at Photoshop

883
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:09,060
and I was like fourteen. I had a slender man and I made myself a bokeh like a

884
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,100
a bunch of like bubbles.

885
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,100
Oh my God.

886
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,100
And that was my background for like years.

887
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,100
Because I made it myself and I was like, "Man, this is amazing."

888
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,100
I just followed a YouTube tutorial.

889
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,100
Yeah, I did. When I got my first laptop,

890
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:26,100
I had a Windows XP refurbished laptop

891
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,100
that had 512 megabytes of RAM.

892
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,100
That's massive.

893
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,100
Really old computer.

894
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,100
Did it have the...

895
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,100
I could only play Fallout 2 on it.

896
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Did it have the bubble?

897
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,100
All in the middle of the keyboard.

898
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,100
The clitoris.

899
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,140
in the middle. I bet you couldn't find it.

900
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,980
I'm trying to find my key. All right.

901
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,940
Where's my keyboard? I'm trying to find my computer.

902
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:51,940
But I tried, I learned how to like get custom themes

903
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,580
for the like the, what's it called?

904
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,180
Like the key, like the toolbar and all that stuff.

905
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,980
Oh yeah, Star Wars one. There's a million Star Wars ones.

906
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,580
Yeah. Yeah. I did all that shit.

907
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:06,060
And then I got like such a bad virus on that thing that it did.

908
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,900
I just couldn't use a computer anymore.

909
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,020
I bricked so many computers.

910
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,300
I bricked my mom's work computer because I was jacking off to Weeds.

911
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,300
Weeds?

912
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,300
The HBO show.

913
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:21,100
I was watching like a pirated version of Weeds, whacking my shit into all the sex scenes.

914
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,100
You bricked it somehow?

915
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,900
I just got a bad virus from one of the websites.

916
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,300
I tried to download After Effects onto that computer and I bricked it.

917
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,300
After Effects was the most common virus.

918
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:35,300
Dude, it was like Command Prompt and it was in Russian and I was like, "Oh, dude."

919
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,300
You're fucking done, man. You're done, man.

920
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:44,300
Yeah. Thank God I was like 12 and I didn't have a bank account, but that could have been

921
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,300
very bad.

922
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,300
Yeah. I never got a virus.

923
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Yeah. You had a MacBook your whole life.

924
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,300
Not my whole life. I had a MacBook in high school.

925
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,300
I remember when my mom switched to Mac.

926
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,300
Yeah.

927
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,300
It was so weird.

928
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:03,300
Yeah. No, I was honestly, I was too scared because I did have, it was the family computer,

929
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,960
my family laptop and I was too nervous. I never really did anything crazy on

930
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,600
there. Yeah, my mom, because I knew how to like change the layout of the

931
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,740
computer, because I knew how to change like the tool bars and shit. My mom was

932
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:20,840
like he is a fucking computer. Yeah, I got all in the family computer days. I

933
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,500
got all my porn through Google images. Yeah, so say sir, pussy, pussy, hole,

934
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:31,500
pussy, hole, pussy, front part, girls, badge, girls, front, that jeaner. Yeah,

935
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,540
stuff like that vagina with coming it

936
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:41,460
was mostly that for me. It was that for me. Yeah, yeah, Google image search

937
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,780
vagina with lots of

938
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:49,460
the double vagina come falling out of a vagina. Come on your mark. Come come come

939
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,340
just come come come

940
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:57,060
searching. I told you guys about come white dick right. Is that your friend?

941
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:02,420
Yeah, my buddy let me borrow his iPad to play Temple Run in the lunchroom.

942
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,500
And we were arguing about something.

943
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,900
So I opened up Google on it.

944
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,460
And the first thing that showed up was come white dick.

945
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,180
Oh, and I was he winning white cum or white dick?

946
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,540
White dick with cum on it. Oh, shit.

947
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,460
And somebody come on or it's the dick's come.

948
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,260
The dick had to come. It's shot.

949
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,580
And I was like, why the hell are you looking up? Come white dick.

950
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,100
What the fuck are you doing?

951
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,980
Yeah. He's like, oh, I've been talking to this girl.

952
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:35,220
so I was sending her back a photo of my dick with how many times I was like

953
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,580
what do you what do you mean what do you mean he was like well she thinks that

954
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,100
I'm a white guy and I was like

955
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,460
wow he lied about being white lied about being white. He said by the way,

956
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:50,140
I'm white. I think it came. She said, Are you white by the way? Yeah, show me

957
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,020
prove it with your penis. This kid passed away a couple of years ago. That's

958
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,240
awful. How many kids sent just in middle school were just sending opposite

959
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,400
screenshots of the Pam and Tommy sex tape to each other being like yeah,

960
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,920
that's me, that's my dick, that's my boobs like that's like nothing. Nobody

961
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,320
was actually sending real nudity because every kid was that was too scary man.

962
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,960
Yeah, yeah, I remember taking a picture of my penis one time and just and about

963
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,400
to send it to my girlfriend in high school and just being like no, no, no,

964
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
This is last week?

965
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
Yeah.

966
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,440
No, that's, no.

967
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,440
You barely get anything for that.

968
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,360
Okay, I do like the song though.

969
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,360
I do like the song.

970
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,360
I just like the video.

971
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

972
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,520
Wait, Celtics are coming back.

973
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,520
Oh yeah.

974
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,520
Celtics are coming back.

975
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,520
Oh yeah.

976
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,640
And this song is going to be pumping in TD Garden.

977
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,960
Let's go Celtics reverse sweep on the Miami Heat.

978
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,960
That's me killing Jimmy Butler.

979
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,960
Yep.

980
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,460
up.

981
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:51,600
You know, as I get older, I've had this really sad realization of sports that I

982
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,160
have no. I think that I'd be really bad in war because I've no allegiance at all.

983
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:00,520
Yeah, I know I switch sides so often. I know if the Celtics are what means you'd

984
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:06,480
be really good in war, but you'd be dangerous pretty low. I'd be a spy. I

985
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,600
hate the Celtics when they're winning. I love them when they're losing, but then

986
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,560
as soon as they win, I'm going to be like oh, the Celtics won fuck. There'd

987
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,780
you'd be a good super soldier. You'd be a good. Thank you. So that's honestly

988
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,120
probably the kindest thing you've ever said to me. I would be a good

989
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,680
running experiments on yeah yeah. I should be a pig. They should be injecting

990
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,380
you with like a new steroid that makes like your penis. Do you ever see that

991
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,620
shit about like if you oh, we need to stop testing on animals perfumes. I

992
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,980
don't you can test perfumes on me. I don't care. That's not a big say that,

993
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:40,580
but you don't know the smell of their testing. What are they do on you onion

994
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:45,260
plus do onion plus do and that wouldn't rather by fart Jacobs fart. Jacob

995
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,380
doesn't have the capital. Are you doing here testing?

996
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:51,300
That's what that's what they're testing perfume for. It's not like to see if the

997
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,900
chemicals are like dangerous to put on your skin or something. They just

998
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,500
about they spray like a monkey with something. They smell like now that

999
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,900
smells like shit. Yeah, get rid of that. What would you fuck? It's like actual

1000
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,660
poop. Yeah,

1001
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,780
you want to

1002
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:08,700
just based on smells now. Now it smells half like poop, but how do they so the

1003
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:13,480
did that in my head. They test perfumes is yes. They sprayed on a monkey and

1004
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,400
they put a monkey. They put it in a room with a blind person. They're like

1005
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,400
would you fuck this person based on smells alone? They handcuff two monkeys

1006
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,500
by their necks to each other. I'm a very cruel. They hold the chain in the

1007
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,740
middle and then they have a big bucket that they got at a hardware store and

1008
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,660
they dump them. It's filled with

1009
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:35,260
and these are my flowers yeah. No, these are capuchins. They're pretty small.

1010
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,720
they take the cutest monkey and they say let's go. It makes

1011
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:42,440
yeah. I have a robot arm that looks it looks exactly like a human hand. It's

1012
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,720
got skin on it and they have it as a full human body attached to it and it

1013
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,780
just goes like when like when her son, but it is it as red eyes mice. They

1014
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:55,100
take all of the they go around to every farm. They take all the cutest animals,

1015
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,520
they take it back and they make the perfume and then they say let's see if

1016
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,040
they if it makes the eyes smell better and they just say they write in their

1017
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,480
sometimes. They use Homer Simpson's makeup shotgun. Yeah. That's how they

1018
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:11,080
test all the Estee Lauder. Yeah. Estee Lauder. Yeah. They test all that way.

1019
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,480
I only know what that is because of crosswords. Wow. There is a lot of

1020
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:21,380
Estee. A lot of Estee. A lot of fashion. I assume means some kind of, it's a

1021
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,480
good filler word. It's a clue, it's some kind of house of, some perfume

1022
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,780
house or something. Yeah. It's a good filler word. It's S-T-E-E, you know,

1023
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,780
you can fill up a lot of it, put it in the cross. Estee. Put it across, in

1024
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,100
middle of the word. Do you think you could make a crossword? I made a lot of

1025
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,740
crossword. That was really I

1026
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:40,740
I used to make crosswords, but that should be a new segment. Do you think you

1027
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:45,620
could make it hard up to snuff with the Sunday ones? That seems so hard. I could

1028
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,660
I could make I've made several ones that I would say are probably Monday or

1029
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,620
Tuesday. Maybe the twenty five. That's pretty easy. Twenty five dollar tier. You

1030
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,100
get conference crossword. One month. I could do a one month crossword. That's a

1031
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,580
great idea. Yeah. Yeah. It's all words that are like do. Well, that's the thing.

1032
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:04,380
I do there's a bunch of fudge. I do think that there's a okay

1033
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,340
what I'm going to say here,

1034
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:13,340
but I'm going to say here is half a joke. Okay, you I think there's a space

1035
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,660
in the crossword industry for some alt crosswords. I agree because I think

1036
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:22,500
because here's literally literally to normie crossword. No, it's not nor

1037
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,620
jupiter. The problem here's the problem it's either you get a really good

1038
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:32,360
crossword, but it's all it's on New York Times, cultural, cultural ish, stay

1039
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,620
there. I'm talking about authors like steward. I don't give a fuck about that

1040
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,780
or the and then you look up across or it's like I want a movie themed

1041
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,580
crossword, which may be something a guy might look up once in a while

1042
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:47,980
no harm in that and you get it and it's all every every crossword like that is

1043
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,020
kindergarten level. Yeah, they don't fill in the square. They have a word like

1044
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,620
this and a word like this in New York and has so many things that are like

1045
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,980
They're stupid. They're bad.

1046
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,980
It's like cultural references that you or me, no normal person would ever get. It's

1047
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,540
literally only for rich people.

1048
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,780
And the thing is that just because they're in the New York Times doesn't make them good.

1049
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:08,020
There are some crosswords I do in the New York Times and I'm like, if I was the editor

1050
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,700
for this crossword, I would say no. I would yell at this person for this clue. This is

1051
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,100
a bad clue. Even if it's not a cultural reference, this is just not a good clue.

1052
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,420
Yeah. Going in there with your newspaper and just smacking the shit out of it.

1053
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,740
I would go in there with a red pen. I'd stick it up their noses.

1054
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,340
And then say, "You cross that out."

1055
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,340
Yeah.

1056
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,900
with that red pen. I would be so good as the crossword editor for the New York

1057
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,740
Times. I think that you should. I have really strong feelings about crosswords.

1058
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:36,260
I think maybe I've never thought I've had I've been having I've been having

1059
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:40,260
kind of my dream job has been shifting. Okay. And I think this is my new dream

1060
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,580
job. I think I just or the crossword. I was thinking first I was thinking

1061
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:49,860
librarian then I was thinking mailman. I don't like Sudoku. I don't either. I

1062
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,140
don't get it. It's not that good. No it's bad. It sucks. It's all math. Sudoku

1063
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:57,040
for people who aren't smart enough to do crosswords. Yep. True. They can only

1064
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,320
think in numbers. They can only think of nine things that is thing. I think

1065
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,560
technically there's Sudoku that are way harder than cross. Oh for sure. Yeah.

1066
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,160
Depending on how little you numbers are. It's completely true. That is

1067
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,920
addicted to Sudoku, but the people who do Sudoku aren't doing those ones for

1068
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,720
the most part. They're doing tried to step in, huh? With my dad. Yeah, I've

1069
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,240
tried to. I've tried to stage the interventions for you. I do letter in

1070
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,680
there every once in a while. I've made my I've made my girlfriend annoyed

1071
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,920
before, because every time a crossword someone's doing a crossword in a tv show

1072
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,880
or in a movie, I say that to be well. No, I say they're going to slow. Yeah,

1073
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,220
that's on this person. This character is supposed to be smart and they're going

1074
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:36,160
that slow. This is taking me out of the show. I've said that. I said that if

1075
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,480
it's what if it's a very, very, very Mike Mike from and better call Saul. Yeah,

1076
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,880
he's doing a crossword easy as crossword tiny. Yeah, but he's not a he's not

1077
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,440
but smart pen to paper is a little smart. The paper is a little different.

1078
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:53,860
he's from Philadelphia. He's not smart. Yeah, pen to paper. He's a smart guy.

1079
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,800
He would be doing better than that. I'm talking in a sub Monday level crossword.

1080
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,600
He was doing really. I'm talking like ten by ten, so tiny ass cross. Monday is

1081
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,100
Sunday for Monday. Yeah, that's Sunday again. That's a hard ass one. No,

1082
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:07,880
Sunday's easy.

1083
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,100
What Sunday is like a Thursday level difficulty. It's just big

1084
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:16,860
Thursday is the difficult day. No, Saturday is the difficult day. Saturday

1085
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:21,140
is going on. They have to cross two extra lines on each. I don't know exactly.

1086
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,100
It's bigger. It's much bigger, but it's easy. It takes a little longer. I got to

1087
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:24,780
cross for you

1088
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:31,100
that way that doesn't nobody can hear that. Nobody hears your fingers and also

1089
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,740
I don't even like it. I just just by his cadence. I thought I should press the

1090
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,020
button. I thought it was a slam. It wasn't much of a slam. Well, it was the

1091
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:43,340
same because the audio was there. Um, do we have any info to give? Do we want to

1092
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:46,580
pick the next? Well, we'll pick that another time. We'll do you want to come

1093
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:47,240
I'm saying hi.

1094
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:47,740
I'm eating.

1095
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,240
Okay.

1096
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,240
That's your deal corner.

1097
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,240
Oh, there's coming a shout out.

1098
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,240
Oh, deal corner. Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let me see what Serb has to say.

1099
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,240
Do you actually have one?

1100
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:59,240
It's from Serb. This is a deal sent to me from Serb.

1101
01:07:59,240 --> 01:07:59,740
Okay.

1102
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:08,240
Serb said that there is, if you pre-purchase and pre-order Lord of the Rings, you will get...

1103
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,240
Wait, show him the new sound. He didn't hear it.

1104
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,240
Oh, yeah, you want to hear it?

1105
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,740
Yeah.

1106
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:14,740
It's a... the deal corner sucks dick.

1107
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,240
like

1108
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:23,040
like a CSGO sound. No, no, you're thinking of easy.

1109
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,380
But it's and and and put that put that battle. Yeah, that's a good song. That's

1110
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:33,640
the deal. I guess what's the deal? If you pre order and pre purchased Lord of

1111
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:38,860
the Rings, you get Gollum. Great for you. I didn't pick it out. I was doing a

1112
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:39,260
fan.

1113
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,580
Bye bye.

1114
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,580
Bye.

1115
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:46,580
Easy money.

1116
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,580
Easy.
