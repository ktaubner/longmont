1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
they told I'm recording okay wait let me record to hold on ready hold on and clap

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,840
and we're back with amazing Brandon Wardell California man all the way

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
let's see what is Holly Holly weird you hear a lot of this over there in Los

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,680
Angeles huh mm-hmm yeah we got a soundboard today I'm on the soundboard I

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,780
I always do it loud and if you're near the oh my God,

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,280
Oh no, let's see. I got to turn this off.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,000
No, this is good. This is raw.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:49,440
Okay.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,680
I will, if unless Julio cuts it out, I will come clean.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
We need to talk about this. I became the Spiller again. And maybe, no, not even

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,000
maybe, for sure the worst spill of all time on the entire show. Oh, absolutely.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,620
You have been famous for being the Spiller. I don't know if that's why I'm

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,020
famous.

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,840
You're famous on the show for being the Spiller. I think I'm famous as maybe the

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,760
host, the number one host, the better guy on the show. Maybe, maybe, maybe,

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,040
maybe, but... But if you wanna say that's why. No, the Spiller was your

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,200
nickname. The Spiller was your nickname. Coca-Cola all over the mixer. The

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,960
The Spiller used to be his nickname.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,120
I used to be the Spiller because I would spill droplets.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
You would spill droplets.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
Every once in a while.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Yeah.

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,800
The past month I have become the Spiller.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
And I spilled on the mixer.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,360
You poured a two liter of Coca-Cola.

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
A catastrophic amount of Coca-Cola.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,080
All over the goddamn mixer.

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,800
The Christmas fool over here.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
The actual Christmas dunce.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,880
But there is a Christmas miracle.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
The mixer still works.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,120
The mixer does still work.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
Please, I'm not even kidding.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,280
Nobody tell Cameron what just happened.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,320
he can never know. He can never know. He would freak out. He would do some very, very bad

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,160
things at Patrick. So we're going to avoid that completely. And we're going to have to

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,100
put this whole thing in rice pretty soon. That's a lot of rice. I saw a big bag of rice

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,340
the other day. I'm still wiping Coke off my pants. No, it's fine. I have to go to a dinner

39
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,360
after this, but I'll show up smelling like Coca-Cola. It'll smell sweet. Yeah, no, it's

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,920
fine. It'll smell like a baseball game for my wife. Your wife will like it. Yeah, I know.

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,120
I'll probably like that a lot. Brandon,

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,800
great to be back. Buddy, how are you? I'm well. I didn't get I'm I was not

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,180
affected by the soda incident. You were not affected. No, but would that if it

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,560
did spill on you with this? Would you have had some kind of diabetic attack

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,600
from just skin contact touching me? Yeah, that would scare me. I wouldn't

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,840
know what to do in a medical emergency. No, me neither. No, we'll find out. Is

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,480
Is there a world where because you're maybe the only person I know who has any

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,340
kind of medical problem at all? I really tend to keep people away from me who

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,880
have issues like that. So if you had some kind of attack, what I have to pulp

50
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,720
fiction insulin directly into your chest isn't the right or the depends it's

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,760
what what it depends what kind of incident we're talking okay.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,320
Get this

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
I spills he spills all the soda into my mouth directly in your mouth over

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,000
40,000, not 40,000, over, say a gallon of soda somehow made it into your mouth.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,160
Powerpuff girl style, I'm making a big jungle juice.

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,600
Yeah, he doesn't tell you what's in it.

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
And then I...

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
You take one sip.

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
My elbow hits you.

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,840
And then maybe he lies and says that it's Splenda or Stevia, which I imagine you can

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,720
have as much as you'd like.

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,040
I can have soda in an emergency if I...

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
That's so awesome.

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
That's amazing.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,720
I gave you some fruit snacks prior to this.

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,080
They made me feel amazing.

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,640
I really need some sugar.

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
I need the carbs.

69
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,760
that I'm medically required to have fruit snacks on me.

70
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,600
- That is the most amazing fucking diagnosis.

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,400
- No, I took it way too well when I found out about it.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
- How old were you?

73
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,920
- I don't know, I was like in middle school.

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
- Oh, dude.

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,800
- And so I was like, oh cool, so if I have an incident,

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,480
I just have to drink soda and eat candy.

77
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,680
- Sounds amazing to me.

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,520
- I was like, that sounds awesome.

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,920
- So you were in the middle of class

80
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,360
eating candy all you'd like.

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,880
- Yeah, it's basically what, I don't know how,

82
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,180
I don't know how interesting this is for people, but I'll talk about it.

83
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,180
For candy fans.

84
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,500
Please, we have a fully candy fan audience.

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,320
This would be for a candy holic.

86
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
I still like candy.

87
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,120
I would fucking hope so.

88
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,180
I still eat candy.

89
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,180
Your heart still beats.

90
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
Absolutely.

91
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,180
Yeah, so you like candy, man.

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm a red-blooded American male.

93
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
What's your favorite candy?

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,240
A hundred grand, probably.

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
Wow, that's a bit of a curve ball.

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,280
That's a bit of a low-tier Halloween chocolate.

97
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,920
This is a part about lipstick exclusive.

98
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,400
- You actually, 100 breaking news, 100 grand.

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,120
- 100 grand. - My favorite candy bar.

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
- What was that Canadian one you showed me?

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,040
- Wunderbar.

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
- Wunderbar. - Wunderbar.

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,080
All my Canadians in the chat sound off.

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,160
- That is a good-- - It's about Wunderbar?

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
- Good ass candy store. - What's so good

106
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
about this candy?

107
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
- Just like a really good texture.

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,200
It's like peanut butter and then it's like,

109
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,520
there's a caramel center.

110
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
- It sounds like a Snickers.

111
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
- It's-- - No, no, no, no, no.

112
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,080
- Sounds like a fucking Snickers to me, man.

113
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,400
No, no, no, no, no. I feel like you're not listening to me in good faith right

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,820
now. Okay, go ahead. You know, pop off about your wunderbar, which sounds to

115
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,880
me German, but I guess it's Canadian. It's good. It's really good. It's really

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,880
good. It's kind of crispy on the outside, but it's soft in the middle. Yeah.

117
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,880
It's a texture that you don't see with American candy so much. There it is.

118
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,840
That's what it looks like. That's wunderbar. Oh, yeah, there it is. Oh,

119
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm so glad we can do this now.

120
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,560
- It has, you know what?

121
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,680
I'll keep it a buck, man.

122
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,720
That is too much peanut butter in that box.

123
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,560
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,380
- That's too much for me.

125
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,220
- It's a very tasteful amount.

126
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,560
- It's the perfect amount.

127
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,040
And that looks like it's, that's like the computer version.

128
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
- I don't know what that is.

129
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,560
- That's what a robot would eat.

130
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
- Okay.

131
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,220
- That's not.

132
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,060
- So this is what you're eating?

133
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,280
- I did not eat that.

134
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
- That's your favorite candy?

135
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
- No, go back.

136
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,940
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

137
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,780
You are a robot.

138
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,120
- No, that's robot candy.

139
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,480
- Yeah, don't show robot candy.

140
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,280
- No, that's true. - There we go.

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,920
- That's the shit I'm talking about.

142
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,400
- It kinda looks like a hot dog in the middle.

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,600
- The peanut butter's just too dense for me, man.

144
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
I'd have a hard time working my way through all that.

145
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,560
- No, you can work through it really well.

146
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,400
- You'll see.

147
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,720
- I'd be mining with my teeth trying to get through that.

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
- You know what I saw the other day

149
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
that I haven't seen in a long time,

150
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,680
speaking of candy, a Fifth Avenue?

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
- What the fuck is that?

152
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
- I haven't had that. - Those are good.

153
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,300
Those are good.

154
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,560
- Some of those old candies.

155
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,640
- It's an old person candy.

156
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
- Like a Werther's?

157
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,240
- No, not like a Werther's.

158
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,640
It's like a full peanut butter chocolate bar, but the texture on the inside,

159
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,760
like the peanut butter texture is kind of like a Butterfinger, but a little bit

160
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,320
crispier.

161
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,760
Okay. Which Butterfinger has what kind of thing in it?

162
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,360
You know like the...

163
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,720
Yeah, but what's that shit called?

164
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
Peanut butter.

165
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,560
No, it has that other shit, the flake.

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,160
Brittle?

167
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,520
No, what is the flake in the...

168
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,120
Are you thinking...

169
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,280
Beating a Butterfinger, the flakiness.

170
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,320
Crispy?

171
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
The crispiness of it.

172
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,560
That's a Butterfinger crisp.

173
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,300
No, the normal Butterfinger has an ability to be Chris. Does it have an

174
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,320
ability? It has a

175
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,000
call it. Oh, those are good.

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,360
Great stuff. You're missing out. If you want to talk

177
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,800
shitty candy right now,

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,840
recently

179
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,520
a friend of mine

180
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,080
fucking

181
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,480
whipped out, whipped out some Neko wafers. I knew

182
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,760
I knew you were going to say that they're the worst candy in the fucking

183
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,360
worst candy in the world and worst name to I don't like saying that name

184
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,480
nickel wafers. No, no, no, no, no, I mean yeah, New England, we fucked up, we

185
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,200
fucked up creating the necco wafer. My granddad loves those. This is it's

186
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,320
it's like no, it's like you should only that if you're a granddad, this was it's

187
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,980
great depression food and this was millionaire comedian Stavros Stav Stavi

188
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,400
baby.

189
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,500
I mean, I think that if you're fat enough, you eat anything yeah, yeah, but

190
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,520
he well, he was just testing the waters. He never it was a the whole sleeve. No,

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,880
he was a he put him away, not put him away like that. That's how he did. He

192
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,760
did like boy. He put him away. No, he he left it on the table. He he tried one.

193
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,600
He but he went to the he was at the candy store. Yeah, he said, Do you want

194
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
anything at the candy store?

195
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:24,160
Sour patch, please. And then he comes back. He comes back from the candy store.

196
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,420
did he have an assortment? Did he have a he bought the whole trial? I think he

197
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,140
had some like

198
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,020
chocolate frogs, some like seasonal Reese's. I think it was like a Reese's

199
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,820
Christmas tree. Yeah, those are good and the sour patch and then he had like a

200
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,340
roll of neck a wafers. I said stave, what is what is that? What is that man?

201
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,220
He's just trying to he's like I don't I just saw this yeah chalky it's chalky.

202
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,540
The texture is bad. It tastes bad. Can't I would say candy in the probably nineties

203
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,820
had a meteoric rise in quality where before the 90s the candies were those

204
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,580
fucking wax bottles.

205
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,140
Ew!

206
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,900
Wax lips was considered a candy?

207
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,180
Ew! Fuck the wax bottles!

208
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,060
Wax, fuck the wax lips!

209
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,900
Keep wax away from my mouth!

210
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,340
Those are actually, depending on which one...

211
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,540
They're funny, they're not edible.

212
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,020
Depending on the one, if it's the one with the gum on the inside...

213
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,700
I'd rather eat regular cigarettes.

214
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
The ones that look real.

215
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
That's up way too loud, you gotta turn that down.

216
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
What's the tastiest cigarette?

217
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,140
Or maybe my headphones.

218
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,180
The tastiest cigarette?

219
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:29,540
When you hit a like a Turkish Royal, that is nice coffee. I think I never shut up

220
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,340
about these, but Marlboro NXT's, there was a lot of like international students

221
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,700
from Dubai and like China on our college campus and they would have these

222
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,380
Marlboros that had a it was like two different flavor things like two

223
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,460
different like camel crush, but it was like menthol, but also grape or yes, I

224
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,300
- Watermelon. - No, they have.

225
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,180
- Flavored cigarettes from Asia.

226
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,020
- I have seen those, I've seen--

227
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,620
- They have these in other countries.

228
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
- The grape flavored one? - A friend came back

229
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
with those from Mexico.

230
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,300
- Yeah, the Winston's?

231
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,420
The Winston's with the grapes?

232
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,780
- I don't know who made it.

233
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,460
- I want these. - They got those in Mexico.

234
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,060
- I want these skinny Chinese cigarettes

235
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,340
that these skinny Chinese guys smoke.

236
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,140
- I want those too. - I want to smoke this--

237
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,420
- The really long ones? - So bad, I don't think,

238
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,060
there's a full language barrier, can't ask for one.

239
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,020
I want one so fucking badly.

240
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,380
Every time I see one. You can pantomime. You can pantomime this?

241
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,380
This is... But I don't know.

242
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,420
That's such a crass word. You do this, if you want a cigarette from somebody

243
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,260
that doesn't speak English or whatever language you speak, you point at them,

244
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,580
you go, "You," okay, puff, and then you, "Joyous happiness."

245
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,260
Okay. But again, maybe in China, that could be the most disrespectful possible

246
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,140
thing. That's true. I think like this. Is this bad in China to do a pinky?

247
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,040
You never heard that as a kid that this is the Chinese. I know we didn't hear

248
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,120
anything about the Chinese in North Carolina. Yeah, that's a good point.

249
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,520
We didn't know one thing. They might have been telling you a tale out of

250
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,880
school. Maybe. I don't know. That's what I was told. This is the middle finger

251
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,680
there? People would say... So what's this? Kids would say... This is the

252
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,540
pinky... This is what you do when you drink tea? This is, yeah,

253
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,260
when you're drinking a drink, you do that. Can we look this up? But it

254
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,980
was a thing, it was like a little rumor around my school. The rumor was

255
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,840
going around? A rumor that was that this is the Chinese version of the

256
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,360
middle finger. I'm trying to think of what I heard about other countries.

257
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,560
Okay, apparently it's this.

258
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
Yeah, bad.

259
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,080
Bad?

260
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, pull up that picture.

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,360
Mmm, what is it?

262
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,480
Well, yeah, there it is.

263
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,960
Proof is in the goddamn pudding.

264
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,040
It says it right there.

265
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,560
On Quora, they have people, oh man, that looks--

266
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,400
This?

267
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,520
The thumb through the fingers is also a bad thing.

268
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,480
I guess this is kinda, 'cause it kinda looks like

269
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,960
your dick through your shorts.

270
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,080
What is the connotation behind that in China?

271
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,200
If you have your dick through your shorts?

272
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,300
That you're being rude.

273
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,000
that's rudeness. Rudeness, that's peak disrespect. Oh yeah, dude, if somebody,

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,880
okay, like if you see like somebody walking around even in their house with

275
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,360
the no bottoms t shirt on. Pooh bear, that's what I do. Pooh bear, and if

276
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,040
you're pooh bearing. I do that a lot. If you're pooh bearing while you got

277
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,100
people over, that's the most disrespectful thing you can do. Pooh bearing

278
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,480
with guests in the house, it depends on who the guests are, I guess. If it's

279
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,400
your beautiful girlfriend or your lovely wife, that's okay, but if it's your

280
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,900
boys, you can't pooh, you don't pooh bear around your boys. If your brother's

281
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,720
gonna have to poo bear now because he has soda all over his god.

282
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,820
Exactly. My pants are complete. I'm going to be walking.

283
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,840
He's going to be at the restaurant completely.

284
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,340
Pooh bear. Now he's at the goddamn pizza restaurant.

285
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,380
Yeah. Pooh bearing because of your ass.

286
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,660
And I was already by the way, I was already planning to get the fucking

287
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,920
the pizza with honey on it.

288
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,700
And now I'm going to look like I'm doing some kind of entire thing.

289
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,900
So this is going to be a really bad night for me.

290
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,820
Thanks for that red shirt.

291
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,460
Yeah, it's

292
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,620
smelling like complete sugar.

293
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,580
No, those are the his two choices right now are to either Pooh Bear or just this

294
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,820
is the worst beautiful wife. Do this is a smelling like for him to pick up a

295
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,060
catchphrase. Oh bother

296
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,900
everything is lining up in a really bad way. You've been saying that all month

297
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,180
to yeah, it's a fucking that was just a happenstance. Yeah, that just was it's

298
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,700
a thing going around. It's like Grizz or any of these

299
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,980
father. Oh father is hitting every all the middle schoolers are saying, oh

300
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,660
bother on the street. Yeah, no, it's a lot of yeah, W Riz Ohio. Oh bother.

301
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,860
Yeah, you got to say it like Pooh Bear too. It's the hardest part. And if you

302
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,860
don't say it right, kids won't do the Fortnite L dance at you.

303
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,980
Rishio, why be better, oh bother. Why be better, oh bother. That wasn't Pooh, man.

304
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,700
That was Mickey, bro. Oh, that is a little Mickey. That's full Mickey. Oh,

305
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:38,460
bother. Now I forget which one's Pooh Bear. Can you do Stitch? A little bit.

306
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,820
maybe that was me watch it off right now. Okay,

307
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
really? What? Yeah, me what and me one stitcher kind of

308
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,700
whoa. Okay, wait. I thought that was pretty good. I thought that was stitched

309
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,020
man. Pretty good stuff. You have a meat wad that turns stitch.

310
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,340
That's it. That is

311
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,020
no, that was you. I think you have a tenor. This is like this is like

312
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,700
watching Mel Blanc. This is what I know. I tried. I did this for Lauren.

313
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,420
I can

314
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,100
here's me and

315
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,300
talking to each other. Okay, this is me. One of those is me what which by the

316
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,460
way, if you haven't seen a teen hunger force,

317
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,500
this did remind me that one of the one of like the worst

318
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,780
functions I have I've been to what I guess one of the worst hangs. Tell me

319
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,140
about these celebrity parties. This is not this. It's not it's not a

320
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,120
the last part. I'm a man of the people I had. It's that so that is so apparent to

321
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,140
me, but I'm a man of the people. Tell me about this party, but I'm you know I'm

322
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,380
yipped up, okay, cocaine, oh shit, and I

had the sensor yeah sorry.

324
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,080
This is this old me, but then

325
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,860
then the other guy in the room, one of the third party you're in a two person

326
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,900
party. I'm at a it's like three people. It's like three. It's more of a

327
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,380
kickback. This is more of a kickback. All right,

328
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,100
and then this third person is like, oh wait, oh Peter, you haven't seen

332
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,620
like sixth grade. When I was like damn, this is holy crap. That is like

333
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,860
McDonald's come to life,

334
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,700
but to be you know in your thirties, you don't want to be you don't want to be

335
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,460
around any sort of situation where people are like

336
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,660
dude, you got to watch awkward.

337
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,260
That when I was in college, I we had this like literature project where it

338
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,820
was like do a

339
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,020
write something that is in the same form as something that already exists. So it

340
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,580
was a very broad thing and I got paired up with these two guys and they were

341
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,480
with like let's write an episode of Rick and Morty and but the guy said you have

342
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,520
to go do six hours of logged research and everybody else just like faked it. Wait

343
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,360
is this is in college? Yeah. Okay. And everybody else just faked it just wrote

344
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
down like read this for six hours. Which college? The one we went to? In Boston.

345
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,720
Yeah. Okay. And these guys were like yeah at Emerson and these guys were like we

346
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,920
have to wait let's see let's use this opportunity to watch six hours of Rick

347
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,280
and Morty in the middle of a Wednesday. So I went over to his house and just

348
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,840
just watch Rick and Morty for six hours and they were like taking notes like

349
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,160
okay. So Rick is Rick has blue hair. Rick is a bit of a bastard and Morty's

350
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,720
kind of a pus just doing that the entire time. It was really, really did they

351
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,760
figure it out by the end. We wrote probably one of the better

352
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,840
Rick and Morty specs grips of that class. Are you trying to like turn it

353
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,200
in? I mean I've submitted it to pretty much everybody. I mean I showed it to

354
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,160
Dan Harmon. He loved it. Hopefully, we'll move forward with it pretty soon.

355
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,840
left it in his mail box. Yep, I just put it there a little seal it with a kiss

356
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,640
and whatever else he likes probably a

357
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,480
condom with a hole poked in it or whatever.

358
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,440
I don't really know what he does,

359
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,280
but he seems like a normal guy. Jared Leto was yeah, all that kind of thing.

360
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,440
Yeah, I mean Dan Harmon, if you're putting together a gift package for him,

361
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,480
you do the condom, you do maybe fifty to sixty tiny bottles of Jack Daniels and

362
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,640
maybe a picture of your mom and then I don't know if he did he quit drinking or

363
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,160
no, I don't know. I don't quit Rick and Morty. He was he's still he's still

364
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,000
there. He's still there. He still does. Rick and Morty. You can tell based on

365
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,600
the story structure that he's still behind the story circle of it all. You

366
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,920
can tell that he's behind it. He was a very functional alcoholic. He was yeah,

367
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,600
I mean. Rick perhaps something of a self insert. Oh my god. Wait a fucking

368
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,200
And he's got blue hair just like Dan Harmon.

369
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,940
So which one is Justin's?

370
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,900
Which character is Justin Roiland's self-insert then?

371
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
The dog.

372
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Brian?

373
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Yeah, Brian.

374
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
For sure it's Brian.

375
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
It's gotta be Brian.

376
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Why do they never do a collab?

377
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,860
There's no, there is a dog, there is a dog, oh I thought you were just asking why don't

378
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,580
they ever have a dog in the family.

379
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:15,220
I did just remember, I do like when in one of the Justin Roiland DMs, when he's doing,

380
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,520
he's being a pedophile and doing Chinese voice. Yeah, yeah, doing Chinese typing.

381
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,280
Yeah, he's like

382
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
he's

383
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,360
I think he, I think he did like jare bait or something. Yeah, he said

384
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,200
something like to that extent. That is like he told he's yeah, he was like,

385
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,180
you know, he said me so horny to a child

386
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,020
to a child who has no frame of reference for what that is, doesn't know what

387
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,120
that is from this is like this guy's not that good at typing for a writer. He's

388
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,560
not that

389
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:56,420
this is the I'm Atlanta drunk. Yeah, yeah, all with one kid. Yeah, one little

390
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,560
kid. He said, Oh yeah, that's right. He said, I'm Atlanta drunk. I'm Atlanta

391
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:00,960
drunk.

392
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
With that actually

393
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,760
Drake said that if he said, I'm Atlanta drunk. Oh my God, we'd be saying that

394
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,140
It's way different if that's a DM from Champagne Poppy.

395
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,260
That is true. I mean, nobody would get mad at Drake for those exact messages, I don't think.

396
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,740
I think he'd be fine. People would have been like, "Oh, he's so cringe."

397
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,940
Oh, ew.

398
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,740
"Oh, he's so desperate."

399
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,780
He's giving me the ick.

400
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,660
He's seriously giving me the ick.

401
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,060
This pedophile is giving me the ick.

402
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,060
But Marvin's room is just so good.

403
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Yeah, being a pedophile is a red flag.

404
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,300
Yeah.

405
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,620
When are we going to link you up with Drake? I feel like he'd love your ass.

406
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,860
I know, I was definitely trying.

407
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,580
Drake, if you're listening right now.

408
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,160
I was trying in my early 20s.

409
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,660
Oh, yeah.

410
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,160
It was a lot of...

411
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,880
Mmm, yeah.

412
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,120
That was definitely...

413
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,420
Despicable Me era brand.

414
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,920
Yeah, oh, yeah.

415
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,260
Yeah, I remember that, man.

416
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Yeah.

417
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,760
Yeah, yeah, it grew it out.

418
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,260
Yeah, you were pretty...

419
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,380
You had to have been close to getting with Drake.

420
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,020
Who knows?

421
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,400
Who knows what was going on at the...

422
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,140
Imagine if you did at that age, though.

423
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,180
At the YOLO estate.

424
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,980
Would you?

425
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,620
The timeline would have been way to if Drake if Drake I don't think

426
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,620
wise you out.

427
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,860
Yeah, if Drake flies you out and just flies you out to his house and you guys

428
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,100
just like play basketball for one day, is that a little bit insulting that he

429
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,340
doesn't try to have sex with you? Maybe yeah, a little bit just a tiny bit. He

430
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,620
gives you that that what's that drink he's always talking about on the have you

431
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,260
heard of that? This he has a drink that he invented or his friend invented and

432
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,800
it's tequila and passion fruit and it's called Anda.

433
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,300
And it comes in a big wine glass and he always swirls with it.

434
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,500
And he says he's... Someone asked him how many he's drank in his life.

435
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,300
He said probably close to a million, which is an amazing, amazing line.

436
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
He's had a million drinks.

437
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,800
Did you see that video today?

438
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
No. What came out with him?

439
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,800
He was like... It's something like, this is all the underachievers tweeting

440
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,520
leaders, you know, make me sick to my stomach.

441
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,720
Nobody hates fake people more than fucking Drake.

442
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,280
Nobody. Nobody.

443
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,000
Nobody hates fake people more than Drake.

444
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,320
I think he's being, I don't think that he invented this drink.

445
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,000
I think that some...

446
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,440
His fucking friend invented it. I said he invented it.

447
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,400
His friend invented it. He says my friend invented it.

448
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,960
There's definitely an old Mexican guy that made this millions of years ago.

449
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,160
They didn't have passion fruit millions of years ago,

450
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,280
especially not in God damn Mexico. Sorry to say God damn Mexico, Jimmy.

451
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,440
Yeah. Sorry Julio.

452
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,200
Yeah. That's, that's...

453
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Maybe Julio invented it.

454
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,400
You're like a, you're actually, you're a Drake guy.

455
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm a Drake guy?

456
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
You like Drake.

457
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah.

458
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,800
Yeah.

459
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,280
Patrick hadn't listened to Drake and then you were like,

460
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,440
you got to take care of him.

461
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
Yeah, we talked about this, I think the

462
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
second to last time.

463
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
I showed you take care in our 20s?

464
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,360
Yeah.

465
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
That's crazy.

466
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Yeah, when I was like 20, 21.

467
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,040
I had a breakup.

468
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,320
I was living at 22 star.

469
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,160
You were opening at

470
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Laff Boston.

471
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,160
Oh, yeah.

472
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,680
And then you and Cameron came.

473
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,360
We had a fun weekend.

474
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,080
With Gavin.

475
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,760
Yeah, Gavin, Matt.

476
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,040
Very fun weekend.

477
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,640
And I remember that weekend, you were like,

478
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,240
"Wow, I just listened to Take Care of Me."

479
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,480
I just started listening to Drake at that time.

480
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,160
Had you just gone through a breakup?

481
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,480
I think so.

482
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,840
Because that's why I liked that album when I was a kid.

483
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,800
I think that's why.

484
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,600
Because I went through a breakup.

485
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,120
I was with this girl for two and a half months.

486
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,040
And we broke up.

487
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,800
And I started listening to Drake.

488
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,560
I always thought Drake was a homo thug.

489
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,420
that we used to call him. I thought Drake was a homo, and so I didn't like him

490
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,340
because he sang about his feelings and about what he was eating. I was like,

491
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,300
"Shut up, man. Sing about killing people or math." Yeah, they were at the press

492
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,980
and play and you were saying pause. Yes, well, we didn't have pause back then.

493
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,700
If we did, we definitely had pause back then. We, I didn't. Whites had no

494
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,040
pause. They didn't know. Whites had not heard a pause. We had no homo. They

495
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,860
didn't know about Cameron saying it ten years ago. No, I mean, I guess I knew

496
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,860
about camera, but just like purple haze. That was the no homo era.

497
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,380
This was no homo. This was fully no homo. So if you said anything,

498
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,740
you'd have to say no homo or else you wouldn't get paused, but you would

499
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,620
go, you would get a what the fuck? You'd say, "What the hell? You're being

500
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,780
gay." That's what we used to say instead of pause. You sound like a gay

501
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,780
wad. We used to have, "What the bloody hell? You're acting like a gay guy."

502
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,180
You've lost the plot, mate. You've lost the plot, you turned gay. You've

503
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,500
absolutely lost the plot. Yeah, we used to have that. Yeah, it's giving gay

504
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,800
got it. Nowadays, they probably do that. They say that now, but yeah, the only

505
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,660
rap I listened to before Drake, it was all about either

506
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,380
crime or math, math and science. I would listen to, I was into that kind of. Were

507
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,700
you listening to MC Chris?

508
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:43,980
No, he liked MC Chris. I did. Oh yeah. I thought MC Chris was wack, dude. I, oh,

509
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,800
it was a way worse nerdcore rapper. It was MC, too. Name, I can't remember. MC

510
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,760
- No, dude, it was a different guy.

511
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,600
- Yeah, I remember.

512
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,700
- MC, oh my God, MC front a lot.

513
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,540
You remember him?

514
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,100
- Why was it always MC?

515
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,180
- Was he sort of in,

516
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,860
'cause I remember MC Chris had some sort of

517
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,700
ties to Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

518
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,660
- Yeah, MC Chris was the baby character,

519
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,020
the one that's like, I like candy.

520
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,260
- The Moon and I.

521
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
- You know that one, remember that one?

522
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,160
It's like the-- - One of the Moon and I.

523
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,380
- No, no, it was the episode where it's like,

524
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,100
or MC Pee Pants, right?

525
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,940
- Mm, yes.

526
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,780
- Isn't that MC Chris?

527
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,780
I remember he has a song with Childish Gambino, Mystery Team soundtrack.

528
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Wow.

529
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
Yes.

530
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
Filmed in my hometown.

531
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:29,220
This is something that me and, I feel like me and Patrick really connected early on via

532
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,060
like this fucking useless media ephemera.

533
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,340
Trivia stuff that you both know.

534
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,540
Do you also know every actor's name from every movie and what other movies they've been in?

535
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
Not so much.

536
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
So what do you tell them to?

537
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,820
It was mostly me and him saying, "Do you remember that Childish Gambino song where he raps over

538
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,700
two weeks by Grizzly Bears?"

539
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Oh, okay.

540
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Member Berries.

541
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh, did you watch a lot of Wonder Shows?

542
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
We were fully Member Berries.

543
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,700
You guys did Member Berries back and forth with each other.

544
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Well, that's good.

545
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
Member Berries.

546
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Yeah.

547
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,340
Yeah, it was us talking about Wonder Shows and that fucking I Am Not a Rapper by Childish

548
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
Gambino.

549
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
Crazy, yeah.

550
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,340
That is an amazing list.

551
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
I have that on my family desktop.

552
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
Oh, yeah.

553
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,600
to this day. I wonder if he scrubbed that from the internet. No, because it's definitely

554
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,080
that shit that he was rapping over. It's like, yeah, man, I can tell you're not a rapper.

555
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,120
You're not even using any boom bap beats. You're not even using boom bap. You're not

556
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,200
even you don't sound like a mortal technique to me. No. Yeah. You're like this doesn't

557
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,720
have any of the core elements. Where are the five pillars in this? What the hell is this

558
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,920
crap? Five pillars. I'm barely even hearing him seeing. Let alone knowledge. There's no

559
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,860
no no emcee breaking graffiti graffiti be buying. That's the one I that's I think

560
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,920
that's the pillar. I put my most points and a lot logic and reason, logic and

561
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,000
reason knowledge. Let's see there's got to be more

562
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,840
Islam is long. Well, that's that would be wrapped in a knowledge. Yeah, that's

563
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,160
true. You wouldn't know about that. What was the name of the guy who came up with

564
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,200
these Africa Bombada? Yeah, which is an amazing last name wasn't he and an even

565
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,880
better first name Africa Bombada. Was he a diddler or is that but it was guys?

566
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,720
Oh, okay, so it's like

567
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,800
who know so it's worse yeah, because men are

568
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,040
persecuted and our lives are ruined. What is it like being a man in sunny Los

569
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,000
Angeles where the feminists are rain rain supreme? They destroy your life. I got a

570
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,080
phone call yesterday that I ignored from my old teacher or my my old not teacher,

571
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,880
old boss from when I used to work at the UCB on Sunset.

572
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Amy Poehler? Oh, wow.

573
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,280
She called me and I'm really, really scared that she's going to leave me a

574
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,360
voicemail or something.

575
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Wait, what was the... You don't know what it was?

576
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,880
I didn't answer. It scared me so bad.

577
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,320
What if it was a congratulatory call?

578
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,920
I have a strong feeling it wouldn't be.

579
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,840
By the way, UCB Sunset, have you guys talked about this?

580
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,440
No. Not to get too in the weeds about it.

581
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
A little bit, not too much.

582
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,320
But it was like, it no longer exists.

583
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,960
Yeah, it's gone.

584
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,920
But it was like in like an old hospital.

585
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,240
Yeah.

586
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,880
No way.

587
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,420
No, like felt super sterile. It was a very bizarre place.

588
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,340
I didn't go there. The setup was bad. I never went there.

589
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,520
I think that we walked by it and like we walked by it on the way to El Pollo

590
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
Loco, which I was like, Oh,

591
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,700
El Pollo Loco was right next door. El Pollo Loco, pretty good. Yeah.

592
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,720
I used to go there. I used to go to UCB every single day.

593
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,380
I worked there behind the desk. I would sign people up for classes.

594
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,740
It really felt awful. You'd send the lambs out.

595
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,700
to know that they're going to get hurt. Yeah, some kind of way. Yeah, just

596
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,500
in order to play. They're about to get in the worst two year relationship with an

597
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,180
older man. It's just going to be so fucking taught them. Yeah, exactly. It's

598
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,460
going to be just a bad, bad situation. And then I would go and I would go to

599
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,500
subway and I would eat a rotisserie chicken sandwich every single day.

600
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,980
Did that rotisserie chicken rotisserie chicken at subway. The rotisserie chicken

601
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,780
had just come out, man. I didn't know this was on the menu. I think it's gone now. I would

602
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,260
go no cheese, rotisserie chicken, tons of veggies, veg it up. Oh my god. Sometimes I

603
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:17,060
haven't scooped the bread. They hated me for that. Yeah. Can I get it scooped? Not at Subway,

604
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,220
man. Not at fucking Subway. No, come on, man. I don't know. I feel like when you walk into

605
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,820
a Subway, all the employees are at your whim. Me? Yeah. You think I have Subway King? You,

606
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,420
I've seen you in Subway before, bro. You have seen me. I run, I've, oh my god. The way that

607
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,660
you asked for bell peppers. I've never seen it's like it's like when a

608
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,500
Rottweiler see somebody they don't like. Yeah I'm growing.

609
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
"SATCH BELL PEPPERS!"

610
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Bell peppers please.

611
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,260
Did you know about Quiznos?

612
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Yes.

613
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
There's only 150 of them.

614
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
I know dude they went away.

615
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,020
That was the first time I ever had guacamole guys.

616
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Really?

617
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
It was Quiznos?

618
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Quiznos man.

619
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Wow.

620
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Guacamole.

621
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,820
The first experience I ever had with guacamole was at Quiznos.

622
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,420
And people, I mean we had never heard of this shit.

623
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:06,120
I forget about the fucking... There's one person on this sound effect that is

624
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,940
screaming so loud. On the applause thing? I forget about it every single time.

625
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,140
Yeah! Yeah, it's so good. Yeah, that was the first time I had... Nobody had

626
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,380
ever heard of guacamole. What was it on? It was on a sandwich, man.

627
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,760
A turkey sandwich. No, what was the sandwich? A veggie sandwich. Wait,

628
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,900
then it was in the... Do you line up? At Quiznos? Yeah. Is it the same

629
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,740
- You've never been to one?

630
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,900
- It's been years.

631
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,620
- So the Quiznos experience,

632
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,960
the reason why Quiznos isn't around anymore,

633
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,760
they were the first people to do toasted subs.

634
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,500
Subway used to not have toasted subs.

635
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,340
Now, they're trying to toast my fucking tuna sandwich.

636
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,180
I'm about to shit holes.

637
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,100
- That was the key difference.

638
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,260
- That was the key difference.

639
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,100
- They were the only ones, that was their motto.

640
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,420
- And then Subway, once they started toasting,

641
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,780
it was the game changed.

642
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,620
- It was fucking over.

643
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,120
- And they had the sponge monkeys.

644
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,140
- What's that?

645
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,980
You don't remember that? We like the moon, we like the subs.

646
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,060
Uh-huh. They had those.

647
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,180
Yeah, those are funny guys.

648
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,380
Those are really funny.

649
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,180
What the hell is a sponge monkey?

650
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,220
Yeah, it was a video.

651
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,100
It was a viral video back in the day.

652
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,380
They did this in the same time as Jared.

653
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
They were doing sponge monkey?

654
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,060
That was, this was their competitor to Jared for a second.

655
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,220
Well, yeah, Patrick does this thing where every time I'm in town, he's always like,

656
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,740
"Dude, you got to come over.

657
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,820
We're going to hit a sprite gravity bong.

658
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,580
I'm going to show you all of the Quiznos sponge monkeys."

659
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,220
there's only one. I believe that. There's only one, but I keep it on a loop

660
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,660
because I like it so much. He's cracking up. He's losing his shit every time.

661
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,900
They like the subs. They love the subs almost as much as the moon. A couple

662
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,180
of weeks ago, me and Cameron at Pat's house, we were- what were we watching

663
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,060
that you were loudly playing bass guitar through the entire thing? We were

664
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,580
watching some TV show. We were watching- we were watching

665
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,460
Family Guy, Most Racist Moments compilation. Oh, that's enough. Family Guy,

666
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,820
Most Racist Moments compilation. You guys just like came over my... I think we

667
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,860
got lunch. Pat amp in the amp on, turns on the amp, plugs it in, sits next to

668
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:02,980
us,

669
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,140
what's louder than the TV?

670
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:11,260
No, I was playing... That's not what I was playing. You tried. I did. And failed.

671
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,620
I tried to play... I tried to play Tool. I tried to play Tool,

672
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,820
Schism for you guys.

673
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,300
I do wanna...

674
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,060
just speaking of Family Guy, I don't know if I ever showed you that.

675
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:28,220
I've showed you my old my old like forum post from when I was like, I've seen

676
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
the one. Oh, yeah.

677
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,540
Yeah. Grinch alert. I genuinely I was in a shiver down my spine.

678
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,460
I was thinking that you were going to show me just like like, oh yeah, I made

679
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,100
this on the train on the way over and it's like Family Guy yourself.

680
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,620
Like one of those things.

681
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,180
This is kind of a line.

682
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,780
Yeah. But this does this is my first ever post on that website.

683
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,660
- Okay. - Okay.

684
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,060
- Toonzone.net, I was 13 years old.

685
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,060
And this is a subject line,

686
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,460
"I went to the carnival recently, dot, dot, dot."

687
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,340
- Wow, I like it already.

688
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,700
- So, Family Guy does come up.

689
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,580
Yesterday, I went to the carnival.

690
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,420
While I was walking around, I saw plenty of games.

691
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,160
At those games, many character-based stuff toys were there,

692
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,620
including cartoon characters such as SpongeBob,

693
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,260
Superman, Nemo, Batman, and a few of the Simpsons.

694
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,320
But the character with the most toys was,

695
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,520
that that that Stewie Griffin

696
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:27,120
they're an adult animation. Yeah, I know. I was like bitch. I was really

697
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,920
concerned about this. They range from massive to very small. Brian, Peter, Meg,

698
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,840
Chris and Lois also had toys. I even saw- Lois? I even saw plenty of toddlers

699
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,720
with Brian dolls, which there's no way. No. That's- You lied. There's no way.

700
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,120
You lied. I had to have been lying. Yeah. You had to- I've never seen a Lois

701
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:55,080
I've seen one. I understand that many adults and teens go to the carnival too, so I was

702
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,680
not very surprised. However, many of the games with the Griffin Clan...

703
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:11,340
The Griffin Clan is crazy! I love when, like, it still gets me every single

704
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,000
time when somebody talks about the

705
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,580
Family Guy characters as if they're

706
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,460
like, like family friends, you

707
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
know?

708
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,920
You're an amazing writer as a

709
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
child.

710
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,140
Oh, because I also wanted people to

711
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,460
think I was older than I was.

712
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,620
That comes across.

713
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,700
Yeah.

714
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,460
Had a sign saying 12 and under.

715
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,940
I was somewhat surprised by this.

716
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,980
I also recently saw an action figure

717
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,780
featuring Jasper, which I forgot

718
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
about Jasper.

719
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,460
Oh, yes.

720
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,100
Oh, yeah. Replacement Brian.

721
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,060
With the message on the package eight

722
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,920
and up. I know that Family Guy gets

723
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,960
wonderful ratings from the nine to fourteen demographic, but wouldn't Fox

724
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,240
want to hide that fact rather than embracing it? Oh, my God, that's crazy.

725
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,040
So no, I somebody you're trying to sound older in those posts, but you sound

726
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,480
subject matter. You accidentally you you were trying to sound like ten years

727
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,000
older, but you accidentally like sounded thirty years older. You sound like a

728
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,680
Christian. No, I there's like one there's one post where I'm talking about

729
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,240
24 and I was like, wow, like I love 24. It's a great topic to discuss at your

730
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,740
job.

731
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,600
That's what you thought.

732
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,880
Water cooler talk.

733
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,520
Jack

734
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,760
got up to last night. You see the enhanced interrogation? Jack

735
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,440
No, these like old forum posts of mine. I looked, I was like, I was looking

736
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,600
through them and I feel like I beat autism. Yeah, I think maybe I just, I

737
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,120
I mean, you at least...

738
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
You zipped right past it.

739
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,800
Well, I don't know if zipped right past it is exactly what we're...

740
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Zipped or dived right in.

741
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,960
Yeah, you dove right in. And maybe you've gone to the shallow end of the pool.

742
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Right, exactly.

743
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,760
But yeah, but you were definitely high diving into the 30 foot.

744
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,200
I wish that there were still my forum posts.

745
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,520
I found another one real good where I was talking about the new episode of American

746
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Dad.

747
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Okay.

748
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,880
And there's one part where I'm like, "It airs at 8.30 right after Seth's other baby, Family

749
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,560
funny guy. What am I talking? Seth's other baby. Those are his babies.

750
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,700
It's crazy, man.

751
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,360
It was really disappointing for me as a

752
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:23,840
Seth's other baby. It is, dude. Yeah, it's unmistakably his baby.

753
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,200
That's his baby.

754
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,880
His only baby is Stewie or Rallo. When I was a kid being, I remember being a

755
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,160
little bit disappointed when I found out that Seth MacFarlane was not like a

756
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,440
fat guy. Well, not like an ugly libertarian like the South Park guys.

757
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,400
Yeah. Like finding out that he was like a theater kid, made me a little like,

758
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,280
"Oh, well, fuck this guy." You can see yourself... That's the thing,

759
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,080
it's like you can see yourself hanging out with Matt and Trey. You can envision

760
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,480
it... It's all I think about. And it's all...

761
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,160
Oh my God, I can't even tell you the dreams where I just... I wow them

762
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,560
with my Cartman every night. Every night I fall asleep to a dream where I am. I'm

763
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,800
hanging out with Matt and Trey and I wake up to a nightmare where I'm not or

764
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,360
you're not even in the same state of my bed. Well, they, that's, you know, but

765
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,800
Seth, it is funny, it is funny that Seth MacFarlane, who was like, you know,

766
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,920
prior to Family Guy, he was, you know, he's working, he's like a storyboarder

767
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,600
on Johnny Bravo, whatever. He gets on, he gets, he gets on Family Guy, he gets

768
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,040
the, you know, once he got the Family Guy back, he was like, "Finally, my excuse

769
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,780
to be a lounge singer.

770
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,040
Finally, my excuse to

771
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,600
get real. Do this snap. To do it like Frank. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that really

772
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,880
is an interesting

773
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,560
next step. Yeah. That's not what I would think if I had done that. I mean,

774
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,000
they were pushing him front of camera hard. He did the fucking Goldies. He was

775
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
the roast master. He hosted the Oscars. Oh, is that what it was? He was the

776
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,720
roast master for a lot of different roasts. Yeah. He hosted SNL. Frank Ocean

777
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,000
as the musical guest.

778
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,840
- Oh yeah.

779
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,220
- But Seth, you know, you talk Frank with Seth,

780
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,360
he's more of a Sinatra man than an Ocean man.

781
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,200
- Yeah.

782
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,400
- You know, that's the thing about Seth.

783
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,240
- That's right.

784
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,080
Ocean blue eyes Sinatra, that's what he likes.

785
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,720
Not so much Frank.

786
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,320
- And yeah, I remember he hosted the Oscars

787
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,000
and he did that, he got in trouble

788
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,360
'cause he did that song that was like,

789
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,840
"We Saw Your Boobs."

790
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,680
- Yep.

791
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,520
- He did a what?

792
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,920
- He did a song where he named every actress in the room

793
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,280
that had a nude scene that year.

794
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,760
I was like, we saw your boobs.

795
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,800
- That's borderline disrespectful.

796
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,640
- You know?

797
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,460
- Mm-hmm.

798
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,300
- But--

799
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,440
- Strike one, Seth.

800
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,280
- Strike one, Seth.

801
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,120
- You know, Seth, you get tired of it.

802
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,940
- Strike one.

803
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,680
- Strike two, you killed Brian.

804
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
What the hell was that?

805
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,520
- Three strikes, you're out, buddy.

806
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
- You fucking stupid bastard.

807
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,080
- You better not fuck up the Orville this season.

808
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,920
- We got him back.

809
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
- You better not fuck up the Orville.

810
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,960
- You fuck up the Orville?

811
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,780
- Yeah.

812
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,620
- I'ma kill you, man.

813
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,960
- We're coming, we're coming for you.

814
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,800
We're coming for you.

815
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,620
- That's how it is.

816
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,120
- I did want to make sure that you guys know

817
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,080
they did, they brought Brian back. Yeah. What? We know they brought Brian back.

818
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,920
I know. Yeah, they brought him back. I know they brought him back, but

819
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,840
that's a prank you don't pull. Yeah. That's a prank you do not pull. You

820
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,400
wouldn't do that with my own mother, would you, Seth McFarland? You wouldn't

821
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,960
beat her to death with a car and then say, "Just kidding, she's here.

822
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,640
Here's a time machine that brings your mom back." And I would say Brian was

823
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,680
magnitude's greater importance in my life than my mother growing up. Oh,

824
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Everyone says that.

825
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,640
That's where I got all my jokes from and my outfits.

826
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,160
And my love for dirty martinis.

827
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Yeah, it's where I learned what a martini was and fell in love.

828
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm constantly doing this.

829
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,640
I'm imagining a martini in my head.

830
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,080
That's the Seth self insert.

831
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Oh my God.

832
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
He is the...

833
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
You're right.

834
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,600
Brian is like, he's the one voice of reason in the room.

835
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,960
He's a smart guy.

836
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,760
He doesn't have a fucking one of these dog shit New England accents.

837
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
He's well read.

838
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Yep.

839
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
And he fucks hot chicks.

840
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
sex and he wants to fuck his own mom.

841
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,760
He only has sex with white women though.

842
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
And that's a problem Seth.

843
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
And that's another thing I want to talk to you about.

844
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Strike three. Strike three Seth.

845
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Hook up Brian with a black queen my friend.

846
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
We're gonna need some sisters.

847
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Please surround Brian.

848
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Seth.

849
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Seth. Seth come on.

850
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,760
Seth you're neglecting your babies.

851
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Come on Seth.

852
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Your baby is failing man.

853
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,000
Tell me what is it like to be back in the greatest city in the world and away from

854
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,440
the worst? Yes, I love dude. I know. Yeah, I got in today earlier. Yeah, but and I

855
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,880
came straight here. Isn't it amazing? I took a blade helicopter right to the

856
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,720
bottom. I was Tom. I want to take one of those so bad. I've Yeah, but I can't do.

857
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,000
I know that I will die like Kobe the exact same way with your daughter in tow.

858
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,800
No, come on. Talk about them. Well, you're done. I can't. It's not talking

859
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
talking about his daughter you fucking bastard.

860
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I don't have a daughter.

861
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
You're talking about the goat and

862
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
talking about his dead daughter.

863
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Kobe Bryant.

864
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Los Angeles Lakers.

865
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Colby.

866
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
You're crazy.

867
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Can you turn my headphones up?

868
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Which one are you?

869
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
That's me. That was way too loud.

870
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Is this you?

871
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
You have hearing issues.

872
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
I do because I thought you said Colby.

873
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,560
just had a fucking problem, but it's nice being here. Yes, it is nice being here.

874
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,480
I don't it's L A is the L A. Thank you. It's bad. It got bad. What are you doing

875
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,000
every day? Yes, you wake up, you go to air one by of what the crap is wrong

876
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,320
with the price of the smoothie. There is a new fifty dollar rotisserie chicken

877
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,120
Olivia Rodrigo smoothie at air. What the heck? Let me guess. It's pink. Yeah,

878
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,240
no, it's purple. Oh shit. Well, it's the same. Somebody's not keeping up with

879
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,840
the lore. I have a in it at all. No, is that the fellow half Filipino?

880
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,240
Yeah.

881
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Ube. I like the Ube pie. Oh,

882
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,800
Jollibee. I like. Oh, yeah. Oh, the in the little. Yeah. The hollow hollow.

883
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,720
Yeah. The pie. It's the pie. It's like a fast. That's a mango pie. They have

884
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,520
an Ube one. They have an Ube. Yeah, bitch. They do. It's I haven't. I

885
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,880
really haven't been back there in so long because the only one that I know

886
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,960
of is in Times Square. Yeah, it's not worth it. I think there's more. There's

887
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,720
probably more the chicken sand. What huge, huge, huge fan of the chicken.

888
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,300
Oh, it's so good. It's oftentimes left out of that is a really good chicken

889
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,960
sandwich. They put chicken sandwich. It's not pickles. It's jalapenos. And so

890
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,600
you hit, you hit the air one. Yeah. Next thing, let me guess, 10 to 12

891
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,260
auditions. You're going out for the new, the office reboot. They have you

892
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,760
playing Jim. Obviously, you're doing reads kind of silent mug into the camera.

893
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,640
they say it's a pass for now, but you might have a chance. You might have a

894
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,500
chance. You might be the AI stand in for John Crusier. You are our favorite, but

895
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,980
the producers won't like it. One day we might get you in that late season

896
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,400
Clark Duke. Yes. I was thinking about Clark Duke earlier because I saw a

897
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Clark Duke type of guy and you don't see them as often anymore. I would say

898
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,760
I've only ever seen one on TV. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, but you know the type,

899
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,320
you know the type, the Clark Duke, like think about Clark Duke, think about a

900
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Clark Duke clone with like a guy with glass. He looked like glasses.

901
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,520
Like a guy who looks almost exactly like Clark. Like a not that like a kind of

902
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,420
fat guy with glasses. Kind of fat guy with glasses and like the long swept

903
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,120
bangs. You don't see it's like a guy it was like a it was like a man in. You

904
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,020
don't see that anymore. It was like a man from 2012 perfectly preserved in

905
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,920
amber is what I mean. That's interesting. A guy with glasses. A guy with thick

906
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,620
glasses. You know you know what I'm trying to say. Like guy like Weezer

907
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,620
looking at. It's a Weezer looking type of guy.

908
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
I would say you see that all the time.

909
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,620
I see these guys every day.

910
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,620
I think I've been in this damn city too long that

911
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,620
I don't see them. Well, because it's all like Carhartt.

912
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Yeah. It's all Carhartt guys.

913
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,620
It's all these hipsters.

914
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,620
These Carhartt guys jumping up on roofs.

915
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
Who knows what the fuck they're doing. They're using

916
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
hammers and nails, looking like assholes.

917
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
You don't see too many of the

918
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
guy who exclusively shops at Old Navy

919
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,620
in this neighborhood.

920
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,620
The other thing about these Carhartt guys

921
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:06,020
in Bushwick. Yeah, talk about it. They can't work a toolbox, but it's a bunch

922
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:12,340
of tools looking for box. You know, that's my observation about all that.

923
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,820
If you ask me...

924
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,180
Yeah, body. Today, I don't really use Twitter anymore, so... So you gotta get

925
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,020
it out now. I'm gonna go through my drafts. The drafts.

926
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:27,700
I like that. That's what this show is for. Yeah. Today, I was wearing... I

927
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,680
I had to go change my sister in law's tire. She had a fire had to put a spare

928
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,660
on it, miss the gym because of that. I'm so sorry. He's a fucking tool box. I

929
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:41,660
know a little bit. I was changing the tire, though, and I got maybe one second

930
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,020
into even putting the jack up yeah and a guy runs over me, grabs my shoulders and

931
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,820
goes you're going to fuck up the car man. You put the jack in the wrong place and

932
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,940
I was like I know I'm not I'm just starting the jack and he was like you're

933
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,860
fuck the whole thing up man fucking up badly, and I was like I know what I'm

934
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,700
doing man get away from here, and then I looked and I was wearing this outfit and

935
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:09,500
I realized Dickey double knee, the clogs, the clogs with no laces on this guy

936
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,220
thought that I

937
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:16,940
was a hip stuff. Hell no and I not this guy dude and I wanted to say no bro. I

938
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,260
he was already long gone, but I wanted to chase after him on his Uber. Each

939
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,340
I'm not a hipster. I'm not a hipster. I know how to hang a painting. I just

940
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:30,000
saw the TV, you bastard. I hate passion. But luckily, he doesn't make very much

941
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,400
money

942
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,300
'cause he's an Uber Eats driver. So I win in the end. You got him. Yeah. So in

943
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,600
the end, "Okay, change all the tires you want, buddy. You're not getting paid

944
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,160
for 'em. Fuck you." That is funny that he just instinctively was like,

945
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,160
"You're gonna ruin this." He didn't even see what I was doing. He just ran

946
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,400
open up to me, touched me and wanted to tell me that I saw that's an assault. I

947
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,300
could have sued him. I could have ruined his entire family. I should have killed

948
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,960
him. He's crossing a boundary. You should have taken the fucking handle out of the

949
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,800
jack. If we were in a better state, I would have. Yeah, but all of a sudden,

950
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,360
you should have taken the jack, put him on top of it, get him real tall, right?

951
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,140
And then made him and then tipped it over or maybe wait for a bird or a bird

952
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,740
that hit him. Bird of prey to come by. You guys see the thing Eric Adams said

953
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,680
today that was so funny? I did not see. Well, this is going to be so dated when

954
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,040
that comes up. Eric Adams, this is come out, it's backlogs of probably

955
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,260
sometime like January. We've got he'll say something funny. He'll say something

956
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,500
funny. It's okay. Eric Adams said he did some interview today and they were like

957
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,800
what what is what is it like being the mayor of New York and he's like it's a

958
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,880
most amazing city in the world. Every day you could wake up and a plane could fly

959
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,500
into the World Trade Center or you can have the best slice of pizza of your

960
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,480
life. This city is truly something he said every day you could wake up and a

961
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,340
he could fly into our trade center.

962
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,820
(laughing)

963
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,860
That is so, he is such a fucking beast, dude.

964
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,700
- Dude, it's so sick.

965
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,060
- He has to run for president, please.

966
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,900
- Please.

967
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,380
- Please, Eric Adams, if you're listening, please run.

968
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,660
- That video of him, where I think it's him

969
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,140
like showing off places in your house

970
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,660
to look for like weapons that your kids could be hiding.

971
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,140
- I haven't seen that one.

972
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,860
- Oh my God, it's so good.

973
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,820
- Where does he posit that you could find them?

974
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,800
- It's like--

975
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,640
- Why do they make all these--

976
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,140
How many kids are around? I think if your kid had a gun, you'd know you'd be

977
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,640
suspicious.

978
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,440
Could you pull that up?

979
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
They'd make it known.

980
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,540
Because it's like, how the hell is a kid gonna like, it's like, like they're

981
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,040
hiding it behind like picture frames and stuff. And it's like him just putting

982
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,440
a picture frame down. Look up like, it's called like Eric Adams weapons. Yeah,

983
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,240
gun safety.

984
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,040
Behind a like a fucking haunted house.

985
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,740
Yeah, it's like, it's like his house is a haunted house.

986
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,540
Here's where your kids could be hiding ghosts.

987
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,440
Oh yeah, this is him.

988
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,080
well yeah wait what does he have there?

989
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,080
a bag? a book? on a bookshelf?

990
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
yeah that was pretty much all like that

991
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,080
I'm asking you to join me in this crusade

992
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,080
you may be using an illegal drug

993
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,080
or carrying an illegal gun

994
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,080
but you also have to protect

995
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,080
the members of the household

996
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,080
I love his setup here this fucking tiny ass

997
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,080
little Michael Scott style

998
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
flat screen TV

999
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,080
yeah this is a bad TV and you're the mayor

1000
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,080
you're the fucking mayor

1001
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,480
doors, your house is open to inspection by your house and the members of your house.

1002
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:25,480
The message is, I may be hiding. For instance, a gun could be hidden inside a jewelry box.

1003
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:32,480
Look at the various colognes, perfumes, and photos and pictures. In addition to a book,

1004
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
something simple as a crack pipe

1005
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
*laughter*

1006
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,480
something very simple

1007
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,480
it's so fucking sick

1008
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,480
yeah

1009
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,480
cameras try to determine what's

1010
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
taking place

1011
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
behind a picture frame you can find bullets

1012
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,480
*laughter*

1013
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,480
doesn't mean the child is carrying a gun

1014
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
no

1015
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
where there's smoke there's possible fire

1016
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,480
where there's a bullet there's possibly

1017
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
a gun

1018
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,940
That's real shit. Bullets are kind of the breadcrumb. Oh, absolutely. That's what you know a gun is around. Oh, it's the doll, right.

1019
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:08,660
What the f-

1020
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,160
Oh, well.

1021
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,800
(laughter)

1022
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,200
Yeah, he's got weed hidden in the baby doll.

1023
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:19,100
Yeah, this is all, this all would be a problem in my house. Oh, absolutely. My kids will own nothing.

1024
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:27,760
Mm-hmm. No, did you guys- Well, you have, you said, you said that if, if your son comes home with a jewelry box, he's gonna have a different, a different problem.

1025
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,260
he's going to have some real problems. He said there better be a gun in that.

1026
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,000
I would be better not be any so happy if my son brought home a jewelry box. I

1027
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,740
went, oh my God, now open it up. Oh, twenty sixteen. Yeah, okay, all right.

1028
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,200
You know what? Now you're speaking my language. You put your hand in full AR

1029
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,720
fifteen and pull it. And then I sit him down and I'm like, listen, son, you

1030
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,240
don't have to hide this kind of thing from me, okay? Look, I got one myself.

1031
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,840
You pull it out of your pocket. Yeah, I carry. AR. Yeah, mine's not in a

1032
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,840
fucking jewelry box, you freak cake.

1033
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,200
- My son, my jewelry wearing son.

1034
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,160
Did you guys, when you were growing up,

1035
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,960
did you guys have a locked door policy?

1036
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,040
- No, I shared a bedroom with my two brothers.

1037
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,240
- Oh, I did, I did.

1038
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,120
I did have, well, oh, like that you couldn't lock the door.

1039
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:20,000
No, well, yes, yes until I got to a certain age.

1040
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,320
But then-- - Jack off time.

1041
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,900
- Yeah, but once it was jack off time,

1042
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,240
the problem was that I had two doors.

1043
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,760
I was like in the I was in the I was in the basement.

1044
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,560
You have a warning. I was in the basement.

1045
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,440
And then I had like I had one door here and one door there.

1046
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,720
And so if if the knock is coming from both, it's hard to it was hard to jack.

1047
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,160
Oh, you had two doors not to get into your room, but a door on either.

1048
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,520
No, like two separate doors.

1049
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,480
So yeah, this bedroom got it.

1050
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,240
But yeah, no, we I do remember,

1051
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,320
especially in the computer room, they were like, keep.

1052
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,120
Yeah, we had a I had a.

1053
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,600
Oh, fuck. What was it called? I had a program on my computer. It was called

1054
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,680
Safe Eyes, and it blocked out pornography, PG rated R movies,

1055
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,080
everything that was bad for children. And there was no way around this. It

1056
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,740
was the most strong firewall known to man, and I could only watch porn on my

1057
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,480
mom's iPod Touch.

1058
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,920
For years, I would ask my mom if I could listen to some music, bring the

1059
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,960
iPod Touch into my bedroom and shoot jizz on it.

1060
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,840
And then I would hand it right back to her and I say, enjoy your run.

1061
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,240
Enjoy your run.

1062
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,320
Yeah. Spill some ropes.

1063
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,840
I would blast just pitiful child ropes just directly. She wouldn't even notice.

1064
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,760
Was it down? Did somebody spill Sprite on my phone?

1065
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,600
Oh, the iPod touch had internet.

1066
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,040
It had wifi. So you could go on the, was there a browser on the iPod touch?

1067
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,240
Yeah. Oh, cause it's just an iPhone without the phone. Right.

1068
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:00,240
Because actually, no, I do remember Jamel, my co-host, one of my best friends, he

1069
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,080
used to have an iPod Touch with Wi-Fi instead of a phone.

1070
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,320
So you could only contact him if he was like at a McDonald's.

1071
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,640
Adam told me that the other day.

1072
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,800
He didn't have a phone for like 10 years.

1073
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1074
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,760
What the fuck? That's crazy.

1075
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,960
Walking around. He was like, he would just take the bus everywhere.

1076
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,200
You couldn't get in touch with him.

1077
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,640
And then he once he was in inside of a McDonald's, then it was communication

1078
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:29,640
time. But yeah, so back to your Jack off journey, you would get on your mom's iPod Touch and

1079
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,600
then just like watch porno.

1080
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,640
Just watch everything man, everything under the sun.

1081
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,640
I do remember, I feel like, well I'm like 5 years older than you guys right?

1082
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
I think so, something like that.

1083
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,640
5 or 6? AOL at all?

1084
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,780
Yeah, I was at the tail end of it, or I got on the computer pretty young. I think I was

1085
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,500
I was using like AOL instant messenger when I was like six.

1086
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:57,420
We there was I had parental controls, but I remember that I could see AOL

1087
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,620
keyword swimsuit.

1088
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:03,500
And so I could see, you know, Heidi Klum.

1089
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,660
Oh my God.

1090
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Whoa.

1091
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,660
Pull this up.

1092
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,180
Pull this up right now.

1093
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,460
Heidi Klum. What's the other big breasted lady with a large bust?

1094
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,740
What is her name?

1095
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,700
Who jumped around in a bikini?

1096
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,700
Kate Upton.

1097
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Kate Upton.

1098
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,440
Upton this think I've talked about I ever seen in my life when I was a kid. I

1099
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,860
think I talked about it before, but there was a boy in my

1100
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:33,220
jubilee. Can you Google Kate Upton hot, please? There was a there's a boy in my

1101
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,300
class named Ed

1102
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:40,460
porno. You're getting pranked man. I like that. It's called gay male tube

1103
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,620
tube.

1104
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,860
Tube is

1105
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,140
tube is a pretty gay word for penis. I think a gay males to

1106
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:54,500
oh, okay. So you're saying it's a penis only. It's it's also it's a it's kind of

1107
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,980
a genius name for a gay porn website because tube is a double entendre. I

1108
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:04,020
would say if a vagina is much closer to a tube than a penis. Yeah. A tube has an

1109
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,140
inside. A penis has no inside. Yeah. Well, it has a very small one. I'm glad

1110
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:13,020
I'm making you think. That's what I try to do. Oh, but the speak I was talking

1111
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:17,260
I was in this like study lab class that I got a credit for because I had adult

1112
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,420
a d or child, HD, ADHD, because I was a child, HD, I had child. That's your

1113
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,460
website. You like going on.

1114
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,200
I had

1115
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,380
hold on.

1116
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:33,760
There's this boy in my class named Ed Upton and my buddy one day was like Hey

1117
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,420
Ed, look, it's a picture of your sister and pulled up like a picture of Kate

1118
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,300
Upton in a magazine and he's like she's not my sister,

1119
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,680
thought I wish she was my

1120
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,940
I remember

1121
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,340
yeah,

1122
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:53,580
little boys are awesome. Why do you wish the g is your sister ed? Just kind of

1123
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,400
just made everyone make fun of him more

1124
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,780
like oh you want to have sex with your fucking sister. Okay, to be fair,

1125
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,720
no, you don't want to have sex with your sister in let I mean bit of your

1126
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,940
sister's Kate Upton. You might

1127
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:11,220
you her brother definitely wanted to have sex with her. Yeah, there's no

1128
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,340
down my mind. Well what if her brother looks exactly like her with short hair

1129
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:23,380
and I'm saying with the boobs? Then I'd have sex with him too.

1130
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:29,500
Yeah, was that the question? That's the question. David Upton is Kate Upton's

1131
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:39,340
brother. So this guy... Do you know... wait is that true? This is him. If that's her brother right there, the third one...

1132
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,660
one. He's a dead ringer gave for twenty seven years

1133
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,940
when he quit. Wait, he became a wait. Did they give him the outfit?

1134
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,940
The veteran decorated? Wait, I like that. He is wearing a Navy outfit.

1135
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,540
That's funny.

1136
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,780
Gay.

1137
00:54:53,780 --> 00:55:00,380
Jesus. Oh my God, John. Yeah, he did quit. Oh my God. Yeah, thank you.

1138
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,100
Well, that's your John fifteen rocks. What's John is John fifteen like a

1139
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,140
passage in the Bible that says don't be gay

1140
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,560
because there's a whole section of LGBTQ on this website.

1141
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:16,060
Home Philippines. Let's see. Philippines is very Christian, yes?

1142
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,660
Yeah, yeah, Catholic. Catholic, yeah, that's what it is. Bare fruit,

1143
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,760
confession. Well, this is just a bunch of

1144
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,360
news stories. Well, it looks like there's lists on this website.

1145
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,160
"Panoi Atheists Doing..."

1146
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,760
Have you ever been to the Philippines, Brandon? No, not yet.

1147
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,880
I need to go before you pass. I gotta go. I gotta go before I pass. I feel like you need to go while you're young, man.

1148
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:45,400
I know. You think you may fall in love with a bride while you're in the Philippines and come home make your parents very happy?

1149
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,740
Could.

1150
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,740
Another fun thought experiment.

1151
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:57,060
Yeah, wait, I actually am liking the sound of this. I think that you would blend in. I mean

1152
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,560
culturally, I feel like

1153
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,560
You're already there pretty much

1154
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Lakes like are you referring to like swagger? Pino? Thank you. Just you said so over there

1155
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,500
I what's that is that still going on over there? I hope it

1156
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:21,120
California the guys I play pool with we're like these guys were not rich and all of them had like a Rolex

1157
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:28,360
Crazy outfits. Yeah, they still were into belt buckles. Were you playing were you doing like Pinot exclusive?

1158
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,480
It was me and my brother and eight Filipino guys on a pool team, on a billiards team.

1159
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,440
And we played eight ball, nine ball, APA.

1160
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,240
It was Rob Schneider.

1161
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,080
Rob Schneider vibes, yeah.

1162
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,080
Joe Coy.

1163
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,640
Joe Coy, of course, the GOAT.

1164
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,640
The Hollywood.

1165
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,240
That's the OG, man.

1166
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,240
That's my daddy.

1167
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,240
That's the OG.

1168
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
That's my movie daddy.

1169
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,240
That's your father.

1170
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:56,880
There's a scene in that film where he does, for whatever, the pastor of the church is

1171
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,980
he's like come up here and do some stand up. That happens a lot of your and then

1172
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,060
he like just does stand up at the church. Is he being dirty? No, no, no, hell, no,

1173
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,420
thank fuck. It is he doing Joseph. This is a family film. He's doing Joseph and

1174
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:16,220
the movie made well over its budget. No, it was yeah. This is a this movie was

1175
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:21,540
not successful commercially or critically, but critic, but Lord knows my

1176
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,700
you know the but with your family, my mom, my mom's family loved it and that's

1177
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,720
That's what counts.

1178
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,720
That is important.

1179
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,720
That's what counts.

1180
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,720
That is important.

1181
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,720
We talked about him.

1182
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,720
You got the mommy Oscar.

1183
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,320
It can't all be, you know, a lot of the stuff I'm doing is for guys like us.

1184
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,880
You know, you gotta do something for your mom.

1185
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,880
Mommy and daddy.

1186
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,880
One for her.

1187
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,880
You gotta do something for your mom.

1188
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,600
I mean, did you bring her the red carpet premiere?

1189
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
I did, actually.

1190
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Really?

1191
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
That's adorable.

1192
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:52,880
No, this is actually, yeah, she was really excited to meet Joe Koy.

1193
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,880
And my dad got to meet Adam Carolla.

1194
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,220
- Oh, hell yeah.

1195
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,220
- That is the white guy, Joe Coy.

1196
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,880
- Yeah, well, 'cause he was,

1197
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,560
'cause my dad, you know,

1198
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,960
I remember my dad would watch "The Man Show"

1199
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,000
when I was a kid and then flip the channel real quick

1200
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,480
when I would walk in the room.

1201
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,880
The juggies are--

1202
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,720
- You don't want--

1203
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,400
- They're all trampling, he's gotta change the channel.

1204
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,400
And then I finally got the opportunity to say,

1205
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,960
Father, allow me to introduce you to Mr. Adam Carolla.

1206
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,960
My movie uncle.

1207
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,840
Wait, why was he in the movie?

1208
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,600
No, he's just hanging out.

1209
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,840
He's hanging out.

1210
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,800
I don't know Adam Carolla, but he was there that night.

1211
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,440
I think a lot about what showbiz thing

1212
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,720
I could either take my dad to

1213
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,400
or person I could introduce him to

1214
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,160
that he would care about at all.

1215
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,120
And I think it would have to be

1216
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,400
some kind of celebrity golf game.

1217
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,440
I could maybe, if I could become a massive movie star

1218
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,920
and then introduce him to John Daly,

1219
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,320
I think that would be massive.

1220
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,000
I think that might be the only guy.

1221
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,920
I think my dad would not be impressed

1222
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,200
by anybody that I could show him.

1223
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,400
- I think that my mom and dad--

1224
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,960
- You've had your dad on here, right?

1225
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,280
- No, I had my uncle on.

1226
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,120
- You had your uncle on.

1227
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,240
- Yeah, my uncle, Matthew DeVita, yeah.

1228
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,080
- My parents, I think, would get excited

1229
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,240
about any celebrity they would meet.

1230
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,080
- Really?

1231
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,080
- I mean, Colin Connor was on here.

1232
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:18,080
he told the story of like, like my mom was backstage in Boston and was like, I'm

1233
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,920
surprised that I laughed.

1234
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,320
You took that as her being impressed.

1235
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:23,880
She was,

1236
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,880
she was so just excited to meet somebody that has been on TV that she was like

1237
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,280
shaking his hand and stuff.

1238
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,680
At midnight.

1239
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,800
They're bringing it back.

1240
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,280
They're bringing it back. I'm trying to get,

1241
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,920
I'm trying to get those points again, man.

1242
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,000
You should email, do my points carry over?

1243
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,000
When you guys were in diapers. I've been doing this a long time, man.

1244
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,520
Did you win at midnight?

1245
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,620
No.

1246
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,120
Oh.

1247
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:48,620
No.

1248
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,720
Who'd you lose to, man?

1249
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,820
I think Esther did.

1250
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,820
Really?

1251
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,620
I think Esther won.

1252
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,420
Damn.

1253
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,220
Or, I don't know. It might have been Ryan. I don't know who won that night.

1254
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,420
We need to have...

1255
00:59:59,420 --> 00:59:59,920
I just know I lost.

1256
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,720
Nobody won.

1257
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,220
Nobody won.

1258
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,920
Nobody won. That's why you're coming. That's why they're bringing it back so you can go there.

1259
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,420
Yep.

1260
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,620
This is the sudden death episode.

1261
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,220
You could do the at midnight tournament of champions.

1262
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,420
And you could be...

1263
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,820
Give me back in there.

1264
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,780
Yeah, they're bringing it back.

1265
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,780
CBS.

1266
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,780
That's amazing.

1267
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,780
It's on CBS?

1268
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,780
It's on CBS now.

1269
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,780
The new cordon spot is at midnight.

1270
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,780
After midnight?

1271
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,780
Is it Hardwick?

1272
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,780
After midnight.

1273
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Oh yeah, it's not Hardwick.

1274
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,780
It's Taylor Tomlinson.

1275
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:27,780
Who the fuck is that?

1276
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,780
Huge.

1277
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,780
Yeah, she's a big star.

1278
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,780
Somebody really big.

1279
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,780
I don't know who this is.

1280
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,900
Yeah, well, no, she's massive.

1281
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,900
Huge theater act.

1282
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,740
Both of us, same season of Adam and Divine's House Party.

1283
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,300
She's since become a theater act.

1284
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:45,980
I have plateaued. Plateau. I've plateaued, but I've it's a healthy plateau. How are the

yeah, awesome. Yeah,

1293
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:21,540
if you tell

1294
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:26,300
you promote yourself, you're like going to be doing a show in Austin.

1295
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,260
Everybody, it's just

1296
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:32,060
I'm moving to Austin and I'm making myself work for

1297
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,580
Garden at the bottom, I like that.

1298
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:41,580
Yeah, what was I saying about... Oh, road days.

1299
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,580
Road's going good.

1300
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:50,580
You know, certain cities, it's, you know, feeling good about an Austin, Seattle, D.C., you know?

1301
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,580
But I did do a show in Cleveland recently where I was like, "Nah."

1302
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,580
Oh, I heard about this.

1303
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,580
Not a draw in Cleveland.

1304
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,580
Not a draw in Cleveland.

1305
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,580
Not a draw in Cleveland.

1306
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,580
Yeah, there's...

1307
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:03,580
You should have done your whole set about Skyline Chili and all that stuff.

1308
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:07,900
You know, this is the most normal set in Ohio. I could have said that. You could

1309
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,220
have said that. I could have said most normal set in Ohio. Would have done really

1310
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:16,420
well. Yeah, that is the big lesson of doing stand up around the country is

1311
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,100
that there's only about six cities that are worth going to. Yeah, you learn

1312
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:21,860
quickly

1313
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:28,660
how much demand there actually is. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was like when me and

1314
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:33,960
Adam did Pittsburgh at the beginning of the year. We, it's like the biggest

1315
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,260
comedy club I've ever seen. It was like 650, 700 seater. Yeah. And it was like,

1316
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,180
used to be a Dave and Buster's. Yeah. And then, and we sold, you know, through

1317
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:47,480
five, through, it was awesome, through five shows, sold maybe 250 tickets.

1318
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,980
Right. And then... You could have just done Bottle Rocket Social Hall, that's

1319
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,960
a hundred cap and... Could have easily done that. That's right. Could have

1320
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,500
easily done that. I opened for Grace and April there, that place is awesome.

1321
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,240
And then we were leaving and we were like, "Who you guys got coming up?"

1322
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,420
And they were like, "Matt Reif's coming up. He's doing 10 shows.

1323
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,740
All of them are already sold out." Yes. This guy sold like 7,000 tickets.

1324
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,400
No, dude. It's very... Well, it's... And then I realized it's not the

1325
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,880
stand up to man, it's us. We suck. Yeah. That's the thing is it's like

1326
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,920
he's from a different world, right? But he's from a world that is bigger

1327
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,280
than ours. That is true. It's a world that is like... There's no

1328
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,720
Irony, it's just people that are...

1329
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,560
Fucking love irony.

1330
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,400
It's people that...

1331
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,240
You love it, you love it.

1332
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,060
Don't even get me started.

1333
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:29,900
You guys love that stuff.

1334
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,740
Oh, I love that crap so much.

1335
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,560
You guys love that stuff,

1336
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,400
you're addicted to that stuff.

1337
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,400
I love that shit.

1338
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,200
I don't mean to get you guys started.

1339
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,040
But that's a...

1340
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,480
You go over there, it's people that...

1341
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,400
It's people that unironically are like,

1342
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,680
"I hate fake friends."

1343
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,520
Yeah.

1344
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,080
Like, "I hate haters."

1345
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,920
Yeah.

1346
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,600
People are still using Facebook.

1347
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,240
They're happier people than anyone we know.

1348
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,720
They're happier and there's way more of them.

1349
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,360
And he is like, he's so like when I was doing this, I was doing a, like a one nighter in

1350
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,280
Cleveland. I'm like in this small room, I'm like, God damn it. Like this in the big room

1351
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:09,320
next door, man, right. I swear to God that next, it was like five days later, Matt Rife's

1352
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:14,680
doing a weekend sold out months in advance in the main room, like so many shows, probably

1353
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:20,240
every comic on the road has had this experience. But it's like, it's for me, it's, it's a funny

1354
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,400
thing because we had our whole we had we had a public. We had a first beef with

1355
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,960
that. We had a public beef and when I was got involved twenty three years old, I

1356
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,520
I just I posted a couple of pictures of the guy was like how look at how's this

1357
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,720
guy? Look at this guy. Look how just like you know DSL selfies or whatever,

1358
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,640
and then he was like come fight me at the park. You show me them right now.

1359
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,840
Just look up Matt Reif selfie. Matt Reif stuns and you know he wanted to fight

1360
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,840
Yes, but then what's weird is years later.

1361
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Hell yeah.

1362
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
Yeah, there it is.

1363
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
There it is, baby.

1364
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,840
This guy wanted to kick your ass, man.

1365
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,840
Did he look like this when you started the fight?

1366
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
Yeah, he did.

1367
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
Bro, what the hell were you thinking?

1368
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
What were you even thinking?

1369
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,840
I was cyber bullying the guy.

1370
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,840
I was trolling.

1371
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
Holy cow.

1372
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,840
And Twitter figures turned to,

1373
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,160
regrettably trigger fingers and he told you to pull up and park at the time. I

1374
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,480
remember people being like damn, do you want the internet? You know, fast

1375
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,680
forward years later,

1376
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,960
one of the rich, one of the richest comedians alive, one of the richest

1377
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:39,400
comedians in this industry and I have maintained a certain level of like, you

1378
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:39,640
know,

1379
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,680
but that's the thing. All credibility. You've got diehards bro, but now, but

1380
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:50,240
Now when I go to alt shows and there's like younger people there, they're like, "Oh, this

1381
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:55,840
guy is like an elder statesman of being weird in front of a hundred people."

1382
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:00,040
Yeah, it's funny.

1383
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:08,560
So years later, now that he's one of the most famous people alive, there's people who...

1384
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,840
There was some like Nicki Swift video or something.

1385
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,200
of these like YouTube accounts that's like the shady side of man.

1386
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:15,760
Oh, yes.

1387
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:15,840
Yes.

1388
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,800
Oh, I watch these all day.

1389
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:25,680
They posted some video where it's they say that I posted old tweets of his to

1390
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,160
like hold him accountable where they were like, they're like in 2016 Brandon

1391
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,440
Wardell got on Twitter to hold Matt Reif accountable.

1392
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,120
And I was like, that's not that that was never.

1393
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:40,880
There's a lot of things from like when I was like young and like new in comedy,

1394
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,600
whatever, where I regret it. But at no point was I ever like, "Guys, look."

1395
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,800
Yeah. "You guys, we need to do something about this."

1396
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,400
"We need to do..."

1397
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,880
"Let's unpack this."

1398
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,720
No, I was literally just like, "Ha ha, this guy... Look at these fucking gay

1399
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
selfies. Ha ha ha."

1400
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,200
If anything, you made the tweet that gets brought up later.

1401
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,960
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was cyber-bullied.

1402
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,280
Yeah.

1403
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,920
And then years... So that day, other people started pulling up old tweets

1404
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,400
where he's saying the N-word at 13 or whatever.

1405
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,220
Yeah, but through whatever gave it to him, he's not gonna not say it.

1406
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:18,000
I mean, he's a black man. He's one of the best black comics. Yeah,

1407
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,500
he's but he's, it's very, it's like, it's funny. Like, so years later,

1408
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,660
there's these videos, there's this one video and I think I saw like some

1409
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,520
click bait, like listicle article, whatever, that said that I was pulling

1410
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,560
up old tweets of his. And so now I had, I had like a couple of

1411
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,140
they're only using photos of you with glasses. Yeah, they're only using

1412
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,520
like looking photos that I'm not proud of. Yeah, so it's like it's all these

1413
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:44,940
people

1414
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:49,080
and I say all these people. There's like five. I got like five dms about it,

1415
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:54,840
but I got like five dms in my in my message requests that are like dude. I

1416
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,040
can't believe you tried to cancel matt right. I was like I never that's not I

1417
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,680
didn't do that. Oh, they're saying that millennials are trying to cancel matt

1418
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,760
right. One of them was

1419
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,940
I one of them was like a like a landscaping service.

1420
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,940
I could actually find it. I actually

1421
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,360
I

1422
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:20,140
need to fucking see because this is this is like he said this from his

1423
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:20,820
landscape.

1424
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:26,480
He from he said this like from his business. You fucking gay guy, you

1425
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:31,720
will cancel, Mara. Yeah, so this is from Green Shield tree on its a check him

1426
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:37,940
Green, she underscore tree and he sent me this message. He sent me this message

1427
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:44,660
at four. Nineteen AM. So he's like he's drunk as shit. He just watched like he

1428
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,740
just watched like some video about that right. I guess

1429
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:54,140
I'm the victim of misinformation and so now this guy, this tree, this tree

1430
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,220
account, green, chill tree,

1431
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,280
the emc in the middle of the fucking night,

1432
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,780
just

1433
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:06,320
imagine that he was like really early on a he's watching it on his riding. Oh

1434
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:10,840
yeah, I feel like he maybe yeah that's the maybe he wasn't. Maybe he wasn't

1435
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,720
drunk and late. This is a clarity. He was waking up super early to the cut

1436
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,640
trees yeah

1437
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,800
for nineteen AM. He goes you're a fucking pussy

1438
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,520
wait. Is that one message or is that how it's that's how it starts and then

1439
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:29,000
there's like a paragraph he goes like what kind of pussy ass comedian tries to

1440
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,560
get others cancelled. I never did that you know I never you know he goes and

1441
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,080
then you make jokes about drunk driving. Maybe karma will make some drunk drivers

1442
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,240
drive near you and your family. One that you scum bag piece of shit. Whoa

1443
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:47,740
suicide is legal in Oregon, just saying J, which I do like that. He's like go to

1444
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,760
look. You should kill yourself, but do it in order

1445
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,480
Go to Portland you fucking hipster!

1446
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,480
Go to Portland you fucking hipster gay guy!

1447
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,480
Yeah, it's like on his business account.

1448
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,480
That is badass.

1449
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,480
That is so beast.

1450
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,480
Well, speaking of Matt Rife, I'm going to have a mad wife if I'm late to my dinner.

1451
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,480
So, do you have any dates you'd like to plan?

1452
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,480
Yeah, check out Matt Rife on Netflix.

1453
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,480
I guess I'll just do crowd work, right?

1454
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,480
No, look, I wish him well.

1455
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,480
God damn, he looks so good.

1456
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,620
He did break bread. We broke bread once.

1457
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,620
Yeah, I like that.

1458
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:28,500
We did break bread once because he saw me at the Laugh Factory and I said, "Look, we can

1459
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,500
talk about it."

1460
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,860
Comic to comic, there's nothing like those conversations, bro.

1461
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,860
That's the thing about it.

1462
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,860
Y'all did WTF with the cameras off. I like that.

1463
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,860
I like that shit.

1464
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,860
There it is.

1465
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,860
It's like that Dane Cook episode of Louie.

1466
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:44,860
I don't know when that was. It was so Dane Cook episode of Louie.

1467
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,860
It was actually so Dane Cook episode of Louie.

1468
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:50,920
so the thing is man. We can't have our legends fighting like that. I can't have

1469
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,760
no, no, no, no, I can't well, I guess, oh, I guess I don't know when this comes

1470
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,680
out, but just listen to the brand and Jamel show tap in this comes out the

1471
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:03,520
brand of the beginning of January. I think well in that case, Nashville,

1472
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,320
Atlanta, Athens, you have a website that you could maybe plug to see all these

1473
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:11,160
things. I've got a fucking link tree check them out. I don't I haven't

1474
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,080
updated the look

1475
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,480
click the link San Francisco. You'll have it on. I'm going to be in San

1476
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,240
Francisco, San Francisco. Here it is. Yeah, there it is. Look at that. Oh,

1477
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,620
look at all the amazing dates. You guys come to his show.

1478
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:31,420
Last minute intimate one. Oh, the Earl. I love that place. And then it oh

1479
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,980
yeah, yeah, that's a great venue. That's where we did. Well, yeah, thank you.

1480
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,620
Thank you guys for coming, Brandon. Bye, my friends. Bye. Goodbye, bye.

1481
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,700
(static)

1482
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,980
- Remember the reason for the season?

1483
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,900
Hmm.

1484
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,140
- Christ presents.

1485
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,460
- No, no, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

1486
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,740
- Christ's present.

1487
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,060
- It's about Christ's birthday.

1488
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,460
It is not about commercialism.

1489
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,220
That's the complete opposite actually.

1490
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,620
It is not about, unless you're buying black coffee company.

1491
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,740
- Anti-capitalist commercialism.

1492
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,180
- No, none of that.

1493
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:06,060
And then Mrs. Claus is white.

1494
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:11,940
I'm sick and tired of all these different races of Mrs. Claus.

1495
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,040
It's just not true.

1496
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,740
I mean, listen, I'm fine with people being from all sorts of

1497
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,640
worst countries than the one that we're in, right, but I'm not

1498
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,240
fine with rewriting history.

1499
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,340
I am a Christmas fan.

1500
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,440
I'm a supporter of Santa Claus, but also commercialism.

1501
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,840
I like the presents and the stockings and I don't care who

1502
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,280
as long as they are fun.

1503
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,400
I just like Christmas.

1504
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,400
I just like Christmas.

1505
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,320
I couldn't see that TV is too far away.

1506
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,340
And I am a I'm a woke iconoclast.

1507
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,920
So I want to destroy the icons of Christmas.

1508
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,400
I believe Jesus Christ belongs in jail.

1509
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,920
Whoa, not in Christmas.

1510
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,920
You shut your fucking mouth.

1511
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,560
He's only a baby.

1512
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:05,720
He literally manipulated a group of 12 people to do his bidding.

1513
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,720
He was a cult leader.

1514
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,720
To hang out with him?

1515
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,400
What, are you manipulating me and Patrick to hang out with him?

1516
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
I think that on Christmas Eve...

1517
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,400
I'm Cameron?

1518
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,400
Why am I saying your Cameron all so many times today?

1519
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,400
Sorry, continue.

1520
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:20,440
I believe on Christmas Eve we should be leaving out gluten-free cookies and oat milk.

1521
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,720
Shut your trap, you bastard.

1522
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:27,640
And if my kid asks for Harry Potter books for Christmas, I'm hitting them.

1523
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,800
Did you just say them?

1524
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,800
I said them.

1525
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,320
I'm gonna shoot you to death with my fucking gun and then punch the hole.

1526
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,440
I think we have one more position to look at too.

1527
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,440
I don't know if there's...

1528
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,440
We have one more member of the debate.

1529
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,440
If someone wants to read this.

1530
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:47,120
It says, "Jubio, he's a white Mexican," which I've been dreaming of.

1531
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,040
It says, "Amo la Navidad.

1532
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,440
Amo a mi papa.

1533
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,680
Amo a mi mama.

1534
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,880
Amo a Papa Noel."

1535
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,460
(monkey screeching)
