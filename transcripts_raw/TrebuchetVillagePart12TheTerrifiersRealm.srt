00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
[Music]

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,240
Last time on Trebuchet Village,

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,160
the boys realized that Gigi the Shaman stole the Prince Jumanji and took him for sure somewhere fucked up.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,840
So they asked/interrogated their frenemies tit and for tat about where Gigi the shaman

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
went and through questioning, they found out he likely went to St. Anthony's Parish, a

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,400
smaller sect within the Terrifire Church in the city of Gal Gadot.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,720
They traveled there, where they harassed a snake man who led the church, and met someone

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:53,560
named Gil, a friendly "orc" who told them where Gigi likely was, the baby kaiju manji

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,040
temple a little ways out of town. After traveling in that direction and getting an ID of the

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,680
temple and getting um, what the f- an ID? I must have been-

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Idea.

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
An ID- I don't think I even-

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,160
Identification is what that stands for.

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,280
Yeah, getting a look at the temple, a visual of the temple nestled into the mountains.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
It's so frazzled.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
Yeah, I'm very annoyed by that. I don't know what I was doing.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,800
you used his divination magic to see what was going on.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Why'd you say that to him?

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No, the character.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
You guys, he was-

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Take it back.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
We're playing it a little fast and loose with this intro.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Let the man finish.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
I'm enjoying it.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
He used his divination magic to see what was going on inside of it.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
And it was some fucked up, clearly evil ritual type of shit.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,120
Our crew waltzed in quietly, but not quietly enough, because some type of screaming, flaming

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,720
skull had charged into the main hall of the temple.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Dogen, possessed by insane prowess, blasted this thing to shit with one swipe of his battle

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,860
shovel, launching it back from where it came, with nobody even really knowing that that happened.

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,460
With that dealt with too quickly, they continued to rush forward down the hall, only just in

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,040
time to watch the ritual take place.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,820
Many awful naked men biting and killing each other, sucking magic from a woman trapped

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,180
in a magical cage, and the poor Nard boy Prince Jumanji teleported with the

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,980
Terrifier's magic to Trebuchet village. Giggy, with his final breath, told the gang

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,920
the plan. That the boy will be the Terrifier reborn after the heartbroken

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,140
King Nardwar, tricked by the members of Giggy's crew at the St. Anthony's parish,

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,180
perform a ritual that brings a Terrifier back from wherever he fucked off to. He

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,580
then said to Evil Stevel you were not supposed to be there,

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,940
Echoing the cackler fiend that was in Mount Honest Doodle all those sessions ago

41
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,020
The woman trapped in the cave turned out to be the sister of the white woman of the woods the white woman of the caves

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,300
Misnomer of sorts since they were in a temple who told the boys that she could make them go

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:06,140
Really really really really stupid really really really fast. I don't think it's stupid. I think it's a cool story

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,740
Can you just be transported into a new world for once in your life

45
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,740
*laughter*

46
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
I'm in the world.

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,740
Oh look at that, a butterfly.

48
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,740
I can see my ceramics so clearly.

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
Tree?

50
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Well no, it's a cave.

51
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,740
Cave tree.

52
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,740
I do remember there's cave trees.

53
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,740
So our heroes and Sullivan

54
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
arrived back at Sticky Fingers Joint

55
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,740
where it seems an uneasy alliance

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,740
between Sticky Fingers gang, Pleasure Men, and the Brave Lions.

57
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,740
Plus, Trunchbull has begun.

58
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,740
Their plan is to kill the king.

59
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,740
And so you guys have arrived, and Sticky Fingers has just told you,

60
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,740
"You've arrived just in time. We're here to kill the king."

61
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,740
Um, so, you guys know now that what's going on here.

62
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,740
You don't know if they know. They just know that, in the words of Sticky Finger.

63
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,540
The king's been getting too crazy, okay? He's starting to kill people, he's getting really

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,660
fucked up. Even the pleasure men decided to join up with us and these brave lion guys.

65
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,500
So uh, we got a plan ready and in the works if you guys want in. Since you proceeded to,

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,500
I guess, destroy my wall, uh, Kool-Aid Man style. Um, who is a dwarf. Also.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,020
Oh yeah, I know him.

68
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,740
Yeah, I bet you do.

69
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
He's red.

70
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,700
Yeah. He's red, he's completely red.

71
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,220
He drinks a lot of Kool-Aid and he loves Kool-Aid the famous drink.

72
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,660
Yeah, that's why.

73
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,900
Okay, well, I gotta watch what I say.

74
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,660
Uh, so uh, yeah, you guys want in or what?

75
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,880
Hmm.

76
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,380
Yeah.

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,880
What?

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,020
No, I don't care. Let's just kill the king. I don't give a shit anymore.

79
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,140
You really wanna kill...

80
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,580
I mean, I've gone through enough bullcrap.

81
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,780
Why are you guys killing the king?

82
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,100
Because things have gotten crazy here.

83
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,940
You guys haven't been bad to your own flank.

84
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,440
That's a pretty good reason.

85
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:00,940
That's a great reason.

86
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
That is a good reason. I'm sorry.

87
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,820
Oh, I'll explain.

88
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,660
All right, I'm with Patrick now.

89
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,660
First of all, I thought you guys were dead after that mountain-

90
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,160
We are.

91
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,660
-honest-

92
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
I'm dead tired.

93
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
I'll tell you that.

94
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,160
Wait, are you dead or dead tired?

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Yeah, I just flew in.

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,660
Boy, are my arms dead tired.

97
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
You did not fly in.

98
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
I saw you run in.

99
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
I just ran in.

100
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Boy, are my legs tired.

101
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,160
Okay, I believe that.

102
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,660
So, ever since the prince died or whatever, and you guys, I guess-

103
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,160
No, he's not dead. He's just-

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
What?

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,660
There's some bullcrap that happened.

106
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
They're trying to turn him into-

107
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,660
God, we should have ridden the hell-

108
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,220
Yeah, so they're making happen. All right. I'm gonna tell you this scary the terrifying there's actually all right

109
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,300
So the terrifier is trying to come back into a boy

110
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,640
Yeah, the terrifier is a pedophile. I can I can I could try to all right Sullivan

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,120
So you talk about if you mess this up? Oh my god. I didn't see that Wow you just have like no presence

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,540
That's amazing. He kind of blends in. Yeah, he walked all the way here. We were transported

113
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,700
He just got you. I keep thinking he's a rock. Look at Sullivan's legs, it's like realistic

114
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:13,200
Spongebob calves, just like super jacked. Yeah, well, so from what I understood is

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,300
that there's a group of guys who are trying to bring the terrifier back by

116
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,820
having him enter a boy in a word or three words and yeah so we knew the boy

117
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
He was with us. We were trying to bring him back here.

118
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Yeah, it was his boyfriend.

119
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
No, it was not my boyfriend. Please don't say that.

120
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,820
I'm already the, what am I, the sucking dick guy?

121
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,820
Sucking penis guy.

122
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Yeah, the sucking penis guy.

123
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,820
Alright, well, so, anyway, that's what we think is our movie.

124
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,820
Look at me, Sullivan. Look, I'm you.

125
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Yeah, they're you. They're being you.

126
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
That's what you do.

127
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
You like to choke on it.

128
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,620
Well, regardless of what he likes to do with penis, this is interesting news.

129
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,420
He was also making that up. That's not true.

130
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,820
[Laughter]

131
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
He's a liar, too.

132
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:14,420
You see also the-- a handsome blonde fellow turned to you guys,

133
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,820
wearing the Brave Lyons armor on, and he's--

134
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,220
Patrick's trying to break my chair while we record.

135
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,220
I always sit in this chair and it makes that sound.

136
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,500
I'll tell you what, not as loud as it's in tactics, but it does make the sound.

137
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,500
So, and he says to you guys, "Ah, chum to meet you.

138
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,940
My name is McElwee Highlander.

139
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,340
I'm the lieutenant of this area of the Brave Lions.

140
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm glad we have three brave advantage--" and it looks like a frog as well.

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
This is exciting.

142
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,260
"You guys are going to join up with us."

143
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
He's taking a picture.

144
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
He's like, "Sorry, he's a bit eager."

145
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,020
I want to put that guy's face in the toilet.

146
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,040
Yeah, no, I don't want to use his body like a boppet. No, this is all these are all sentiments

147
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm gonna paint some real quick. Well, don't do that because we do know and I won't do that

148
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,160
We just do we do need him for this fight

149
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,520
So look look regardless of whether or not the boys alive or whatever the terror fire is coming back

150
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,100
The Kings been mistreating everybody, you know, if you're a petty thief, you're supposed to be doing grand larceny

151
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,760
He wants everybody to both do more crime and then you get punished harder for it

152
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
He just wants everything to be completely debauched and insane like before

153
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,560
Well before they freed the slaves before they freed people like myself and evil Steve. Oh

154
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,000
Basically, he's trying to bring it back to the way it was word to my slaves. Yeah

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,920
What well we've all been waiting for that

156
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:45,840
You held your finger up so long before you said that I did let make sure I got it in

157
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,320
So, um

158
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,680
Basically, he seems to have gone mad because his son is dead. I guess if we can tell him that his son is alive

159
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,880
That would be really good. So where's his son?

160
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
He's dead

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,280
But not really all that dead

162
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,080
so, uh, and you see also listening in is a

163
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,520
one of the pleasure men

164
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:16,640
Who says my name is Barnabas pleasure. I don't want you going near the child. You're not the first to tell me that

165
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,400
Just based off my face and sort of general demeanor

166
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm the high priest of this region for pleasure, man

167
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,800
I believe I can explain what's going on here based on what you've said seems

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,320
they've sent the boy into the terrifier realm a place where you are trapped in fear and

169
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,600
That would be probably where the terrifier would have access to him and be able to air

170
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,120
Use him to come back

171
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,080
So he's not dead. He's sort of a stillborn

172
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
But, uh...

173
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
So it doesn't matter if we kill the king, really,

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
because the Terrifier's going to come back.

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I mean, well, if the king is somehow part of this ritual, then...

176
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
All right.

177
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
We would have to stop the king from doing his part of the ritual.

178
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Sullivan, do you remember if he was a part of the ritual?

179
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Well, I mean, he was...

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Yeah, I mean, they said that the ritual's going to be carried out.

181
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
So I imagine the king is a part of it.

182
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,680
So we got to go to the Terrifier Realm and get the boy out of the Terrifier Realm and then kill the king?

183
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,300
Yes, but to get him out of the Terrifier Realm is quite a difficult task.

184
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
So we shouldn't do it?

185
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,460
Well, no.

186
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Can you do it?

187
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,540
I can try, but we're going to need-

188
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
I'll give you 20 gold pieces.

189
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
No, I mean, I don't want the terr-

190
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:41,120
Look, I want the Terrifier back, but on the Pleasureman's terms, not whatever the hell these St. Anthony's people are doing.

191
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,860
Okay, so where he was the plan

192
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,880
Today the the king is doing his like a serum

193
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,800
We didn't know what the context of it was, but he was trying to honor his dead son or whatever some jerk-off shit

194
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,120
Who cares?

195
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,880
but anyway

196
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,840
he was gonna climb on top of the claw and he was gonna do on the claw castle and do something with that and

197
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,900
Anyway, we had snipers trained ready to go

198
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,440
We've got some people with some real

199
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,560
Ballistas ready to sort of take him out and then we were gonna have the brave lion dildo over here

200
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,600
Bring his troops out front and sort of storm the castle

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,960
I was gonna go in the castle sneak in there just in case the king didn't die and also to you know

202
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,760
Loot do things like that

203
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,040
Meanwhile the pleasurement over here had an inkling that something was going on back where Honest Mount Honest doodle was now

204
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
This makes more sense about what was going on

205
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,580
They're probably trying to do something with bringing back the terrifier. So we're Mount home. Yeah, we just said that

206
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,360
Well, no, I'm doing well

207
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm just saying that we picked up on that they were doing something there and now it makes us down

208
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,000
We kind of feel like we know what they're doing. So we have this sort of three-pronged

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,740
Plan look I just need some some or coffee or something. I'm

210
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm beat. Well, I think I could help you with that. Who's this guy? Yeah trunchbull

211
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,920
Yodar crap, that's my uncle. Yeah, how's it going? How's it going Patrick? How you doing? Yeah. All right

212
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,420
We gotta talk too, buddy. It's time.

213
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Are you mad at me?

214
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,920
No, no, no. I can never be mad at you. Look at us.

215
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
- You look exactly the same. - We look exactly the same.

216
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,420
We're in different ages and we look the same.

217
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,920
Not even a question, except I am two feet taller than you.

218
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,420
And it's time that you become two feet taller.

219
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
[Gasp]

220
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,920
Not than me, but you know.

221
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
I'm gonna grow?

222
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
It's time. You're ready for puberty.

223
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
[Laughter]

224
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Your uncle's gonna put you through puberty?

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Congratulations!

226
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I'm gonna make you a man Patrick!

227
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

228
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Look, it's not a pleasant process.

229
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
But it needs to happen.

230
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
If you're gonna do this whole thing...

231
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Come here, come here.

232
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Go to him!

233
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Don't hesitate!

234
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
I wanna see this.

235
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Yeah, you guys can figure out sort of what you wanna do

236
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
for the whole

237
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
terror fire plan in a second.

238
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
second. Let's-

239
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
We got important business to take care of.

240
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
We got important business to do.

241
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:11,640
So Verdans in the Forgotten Realms lore have mutations and growth spurts that they go through.

242
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:18,800
In the Trebuchet Village lore, there is sort of a passing of the torch where an uncle and

243
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
his nephew have to slow dance.

244
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
That is so lovely.

245
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,760
That's so romantic.

246
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,400
And during the slow dance-

247
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,700
platonic during the slow dance. You're going to undergo the mutations that you

248
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,940
were meant to undergo at this stage in your life.

249
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,680
Mm-hmm. So is it painful? It will depend on the mutations. I have, I scoured the

250
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,180
forums and found a number of mutations that are out there. We're going to

251
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,260
roll some dice. Oh yeah, we're going to roll some dice. And you're going to go through some

252
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,160
mutations. The first one that is going to happen regardless, you know what it is.

253
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I think we've talked about it before.

254
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,960
- You don't want to save it for last?

255
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,360
I think we should save it for last.

256
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,200
- We will.

257
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,020
- I think save it for last.

258
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,860
- Well, I'm not going to say it.

259
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,700
- Yeah.

260
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,520
- And then there's a couple,

261
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,640
there's one other mutation that's going to happen,

262
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
which is that you're going to,

263
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
we know already, which is that you are going to grow.

264
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
You are going to be the first tall member of this party

265
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,560
of all short characters.

266
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,320
- So.

267
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,140
- I will grow a cardigan.

268
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,760
- Come over here, come on Patrick, come on.

269
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,320
Come on, I drew a little circle over here.

270
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,140
We're going to dance.

271
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,980
- Yeah, right, I'm getting in the dancing circle.

272
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,120
- Okay, you got to put your hands on my hips,

273
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,080
put my hands on your shoulders okay? Can I do the shoulders? Hey yeah all right fine

274
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,360
I'll put that I guess that makes more sense now that I think about the way that

275
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,180
meant means you gay. No Dave you better watch it and you guys start to you guys

276
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,160
put your hands in there. You better hope he's not gay. Look you know well you know

277
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,440
when I knew that we were able to. They would have faked it? Yeah that ruins the whole

278
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,520
puberty. You shrink. I shrink if my uncle's gay? You shrink to the size of an ant. Look I'm not gay you saw me fuck those spirits. I didn't see you

279
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,920
- Did you fuck the white woman, did you fuck the cave lady too?

280
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,760
I don't remember if I asked her.

281
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,600
- Yeah, I tried to.

282
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,280
- You fucked a cave lady?

283
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,360
- The white woman of the caves.

284
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,160
- I fingered her for a bit and then she was like,

285
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,560
"I got work in the morning."

286
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,600
- TMI, Uncle Trudge, but I don't know.

287
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,440
- Tell me more.

288
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,520
- Well, I was trying to, so I was looking for the--

289
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,360
- Can we just get through with the dance?

290
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,600
- 'Cause not every woman likes the same thing, you know?

291
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,880
So like the white woman in the woods had sort of a like,

292
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,160
"Yo, you gently rub the clit

293
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,520
"and then you gotta go in a little bit."

294
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,120
And then the cave woman had a thing where,

295
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,080
I really had to go in there and sort of go up, right?

296
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,920
- Oh, I know the up thing, yeah.

297
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
- Yeah, the up thing.

298
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,600
She liked that.

299
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,440
Some of them, it's like too much for her, like that.

300
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,320
And so I was getting kind of tired, to be honest.

301
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
And then she was like, "Oh, I got work in the morning anyway.

302
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,760
"You seem tired."

303
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,800
And I was like, "No, I'm not tired."

304
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,720
But I was.

305
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,480
- You ever hit the elbow with a bitch?

306
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
- No, no.

307
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,440
Oh, well.

308
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,280
- You know what I'm saying?

309
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,480
- Well, we can talk about the white woman

310
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,920
of the forest later.

311
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,480
Different than the woods, let me tell you.

312
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,760
- There's a different forest at work?

313
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,120
- There are so many white women.

314
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,400
White women are sort of one of the many spirits of this world.

315
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,920
Anyway, let's slow dance so you can get taller.

316
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,440
(laughing)

317
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,600
So you begin slow dancing,

318
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,760
and we're gonna do some rolls.

319
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,280
So I have my dice here.

320
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,760
Just should've had these out already.

321
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,680
- I know, right?

322
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,520
I can't believe you.

323
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
- You're the worst DM ever.

324
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,720
- I am the worst DM ever.

325
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,520
So first, you're gonna start,

326
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,880
as you start slow dancing,

327
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,040
He says, "You know, I knew the second that you were just

328
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,960
"sipping on juice while you're watching me fuck that lady,

329
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
"I knew that we were gonna, you know,

330
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,620
"we're gonna be homies, you know,

331
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,240
"uncle and nephew kind of homies."

332
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,080
And as he's saying this--

333
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,360
- I said we were before.

334
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,960
- Oh, that's my boy, and you start to grow a bit taller.

335
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,220
And so you are now two feet taller.

336
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,720
- How tall does that make him?

337
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,320
- Probably like five one or something,

338
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,280
which is probably the tallest,

339
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,120
I think 'cause you're probably five, maybe like--

340
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
- I wanna be five seven.

341
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,880
you're five seven which is a great height by the way and yeah so you're five seven

342
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,520
and he's like whoa look at you pretty tough over Dan you guys just love

343
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,460
dancing you're like a inch taller than your your uncle trunch ball or the

344
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,800
famous adventure yeah and you still have these like heavy ass son now dragging on

345
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:17,480
the ground as you're dancing and now what we're gonna need to do is okay first

346
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,880
First we're gonna roll a d20.

347
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,400
- Okay.

348
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
- What'd you get?

349
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,960
- I got a redo.

350
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,240
- He got a three.

351
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,080
- What'd you get?

352
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,900
- I got a three.

353
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,740
- That's fine.

354
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,880
Okay.

355
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,880
And now roll a d100.

356
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
- Do we have that?

357
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,880
- Yeah, you roll these two together

358
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,080
and then one of them is the tens place one.

359
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,720
- I thought the ones place.

360
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,700
- Dude, I wish.

361
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,040
- What'd you get?

362
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,080
- 21.

363
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Okay. Okay. It's kind of weird. And then roll the D100 one more time. What'd you get? 94.

364
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay, roll that again. What'd you get? 18. Okay. Why'd I have to roll again for the 94?

365
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:22,340
I only have so many on this list. So, okay. So, first thing that happens is, what color

366
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,840
was your hair?

367
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,960
Well, it was gray like an old man's.

368
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,280
Okay. It changes.

369
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
To what?

370
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,680
What color? Imagine a color in your head.

371
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Silver.

372
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:43,000
Silver? Your hair changes silver. Okay. Next, this one's weird. The proportions of your facial

373
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,160
features change really so your nose just gets really small like Michael Jackson

374
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:58,520
small your eyes get huge your mouth stays the same you still look like like

375
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,280
normal but like within reason I look like I look like Alan Alda with like a

376
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:10,160
like a like he ate like a warhead yeah yeah exactly yeah he looked like the

377
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:17,160
out all the warhead. The last one, it's my favorite so far. You gain an eye.

378
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,160
(Laughter)

379
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,160
On my face or can it be somewhere else?

380
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,160
It doesn't specify so I'm going to let you choose.

381
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Gigantic eye on my belly.

382
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Okay, cool. Well I guess we'll figure out the mechanical implications of that later.

383
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
You should put it on the back of your head.

384
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Okay, gigantic eye on the back of my head.

385
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,440
my head okay yeah so it's just like like it just opens up and there's a big eye

386
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,300
in the back your head and your silver hair is falling behind the eye and it

387
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,920
blinks and it kind of parts the the hairs behind it you know it was like

388
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:57,960
whoa that is that is a weird one why the why do you look so fucking normal oh all

389
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,040
my pubes are tentacles it is not great I see you yeah tell you what it's great

390
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,920
for the girls but for just looking at him yeah I'm in front of you dipshit yeah

391
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,560
you see me and of course I'm talking to people behind me there's no I even

392
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:22,800
fucking works last but not least hmm your balls your big heavy balls start to

393
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:30,320
rumble and scrunch crap and then you start to become more and more normal

394
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,920
sized. As they start shrinking I jump in a motorboat and one last time.

395
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,120
It's like as you're going like it's getting like your the pitch is getting higher as the

396
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,320
balls get smaller.

397
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,200
And there you go now you got those regular balls pretty nice right?

398
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,680
I miss the old ones.

399
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,080
Yeah I missed mine too. Would you ever do the thing with the skin where you? I would do

400
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,480
shadow puppets with mine.

401
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Me too yeah.

402
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,200
It was good times good times.

403
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,600
- Did you ever keep a coin in there?

404
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,480
- Oh, I kept so many coins in there.

405
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I think, honestly, when they shrunk,

406
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,280
I feel like I lost $700.

407
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,120
Not even kidding.

408
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,080
Don't know where it went.

409
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,880
- I was about to sit down on his balls

410
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,520
and they like shrank out from under me

411
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,720
and I fell on the ground.

412
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,300
- All right, we don't have to,

413
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,000
you can stop, we can stop slow dancing now.

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,120
That was fun though.

415
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,960
- All right.

416
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
- All right.

417
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,440
- Oh God, I miss my balls so much.

418
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,880
- Where does balls go, demon?

419
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
- Well, the balls, they go to all the other mutations.

420
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,200
sort of how it works. You tell me that eye on the back of his head is one of those balls. Yeah it's a ball.

421
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,120
I can smell it. It's sort of a ball. And your face, don't worry about that too much.

422
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:48,880
You look like you ate a warhead though. Yeah, it's fine. All right, yeah. Cool, all right.

423
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Where do I start getting acne? So now that you've done all that, so you have this eye on the back

424
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,880
your head. So, I mean, I'm going to say that like, God, any like perception checks that

425
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,780
require visuals, I guess like any dexterity saving throws that involve like visual cues

426
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,680
you have advantage on, like period. Like there's just no reason why having a third eye in like

427
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
a literal blind spot.

428
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
What's my other, my regular eyes are so big now.

429
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Yeah, right. You're just-

430
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
You get a lot of vision here.

431
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Yeah.

432
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah.

433
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,720
Patrick, Patrick Yoda was more ear focused. You're a lot more visual focused. Yeah. I like that one.

434
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,600
Yeah. There are some funny ones on here. If we keep doing these characters, I want to like,

435
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,320
every time we do this, I have more mutations to you. But yeah, cool. So, you see Sticky Fingers

436
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:46,600
like, "Okay, so, uh..." "Hey, I see you." "That was great." "I see you." "No, I..." "My eyes are big

437
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,200
now? Yeah, get used to it to be honest. Wait, hold on, I'm gonna turn around.

438
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm never gonna get used to that. I'm gonna be honest. I still see you. Yeah, no, I'm aware now. What is

439
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,520
that like? Is it sort of a... what is that experience? Well, the back... I mean, it

440
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:11,080
sucks. I mean, there's one big eye in the back and then, I mean, two. They're also

441
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,920
So pretty big.

442
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,160
- I'm also gonna say that you're gonna get expertise in--

443
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,000
- Seeing.

444
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,820
- In perception.

445
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,660
(laughing)

446
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,720
And seeing in general.

447
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,720
So expertise is just you add your proficiency bonus again.

448
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,520
If I'm correct about that.

449
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,400
I haven't played a bard in a long time.

450
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
So let me just double check.

451
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,040
Yeah, you just double your proficiency bonus on it.

452
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,880
- Okay.

453
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,000
- So just when we roll,

454
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,560
you'll just add your proficiency bonus again.

455
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,120
So I think your proficiency bonus is still,

456
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,440
I think it's plus three now.

457
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Perception?

458
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,160
Yeah, so whenever you do a perception check, you'll just add an additional +3.

459
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,520
And he has advantage?

460
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
On dexterity saves, yeah.

461
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Oh my god.

462
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, no, it's cool to mutate.

463
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,840
Why can't I get mutations?

464
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
You didn't go through puberty.

465
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,600
You didn't go through and kill everything in the game.

466
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
No, I don't.

467
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
You killed the Screaming Flavor.

468
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
You don't remember that.

469
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
The Screaming Flavor.

470
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
The Screaming Flavor.

471
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,960
I think we called it that at the time.

472
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
I don't have my notes here.

473
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm pretty sure we called it the speed screaming flamer.

474
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,960
No, because every time I do a session I delete my notes after.

475
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,560
So I can't confirm or deny what we called it.

476
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,160
And what Cam did to the screaming...

477
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,560
He heard a screaming flamer for...

478
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,360
Cam heard a screaming flamer and he immediately got...

479
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,760
Yeah, he took out his shovel.

480
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
He took out his shovel.

481
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,960
He's fucked up, brother.

482
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,160
You made Ruth the screaming flamer.

483
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,360
So far, you two are the most problematic of this episode.

484
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
It was a flaming screamer, okay?

485
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,860
Yeah.

486
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,360
[Chuckles]

487
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Mmm.

488
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
That's a pretty good trick.

489
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,360
So anyway, uh, he goes up to you, uh, Sticky Fringe and says,

490
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,360
"So, I was thinking, based on the sort of the expertise we got going here,

491
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,360
you, Dogen, you could join that asshole out in the field of battle.

492
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,360
You, Patric, you're coming with me. We're gonna sneak into the castle.

493
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Mm-hmm.

494
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
You, you go with the Pleasuremen.

495
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
I want to be with my friends.

496
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,360
You could, I guess you could join up with one of them if you want to instead.

497
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,160
Fuck you Pleasuremen. I'm going with Dogen.

498
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,960
Okay, cool. You'll join Dogen in the field of battle.

499
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,760
The Pleasuremen will just sort of go on their own in that direction.

500
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,160
You're gonna sneak into the castle?

501
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,160
With me? Or do you wanna go in the battle too?

502
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,060
I'm gonna sit in the back and I'm gonna look through a big telescope.

503
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,460
Okay, so you're going backwards?

504
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,960
Yep.

505
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,760
Oh my god. Damn. That's cool.

506
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,560
We can just send... We'll send the wizard.

507
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,860
He'll teleport here and he'll go with you.

508
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,160
What wizard?

509
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,060
The wizard.

510
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,060
That guy knows about it, I point straight.

511
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if he knows where you guys are.

512
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
He can scry us.

513
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
I guess he could, he might have done that already.

514
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
But, I don't know.

515
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,060
He should do that.

516
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
He should do that already.

517
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
He did that and he's on his way.

518
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,060
And then Sullivan will go in the other, whatever other place.

519
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Sullivan, you're going to be the front line of the battle.

520
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,060
No, no, no, no.

521
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
You can sneak into the mountain.

522
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Sullivan, you're going to go with the pleasure men and they're going to touch you.

523
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
Yeah, Sullivan, the pleasure men are going to treat you so right.

524
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,460
so right no go ahead

525
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,060
going to come little frog yes Sullivan you're an agent of pleasure

526
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,860
yes I've heard tell of the sucking penis man make sure they're there they're

527
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,700
ready that's a that's a not my name that was just a one-time thing as a one-time

528
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,460
name not like that was never I think it was a thing he did no I've never done

529
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,380
anything like this is what he does

530
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,820
in your religion. Oh yes we like all kinds of pleasure and all the different forms

531
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:43,980
that comes. Here's a piece of candy. That's ooh butterscotch. Oh my god. I knew you'd like that.

532
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,100
Yes I did. So yeah I mean you guys want to like start doing this so the order

533
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,940
yeah because the order of it will be that the people going out to battle are

534
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,580
gonna sort of kind of conceal themselves and get ready because the king is gonna

535
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
to go do whatever ceremony he's going to do.

536
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,280
You guys, the people sneaking into the castle, you can either

537
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,580
go in through the front before like the king is assassinated

538
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,280
or attempt to attempt to assassination.

539
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,580
Are we going to the Terrifiers realm at all?

540
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,480
Right now, it's well, I guess you could keep talking to the

541
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,080
pleasurement about it, but it sounds like he doesn't have

542
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,580
what he needs for it, but you can talk to him about it and

543
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
figure out what that is.

544
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,080
Because should we I feel like we should right?

545
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,880
I feel like that's the correct thing to do.

546
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,920
I feel like there's like a three-pronged plan here.

547
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Yeah, I actually heard that.

548
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,560
That God set into place.

549
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,640
No, you could try to go into the Terrifiers' realm now.

550
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,440
You have a connection to God.

551
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,080
You could try to go into the Terrifiers' realm now.

552
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,760
You could talk to the Pleasure Man about how to do that.

553
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Does your, wait.

554
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
There's all different ways you can go about this.

555
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,480
The Oreo God, does he know the Terrifier?

556
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,720
I could ask.

557
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,360
He could be in a kind of similar realm.

558
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,640
Maybe the Terrifier realm and the Oreo realm are like neighbors.

559
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,600
Well the Oreo God's evil too and the Terrifier's evil, right?

560
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
So probably the Terrifier.

561
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,240
Wait, you didn't bring a ring!

562
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,040
Yeah, I put an Oreo in my mouth.

563
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Yeah, you went Oreo-ing.

564
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
That's how I...

565
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Okay.

566
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Alright, and the Oreo God appears.

567
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
I have not thought of a voice for him.

568
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Okay, here we go.

569
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Wazzup!

570
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Wazzup!

571
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,040
He's cool as hell.

572
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
I love Oreos!

573
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,040
You definitely already did have a voice for him.

574
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
It wasn't. It was this. Just keep going.

575
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Okay, cool.

576
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Yeah, the mop voice always.

577
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
What's going on, Dogen?

578
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Do you--you being evil?

579
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Oh, hell yeah.

580
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
We're totally not gonna try and kill the

581
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
ultimate evil god or anything.

582
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Definitely not doing that.

583
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
But do you happen to know where he is or how to

584
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
get to his realm by any chance?

585
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Oh, yeah.

586
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Oh, like from--I can just sort of

587
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
walk next door, but for you,

588
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,040
You're gonna have to use some sort of magic.

589
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,660
But the particulars of it, hold on one second.

590
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,420
- What if you just pulled us up?

591
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,220
- Yeah, just reach down here and--

592
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,780
- No, I'm small, you can carry me.

593
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,980
- I just grew.

594
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,300
- You might need-- - I'm still pretty small though.

595
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,580
- You're gonna need-- - Five seven is a reasonable--

596
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,500
- Five seven, it's tiny.

597
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,660
- To find the vessel. - Might as well be one inch tall.

598
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,660
- It's true, if you're below five nine, you're a midget.

599
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,220
- You're gonna need to fuck, no.

600
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
We're gonna need to fuck what?

601
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,460
You're gonna need to find the vessel wherever the thing that's trapped into the realm.

602
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
And we fuck it?

603
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
No, do not fuck the vessel.

604
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,460
BLEGH!

605
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,460
Because isn't the vessel the prince?

606
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:34,960
Is the...

607
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,460
Patridge?

608
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
Oh my god.

609
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
I don't remember.

610
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
That's what the lawyers tell you to say.

611
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
[laughter]

612
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,960
Oh, I don't remember. I'm crazy.

613
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
And from there,

614
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,460
You're gonna need to probably try to...

615
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,960
...uh, sort of coax it out.

616
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,460
Make it try to become whole.

617
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,460
Sometimes it's just something intimate needs to occur, not fucking, you creep.

618
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,960
What are you saying? Whole?

619
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,960
When you're saying something intimate, now I'm weirded out by you.

620
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
No, something sentimental.

621
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,960
[Evil laugh]

622
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Like...

623
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
...the tears of a father.

624
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,460
That could help.

625
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
What about the blood of a father?

626
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
That could do it too, it'll just look different.

627
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Okay.

628
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Alright.

629
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,960
It's gonna be different if it's the blood, but it is possible.

630
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Baaaaah!

631
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
[Laughter]

632
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Sorry.

633
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
[Laughter]

634
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Sorry about that.

635
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
So we gotta make a daddy cry.

636
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
[Laughter]

637
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Baaaaah!

638
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
That's a yes.

639
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm gonna go get that double stuff back!

640
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,800
(laughter)

641
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,400
- It was good talking to you.

642
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,240
- Whatever.

643
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
(laughter)

644
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
- Why so rude?

645
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,680
- What is it?

646
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,520
Whatever, it's my God.

647
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,200
- You're one disciple, dude.

648
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,760
- No, he's gone, he's gone.

649
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,600
- What?

650
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,160
Maybe I'll go back to dirt.

651
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,760
- Hey guys, I just came up with this.

652
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,600
Wazzup!

653
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,440
(laughter)

654
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,280
- That is amazing.

655
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,880
- I'm gonna keep doing it.

656
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,960
- Okay, cool.

657
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,920
Yeah, so, you hear the pleasure man, he's like,

658
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,160
no that old chick's out, that's what I was gonna probably

659
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,120
something like that. It's crazy we all heard him. Yeah, no, yeah, well you sort of

660
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,320
established that as what's happening in the fiction so I'm just sort of rolling

661
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,560
with it. I like the Oreo God better than the dirt God. Yeah. Yeah. This guy's wassup. Yeah, he lets me eat Oreos too.

662
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,080
Yeah, the Oreos have dirt. Oh, you follow, you follow Dogen? Yeah, the Oreo God.

663
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,000
Dogen the Oreo God. Oh, okay, never mind then. I was gonna say that would have been

664
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,560
hilarious. That guy makes his disciples eat dirt and you don't even need to. Yeah,

665
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I never did that before. Okay. So yeah I mean you guys can, in that case, I mean

666
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,080
you can all go to the castle if like your job, if you feel like, like it's up to

667
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,320
you what you want to do. I need to make that king cry. Yeah. You make him cry?

668
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,920
And I have a beautiful song I can perform for him. I can cry with laughter from my

669
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:15,600
famous comedy routine. And I'll stand in the room. Okay so uh. So I guess what wait

670
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,160
should we all sneak into the building then? Because then we can go see the king.

671
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,320
Yeah sure I mean you could do whatever you want I was just. What's the quickest

672
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,920
way to make the king cry? Onions I don't know what the. Whoa hold on what is that?

673
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Wait, what are onions?

674
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,420
Yes.

675
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
Oh, they're like a-

676
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,420
You've never heard of onions, Patrick?

677
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
You've never heard of a-

678
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
You've never eaten an onion?

679
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
Is there one here? Can I see it?

680
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
Yeah, there's one right here.

681
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,420
It's literally right there, on the ground, in front of us.

682
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,420
It's been there the whole time.

683
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,420
It's a native species.

684
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Hold on, let me take a look.

685
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
Anything stinky pretty much grows in Trebuchet Village.

686
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Let me take a look at this real quick.

687
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Yeah, you're looking at an onion.

688
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Oh my god.

689
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,940
Do you like the onion? I'm like peeling it. Yeah. Well you don't really want to

690
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,300
peel it too much. Yeah because in this fantasy world an onion is a type of

691
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:24,620
animal. I'm just I'm peeling it. You hear the onion go... That's right hot dogs and onions are both animals in this world.

692
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:31,100
shit out of it. It's like oh my god it's like a shallot but big.

693
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,900
All right what you guys want to do? You guys want to, what do you guys want to do?

694
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,660
First of all I'm eating this onion. Yeah but I feel like we don't need all

695
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,420
three of us to go make the king cry right? That's true. Whatever man I'll go

696
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,780
with the fucking pleasure man dude. Yeah but we need the king's tears.

697
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,820
Yeah so you go get the king's tears. Okay.

698
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,180
I'll fight in the battle you go with the pleasure man. Whatever. I sort of line

699
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,160
this up just to have but like you guys can do what you want I'm already with the

700
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,280
pleasure man okay already at the battle yeah I actually finished the entire

701
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,980
thing you know me too I saw the entire I can mean me me it was such a sad ending

702
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:16,600
- might as well just turn this off now all right I'm gonna get a drink all

703
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:23,020
right cool so yes you guys are all sort of a lining up to your locations the

704
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:32,860
newly tall Patrick Yodar. I hit, can I, hold on, I hit my head on a shelf immediately. Yeah, you just

705
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:42,540
like keep, why'd you do that? He's tall now. Ah crap, I'm so tall and I hit my head on a shelf.

706
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:49,180
It was because I was so tall. Actually I hit my head on the ground. I feed him my dookie.

707
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,180
Feed him a piece of dookie. Yeah, he likes it. Yeah, he likes it. I mean

708
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:00,900
And so you're you guys I mean, I don't if you wanted to go through the dungeon passage or try to go just through the front

709
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,740
door

710
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,900
Either those are valid to try though Patrick

711
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:13,180
Probably gonna go dungeon. Mm-hmm. Okay, so we'll resolve that in a second. You are Dogen are lining up with

712
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,340
McElwee

713
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,420
Highlander

714
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,340
in the sort of lining up with his soldiers. So I'm lying outside you see

715
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:28,000
like a huge crowd of terrifier born and also scaredy cats.

716
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,140
Yeah and I will really quick I like tap Macaulay Highlander on the on the

717
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:39,300
shoulder. Hi! I have an idea for you. Okay. Abolish ice.

718
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,860
That's a... let me write that down my ancestors will love it. I mean the other

719
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:52,480
thing. Progeny? Descendants? Descendants! You're welcome. Yeah, he writes that down a

720
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:04,620
hundred times. I came up with it. It's millions of years ago. I did it. And so you guys are

721
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,620
sort of like staking out the location because basically what it is is there's

722
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,700
a ceremony today to bring back to sort of honor the prince is what the like

723
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,620
ostensibly what it is. Now that Mount Honestoodle is gone, he's doing it on top of Klawe Castle.

724
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:25,380
So there's all these people outside of Klawe Castle, mostly Terrafire-born, but also Scaredy

725
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,540
Cats. And the Scaredy Cats are slaves again, which wasn't true in Trebuchet Village. So

726
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:36,340
they've been turned into slaves again, the king's madness. And you, Evil Stevel, you and the

727
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,460
Pleasure Men are sort of just going back around. So the way you came when you first got towards

728
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,220
Honest Doodle, that first session, you're going with them towards Mount Honest Doodle, which is,

729
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,580
you know, sort of on the other side of town, sort of away from Claw Castle, or where it once was,

730
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:59,860
right? So, the first thing that's going to happen is you, Patrick, you're going down to where the

731
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,540
dungeon is. And so, you're with Sticky Fingers and with a couple of his guys, and he's like,

732
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,540
"Yeah, so this is the way I used to break people out of all the time when we had to get them out

733
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,020
out of the dungeon because they got caught doing one thing and another thing.

734
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,220
Yeah, so you know that we won't get caught down here because you know everything

735
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,980
about this place. Well yeah, things have probably changed since I've been down here.

736
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,180
That's shit. Yeah, sorry about that. And as you sort of approach this like

737
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,780
sort of underground dungeon entrance you do see like an orc like standing guard

738
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:34,540
outside of anything. So for example that's new. Okay. I mean we

739
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
We could kill him.

740
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
Do you want to kill him?

741
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,100
Do you want to talk to him?

742
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,260
You know, it's a day of celebration.

743
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
I think we should kill him.

744
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
You want to try to talk to him?

745
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Kill me?

746
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Okay.

747
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,300
And so, yeah, you guys are about to, we're going to line you up for that.

748
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,060
By the way, did we get any kind of short rest before?

749
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

750
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
You, yeah, sorry about that.

751
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
I forgot about that.

752
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,580
Yeah, you guys should have had a short rest while you were in the area, so just roll some

753
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,860
of your hit die.

754
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:09,140
I think you have like full hit points. A short rest or a long rest? It would be a short rest.

755
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,620
A long rest. How many hit die do you have?

756
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:18,020
I have 21 out of 21. Does a short rest restore any abilities or anything?

757
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:25,020
It depends on the class. For paladins... I guess I can just do it on here and see what happens.

758
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,220
What menu is short rest on here? I'm trying to find it. So yeah I think it might be a little weird on the...

759
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,560
I think it's this campfire thing. Yeah on the app. Is it weird on the app or no? Okay good

760
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,460
Yeah, you would just get I mean short rest for

761
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:43,800
Paladins they they don't think they get their they don't get their spells back. I think until a long rest if I'm correct

762
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,440
Yeah, I can't wait. Where is it? I can't find left. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Got it

763
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,000
Short rest. Mm-hmm

764
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,840
Yeah, and I think clerics also don't get their spells back until a long rest. Oh

765
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,840
(WARLOCK NOISES)

766
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
I should really have just like a chart for this.

767
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
It just never like...

768
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
Well, it just automatically does it on D&D Beyond.

769
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Yeah, I think it's just Warlock is like the only one that gets it.

770
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
I got back my Fury of the Small, that's all, but it doesn't matter.

771
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Yeah, Warlock's the only one that got it by short rest, right?

772
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
That's the whole thing. Okay, cool.

773
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
I always like forget to remember that.

774
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
That's a good long cramp.

775
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Yeah.

776
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
What the hell?

777
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
So, yeah, I mean...

778
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
You can't hear me.

779
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,840
So you should have three hit die to spend, EvilSteevel.

780
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Huh?

781
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:34,520
have three hit die to spend. Yeah. So and your hit die is I believe a d8. Yeah. It just does

782
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,520
it on D&D Beyond. Oh, okay. So that's it for you. That's what I was trying to tell you.

783
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You are a monster. You are a bad person. That's right.

784
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:51,000
Okay, cool. So meanwhile, yeah, Evil Seal, you've been walking with the pleasure men and,

785
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,600
you know, probably talking about whatever it is that pleasure men talk about.

786
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,000
And you see out of the corner of your eye

787
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,160
that little cackler fiend that you first saw when you were in the mountain.

788
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,400
What do I see out of the corner of my eye? Oh, I think it might be that cackler fiend.

789
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,960
You! You! Cackler fiend! Step no closer!

790
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,400
No, no, no, no. I mean no harm. You better stop cackling right now.

791
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,800
I can't, I'm cursed, that's what we do!

792
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,800
If it's a curse, well, you're welcome to hang out with me.

793
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,300
Okay, listen, listen, listen, you have to-

794
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,100
You weren't supposed to be there, okay?

795
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,400
But you were.

796
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Beware!

797
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,600
At the mountain, at the mountain!

798
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,100
He's like trying to find the words, he's like struggling.

799
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
I'm under there?

800
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,900
The Terrifier doesn't want to come back.

801
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
He's-

802
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,400
Master's tummy hurts.

803
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,700
He's sick, sick and tired.

804
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,220
Does not want to come back if he comes back we'll all be killed

805
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,460
You have to stop it. You have to how can I trust you cackling?

806
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,860
fiend

807
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,420
See, I don't know

808
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,240
I'm scared. I don't want to get killed by master

809
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,020
He's so hungry now

810
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,460
He can't get through the ramen. He wants the ramen though

811
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,580
Let me see the cacklers looking like despondent and just looking around

812
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,700
You see the pleasure man, the head of the pleasure man, Barnabas, goes,

813
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,700
"Hey, is this guy bothering you?"

814
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
"Yeah, he's fucking cackling while I'm trying to think."

815
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,700
"Hey, why don't you fuck off? We're trying to do something here."

816
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,700
But he did say something crazy about some terrifier.

817
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,700
Well, he said, I think he said, "Terrifier, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, doesn't want to come to here."

818
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
"The terrifier doesn't want to come back."

819
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,700
"Oh, okay. I mean, we don't want him to come back anyway."

820
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,700
"Good, good. I just, just, he wasn't supposed to be there."

821
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,140
"There, okay, I don't need to know.

822
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,260
You're just, okay, fine, come with us."

823
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,140
And takes a fiend along with you.

824
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,540
You, Dogen, you're standing by ready for the battle.

825
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,940
And you see the sort of field of all these like baddies

826
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,960
and then they have their sort of scaredy cat slaves.

827
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,180
And you look up at Clock Castle

828
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,220
and you see King Narwhal come out.

829
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,620
And you know, he looks like tired and like fucked up,

830
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,260
like angry, like a kind of like deep anger and sadness

831
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,780
from what you can see all the way on top of Claw Castle.

832
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,660
And he shouts like some sort of chant

833
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,220
that you can't understand.

834
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,220
And he holds aloft the sort of like semi corpse of his son.

835
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,760
And as he does.

836
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,940
- Ooh, that was a close one.

837
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,780
- Yeah, it was.

838
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
It shouldn't count.

839
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,460
Yeah, it almost rolled off the edge.

840
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:46,220
A ballast, like a ballista, shoots from across the way and you see McKelvey turn to you and

841
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,740
he goes, "Now's our time!"

842
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,860
He's like so excited for battle.

843
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:59,540
And the ballista fires out and you see the king and he's like doing his chant and the

844
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:04,220
giant fucking arrow just like gets him in the gut.

845
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,580
He's gonna take some damage from that.

846
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,620
Oh, ooh.

847
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,900
Ooh, okay.

848
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,140
And he just gets fucked up in the gut,

849
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,100
and you see all the people now in the front are like turning around like,

850
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,300
"Rrrrraaargh!"

851
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,460
Those are all monsters.

852
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,180
And then you see McKelvey goes,

853
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,820
"Brave lions, attack!"

854
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,540
And you all sort of get up and run out.

855
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,140
And now you guys are all informing up,

856
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,140
getting ready to fight.

857
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,460
You see the other, there's these trolls and these goblins

858
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,300
and these ghouls and zombies and no conscience

859
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,380
and they're all sort of getting ready to fight.

860
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,820
And so now we're gonna do two roll initiatives,

861
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,960
one for you, Patrick Yodar, and then one for you.

862
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,700
And then we'll do you soon too.

863
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,820
- I love that.

864
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,100
- Oh yeah.

865
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,300
- Pat got a four.

866
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,140
- I saw.

867
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,660
- I got a four.

868
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,500
- Okay.

869
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,660
- See, I should have just done that.

870
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,500
- Okay.

871
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,320
- I got a seven, two roll.

872
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,160
- You roll.

873
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,000
- I got a four.

874
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I got a three. Four town.

875
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
No, that's a four, that's a seventeen.

876
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What?

877
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
There's a three and I added one for my initiative.

878
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh, well I didn't add anything for my initiative. Hold on.

879
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You guys are so bad at this game.

880
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm insanely good at it. I'd do a backflip.

881
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
My initiative.

882
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Roll.

883
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Alright, fine. You wanna see how good I am at this fucking game?

884
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You're gonna have to roll though.

885
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Roll. I'm rolling it.

886
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Roll. Oh, wait, so that's just seven.

887
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Three. So you also got a three?

888
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Uh, but I gotta add my backflip score.

889
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, I figured it was a seven.

890
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Plus seventeen is a natural twenty.

891
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,840
- And Natural 20.

892
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,240
- Nice, okay.

893
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,080
So--

894
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,040
- Have you been adding the initiative

895
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,920
or whatever, like all the bonuses?

896
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,360
- Yeah, I always add it.

897
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,680
- Oh.

898
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,520
- I have your sheets up too here.

899
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,240
- Have you been shutting the fuck up?

900
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
- We talk about it every single session.

901
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,880
We say, I say, remember you add something

902
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,720
for your initiative.

903
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,200
- Well, I always forget to add it,

904
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,040
but it's nice--

905
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,860
- Every time I say it.

906
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,160
- No, I'm just saying that Patches is a good DM

907
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
because he adds it for me.

908
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,680
- I do everything.

909
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,520
I do everything.

910
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,560
(laughing)

911
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,580
I do it all.

912
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,040
Okay, cool.

913
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,760
and then who we are what's that going to be who yes

914
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,440
or use

915
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,640
yes it should be bad for you

916
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,840
it should not be a good time for you call it is

917
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,040
so yeah all this is happening at once you would stick your fingers charging the

918
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,760
work

919
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,200
sticky fingers is going to go first on this or disorder like my uh...

920
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,280
completely taken by surprise

921
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,120
you are sticking fingers he's a gnome

922
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,600
uh... he's pretty fucking fast and he takes a he's got dual daggers

923
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,200
he's running up to this guy

924
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,880
And you're running up with him, so you're both like...

925
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Can I just be walking with my hands in my pockets?

926
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Yeah, you're walking with your hands in your pockets.

927
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,880
But because he's getting a surprise round on him, he's going to have advantage.

928
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,880
Um, okay.

929
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
Six plus five.

930
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,880
Okay, that's going to hit because of his plus on his daggers.

931
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,880
And now, his double daggers. What do I have him doing for damage?

932
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Ooh, baby. Okay.

933
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,880
Da da da da.

934
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,880
And...

935
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,940
Nice, okay, so he just like runs up to this organ just like

936
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,120
Like just like jumps up around him and slices him up

937
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,340
And meanwhile you were cut

938
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:13,600
Dogen Dogen you have a you and and McKelvey are squaring up on a troll like a pretty big troll, okay?

939
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,880
and it's gonna be

940
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,340
The trolls turn first unfortunately. No, he's going to attack

941
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,460
He's gonna attack actually the soldiers in front of McKelvey first

942
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:34,600
So, let's get that up. Oh yeah. And so, he's going to take like a giant fucking club that

943
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,440
he has. And there's all these other battles and skirmishes going on. You see the brave

944
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,760
lions are trying to hold their own, but they're going up against like giant creatures. It's

945
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:50,260
like going too hot. So, Troll's going to attack. Awesome. Where did I get? Four. Nice. Okay.

946
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,400
That doesn't count. It rolled on the floor. That's - no, what are you talking about? We

947
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,160
don't play it as it lies. What are you talking about? That's bad for the Tim. Yeah it's bad

948
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,680
for the troll. Why are you making him re-roll? I'm re-rolling it. Don't re-roll it! Oh I

949
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,480
want to. Oh my god. Patrick's trying to get me to lose the game. So yeah, the troll goes

950
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,160
in and he swings down on the soldiers and the soldiers are able to sort of get out of

951
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,440
the way and are sort of able to dodge. The troll's going to try to attack again. And

952
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,900
yeah, the troll is just like sort of swinging his club and missing. He's taken way too much

953
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,820
by surprise. I hear I hear Patrick's voice in the back of my head trying to get me

954
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:33,020
to walk into the club but I'm resisting it. Oh shit! Walk in there motherfucker!

955
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,020
I am gonna actually am gonna retcon something because I should have mentioned

956
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:45,700
this before. Each of you has these walking talking stones. I totally forgot.

957
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,820
I was like I was so excited about that just in case you guys decided to did

958
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,140
decide to split up. But you all have these walking talking stones so you can

959
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:59,020
communicate with each other throughout. They make an insanely loud "kshh" sound

960
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,420
whenever they start up though. So if anyone's sneaking anywhere you just have

961
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,860
to be careful about it. But uh... Okay then no one talk to me.

962
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:16,380
Patrick how's the dungeon going? Shut up. Are you sneaking yet Patrick? I'm in the

our get to Honest Doodle where it once was and you do see a circle there of

996
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,380
similar to the one you saw in the temple. Nobody's naked yet though, but it's

997
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:38,540
members of the St. Anthony's parish as well as Kitsunes, those creepy

998
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,580
long fox creatures from the woods. And you see in the middle of them all, in the

999
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,820
middle of their painted circle, they've sort of painted on the dirt ground, is

1000
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,980
is the jester's hat.

1001
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,020
The jester, the spirit jester who vanished

1002
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,540
or was destroyed.

1003
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,420
- Is the jester the terrifier?

1004
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:02,420
- And you see it there and you see the pleasure man.

1005
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,260
He goes, "It looks like they're trying to summon

1006
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,420
"some sort of shade of the terrifier,

1007
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,140
"a spirit, merge it with the vessel.

1008
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,780
"This is not good.

1009
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,500
we should we should probably try to kill them

1010
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,940
i'd be more like them

1011
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,300
will talk to him too

1012
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,900
now we should kill them and i'm sorry

1013
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,380
we can do it we can talk of course

1014
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,680
or have a question

1015
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,320
yes to meet who

1016
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,580
you know me what's on the word is date

1017
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,920
to the people in the circle have the vessel

1018
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,540
no the king of the vessel

1019
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,660
all got it got all of the okay yeah

1020
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,680
i've okay this whole time i thought the vessel was like a a stone

1021
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:54,200
thing like a big diamond? I mean some would say children are diamonds. I forgot that vessel

1022
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:01,960
meant child. In this it does but not in like anywhere else. Okay so I heard vessel and then

1023
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:11,120
you said that the white woman of the caves. Well in this context. I thought that the, I

1024
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,880
think you said that the white. Everyone kick your feet up this is going to be a while. I

1025
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,080
You said that the white woman of the caves was in a vessel.

1026
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,080
Oh no, she was in a cage.

1027
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,080
Okay. Alright.

1028
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,080
But cage means child, you're saying?

1029
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,680
Uh, well, let me tell you. Marriage is a cage, alright?

1030
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,680
And he's married to a child.

1031
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,080
Child is a prison guard who's torturing you.

1032
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,080
Oh, I get it.

1033
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
Come on now.

1034
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,280
Is everything clear though?

1035
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,880
Yeah.

1036
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,480
Okay.

1037
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
I'll have like a sort of like dictionary ready.

1038
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,880
Like I'll have like sort of a wiki made with all the terms.

1039
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,080
I just forgot that one thing.

1040
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,880
No, no, no, you're fine. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So, all right. Yeah. They heard like

1041
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,980
summoning some sort of shade of the terrifier to merge with the vessel and

1042
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,680
they I think I'm going to walk in and use my Kimbo shotguns on them. Okay.

1043
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,080
Cool.

1044
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:01,380
Can't believe I gave those to you. It was so stupid. That was a big misstep.

1045
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,080
It was.

1046
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:08,680
It was a auto crit too. Yeah, all head. 10d 10 damage. Yeah, it was so dumb.

1047
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,480
I should have given you a sword or something instead. No.

1048
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:20,480
Okay, uh, so yeah, I mean you see them. They don't seem to see you. I should be a bit more diligent.

1049
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,480
Can I at least roll something? I haven't rolled anything this entire game except for a backflip roll.

1050
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,480
You rolled for a backflip? Nobody else rolled for a backflip. That was special.

1051
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
Yeah, you got a special roll. You think so?

1052
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,480
Well, there's things you can, so you can, I mean you can try to sneak up on them. You can...

1053
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,480
Do they hate water? Due perception.

1054
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,480
You should ask.

1055
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:47,640
Hey, pleasure man guy. Yes, what's going on? By the looks of them. Would you say that

1056
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:54,640
maybe they might not be too fond of water? I don't think they think sort of

1057
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,480
about water in terms of fondness. That's good enough for me. I'm going to

1058
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:07,320
I'm going to create as much water, more water than any of you have ever seen. I

1059
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,960
I think the limit of that is like 15 feet, a cubic feet of water.

1060
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,120
That's a lot of water.

1061
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,120
They're in a pit, right?

1062
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120
That's probably a million miles of water.

1063
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
What?

1064
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Aren't they in a pit?

1065
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
They're in a circle.

1066
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,120
They're in a circle.

1067
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,120
Well, they're in a circle.

1068
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,440
You can do 10 gallons of clean water within rain.

1069
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,600
It's so fucked up that the world is so bad when you could create water.

1070
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,520
I kind of just want to freak them out.

1071
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
Yeah, alternatively, the waterfall-

1072
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,720
Well, couldn't you drown all of the-

1073
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,720
They're not in a-

1074
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,720
aren't they in an empty pool with bars over the top?

1075
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,720
Are they handcuffed to the bottom of a pool like David Blaine?

1076
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Okay, maybe I might have put this in my mind palace.

1077
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,720
My own thing. Well, let's take a look. I thought that, so you said it's where

1078
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,720
Mount Honest Doodle was, so I imagine that there was a crater.

1079
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,720
No, no, no. It's almost like it was never there. That's a good point.

1080
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,720
It's very bizarre. I thought that there was a big crater that they were sitting in.

1081
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,920
Um, the water...

1082
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,920
'Cause I was gonna say, you could just drown them.

1083
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,720
Yeah, 'cause the water...

1084
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,720
With 10 gallons of water.

1085
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,220
You could create the, uh...

1086
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,720
Yeah, alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range.

1087
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,220
I think I'll actually...

1088
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,720
You could just...

1089
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,020
You could just get them wet.

1090
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,720
You can make fog, too, right?

1091
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,220
Oh, I can make fog.

1092
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,020
I've done that before.

1093
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,320
Yeah, I did let you do that.

1094
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,020
I'm gonna make fog, you bitch.

1095
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,420
Yeah, I did let you do that.

1096
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,220
Let's do it.

1097
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:26,720
Okay.

1098
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,020
Let me go to my spells.

1099
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:33,620
There is, I think, a spell that deliberately creates fog.

1100
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,020
But that's magical fog.

1101
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,820
Yeah, you know what?

1102
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,620
I don't need any fucking crazy fog.

1103
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,020
I'm going to create and not destroy water.

1104
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,020
Okay, cool.

1105
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:49,220
So you create that, and you create that fog around them, and you see them start to freak

1106
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,220
out.

1107
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,220
I thought he was creating water.

1108
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,220
They're kind of confused.

1109
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,140
They're looking around, and Pleasure Man goes, "Good job.

1110
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,140
Let's strike now."

1111
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,300
and they start to run up, and so we're gonna roll for initiative,

1112
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,820
you're gonna have a surprise round on them.

1113
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,320
Yes!

1114
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,800
'Cause you see them, they're like, "What's going on, huh? What's going on?"

1115
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,320
Nine.

1116
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,820
Okay.

1117
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,820
Well, add your...

1118
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,100
I don't, I have a zero.

1119
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,300
You have a zero, there, alright.

1120
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,940
Alright, cool.

1121
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,400
Let me get your shit up here.

1122
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:13,900
Sucks.

1123
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,060
Goddamn.

1124
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,660
This is...

1125
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,860
Wait, where's your...

1126
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,180
What the fuck?

1127
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,700
I thought I had the, uh...

1128
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:22,580
Steevo, what are you up to?

1129
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,080
There it is.

1130
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,580
Okay.

1131
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,100
I'm in the fog.

1132
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,100
Over.

1133
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,100
You just made a bunch of fog?

1134
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,100
Yeah.

1135
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,100
Patrick, you really need to say over.

1136
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,100
Over.

1137
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,100
I'm trying to be quiet, y'all.

1138
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Over.

1139
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,100
Well, I just like to hold the button down.

1140
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,100
Stop doing that.

1141
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,100
Just in case I need to say anything.

1142
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,100
I gotta be quiet.

1143
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,100
It's getting so loud.

1144
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,100
Over.

1145
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,100
Under.

1146
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Over.

1147
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,100
You can't say under without saying over after.

1148
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,100
Over.

1149
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,100
Underwear.

1150
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,100
I just said underwear.

1151
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,100
He said underwear.

1152
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,100
Over.

1153
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,100
I said underwear.

1154
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1155
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,100
Over.

1156
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,100

and they're going at it,

1169
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,540
they're like casting spells at one another,

1170
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,640
and like, sort of like using their stabs

1171
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,640
to like fucking beat each other back.

1172
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,580
And you and Barnabas go and run toward,

1173
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,860
and Barnabas is sort of running towards

1174
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,360
the jester's crown in the center.

1175
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,020
And he's like, "Let's, we move it

1176
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,220
so we can disrupt the ritual."

1177
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,820
And as he's getting closer to it,

1178
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,560
the jester's crown starts to shake.

1179
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,240
And as it shakes, and you can sort of see it

1180
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,620
a little bit through the fog,

1181
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,260
and it shakes and vibrates,

1182
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,780
And you see it like become the jester's face

1183
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,980
and then kind of warp into something else

1184
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,580
and then back to the jester's face.

1185
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,640
And it becomes some sort of like black shade spirit,

1186
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,780
sort of shimmery and staticky.

1187
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,700
Kind of looks like, it was mostly for Cam, I guess,

1188
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,360
but like gone when he becomes evil

1189
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,660
for a second in "Hunter x Hunter," right?

1190
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,060
And it's like this weird shimmery shade

1191
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:10,660
And he's like, "Okay, okay, that's the terrifier shade.

1192
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,540
"Okay, it's not as strong as the terrifier,

1193
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,220
"but we're going to need to kill it."

1194
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,100
And yeah, you guys are scoring up against that.

1195
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,820
And the spirit though, you do have a surprise round

1196
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,860
on the spirit still.

1197
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,060
So Barnabas is gonna go first though.

1198
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,140
And Barnabas is going to, what did I have Barnabas to?

1199
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,200
Oh yeah. - I'm so weak.

1200
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,420
I've never done any damage to anybody in this tournament.

1201
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,820
- Oh, you'll do damage.

1202
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,140
- You don't, you have a bunch of spells.

1203
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,200
- You have a bunch of good spells.

1204
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,820
You just use the same one.

1205
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,420
- You use chill touch every time.

1206
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:42,800
My best friend over touch is cool. You can't be complaining over so Barnabas sort of like stops himself and

1207
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,660
throws his staff up in the air and

1208
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:50,500
And

1209
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,620
from the from the sky you see sort of a like a

1210
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,000
Silvery like beam of pale white shoot down and

1211
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,780
it's a it's moonbeam is the spell and

1212
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,420
Roll the dice on your phone.

1213
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,420
He's gonna have to try to avoid it.

1214
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,420
Why am I doing this?

1215
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,420
Okay, cool.

1216
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,420
And what do I have for Mr. Shade?

1217
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,420
I think Patches does whatever we say, guys.

1218
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,420
[laughter]

1219
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:20,420
The Shade's Constitution.

1220
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,420
I thought that the bevels of his phone case

1221
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,420
would stop the dice, but I was wrong.

1222
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,420
Okay, yeah. So...

1223
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,420
The moonbeam shoots down,

1224
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:37,500
And the shade is able to sort of resist the full power of the beam, but it still takes

1225
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,500
some damage.

1226
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
So where's a D10?

1227
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm trying not to touch nothing.

1228
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,180
Here we are, oh no, it's 12.

1229
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,740
Oh, where are you?

1230
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,740
Your shape is annoying.

1231
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,980
Wait, it's the one that looks...

1232
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,980
This one?

1233
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,980
D12?

1234
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,980
No, D10 I need.

1235
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,180
I always forget, yeah, there we go, thank you.

1236
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,060
Right, looks like that.

1237
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:06,400
all right and it does 1 million points yeah okay so it just takes a little bit

1238
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,460
of damage as the moon beam comes down and evil steve well you can do something now

1239
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,680
too okay I'm going to so bravely cast inflict

1240
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:20,740
wounds onto this evil shade cool so for inflict wounds you have to be in you

1241
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:25,740
have to do a melee attack I think I will do go for it so you have I think a mace

1242
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,400
If I'm correct, I think I'm gonna use it

1243
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,940
Any problems with that big guy? What's um, what?

1244
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:37,700
No, no none. Hey better not any problems with it. So what should I roll?

1245
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,520
I don't know. You should just roll d20. Okay, I will

1246
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,260
12 nice that

1247
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,420
Plus it's plus

1248
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:01,100
Was for us for 16 that hits so over damage is 3d 10 damage. It's 4d 10 on my screen

1249
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,460
Oh, you're casting it at level 2. Yes, sir

1250
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,960
Around here. I want to kill this fucker

1251
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:13,940
Go my shit kill him for kill him for dead. All right, here's here's I'm rolling 3. Oh, I got all for that's nice

1252
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,940
I don't think that's it. No, they're all

1253
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,460
tensile like top series

1254
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:19,900
- They're scary.

1255
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,940
- They're scaries to me.

1256
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,660
(laughing)

1257
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,840
- Five, 11, 19.

1258
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,940
- Nice, yeah.

1259
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,500
So what does your inflict wounds look like

1260
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,340
when you hit this thing?

1261
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,160
What do you do?

1262
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,640
- I'm gonna, so I have a mace.

1263
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,180
So I'm gonna hit him with the mace.

1264
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,460
- It's a melee spell attack,

1265
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,260
so it can be technically like your mace,

1266
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,100
it can be whatever you want.

1267
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,020
- Okay, I'm gonna use the mace

1268
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,860
and I'm gonna hit him a hundred trillion times.

1269
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,060
- Yeah, okay, yeah.

1270
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,100
- Yeah, just sort of go.

1271
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,700
(imitating mace)

1272
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,700
sound like yeah, this shade is like

1273
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:56,500
like as you keep punching it is rock. Yeah. Yeah, and it's got

1274
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,600
the moonbeam coming down on them and as you're punching him

1275
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,300
through and like the shimmery light on this thing, it's like

1276
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,700
pretty beautiful and weird, especially with the fog going

1277
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,100
around. It's like with this weird beautiful violence happening.

1278
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,500
Yes, you beat the shit out of him and that's pretty good for

1279
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,200
the surprise round. We're going to go back to the top of the

1280
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,400
order in a second first though. We're going to cut back to

1281
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:20,760
Dogan Dogan it's going to be Sean whoops. It's going to be a Mckelly

1282
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,880
Highlanders turn.

1283
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:27,820
He's going to try to attack the troll okay, and that's going to hit the troll

1284
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:33,920
for fucking sure and he's going to he's going to be like my sword of data and

1285
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,080
he's going to try to attack. He's going to attack the troll for

1286
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:45,680
got 12 damage in this 12 out of 12 so the troll is just like slashed through like

1287
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,480
gutted and he's gonna attack him again that trolls ran through and this time

1288
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,680

Spoon shovel. Right, it's a spoon now.

1291
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
That's 11 plus...

1292
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
So that's a 15.

1293
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
That hits.

1294
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,640
Okay. Is it D8?

1295
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,640
Plus 2. That's 5 damage.

1296
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,640
Nice. You can also do Divine Smite still, if you want to do that.

1297
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,640
Do it.

1298
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,640
I only have one spell slot left.

1299
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,640
Okay, then don't do it.

1300
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,640
Oh, okay. Yeah. Right. I forgot about that.

01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,640
Yeah, you conk him in the gut where the slash was made.

1302
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,640
So you're sort of like rubbing in the wound.

- All right.

1317
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,800
- So you get advantage.

1318
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,200

- What do I add to that?

1322
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,360
- I think it's gonna hit.

1323
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,720
- I think it's probably fine.

1324
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,800
- Yeah, I know, but it could be like a 24.

1325
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,640
(laughing)

1326
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,800
- It could be really big. - Well, anyway.

1327
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,040
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

1328
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,880
So I got a 19 plus how much?

1329
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,960

1333
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,040
- Oh, I guess they don't technically give...

1334
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,000
- Well, what would I be looking at?

1335
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,600
- That's annoying that they don't give advantage

1336
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,800
to surprise rounds.

1337
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,820
They really should.

1338
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,200
I give it.

1339
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,000
So it's a 19 plus five.

1340
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,040
They really should just give,

1341
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,240
why wouldn't you also give advantage?

1342
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,640
I guess 'cause you're already getting to get to go first.

1343
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,640
But I give it because I think it's cool.

1344
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,520
- Okay, yeah, and you hit him. - And this is also a sneak attack?

1345
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,480
You hit him, yeah. So roll...

1346
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,160
- So I just... those three dice? - Yeah, so you're gonna...

1347
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:31,560
- These three, yeah, 'cause you have two d6 for your sneak attack. - Okay.

1348
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,840
And then you're gonna add the additional, I think, that...

1349
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,280
That is a... nine.

1350
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,360
Nice. And then you're gonna add also, for your shortbow, plus three, so twelve.

1351
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,800
So yeah, um...

1352
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,640
God, between all that, yeah, you guys... you finish off the orc.

1353
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,400
- Yeah. - You just, like, get him square between the eyes.

1354
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,400
after sticky fingers like a slashing him up and you think and just like

1355
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,280
don't and it's just these is dead

1356
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,680
as a figure sort of waves you and the other guys and

1357
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,120
like you're just like going

1358
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,740
and uh...

1359
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:03,220
evil steve work at the u_n_ where's the court uh...

1360
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,560
i guess i'd find this out later

1361
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,520
because it's gonna ask where the king is all your speaking now patrick

1362
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,920
you know that

1363
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,800
who had been doing a lot of sneaking around the country at me

1364
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,400
i told you to come with or be over

1365
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,460
which i told i told the both the could come with me

1366
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:23,700
but you guys decided to go the other way i mean we could well do this together

1367
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,020
and anyway

1368
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,600
uh... i'm going up

1369
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,940
a set of stairs right now and i'm going to sneak up on the came that the short

1370
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,940
over it's sort of something like that i don't know where where is the king now

1371
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,700
because he's got no ok over so that he retreated what you would i mean you

1372
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,620
wouldn't you don't even know that he did retreat back into the castle will you

1373
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,780
probably told

1374
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,780
No.

1375
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:48,020
So, okay, you don't know where he is at all.

1376
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:51,780
So we're cutting to Evil Stevel.

1377
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,780
Now the shade is going to go.

1378
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,780
And so he's going to look to you, Evil Stevel.

1379
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,900
This is a shade of the Terrifier, so it's like taking some elements of the spirit, the

1380
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,460
jester who serves the Terrifier.

1381
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:06,100
And he's going to look to you.

1382
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,660
Yes, very cool.

1383
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,100
I'm just very boredly looking into his face.

1384
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,540
Yeah, you just like beat the shit out of him.

1385
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,140
You're gonna roll a,

1386
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,060
ooh, what did I give him?

1387
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,500
Oh yeah, okay.

1388
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,820
- Oh, that was a crazy.

1389
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:20,660
- Scary.

1390
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,820
- Oh yeah.

1391
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,660
- Sorry about that.

1392
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,900
- You sound like George Takei.

1393
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,820
- Oh my.

1394
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,660
- Yeah.

1395
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,480
- That's what he says.

1396
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,140
- Yeah, that's what he sounds like.

1397
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,700
You're going to roll a--

1398
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,260
- A real George Takei impression.

1399
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,500
(laughing)

1400
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,080
- You're gonna roll a,

1401
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,700
a, what was that?

1402
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,980
Yeah, wisdom saving throw.

1403
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:45,980
So roll a d20 and add your wisdom saving modifier.

1404
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:49,980
Which, oh I think you, do you have an advantage on that? No, just against poison.

1405
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,980
Okay. What'd you get?

1406
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,980
I don't know what to say. You got a 2 plus 4, that's 6?

1407
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,980
You know what, it's not enough.

1408
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:04,980
The Terrifier Shade looks at you, and he projects a, or it,

1409
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:09,980
projects a phantasmal image of your worst fear.

1410
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:21,860
Hmm what is your worst fear? My friends getting hurt. You see images of Dogen

1411
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:29,340
stubbing his toe and Patrick hitting his head on a shelf from before you see that

1412
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:35,220
what happened earlier just like play over and over and over again. No demon

1413
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:44,380
release me no and you're getting like super frightened so you drop your weapon

1414
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:50,020
on the ground while you're getting friends on the ground boys are you okay

1415
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:55,580
over and you are my head on the doorframe

1416
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:04,140
Patrick didn't say over so you should have waited before you said over and you

1417
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,900
You are now afraid of the Terrifier Spirit.

1418
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,440
I'm so afraid!

1419
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,700
So you're going to have to run away from it.

1420
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:13,700
I'm running!

1421
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,700
Not yet.

1422
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,180
I'm going to wait though.

1423
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:23,420
So, alright, we'll cut away from that and we'll go back to the battlefield where the

1424
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,420
troll is there.

1425
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:28,620
So the troll is going to go now and he's going to swing at you, Dogen.

1426
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,420
Okay, I don't think that hits you.

1427
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,800
No, he swings at you and he just misses,

1428
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,960
and he's gonna try to swing at you again.

1429
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,800
That definitely hits you.

1430
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,760
- Oh.

1431
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,320
- Yeah. - It doesn't.

1432
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,000
- That troll's gonna do some damage.

1433
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,260
- I think the troll's about to hit me, over.

1434
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,240
(laughing)

1435
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,080
- Okay.

1436
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,360
- Just, just, just don't let it, over.

1437
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,560
- I'll let you guys know how much damage it does to me, over.

1438
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,160
I don't even wanna know, over.

1439
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,160
- You should tell him if it does or not

1440
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,440
because I feel like that's something

1441
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,480
he could coach you through, over.

1442
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,880
- I know, I'm already really frightened and upset.

1443
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,200
- So it's 14 damage to you.

1444
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,920
- 14 damage, guys, over.

1445
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,760
- He's getting gashed.

1446
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,840
- No!

1447
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,680
- And as you take that hit--

1448
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,940
- Is that good or bad?

1449
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,680
- Let's see.

1450
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,040
- I'm at 11.

1451
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,640
- So probably bad.

1452
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,840
- So after you take that hit--

1453
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,680
- That might be bad.

1454
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,520
- You're looking around at the battlefield

1455
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,980
and it is looking kind of dire.

1456
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,960
The Brave Lions are just not up to snuff.

1457
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,600
Just a reason why their rebellion hasn't happened just yet.

1458
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,400
And you're watching the trolls start to play

1459
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,800
with the bodies of these like little puny little humans

1460
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,600
and slap them around and you know,

1461
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,080
like the Hulk or whatever.

1462
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,160
- You should have just come with me,

1463
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,200
we could have been good sneaking partners over.

1464
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,620
- And then, Dogen, you recall something

1465
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:52,440
that definitely was said by Fuck You a while ago,

1466
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,160
where he said, "Look to my coming at first light

1467
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,360
"on the fifth day.

1468
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,480
"At dawn, look to the east."

1469
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,920
(laughing)

1470
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,760
and as you turn your head

1471
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,160
i guess it has been five days

1472
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,720
you see cresting over the hill i'm looking at the west at first i don't see

1473
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:15,080
anything i got turned around on the battlefield

1474
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,200
and you see

1475
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,480
riding

1476
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,760
sullivan

1477
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,800
i brought him and you see fuck you

1478
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,800
and a hundred idiots

1479
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,800
compressing over a hill.

1480
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,040
(laughter)

1481
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:35,960
And they're all doing the Monty Python silly walk.

1482
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,360
Are cresting over the hill.

1483
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,600
And storming the battlefield.

1484
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,760
And you see Fuck You, who's on top of Solveigns,

1485
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,080
and he's like, "Can I stop killing you?"

1486
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:44,920
"No!"

1487
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,080
And he's casting insane spells and wiping the field,

1488
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,880
not completely clean, but he's helping

1489
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,240
turn the tide of battle.

1490
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,080
and you're gonna get to go again.

1491
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,280
You're gonna get to try again,

1492
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,000
one more time, to fight this troll.

1493
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,840
- Okay.

1494
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
- You're gonna get up and fight him again.

1495
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,080
- I'm gonna do it right now?

1496
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,920
- Yes.

1497
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,640
- Hey, Dogen.

1498
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,800
Have you tried using the troll spray?

1499
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:14,160
- I'm waiting for you to say over, over.

1500
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:19,840
- Sorry, I'm trying to walk up the stairs right now,

1501
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,460
and it's just, I gotta be so quiet, over.

1502
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:23,860
(mimics gunfire)

1503
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,220
- Heard you loud and clear, buddy.

1504
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,060
Over.

1505
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:28,400
(laughter)

1506
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,060
- I'm gonna swing my battle spoon.

1507
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:30,900
- Yeah.

1508
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:35,840
- That's a seven plus, I already forgot what it's plus.

1509
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,620
- I have a 100.

1510
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,220
- Four, it's 11.

1511
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,820
- Ah, just barely missed this.

1512
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:41,980
- You get kind of inspired,

1513
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,420
but you still just gotta whiff this.

1514
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,540
- Oh, yeah.

1515
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,020
- I'm sorry for distracting you, over.

1516
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,980
- Uh-oh, guys, over.

1517
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:50,380
- And we're gonna cut now to Patrick Yodar.

1518
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:53,740
So you are in, you are, you have sort of like crawled up

1519
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:56,540
through the dungeon now, which are empty.

1520
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,660
Everyone's been, there is no jail.

1521
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,820
Everyone's just killed now.

1522
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:01,740
It's terrible.

1523
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,340
And--

1524
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:06,620
- Why was the guard even there?

1525
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,700
- 'Cause he knew it was an entrance, I guess.

1526
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,340
But yeah, nobody's getting in or out.

1527
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,940
Well, now you guys are getting in.

1528
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:17,060
And as you're growing up the stairs, roll perception.

1529
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:22,980
Is that a 9?

1530
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:23,980
What about his big eye?

1531
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,980
And you have advantage on perception.

1532
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:25,980
Oh yeah, you're going to have plus.

1533
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,460
Oh, and I have advantage on every perception roll.

1534
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:30,660
Not advantage on perception, you get additional, but you do get additional.

1535
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:31,660
Oh, dexterity.

1536
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,660
Oh, okay.

1537
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:33,660
And dexterity saving throws, yeah.

1538
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:37,420
So, my perception is...

1539
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,460
What's my perception?

1540
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:43,020
Perception is pretty high, and I think you also have...

1541
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,260
Well, I have plus 4 perception.

1542
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:50,820
Yeah, and then yes, you get plus four perception and

1543
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,820
all right. Yeah, I forgot you can use a bonus action spot.

1544
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,540
That's cool. You have that for your other thing.

1545
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,820
You plus four perception. You got an additional, um,

1546
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,980
you had your proficiency measures too. Not three. I don't know.

1547
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,180
I thought it was three. So you had to see at six to eight.

1548
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:07,140
Would you get again? Would you get a nine, nine? Okay, cool. So yeah,

1549
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,900
with 15, it's pretty good. Um, so as you're calling up the stairs,

1550
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,180
you notice through the door,

1551
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:16,100
but there are two guards inside the atrium.

1552
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,580
Like you're able to sort of spot that out,

1553
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:21,460
like you're able to hear it or see it rather.

1554
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:24,940
And Stickyfinger sort of gets the message

1555
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,900
and he, Stickyfinger goes like,

1556
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,660
you know, does like sort of command shit,

1557
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,420
like two fingers move forward

1558
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,940
and two of his gang members burst through the door

1559
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,020
and take out the guards.

1560
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,900
I mean, he waves you in, he's like, "Come on, let's go."

1561
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,980
And so you're able to sort of go

1562
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,100
into this main atrium of the castle

1563
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,820
you see the guards are just dead already. Like, Sticky Fingers crew took them out. It's,

1564
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:50,980
you know, lots of bones. It's a very spooky claw castle. It's kind of Romanesque, actually,

1565
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:54,580
like, as far as the architectural style, where it's like a lot of simple things, but then with,

1566
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:58,660
like, bones interspersed. And the only thing that's, like, not this, like, early medieval

1567
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:03,220
thing is that there's, like, this ornate skylight that when you look up at, you can see the rest of

1568
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:07,220
the arm of the claw. And you see in front of you, there's double doors that lead to this, like,

1569
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:11,940
spiral that's going to lead to the famous, like, spiral staircase where you walk up the claw's arm.

1570
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:16,740
to the top of the claw which is where you think maybe the king would be working

1571
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:21,700
anywhere after getting wounded could I do an investigation check yeah you could

1572
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,380
certainly try to do a yeah tell me do investigation to see if you can

1573
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:31,700
understand the layout of this place that was a nat 20 on that 20 Wow um yeah so

1574
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,900
shit so you look around and you're trying to get the sense of like okay

1575
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,460
looking for blood because he got hit in the stomach right mm-hmm okay you're

1576
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:41,540
sort of like trying to get the sense of what could have happened where he could

1577
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:49,940
have gone. And from what you know, like Arkham Asylum style, like vision and shit, like looking

1578
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:55,340
at the floor. Yeah. And like you get a pretty good sense of the layout of this place now.

1579
01:15:55,340 --> 01:16:01,460
On either side of you are two is a room. One is a storage room of some kind. The other is

1580
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:09,100
like a library. You know that if you go up the tower, there is a small like sort of church

1581
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:14,860
room and you also know that at the top of the tower is the throne room by where the palm

1582
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:20,180
of the claw is. So, if he were to sort of hide somewhere, he'd probably end up going to the

1583
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:24,400
throne room. Like, you would have to climb up this thing, you know, and there's also

1584
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,940
like a barracks, you know, too.

1585
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:26,940
Yeah.

1586
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,940
So, you'd want to avoid that, obviously, because there's probably soldiers in there.

1587
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,420
Is the barracks in the staircase?

1588
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,020
This barracks is also one of the offshoots of the staircase. It's sort of like the whole

1589
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,700
castle's like this spiral staircase, like this thin spiral staircase and then like all

1590
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:37,700
these rooms.

1591
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,700
How many floors?

1592
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,620
God, I didn't even put a number on that, but...

1593
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:42,620
So it's two floors?

1594
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,620
It's two floors.

1595
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,620
No, it's like...

1596
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,620
I would say...

1597
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,020
It's two floors, but the stairs are very long.

1598
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,260
Yeah, it's probably like 25 floors, I would say.

1599
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,100
It's a massive staircase.

1600
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,360
But those are like the main rooms that you would know about.

1601
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,380
The other rooms are probably just like...

1602
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,920
And where is the dumb waiter?

1603
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,420
The dumb waiter?

1604
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,900
The dumb waiter is in the center of...

1605
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,820
I'm looking at him.

1606
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:08,140
dumb waiter that you know there's multiple dumb waiters that go from

1607
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:12,180
different rooms to send down different gruel and stuff and also Patrick is the

1608
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:17,540
dumb waiter mm-hmm I'm sorry so I can't so so because you said that I can

1609
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:22,140
transport anywhere in the building that I want to because I'm a dumb waiter and I

1610
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:26,460
can actually go to the dumb waiter goes up and down it goes up to the throne

1611
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,980
readers mostly go down I think well I think a dumb waiter could go up to

1612
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,780
well they can't run around to the house and the family i think i think i was

1613
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,780
down forever and just all i guess it makes sense

1614
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:38,660
uh... so it don't we're read the dumb waiter

1615
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,940
not yet you're done

1616
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,660
well among so i'm a dumb waiter

1617
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,940
so i can go all the way up to the throne room

1618
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,700
we could ride the dumb

1619
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,100
actually problem past rightman

1620
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:55,900
can you write it down and all i have to do is make the king cry in front of his

1621
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,740
half-dead son

1622
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:05,220
yeah yeah yeah you're right yeah and you have to ask and i'm also a dumb waiter

1623
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:08,300
so i can go up all the way all right you're not a dumb all right take it back

1624
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,020
you're not a dumb okay so well you can start climbing the stairs you want to go

1625
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:18,300
to the or you want to go to explore the other rooms or do you want to do i mean

1626
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:25,220
should i explore the other rooms i don't know i don't know over i'm having a hard

1627
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,500
time because there's there's two rooms here doesn't it seem like patrick is

1628
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:34,200

inventory too. Duck tape. Yeah you can do whatever you want we can cut back to you

1632
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,340
too you can think about it you can chew on it.

1633
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:56,020
Mm-hmm evil Steve. Oh, yes, sir. Well, I'm thinking I'm

1634

01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,500
Sticky fingers are climbing the stairs together now

1637
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,300
evil Steve Oh

1638
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,660
You are now

1639
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,840

Barnabas is

1643
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:33,740
Because the thing didn't move it just like took damage it doesn't maybe not like smart enough to really move at this point

1644
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:38,540
Oh, okay. Yeah, it should take damage. It should actually take some damage

1645
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:45,340
So we roll constitution saving throw here

1646
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:53,240
Yeah, it's not enough. So let's go so I'm gonna take some extra damage now these details. I love extra damage

1647
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,740
There it is. I got it. Oh, no. Yeah, they're all over there. Give me that

1648

He's just gonna concentrate in the beam and he's trying to like wave you back over but you're too afraid

1651
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:16,080
So it's your turn and you're just running from this thing. You can um, can I turn around?

1652
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,660
No, you just like I'm just so scared

1662
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:17,140
what we can do is I think you can try to roll to do at the end of your turn I think because

1663
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:22,460
you're kind of moving outside the cone it's vision cone. Okay. And I know that fear I think

1664
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:26,660
is supposed to technically be like once you're in the cone you're kind of frightened for

1665
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:31,460
the duration but if you move out of line of sight and you have your friends by your side

1666
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,160
I want you to try to roll for this.

1667
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,160
Okay.

1668
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,160
Yeah.

1669
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:39,840
Roll a d20 to see if you can, and we'll see if you beat the wisdom, his wisdom DC here.

1670
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,720
I cast friendship delight.

1671
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,720
Yeah!

1672
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,720
Over.

1673
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,720
Ten.

1674
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,720
Ten.

1675
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,720
What do you add?

1676
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,720
You add your wisdom.

1677
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,720
It says I add my friendship score.

1678
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,840
You don't have a friendship score, man.

1679
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,840
Friendship score is 100.

1680
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,400
Somebody doesn't know anything about D&D.

1681
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,640
Friendship score is 3 because it's 3 friends.

1682
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,640
My wisdom is...

1683
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,640
Oh, fucking shit.

1684
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:05,640
is

1685
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,000
So it's a 12.

1686
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,360
Okay.

1687
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,800
You're still scared of this thing.

1688
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,720
It says you can cast Friendship Delight twice.

1689
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,000
And we're gonna cut to...

1690
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,640
Turn.

1691
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,480
Uh, Dogen?

1692
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,360
Yeah.

1693
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,000
Uh, so now you're bu- you're- you're friend, I guess.

1694
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,200
Am I about to get fucked?

1695
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,640
McElwee is gonna attack.

1696
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,320
Cast Friendship Delight, Dogen!

1697
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:30,120
McElwee does hit, so he's gonna do some damage now.

1698
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,640
Where is that?

1699
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,680
D12.

1700
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:33,800
Oh yeah.

1701
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,800
Okay, not that much damage. Uh, he's gonna attack again.

1702
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,000
That also hits.

1703
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,800
And... damn, okay.

1704
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,900
The troll is not looking too good.

1705
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:48,400
Um, you are up now, uh, Dogen.

1706
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,500
Okay.

1707
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,800
Alright, here goes.

1708
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,700
Here goes.

1709
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,600
I'm casting my Friendship Delight attack over...

1710
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,700
[mimics attack]

1711
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,700
Can you guys teach me that over the microphone real quick?

1712
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,600
Don't do that. Do your regular attack.

1713
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,580
It's it is it says it's my regular attack, but it deals plus 1,000 damage

1714
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:09,260
Okay fine

1715
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:17,040
No, it's not what I that's a 19. Okay. Yeah, that hits the troll. Okay, so this is d8 plus 2 plus

1716
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:22,080
It's not plus 1000 plus 1000 and you know, right? It's plus 1002 and you know

1717
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:29,220
8 and 2 plus 2 no is 10 1,000 and 10 damage 10 damage is very good

1718
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,720
and you should be happy with that.

1719
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,560
So you do 10 damage to this troll.

1720
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,460
- And you know that's 1,010.

1721
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,100
- 1,010 damage was just dealt by me.

1722
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,260
- And now, Patrick Yodar.

1723
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,620
- That's how much damage I just dealt.

1724
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:40,980
Guys, I dealt my damage.

1725
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,500
- Patrick Yodar, you're climbing up the tower.

1726
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,460
Do you wanna stop at any of the locations?

1727
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,300
- No.

1728
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,220
- Cool, yeah, so you're just shooting up this tower.

1729
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,140
- I have a song in my heart.

1730
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,020
- Yeah.

1731
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:55,940
- And I'm gonna make that king cry.

1732
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,500
- Yeah, and with your new gangly legs,

1733
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,420
You're able to get up really fast.

1734
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:01,540
You're doing two steps at a time.

1735
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,380
Yeah, you're doing some real--

1736
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,540
Like someone trying to fuck.

1737
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:07,020
I'm looking at Sticky Fingers

1738
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,540
and he's having a hard time getting up the stairs.

1739
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,380
I'm looking at him like,

1740
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,860
"Grow your legs."

1741
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,540
Oh, shut the fuck up.

1742
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,420
This is awesome.

1743
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,500
Look at this.

1744
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,580
And I just do like the elf--

1745
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,100
Your fucking eye is weird.

1746
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:22,620
You know the elf on the escalator?

1747
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:23,820
Buddy the Elf on the Escalator

1748
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,220
where he's got like the one leg.

1749
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,060
Oh, of course.

1750
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,100
I'm familiar.

1751
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:27,940
It's a good movie.

1752
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:31,020
- Yeah, I do that up like four steps.

1753
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,460
- Yeah, roll a stealth check.

1754
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:36,140
- You know, four steps is really not that many

1755
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,020
to do that up, actually.

1756
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,100
- No.

1757
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,580
- It's actually quite a small amount.

1758
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:41,420
It's like--

1759
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,420
- Actually, it would be pretty impressive

1760
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,120
for someone five, seven to do that.

1761
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:44,960
And it's also--

1762
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,180
- Oh, right, I forgot we're talking about a, yeah, child.

1763
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,940
- But it's also like actually easy to do

1764
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,780
if you're five, seven.

1765
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:50,900
- I forgot we were talking about a garden gnome.

1766
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:51,740
My bad.

1767
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,820
- No, it's not what you're talking about.

1768
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:56,500
- 18.

1769
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,320
- All right, cool.

1770
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:03,740
you're able to do that without a warning of like a well no one notices found the

1771
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:09,240
words almost you keep coming up you're rushing up the steps evil steel this

1772
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:13,160
this thing is coming after you this terrifier shade he's gonna try to slash

1773
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:20,560
at you I don't want to be slashed that was a zero you know zero but he did miss

1774
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:25,960
he did slash at you and missed and now he's gonna like open his mouth and shoot

1775
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,860
His mouth says zero and it doesn't want to.

1776
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:32,680
He's going to shoot some sort of like dark necrotic spell at you.

1777
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,680
What is it?

1778
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,680
Just roll it on the...

1779
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,840
It has to be re-rolled because it landed on the floor.

1780
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,640
So that hits you and...

1781
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,280
Why would you tell him?

1782
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,280
I think it was actually...

1783
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,280
Wait, no.

1784
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,280
It was Caleb's bad.

1785
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,280
It was a 1.8.

1786
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,280
It's actually a .18.

1787
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,280
Yeah.

1788
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,280
Sure.

1789
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,280
No, you don't take that much.

1790
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:57,060
You take 5 damage from this thing as it's sort of chasing you around.

1791
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,160
I can't really do anything because I'm so afraid.

1792
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,680
You're still afraid of it so you're still running from it.

1793
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,320
This is your arc.

1794
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:13,200
But now as it's moving, Barnabus is going to move his moonbeam over and chase it and

1795
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:18,120
he's going to be able to see if this thing can get hit by it or not.

1796
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,920
That thing does not resist the damage.

1797
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,400
It's gonna take a good amount of damage now.

1798
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,880
Oh boy.

1799
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,360
That's ten.

1800
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,720
That's one thousand.

1801
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,720
That's not one thousand.

1802
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,080
That's plus three.

1803
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,920
So it takes another thirteen damage.

1804
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,080
This thing is not looking good.

1805
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:39,920
Even as it's chasing you it's like slowly dying and it is like you know, it's making

1806
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,800
like *roar* like horrible sounds, like terrifying sounds.

1807
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,880
That's only making me more scared.

1808
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:52,880
That's right. Your turn. Roll again. Roll Friendship's Delight again.

1809
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,880

He's just like right next to you, Dogen. He's like, "Hi!"

01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,820
Aye aye aye aye.

1833
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,820
Or 4 actually, sorry.

1834
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,820
Roll 4d10.

1835
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:39,820
Are you doing level 1?

1836
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,820
I mean, describe your kill.

1837
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,820
I'm seeing a 6 and a 7, describe your kill on this thing.

1838
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,820
So here's how it's gonna go down.

1839
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,820
Shane, Jester.

1840
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,820
Basically you tried to scare me and I pretended to be scared.

1841
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:51,820
So that you, I would chase you.

1842
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,820
You would chase me over to over here.

1843
01:28:53,820 --> 01:29:00,000
over here and then I could reverse myself with a friendship and then I could use

1844
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,540
my hand which I have already used. It's nodding. This shade is nodding. Yeah that makes sense.

1845
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:09,240
And basically I'm gonna do this. And I just go like this one time underhand punch right

1846
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:14,900
to his stomach and kill him. He goes "D'oh!" And basically everything happened exactly how I planned.

1847
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:20,460
Do you see the shade sort of fizzle out and dissipate and and shrivel up and

1848
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:25,380
you see the battle around you and you see that as the fog is starting to

1849
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:30,580
clear from this battle, the Pleasure Men and you won this battle. So the shade is

1850
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:35,620
gone for now. So there's no, seems like there's maybe no-- There's no shade.

1851
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:41,420
There's no shade and there's no risk of the Terrifyer coming back right now.

1852
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:51,260
Okay. Now, uh, uh, Patrick, you get to the throne room and you see the king there and

1853
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:56,060
he's like holding his side and he has his son, his like sort of fucked up weird

1854
01:29:56,060 --> 01:30:04,340
half-alive son, and he looks to you two, he goes, "Sticky fingers and are you

1855
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:10,500
Trunchbull?" I'm his nephew. You might have heard of me, I'm a beautiful singer.

1856
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,340
"What are you two doing here?"

1857
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,940
- I look at him, I look at him and I say,

1858
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:20,940
♪ Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do ♪

1859
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:32,500
♪ Understand the things I say ♪

1860
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,580
- What's he doing?

1861
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:37,180
♪ Don't turn away from me ♪

1862
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:42,060
'Cause I've spent half my life out there

1863
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:45,100
Trunchbull is somewhere else singing along with you

1864
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,700
You wouldn't disagree

1865
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:48,540
Do you see me?

1866
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,060
Roll performance check

1867
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,460
Do you like me?

1868
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:55,580
Do you like me standing there?

1869
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:56,700
Seventeen

1870
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,700
Do you know ten?

1871
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:04,060
I'm getting the sense something beautiful is being sung over

1872
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,060
Do you see me?

1873
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:12,300
do you see me does anyone care you see the king

1874
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:19,420
hand on was when I was young cradling his son and he just starts to cry and he's

1875
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:26,260
hearing the song so good and we didn't give it all right Patrick is muted for

1876
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:35,540
the end and he's crying and tears falling on his son's body and he's crying sticky

1877
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:41,660
fingers like looking at you like oh okay like I guess this is working and all

1878
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:46,900
three of you where you are you start to you guys hear my song you guys start to

1879
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:53,420
shimmer yourselves and and from what anyone else can tell you look like sort

1880
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:57,420
of like negative image versions of yourselves standing completely still in

1881
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:04,260
place did you guys hear my son and yes over you have to say over that's why I

1882
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:08,020
didn't respond over all three I didn't say I was planning this song the whole

1883
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:12,380
time that's why I put six before - over I was playing this song the whole time

1884
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:15,620
that's why I had tape on the thing I just wanted you guys to hear my beautiful son

1885
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:21,500
you are now over gave these adventures walking you three are now all together

1886
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:26,300
we're still doing that still doing it and you look sort of like in like this

1887
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:32,140
black completely black realm and you are have like this you look like kind of

1888
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:35,740
like if you're like negative images of yourself in the middle of the field and

1889
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:39,340
we'll go to people's reactions to that but we're with you guys now. You're all

1890
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:43,700
like kind of like gold now. You look like gold shimmery versions of yourself in

1891
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:48,340
this black realm. I open up I like pull like the drawstring on my my I pull my

1892
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:53,960
pants open I look down I go that's what I like. That's what I like to see. And you

1893
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:59,140
see in the distance you see what looks like the scene from when you were at

1894
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,860
Honest Mount Honest doodle and you see

1895
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:05,860
The Prince Jumanji

1896
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:09,980
You see him with the knife you see Sullivan there like lying on the ground scared

1897
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:13,260
He's about to be stabbed 500 times in the leg or so

1898
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:18,520
He thinks and you see the king like gesturing out to the audience like you know

1899
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,460
We're all excited to see it. You don't see yourselves in this scene

1900
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:26,220
You just see everybody else around and as you guys walk towards this scene

1901
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:30,580
It's like it's hard to tell how distance works, but it's it's getting closer. You can tell right

1902
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:37,900
And then you notice that everybody in the scene is completely still except the prince his hand is shaking

1903
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:42,860
As he's holding the knife. He's terrified. He's really really scared

1904
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:48,600
And he's saying he's like I don't know what to do I don't want to

1905
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,520
I'm gonna snap this frog. I don't know what to do do it

1906
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:58,260
Should I do it? Actually never mind, hold on.

1907
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:07,020
So yeah, I'll just tell you, in this realm, you can decide what the prince would have done

1908
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:13,900
in this moment, which will alter things in the story, depending on what it is. It could

1909
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:20,660
be big, could be small, but you're essentially helping him conquer his fear of, in that moment

1910
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:25,340
of I don't know who I am, I don't want to hurt anybody, but I seem like I'm meant to hurt

1911
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:27,340
people, what should I do?

1912
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:31,980
And you can sort of talk with him in like that weird way that you could talk to ghosts in

1913
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:38,260
movies and stuff where it's like you can sort of try to commune with him in this moment.

1914
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:41,380
Well, I'm evil and I hate Sullivan.

1915
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:45,540
So, and I'm evil and I hate Sullivan.

1916
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:46,900
I mean, I'm kinda neutral.

1917
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:50,180
But I god damn do I hate Sullivan.

1918
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:50,680
*Chuckles*

1919
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,620
But, let me just say...

1920
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,120
Jumanji.

1921
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,080
He's like, sort of looking around, right?

1922
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,140
Like, doing the thing he do.

1923
01:34:58,140 --> 01:34:59,800
You pocket that knife...

1924
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,420
You sell that thing.

1925
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:03,780
That thing is worth...

1926
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,140
Ten grand.

1927
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:07,500
That is a ceremonial knife.

1928
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,300
You don't even-

1929
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,800
You- You just gotta pretend to stab that fucker.

1930
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,180
And I leave it in mint condition, you mean?

1931
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,340
You can- I mean...

1932
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:19,500
you leave that shit in mint condition you could sell that thing for ten grand I

1933
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:23,980
mean you know you're Prince already but I mean we can go to the casino together

1934
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:31,460
after this I want you to look at that frog look at him you looking yeah I'm

1935
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:38,340
talking I'm looking Prince you see you see his eyes yeah there's nothing behind

1936
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:42,500
it uh I guess if you say so he's I mean he's

1937
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,540
He's basically nothing. He's a speck of dust.

1938
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:48,660
He's fucking dog shit. Okay?

1939
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,940
He's lower than fucking dirt.

1940
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:52,440
Just like the-

1941
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,440
Oh my god, I was married to him!

1942
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,440
*laughter*

1943
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,440
*laughter*

1944
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:04,440
As you're saying all this, the camera's like just lingering on Sullivan's frozen face.

1945
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,440
Look, he can't-

1946
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,440
And then you say the marriage thing and it just like goes right to your face.

1947
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,440
It's like, oh god!

1948
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:17,160
Sullivan, move your face if you're not just a complete piece of shit who deserves to die.

1949
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,160
Well, I feel like it's settled.

1950
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:22,700
So I should stab him 500 times and kill him?

1951
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:29,160
No, you should pocket the knife and pretend to stab him, and then we can go to the casino and turn that 10 grand...

1952
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:32,040
We can turn that 10 grand into 20 million.

1953
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,040
Dogen, is there anything you want him to do?

1954
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,840
I don't know.

1955
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,640
Well, I...

1956
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,080
He does suck really bad.

1957
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:47,280
But also I'm married to him.

1958
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:51,280
So I kind of wish I wasn't married to him anymore.

1959
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:58,320
So I think, you know, I'll just let you do with that what you will.

1960
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,200
Both of you roll persuasion checks.

1961
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,200
Okay, your dice.

1962
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:06,200
We're rolling at the same time, baby.

1963
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,200
Oh yeah.

1964
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,760
Okay, so mine is this one.

1965
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,360
is the black dice because you're doing the evil roll.

1966
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,800
Or the angel and devil on his shoulder.

1967
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,760
Alright, you said it, not me.

1968
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,760
What?

1969
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:18,760
Hold on, can we cut that out?

1970
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:19,760
Please?

1971
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,760
Roll!

1972
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,760
Please can we cut that out?

1973
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:22,760
Oh!

1974
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,760
Well hold on, it changed his to a 9.

1975
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,760
But it was still lower.

1976
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:25,760
It was still lower.

1977
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,760
It was a 9.

1978
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,760
Well, evil.

1979
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,760
What did you have?

1980
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,760
You had a 9?

1981
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,760
I had a 9.

1982
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:31,760
I don't think I have very good persuasion.

1983
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:32,760
Oh my god, did you guys just tie?

1984
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,760
Oh no wait, your persuasion is crazy high.

1985
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:34,760
Mine is 8.

1986
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,760
Yeah, plus 8.

1987
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,760
My persuasion is...

1988
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

1989
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,760
My persuasion is...

1990
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,760
Oh my god, what's your persuasion?

1991
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,760
Oh my god, this is pretty intense.

1992
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,760
My persuasion is +2.

1993
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,760
Oh my god, they tied!

1994
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,760
Alright, I guess it's a re-roll.

1995
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1996
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,760
I'm staring at...

1997
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,760
They're like both...

1998
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,760
Yeah, he's not sure what to do.

1999
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,760
They're like...

2000
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,760
I'm looking at Sullivan,

2001
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,760
and I look at the ring on my finger,

2002
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,600
and I'm thinking and I look at Prince Jumajanga and I go, "Yeah, kill him."

2003
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,600
[Laughter]

2004
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,600
Oh man.

2005
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,600
[Laughter]

2006
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,100
Okay.

2007
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:20,100
Sullivan's never died in any of these campaigns.

2008
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,600
That's not a good move.

2009
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,100
He looks to the frog.

2010
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,600
It's what the characters would do.

2011
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:32,100
And he looks up at his father and you see the knife go down and we fade out of this.

2012
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,100
[Fade out]

2013
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:35,100
Oh, I wanted to see him fucking die.

2014
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:41,760
And we return to the real world and you see the prince. You see the prince now

2015
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:49,340
fully formed and you see him and he looks different. It looks like he did

2016
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:55,860
something that he'll never forget that he did. He's a terrifier isn't he? No. And you see the

2017
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:59,980
king who's so happy now and you see the troops in the battle it's sort of

2018
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:04,600
Peter Dow, the idiots and why me, fuck you, really turned the tide.

2019
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,600
Wait, hold on, was that the real Sullivan?

2020
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,600
And you turn to your left.

2021
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,600
Just let him talk for a minute here.

2022
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,600
Oh my god.

2023
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:17,600
And wherever Sullivan was, he's not there anymore.

2024
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:27,600
[Laughter]

2025
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,840
- Steevel, Steevel, I mean, no change really around you.

2026
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,800
- Barely even noticed.

2027
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,320
- But the war, the fight is over.

2028
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,380
The king, his army has been defeated.

2029
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:43,800
And, you know, the ending here is really

2030
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,360
about reconciling this, figuring out how to,

2031
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,960
what does the king wanna do?

2032
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,240
What does the pleasure men wanna do?

2033
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:55,360
Brave lions, there's a lot here to figure out, I think.

2034
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,640
Is that what you were gonna say?

2035
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:00,760
i look at my my hand to everyone now

2036
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,200
chilling

2037
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,720
grace

2038
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,200
the acts

2039
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:08,000
and

2040
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
and i don't have to pay shit

2041
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,360
so to be given at least his inventory

2042
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,400
the business is so it is in my life at the present up the will make you kill

2043
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,000
the frog

2044
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:24,000
but

2045
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,580
I think we could we could end there because what I was gonna do is I'll write something that's like a bit more

2046
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:45,520
And so for now our story ends the battle was over

2047
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:52,560
With the return of the Prince Jumanji King Nod Wars madness was no more and he ordered his men to step down

2048
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:59,040
All members of St. Anthony's parish were immediately excommunicated from the Church of the Terrifier,

2049
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:04,040
which now had to earn the trust of the people, as did the King.

2050
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:08,040
See, Nardwuar refused to relinquish his throne.

2051
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,040
But he knew that his temporary madness had forever tarnished his once sterling reputation,

2052
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,040
at least with those outside of Gal Gadot,

2053
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,040
and so in an effort to maintain peace and make amends,

2054
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,700
as to the demands of his challengers heretofore unthinkable.

2055
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:28,140
For one, the dreaded pleasure men were now full members of King Nardwar's court.

2056
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:32,540
Their worship of the minor god Discharge and their vision for a vile world built on the

2057
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:37,140
principles of pleasure at all cost became almost customary and in some places bordered

2058
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:38,800
on the prosaic.

2059
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,100
While debauchery is often appreciated in the Terrifier kingdom, the differences between

2060
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:47,820
the worshippers of Discharge and the church of the Terrifier spelled a cultural tension

2061
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:53,060
to come, especially since the pleasure men were not so concerned with whether or not one

2062
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:58,540
was terrified or born like the church was, nor did they stage a destabilizing coup or

2063
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:03,500
try to revive a god who would have been really upset about being revived.

2064
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,820
Meanwhile the brave lions were granted sovereign territory in the western part of the kingdom

2065
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:11,500
in a new land called "It is real".

2066
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:15,900
Perhaps a step back in their revolutionary fervor, but for many scaredy cats this was

2067
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:16,900
enough.

2068
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:21,820
Of course, hardliners still demanded more, and continued to organize and militarize around

2069
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:27,380
the goal of the total annihilation of their former slave owners.

2070
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:34,020
Sticky Fingers gang, meanwhile, have been given full pardon for their crimes, and a position

2071
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:38,740
in the kingdom as members of the clandestine organization, the Night Terrors.

2072
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:42,140
To what end, who knows?

2073
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:48,140
Fuck You, meanwhile, ran the theme park idiot land, Stupidville, where he was finally given

2074
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,980
his wizarding tower of terror.

2075
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:56,460
While his home doubled as a ride, he was pleased as one could be, acting as a surrogate father

2076
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:59,620
and leader to hundreds of idiot slaves.

2077
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:06,060
Ola, meanwhile, still helped fund and advise on the theme park, but she also became business

2078
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:12,640
partners and more with Thorax, whose gang grew in size and now acted as a private security

2079
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,060
force for her conglomerate.

2080
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:19,820
She used her considerable influence and association with the three heroes of Trebuchet Village

2081
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:25,900
to expand her business and the influence of the city of Gal Gadot, whose ruler, the tiefling

2082
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:32,820
Gorgonzola, was now poised to make a move on a weakened Nardwar.

2083
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:35,580
The Prince Jumanji was forever changed.

2084
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:41,780
The decision he made in the Terrifier Realm turned him into an ice cold warrior prince.

2085
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:44,260
Everything his father thought he wanted him to be.

2086
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:48,620
He'll never forget the time he spent with the three adventurers and the lessons they

2087
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:52,900
taught him about what it means to be a man.

2088
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:59,340
As for those three adventurers, Patrick, Dogen, and Evil, well they're heroes.

2089
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:03,220
They ended a war that could have torn the kingdom apart before it even began.

2090
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:08,500
They halted the resurrection of a beloved evil god who would have probably killed everyone

2091
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:14,340
were he brought back, at least according to one particular creature.

2092
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:18,820
Each of them were made minor lords of the Terrafire Kingdom, given a plot of land and

2093
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:20,740
tons of gold.

2094
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:24,620
They had their theme park that gave them a tidy profit, and they had their friends from

2095
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:30,580
Whippet Woods to Gal Gadot and Trebuchet Village and the Walrus.

2096
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:35,780
They had plenty of company and love.

2097
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:40,980
Something else is always on the horizon for these three, because adventurers can't sit

2098
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,820
still for long.

2099
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:47,100
The legendary Trunchbull, who finally gave his nephew the slow dance he needed to grow

2100
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:53,980
up, passed away peacefully, surrounded by his beloved friends and his white women.

2101
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:59,420
His parting gift to Patridge was a galleon, one he christened the White Woman of the Sea

2102
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:02,420
Long, long ago.

2103
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:06,420
The promise of a pirate's life is almost too great to resist.

2104
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:10,920
So only time will tell what the boys do with that.

2105
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:14,320
Much has changed in the Terrifier Kingdom,

2106
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,320
since our three heroes were called, or rather launched,

2107
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:21,920
into action by the force of ten thousand dragons.

2108
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,420
Many mysteries still remain.

2109
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:27,020
Mount Hodus Doodle is still missing.

2110
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:31,340
Spirits that litter planet E-Bomb still confound.

2111
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:37,140
And while our hero's place in the surreptitious trappings of capital-D Destiny seem assured,

2112
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:42,340
the meaning of this and its relationship to powers beyond the veil remains as elusive

2113
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:45,740
as ever.

2114
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:49,540
Only one thing feels certain in every single respect.

2115
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:55,180
There's a frog-shaped hole in the universe.

2116
01:45:55,180 --> 01:46:00,140
And Lord knows who's gonna fill that hole.

2117
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:02,500
Will it be you?

2118
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,180
Are you gonna do it?

2119
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:14,060
Are you gonna fill the hole?

2120
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:14,980
The End.
