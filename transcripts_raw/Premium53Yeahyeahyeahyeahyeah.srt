- He's gotta get it out somehow.

62
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280

63
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,760

00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,120
- No, pain hurts.

65
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,240
- He doesn't have it bottled up.

66
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,340
In your sleep you go, "Ahh."

67
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
I do?

68
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,340
No.

69
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,340
Oh.

70
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,340
But you do breathe really funny.

71
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,340
Did you fall asleep earlier?

72
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
Yeah, he was asleep.

73
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,500
He was going like, "Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft."

74
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,460
Jan, I heard you snoring in the other room and just started laughing so hard when I talked

75
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,460
to you and woke you up.

76
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,460
Yeah.

77
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,460
Yeah.

78
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,460
It is.

79
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,460
He does have a funny breathing.

80
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,460
I have sleep apnea.

81
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

82
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,020
Sleep apnea, it doesn't sound like you have sleep apnea though.

83
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,260
It just sounds like you're breathing funny.

84
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
Sleep apnea is like, "Kh, kh, kh."

85
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
It sounds like you have rocks in your mouth.

86
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,260
No, you do like you do like

87
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm in a really deep sleep

88
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Does he wake you up at night when he sleeps because of his snoring? No, no, he didn't last night

89
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,460
At least I had a friend in high school

90
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,700
Who would stay at my house and I would have to go sleep like in the living room because he's snoring was so beard

91
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,940
Yeah, I have sleep apnea - I sound like I'm gonna choke. Well, yeah, I used to in high school

92
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,020
I would fall asleep on the couch after school and my parents always said that they were afraid I was dying because I would fall asleep

93
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,020
and they go like

94
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Because I have really bad sleep.

95
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,020
You snore and then in the middle of the snore you're just like

96
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,020
*snorting*

97
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
This is why you two are stupid and I'm smart.

98
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
I get full oxygen in the night.

99
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Yeah, that turns you completely red.

100
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,020
Yeah, that's right.

101
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
No, I just get hot when I sleep.

102
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,020
I burn a hole in the fucking sheets, dude.

103
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,020
That's why you keep the AC on all fucking night.

104
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,020
I gotta have it be cold, bro.

105
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,020
It sucks. It's the opposite of hell, actually.

106
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
Yeah, it is the opposite of hell.

107
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,020
You guys can buy a hotel if you want.

108
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,460

there would be no ice cream man. That's true. Yeah. What kind of parole job are you going

169
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,580
to get then? I told you guys about my mom chasing away the ice cream man because she

170
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,380
didn't want to give us money to go see the ice cream man. So she chased him away? She

171
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,680
Said no soliciting to him. She pointed at the sign in our neighborhood.

172
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,040
His entire job is soliciting.

173
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,540
I know.

174
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,040
Yeah.

175
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,700
And she told him that he couldn't come into our neighborhood and everybody in the fucking neighborhood was mad at her.

176
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,460
You guys ever get in trouble for loitering?

177
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
No.

178
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,960
No.

179
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,380
I never got in trouble for loitering.

180
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,080
I got in trouble for loitering at the dollar store when I was a kid, dude.

181
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,920
That kid, he just looked me up and down, he's like, "You don't even have a dollar."

182
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,420
[laughter]

183
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,580
I can just tell by looking at you, you don't even have one fucking dollar you can spend.

184
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,060
I was like, "Damn, he got me, bro.

185
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Kicked me out.

186
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
Damn, fucked up."

187
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
I, uh...

188
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
Oh, yeah?

189
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Dude.

190
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,060
Yeah?

191
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,060
Really?

192
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
Wow, dude.

193
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
I've been practicing telekinesis.

194
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
I can't believe...

195
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,060
Or telepathy.

196
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Yeah.

197
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
And that's a new segment on the show.

198
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,060
Yeah.

199
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Where I do...

200
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,060
You beaming bits and stuff.

201
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Yeah.

202
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
I've been practicing telekinesis.

203
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
I can't believe...

204
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Or telepathy.

205
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Yeah.

206
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,060
And that's a new segment on the show.

207
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,700
bits into my head. And they're it's the things we can't say on the show. Yeah

208
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,180
that's right. Yeah. Patrick has a lot of those. Yeah those are a lot of them. And they're all

209
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,060
about Cameron it's just me and Caleb talking to each other through telepathy. Cameron is so

210
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,060
beautiful oh my god. God look at his pants right now. Look at those legs. I wish I could live in

211
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,940
his pocket. I wish I could live in your pocket and you'd take me out. I wish you could sneak me into the movies.

212
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Oh man, I wish I could live in his pocket and organize his coins for him.

213
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Do you want to organize my coins for him?

214
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
I'll have pennies in this pocket.

215
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,940
I'll have a system where I can run across his legs and go to the other pockets in his pants.

216
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,940
If two of us had to be...

217
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
I'm going to put a tunnel into my pants for you.

218
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,940
If two of us had to be really small and live on the other one, I would pick you and me live on Cameron.

219
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Yep.

220
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,940
You're doing a bad job.

221
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:42,940
a

222
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,980
just like smaller than Cameron's so I would definitely live in Cameron's pockets.

223
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,900
I think Patrick, I think you could definitely live in Patrick's pants or shirt.

224
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
Also they don't make clothes that small so you don't have to be naked.

225
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,580
Patrick also always wears a beanie.

226
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
That's true.

227
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,580
You could live in this like folded up part right here and stick your head out.

228
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,580
You get way too hot bro.

229
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Yeah.

230
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,500
I do wear very loose pants too.

231
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Yeah that's what I'm saying.

232
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,820
You want me to tape myself to the inside of your pant leg?

233
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Maybe, I don't know.

234
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,400
Like you're sneaking some of that jazz cabbage into the airport.

235
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,480
pants I could definitely sneak some some of my homemade raisinets into the movies

236
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,640
I like them better they're dark chocolate they don't have the right size

237
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,160
they don't have a white chocolate listen they don't sell it in the right amount

238
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,400
what they have there it's too much for me I want two or three raisinets I'm not

239
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,080
gonna spend money on a whole box if I just have to throw them away true I can

240
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,400
only I put salt on I had I had two or three that's earlier good chocolate

241
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,680
Raisinette with salt. That sounds really good. Yeah, I want one big raisinette. Yeah, that's how you know

242
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,680
You're growing up as when your favorite candy becomes raisin

243
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,920
But I'm gonna smuggle one really long pretzel stick into the theater up my whole leg

244
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:05,240
Excuse me, sir. Someone just hits it with a baseball bat

245
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Yeah, we know

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,620
Okay, we know you saw this big red soul just sitting down at the movie

247
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,880
theaters and putting your leg up on the seat in front of you to try and like

248
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,120
pull the pretzel stick out of your pant leg.

249
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,600
Flies for you pull that you are sure it's spreading like trying to get my

250
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,400
pretzel out of my leg. When I was a kid, I would sneak in two ciabatta rolls

251
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,480
that I got from Costco into the movies and I would eat them with mustard. Why?

252
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,120
Because I didn't want to spend money on a pretzel.

253
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,120
So I went and I saw Chris Rock's Top 5 and I ate two ciabatta rolls.

254
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,520
That's a weird snack.

255
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,120
No, it's not. It's bread.

256
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,620
What's the difference between that and a pretzel?

257
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,320
Pretzel has like a... pretzel's like got more salt on it.

258
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
Ciabatta is like...

259
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,320
That's what the mustard was for.

260
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,520
Yeah, but if it was a pretzel, that's a lot different.

261
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Why?

262
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,820
Because pretzels are made to put on mustard and ciabatta is just like bread.

263
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,060
You're just eating bread and mustard. That's weird.

264
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,060
That's what literally what a pretzel is.

265
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,820
Yeah, but it's different.

266
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,420
Just because of the shape?

267
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,820
Because of the shape and the density of the bread?

268
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,420
You are a victim of marketing.

269
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
The density of the bread.

270
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
Marketing has convinced you that pretzels are different.

271
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,060
No, ciabatta...

272
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,220
A ciabatta is an airy bread.

273
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,820
It's not, no. Yeah, because that's why I wouldn't eat it with just mustard,

274
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,140
because it's too airy.

275
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,820
But it has different pockets that the mustard can get into once you open it.

276
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,900
Yeah, you put maybe a ciabatta sandwich, like a sandwich with ciabatta bread.

277
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,740
You told me to bring a goddamn sandwich. I'm not, I mean, I'm not a criminal.

278
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,300
I'm not gonna bring a sandwich into the movies.

279
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,500
Speaking of criminal, uh, what, how many beers do you think you could sneak into a movie theater?

280
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,460
Oh, I've snuck two in before.

281
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,580
I've never snuck beer into the movie theater and I never,

282
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,740
didn't have that thought until just now.

283
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,540
Yeah, I never have either.

284
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,100
Really?

285
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,340
Yeah.

286
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,420
I felt like that's too big of a crime. Like, I felt like if I did get,

287
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,540
like if you get caught with soda it's like ah throw that away but if it's beer

288
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,660
they're like okay we have to call the cops. I mean I guess if you're like a kid

289
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,380
I would bring beer into AMC Lowe's in Boston all the time.

290
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,740
But it's really expensive. It's like a $12 cocktail there.

291
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,300
You know what I mean? It's like you're allowed to have beer in

292
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,860
there. Maybe not your beer but... That was like the perfect time

293
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,820
when MoviePass first came out and we were all going to school right next to

294
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,700
the movie theater. I would just bring... I didn't get movie pass. You didn't get movie pass?

295
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,740
Oh man. Movie pass was so sick dude. I'd get like just super high and watch like the Curse of La

296
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:48,660
Llorona. What's the Curse of La Llorona? It was one of the Conjuring Universe movies.

297
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,780
I just watched like every superhero movie that came out that I didn't...

298
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,580
like I don't walk in... because it never fit perfectly with my classes, I would just walk

299
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,820
walk in forty five minutes in a movie, crush two beers and then go back to

300
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,820
class. Yeah, yeah, just I just yeah just walk in like like twenty minutes into

301
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,100
John Wick three. Yeah, and I didn't like it. I didn't just go back to work at

302
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,220
the end. I think I did it between. Oh, there was one movie. I don't remember

303
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,420
what movie it was, but there was one movie that I went to go see with

304
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,740
MoviePass three times, because I walked in like in the last thirty minutes

305
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,660
once, and then I went for the like middle hour, and then I went for the

306
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:31,540
beginning. So sick. MoviePass was the best. It ruled, dude. Yeah, I wish I'd taken advantage

307
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,340
of that. It just gives you a special card, too. The craziest way to do it. We give you

308
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,340
a special debit card that we're going to put money onto whenever you want to see a movie.

309
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:48,220
Also being like, "Yeah, that's going to make us money." Right. Five bucks a month. I fucking

310
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,500
love that app developers like that are so stupid that they do shit.

311
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,340
it's such a gift that we get like movie pass and Quibi because any if you ask any

312
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,260
person like on the street is like oh do you think this would work they just go

313
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,500
like no yeah but like these people who have like billions of dollars are like I

314
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,940
can make this work right and they look great it'll get a bubble of like and I

315
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,100
did Jeffrey Katzenberg just enough the Quibi guy just like downsized his home

316
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,500
which is awesome but uh they'll for the only fucking movie that movie pass

317
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,780
produced was Gotti. MoviePass produced that? Yeah I think I'd have to look that up but I

318
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,420
remember because there was like an exclusive I went and saw Gotti with Ben

319
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,560
and Kieran because Gotti was a MoviePass like exclusive like you could just go

320
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,820
see Gotti or something I think that was the deal. MoviePass bought a stake in Gotti.

321
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,660
I didn't have it I paid to see Gotti but I think Ben had it. MoviePass really

322
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,540
really wants you to see Gotti. Yeah. Yeah. MoviePass backed I guess. Yeah. And that

323
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,700
was the fucking like that is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. What is the

324
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,380
what is the thing that like... It says that they manipulated the audience score for

325
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,580
Gotti. Yeah. MoviePass did. He tells like he goes through like all the different

326
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,940
boroughs at some point. Oh yeah. He's like it's a Stacey Keach and Stacey Keach is

327
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:18,860
like the window respect to the family you got to get to five boroughs the Bronx

328
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:26,340
Manhattan I don't know the five Brooklyn Brooklyn Staten Island Queens and

331
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,300
of these five boroughs. These are the five neighborhoods I've never been to. But now

332
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,100
that I've heard about them I suppose I will. I am the gangster from New Rochelle.

333
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,780
That is what they've called me. I guess I will get those five boroughs now. Thank

334
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:56,020
you very much. That's what I have to do. Was he from New Rochelle? No. No. I was just doing a

335
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,500
goof. He's just doing a funny joke. Yeah. Dude, I just can't tell what he's serious.

336
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Actually the whole movie is about how Gotti is the, how he came up from New

337
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,100
Rochelle yeah I came up from the slums of New Rochelle yeah he lived above a

338
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,540
bakery

339
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,220
it was working hard living there

340
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:30,500
yeah my mom sometimes you forget to DVR sex in the city extremely tough. When she forgot to

341
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,160
fucking DVR sex in their city you knew the next day that was gonna be fucking

342
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,660
hell. At one point we had to downgrade to androids. Stuff. Green text you don't know what a

343
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:48,500
green text message is. Being on the sending end of a green text message. God, the disrespect.

344
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,500
And that's why I joined a mafia. That's why I joined the mafia. I learned about the five

345
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,580
bureaus. Basically everything after that was kind of smooth sailing and then I

346
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,080
And then I bought an Amazing Dominoes franchise.

347
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,880
I bought an Amazing Dominoes franchise, I got to retire.

348
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,180
And that's the story of me.

349
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
And that's the story.

350
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Sean, God.

351
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,180
There's never gonna be another man like me for another thousand years.

352
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,180
And I'm not throwing away my shot.

353
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:23,660
There's a, oh fuck, there's like a part in that movie, it's one of the most confusing

354
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,060
movies I think I've ever seen, because there's a scene in that movie.

355
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm gonna make Patrick watch Primer.

356
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,580
Yeah, yeah, that'd be pretty fun or sick. I feel like I would understand primer more than Gotti

357
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,940
But

358
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,660
There's a scene in that movie. It's like supposed to be

359
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,180
1985 something like that supposed to be the 80s

360
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,220
They're playing that song because Pitbull did the soundtrack and they're playing sense to gangsta

361
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,180
Yeah, exactly John Travolta Pitbull to the two gangsters in the five boroughs. Yeah

362
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,020
Two things that love to fuck young boys

363
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,540
That's what a gangsta is. But they're using, they use fireworks footage that's like

364
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,180
clearly stock footage and then it's playing that Pitbull song that's like

365
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:18,940
"Hey, yay, yay, yay!" And it's John Gotti yelling at the cops to not shut down the block party.

366
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,180
And he's like, that's how they show that the neighborhood loves him.

367
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,820
because he kept the party going he was a good guy I think John Gotti was a good

368
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,980
swag yeah yeah he's cool yeah yeah did you guys see the Netflix documentary

369
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,840
about the mafia the like series where they have like it's just like them

370
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,780
interviewing I saw a mafia.com. I don't remember that. I don't remember that.

371
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,580

373
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,780
Thanos even sounds like Josh Brolin as he died.

374
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Hey it's me, it's Thanos.

375
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,220
Oh no, I got mad, you gotta get mad at my stones.

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,220

377
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Oh.

379
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
This my weird glove.

380
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,660
I like my lady's glove to wash the dishes cause the water is too hot.

381
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,060
The water in the dishes is too hot.

382
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,500
I think I look cool with my glove.

383
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Do I?

384
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,700
Does the glove make me look weird?

385
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,860
You can tell my glove looks weird.

386
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,540
I love that he just like had like a he just looked like a guy. Yeah. Yeah. It's such a funny design

387
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,900
for an alien. Yeah. Like just a guy just like the biggest guy. I don't know. Big guy. Purple

388
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:49,140
lines on him. It's fucked up that he got to be Thanos and uh Cable. Yeah not not okay. Yeah.

389
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:55,620
Who's Cable? Cable's uh Deadpool's brother. Is he his brother? No. I didn't know he's his brother.

390
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,860
No. Cable. I didn't know he was his brother. Is Deadpool a Marvel thing? Yeah. Is it? He's not in

391
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,020
in those movies though is it? No, but there's a part of the X-Men yeah.

392
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:10,840
Is that like a... Shut up! We don't care about comic book movies Caleb. I just want to learn from you

393
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,820
nerds. Well Cable is the son of Jean Grey and he's from the future. Yeah he's from

394
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:22,740
the future. Caleb is the son of David. Mm-hmm he's the son of Jean Grey and Cyclops and he was

395
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,500
transported to the future. Damn I want to see that hot kid. Yeah. Whoa. He looked good.

396
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:34,980
damn he's got a he's got a virus he's got a he's got a crazy eye yeah his eye is

397
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,940
crazy cuz he's constantly fighting off a virus in his body with telekinesis

398
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,660
that's what I do yeah yeah yeah the designs from that era of comics are so

399
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,800
fucking yeah I think so like so late yeah they're like yeah he has a he has an

400
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,720
eye that shoots electricity cuz he's got a virus and he has to fight it with

401
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,060
psychic powers all the time so yeah wise I look and Deadpool are both Rob Lee

402
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,660
field I think yeah yeah I was like what if there's a guy who was the ugliest guy

403
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,940
ever and he looked like Freddy Krueger but he was funny you wore a mask and he

404
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,900
could talk he's dressed like a red ninja yeah and he has 16 bandoliers and guess

405
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,260
guess what he likes Mexico Stanley getting like high on cigarettes there's

406
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:21,380
a guy with a funny balloon and he's evil basically that was the 70s more yeah

407
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,660
That was all it was how about this?

408
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:30,100
It's a character called the blob and he's a fat guy half and he runs half Japanese man

409
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:38,380
How about that what about a character named the frog he's called the Suzuki sailor

410
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:47,440
And he is a beautiful little wife and her name is the psychic woman and her name is Stan Lena

411
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,580
What about what about Chinese man Stan we already did that like three times come on

412
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:59,140
Yeah, dude, I'm so glad he's dead

413
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,060
Why yeah cuz there's gonna be no more cool. He has a piece. There's gonna be no cool cameos to look out for

414
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm gonna dress up. They should they should send Johnny Knoxville as fucking

415
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Durban bad grandpa Irving's this man do the yeah, he looks like Stan Lee

416
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,940
He does look enough like Stan Lee.

417
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
And he sounds like him too.

418
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,500
They could just fucking keep doing it forever.

419
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
They should play-

420
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,660
But then Johnny Knoxville will die.

421
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
Yeah, that's true.

422
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
And then it'll be a whole thing.

423
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
The only-

424
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
It's the Stan Lee curse.

425
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,500
The only movie that would make sense for Irving Sisman to be in would be Deadpool 3.

426
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,540
Do you think they're gonna do like a Stan Lee biopic movie?

427
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Yeah.

428
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Oh, for sure.

429
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
Yeah.

430
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
Are you kidding?

431
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
Who do you think will play him?

432
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
Johnny Knoxville.

433
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,820
Johnny Knoxville would be a really good pick.

434
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,420
I think they're gonna cast me.

435
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Really?

436
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
No.

437
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,660
have to wait a few years. They can do it like boyhood and then just do it from now until

438
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
you're 90.

439
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,660
That's true.

440
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Right?

441
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,460
And then they kill you with a pillow at the end of the movie.

442
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Yeah.

443
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,860
And then they look at the camera, this is how it actually happened. Directed by Oliver

444
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,300
Stone.

445
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,340
What if Deadpool had a cameo in the Stanley biopic?

446
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
Oh my fucking God.

447
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,340
No!

448
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340
And he acted as if he was Stanley.

449
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,340
It wouldn't make any sense!

450
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
It's too meta! Don't fucking do it!

451
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,940
That's like a Krabby Patty having a cameo in the Krusty Krab movie.

452
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
Yeah.

453
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,940
It would never make sense.

454
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,780
It's like Spongebob living in Squidward's house.

455
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
I can't even process that.

456
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,780
It's like the ugly monkey having a fucking cameo in a movie.

457
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,780
It's like the ugly monkey being beautiful.

458
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,780
It wouldn't happen.

459
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,780
It's like putting the ugly monkey in a dress and giving it a makeover

460
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
and you do find out that it's actually hot.

461
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,780
It's like Princess Elsa pimple popper pregnant dress up game for flashgames.com.

462
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
That's a good game though actually.

463
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,020
though actually. That was the craze in the 90s with the makeover scenes. What? How they

464
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:52,140
had like every... In the 90s they would have like a movie where it's like, "Well this girl's

465
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:59,200
a nerd. We're gonna make her, the football team's gonna make her hot." I feel like, yeah.

466
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,980
Do they not still do that? Not as much. They did it in the duff. Yeah, they did do it in

467
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:11,340
the Duff but but so okay so they did it in the Duff so that's one where it where

482
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:05,300
they they figured that they needed him around till the end of the first phase of the Marvel movies

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,980
moon what do you what do you think they're gonna CGI Chadwick Boseman into

488
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,860
something I think they are I think what they're gonna do they're gonna have a

489
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,580
new if they don't cancel the second Black Panther movie and if they haven't

490
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,660
already filmed it my theory is they're gonna have a new guy like a new kid take

491
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,780
up the mantle of Black Panther like like a Spider-Man style like coming-of-age

492
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,700
thing and he's gonna have you know the ancestor scene in Black Panther yeah

493
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,920
they're gonna have an ancestor scene with a CGI like Chadwick Boseman who's

494
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,500
like half panther didn't he get destroyed by Thanos he got destroyed by

495
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:05,780
colon cancer yeah there's nothing much else to add huh yeah yeah he did get

496
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,180
just snapped yeah yeah well yeah that I think Black Panther did get they all

497
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,220
come back though at the end yeah but it's just funny that they had like such

498
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,780
an easy out right and they were like it'll definitely live yeah it'll be

499
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,940
fine no way this guy they put him they put him through so much like work to

500
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,100
like stay ripped yeah yeah because they probably paid him like the

501
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,260
marvel million dollars and his family will be fine now that he's dead yeah you

502
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:38,100
the Marvel like like getting actors ripped routine is so scary to me like

503
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,660
just seeing like Kumail Nanjiani now it's he also clearly just was like

504
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,000
fucking shooting HGH into his yeah yeah they'll definitely like like fucking like

505
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
filed his jaw shit fucked yeah no it's unless it always looked like that no and

506
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,140
you could never tell you had a pyramid head up yeah he looks insane now yeah do

507
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,380
you think they put jaw fillers in I think I think I did think that it's

508
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,220
got a big HGH I just imagine like a fucking like like they've got like a

509
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,180
Joseph Mengele lab like underground with Walt Disney's frozen head with like

510
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,740
fucking robot arms like like putting like hacks and they're like spreading

511
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,100
out there they're fucking their cages

512
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,300
He's built yeah they have Walt Disney built like the the little spider guy

513
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:35,440
from Toy Story yeah it's just a head on like fucking erector sets.

514
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,880
He's like Gert Russel. Gert Russel. Gert Russel. Come here. Come here.

515
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,500
He looks like fucking he looks like Hitler from Wolfenstein.

516
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,180
Yeah they bring him fucking they bring him Tom Holland to like prep for the

517
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,920
the spider man movie. Kurt Russell,

518
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:00,400
just gives a plastic surgery to look exactly like child Kurt Russell. He

519
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,420
must have been no Disney. No all right, we're gonna have to take it

520
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,440
bring me Gert Gert. He must have been as ecstatic when he found out that

521
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,240
Kurt Russell was in an M.C.U. When he found out that Kurt Russell was a

522
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,120
real guy and just a name he yeah, he was like I have a new idea

523
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,340
for a character Kurt Russell

524
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,260
flat lines right there.

525
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,140
(laughter)

526
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,540
- Well, I guess we gotta hire this kid.

527
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,540
- A new Disney princess named Kurt Russell.

528
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,500
That's the plan.

529
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,840
- Yeah.

530
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,780
- And then he died.

531
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,460
- And then he died.

532
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,300
- That was sad.

533
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,420
- He died after Mary Poppins, right?

534
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,700
- Yeah, the heartbreak killed him.

535
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,780
- Yeah.

536
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,060
No, he heard Dick Van Dyke's voice and was like,

537
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,260
God damn it, we gotta fucking,

538
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,980
shoot me, shoot me in the head.

539
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,460
(laughter)

540
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,660

541
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,020
- Yeah.

542
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,140
He knew people just keep complaining about it forever.

543
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,700
That's so, dude that is so funny.

544
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,380
He could do that fucking.

545
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,220
Hello, Mary Poppins.

546
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,060

I'm the British chimney sweep.

549
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,500
Also the fact that his character's a chimney sweep.

550
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,340
Dude, it's really good.

551
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,240
It's like a character that like,

552
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,900
also like the guy who thinks that's a British accent,

553
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,500
that guy came up with that character.

554
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,340
Yeah, yeah.

555
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,020
He's like, uh-uh, British guy,

556
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,500

Hello.

558
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
He walks into every seat and he goes, "Hello!"

559
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
Yeah, he's always sepia-toned and shit.

560
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
I don't fucking know, dude.

561
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460

00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
He's got 25% soot on his face.

563
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,460
But God-- oh, I forgot to unplug the music.

656
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,580
sharpest knives made out of whatever videos sharpest knife made out of cookie

657
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:48,280
sharp as a knife made out of my hand. I'm just cutting a banana with a cookie. I don't do

658
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,180
anything to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those sand pit, those whetstones that they

659
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,780
use in those videos, I want to get all of them. There's something about like

660
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,140
Korean artisans on YouTube that make 50 minute videos. That guy's Japanese.

661
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,060
Well I'm obviously talking about someone different then. 50 minute videos

662
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:13,860
that where it's just like them like turning a bike into a car very very

663
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:19,180
slowly and it's in the ASMR is in is involved there's no ASMR in these videos

664
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,060
yeah it's cool how ASMR ASMR kind of just devolved into anything that makes you

665
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:29,580
calm yeah like what it actually like started out with was like like a woman

666
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,180
whispering into like an ear shaped one original no no originally it was anything

667
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,020
that makes you calm yeah it was like the first ones and then it turned into porn

668
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,220
yeah it was like ASMR videos about somebody and they're like I'm a baby and

669
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,780
I want to make you come yeah yeah yeah now it was always like yeah I'm a baby

670
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,740
on a spaceship yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the fucking fairies video have you seen

671
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:57,140
the fairies one no I'm your teacher in the dungeon yeah and I'm gonna buy you

672
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,220
groceries that was the one of the best way was this guy Tony Bamboni and he's

673
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,300
like, "No, no paparazzi, please. I'm just a fairy in the woods."

674
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,580
It's one of the best ASMR videos I've ever seen.

675
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,220
That's funny.

676
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,700
I wish I was just a fairy in the woods.

677
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:19,060
Yeah. And now they do like ASMR like 10 hours of a rock falling down a hill.

678
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,560
Yeah.

679
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,340
Yeah. How about ASMR 10 hours of just pure rock and roll?

680
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,980
Hey.

681
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,780
You know?

682
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,020
It used to just be mouth clicks. It used to just be like...

683
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:36,320
yeah like vocal fry and shit like that. And like tapping fingernails on stuff. Yeah Noah used to be

684
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,860
really into ASMR. He would listen to ASMR and play Counter-Strike.

685
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,260
Yeah. Just for hours. I had a friend who was really into ASMR and I just I really got it.

686
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,900
I never understood it. I think I don't respect people as much when they're into ASMR. I get the tingles but I don't like them.

687
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,380
Yeah it's really unpleasant. It's like someone breathing on your neck. You know what I also didn't realize is you're supposed to leave it on in the

688
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,540
background I would watch the videos that's the other thing yeah there's a

689
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,020
girl in like the lowest cut top of all time talking about how she's a an evil

690
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,700
monkey yeah that and fucking dude Tony Bamboni the king of it

691
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
I'm a bacteria.

692
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
No, don't take any pictures of me.

693
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,700
I'm a fairy.

694
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,700

695
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700

698
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
I'm Booster.

699
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,700
I'm Booster from Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.

700
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
I'm a big, fat, red guy.

701
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,700
And I am huge.

702
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
My stomach looks like a sphere.

703
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,700
My hands are so small.

704
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
And my legs are tiny too.

705
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
And I need to eat a big sandwich right now.

706
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,700
I need to eat the biggest sandwich.

707
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,700
I just ate a huge, big sandwich.

708
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
I just ate a huge, big sandwich.

709
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
I just ate a huge, big sandwich.

710
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
I just ate a huge, big sandwich.

711
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,700
I just ate a huge, big sandwich.

712
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
I just ate a huge, big sandwich.

713
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:37,700
legs are tiny too and I need to eat a big sandwich right now. I need to eat the biggest sandwich.

714
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,540
I just ate the biggest sandwich of all time and I'm so fat and hairy and I'm gonna sit

715
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,780
on your face so hard. It's funny that I think we are just doing ASMR now. I think people

716
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,220
who listen to this are probably getting the tingles. It's a Dagwood sandwich and it's got

717
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:58,220
a toothpick with an olive on it. And I eat it in one bite. I'm Scooby Doo. I'm weird.

718
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:13,220
I'm weird. I'm being so weird right now. I'm being weird. I'm your friend and I'm weird. I'm weird. I'm that one weird friend. I'm weird. I'm the weirdest guy on the planet.

719
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,220
I wish that I had gotten into something like that on YouTube. I feel like every gimmick on YouTube has already been filled.

720
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
It's been done to death.

721
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,220
The thing is, the next one is not gonna... like you just have to think of...

722
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,220
I just need to be in the future.

723
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:30,980
was like the craziest because it was all gimmick fetish stuff it was like fat it

724
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:38,140
was like fat daddy smoking cigar and leather shirt with bolo tie I remember I

725
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,460
remember seeing a bunch of screens like seeing a bunch of YouTube screenshots I

726
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,700
thought were funny of like my dad sets up my my we and like looking them up and

727
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,380
then all the recommend recommended videos are like my dad just out of the shower

728
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:55,800
soapy he tells me yeah like that right it's like oh my god I thought it's a

729
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,540
weird we know you can't you can't do titties on YouTube can you know you can't

730
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,460
do titties but you can be like a fucking you can be a bear and smoke a pipe yeah

731
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,620
tell people tell people they're a piece of shit to the camera you can wear it

732
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,380
you can wear it I think you can do breastfeeding videos you do breast

733
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,300
feeding which is that is mammogram you sing and stuff like that jack off to

734
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,540
women feeding breasts. I don't know how it works.

735
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,980
That's scary though. People jacking off to breastfeeding is scary.

736
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,180
I guess if you look at it and you're like, "That's my cum that's coming out of

737
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,500
those boobs," then you might... Into a baby's mouth?

738
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
No, they don't feed babies in those videos. That's what you think when you watch it?

739
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,500
No, they shoot it into bottles! They don't put it into a baby's... What the hell is wrong...

740
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,500
You can't put a baby on YouTube! What the fuck is wrong with you?

741
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,500
No.

742
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,500
That's your Justin Bieber.

743
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
They put it, they pumped.

744
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Oh, that is the word.

745
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Like, sometimes if you're trying to find old, funny YouTube videos with one view and you

746
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
find home movies, and then it's just like you see that YouTube just starts, like, if

747
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
you go to a home movie of a kid doing something funny, there will just be a bunch of recommended

748
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,500
videos that are like, "Kid in the bathtub."

749
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Right.

750
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Home video.

751
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,500
Wasn't it like a huge, like, because that's where the interset or something?

752
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Yeah, they had an algorithm.

753
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
The algorithm was just making playlists for, yeah, for pedophiles.

754
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
It would be like, "This person is a pedophile.

755
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
This person is a pedophile.

756
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
This person is a pedophile."

757
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Yeah, and then they would just put it in the video.

758
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,540
something funny there will just be like a bunch of like recommended videos that

759
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,660
are like kid in the bathtub right home video like a huge like yeah yeah they

760
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,860
were like the interceptor yeah they're like had like an algorithm like the

761
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,580
algorithm was just making would be like this person is a pedophile

762
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:17,180
basically recommend kid videos yeah yeah it's fucking crazy dude and they just

763
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,660
haven't done anything about it yeah yeah cuz I mean yeah it's just it's just the

764
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,620
AI they're just it's funny that all algorithms just become evil yes full

765
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,820
like so evil yeah it's become yeah that was a huge problem with the fucking Elsa

766
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,620
pregnant stuff yeah the Elsa pregnant spider-man all the video yeah and then

767
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,100
like you could make videos where like it started out as like a finger family and

768
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,020
in the middle it shows like Darth Maul who says he wants you to kill your mom

769
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,820
yeah you ever stumble on those ones no I definitely talked about it before you

770
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,060
definitely showed me a few called hey kids TV where there's a guy who has like

771
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,900
it's like it's like a CGI guy who is like like Darth Maul shit on his face

772
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:57,660
and he's like, "Hey kids, does your mom ever hurt you? I'm Hitler!" and just like stuff like that.

773
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,260
Just like trying to like... It's kind of funny.

774
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,860
Who makes those? I mean, if he's making it...

775
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,500
Well, he also said, in those videos, he also says, "I am an AI and I'm going to take over the world."

776
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,860
That's another part of it. Dude, that's sick. I hope that's true.

777
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,260
Yeah, it's cool. It's cool if you do that to show that the fucking algorithm sucks and like

778
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,780
the algorithms like... Yeah.

779
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,980
Something I made... Do shit like that.

780
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,220
YouTube turned off comments on all kids videos, but it used to be that if you go to a kids video

781
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,860
They would all have like like seven million comments that were just like like babies pressing the keyboard

782
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:34,920
Like literally you just scroll and that's all it was yeah, yeah, it was so funny

783
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,380
But it's good that they shut off the comments on very yeah at least they have that

784
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,940
Everything else is so me and Cam used to find these like fucking kids videos at work that it was it was called like

785
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,680
Fun counting with horses and there would be five horses that were different colors. Yeah

786
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,480
I'm really like a run into a lake

787
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:50,900
Yeah

788
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,220
Like CGI like unity assets and then they would just run into a lake and then come out and they'd be really small

789
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,060
Yeah, and then they would get huge one would get huge when we get even smaller

790
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,460
Yeah, and then it would be like fun with counting

791
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:02,600
Yeah

792
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
It would be like it would be like a car drives

793
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,240
Drives up to onto a platform and then a cup goes on to it and then it comes off and it's a gorilla and it's

794
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,240
Like I would just say like red

795
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,180
It's like a kid's version of like hit him up is playing

796
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:20,420
Fucking sick, dude. That's a I mean just being the animator for those got to be the best job ever

797
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:26,780
No, you are you kidding? It's a farm in some fucking country. It's a great job. It's got to be so creative

798
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:32,380
Yeah, you need to come up with awesome. It's some content horse a small horse. Yeah. Yeah, that's true

799
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,660
I just teach you unity and then pay you like my favorite one

800
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,260
I think was one where it was like different animals

801
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,300
so it'd be like a bear and a dog and they would just like sit next to each other

802
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,340
and then one of them would disappear and then like a different animal would fill

803
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,940
the space like they were doing like an animal bracket yeah and the bear just

804
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,220
would always win yeah there was something there's one that we watched

805
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:57,700
that was like animal battle and all the animals kills each other that's what

806
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,820
kids want to see it is what kids when I was a kid did I was just searching like

807
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,940
most violent video game of all time on you yeah like yeah sir you'd go on

808
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,380
YouTube and search goriest movie ever and just watch Rickio scenes yeah I that's

809
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,780
how I found out about YouTube poop is because you look up funny poop and then

810
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,620
fuck in like oh yeah what's that goddamn it's that Toy Story one it's like called

811
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:26,240
toys gone wild and that's like the first YouTube poop gone wild yeah like Mardi

812
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,420
Gras gone wild what's up you want to see you want to see a little bo peep yeah

813
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,940
Little Bo Peep was a hot mommy and daddy to me.

814
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,940
Chucky wasn't in that movie.

815
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,260
Chucky wasn't in Toy Story.

816
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,580
He's in the background.

817
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,180
Yeah, Chucky was in the background of every Toy Story movie.

818
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,420
They hid him in a frame.

819
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,420
Yeah.

820
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,420
Yeah.

821
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,500
That was one of the subliminal messages to the kids is Chucky exists.

822
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Chucky does exist.

823
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,700
One of the subliminal messages is it just says Chucky is a doll.

824
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,620
Yeah, the subliminal message says this is the game that you can only play while smoking

825
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,620
weed.

826
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,620
This is the game you can only play when you're high.

827
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,020
that's what I think about that all we should get into hiding one frame of

828
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,220
subliminal messaging

829
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,300
yeah in what in the like videos you make or something

830
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,740
all the videos we make do it like a like a still of a

831
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,940
Disney movie or something yeah hidden in the window do you guys believe in

832
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,540
subliminal messages

833
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,420
yeah only the ones they send me through the microwave

834
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,140
whoa do I believe in them I try not to

835
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,700
yeah that's the whole point dumbass

836
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,820
you know the ones where it's like uh... it's a sex in the sky during lion king

837
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,780
yeah yeah that stuff

838
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,100
i think that was real

839
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,020
yeah yeah i think some of them are really makes me how

840
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,900
that movie what up now

841
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,560
what

842
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,300
is it do you think it's lying king or

843
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,780
i'm trying to work on was telling me recently there's one movie where like

844
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,340
one of the animators just drew a dick in one frame like and it like well little

845
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,060
mermaid

846
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,540
no no no no no it was a different one

847
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,100
It was, I know about the little mermaid one where there's like a dick in the

848
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,600
background.

849
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,340
Yeah, there's a priest has a boner.

850
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:05,540
I think it's like the Robin Hood animated movie with all like the

851
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,900
animals or something, but there's a frame where there's like an actual

852
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,380
picture of a porn movie in the window for one frame and then they, it was

853
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,260
like in the theatrical release and then they deleted it for the DVD.

854
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah.

855
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,460
But pretty funny.

856
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,980
I can't remember what movie I'm, whatever.

857
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,740
It's just like a guy's dick in a pussy.

858
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:20,900
Yeah.

859
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,660
Like an actual, it's not animated at all.

860
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,020
It's so sick.

861
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,020
And they're just like, "That'll be kind of funny, right?"

862
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:30,020
Because at that point they were like, "I mean, nobody's ever going to watch this movie again."

863
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,020
They'll never see the movie at home.

864
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,020
They'll see it once and they'll be like, "Was that it? There's no way, right?

865
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:40,020
Well, I guess I'll never see it again unless I pay another nickel to come watch the movie again."

866
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,020
Yeah, that's when that came out.

867
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,020
Yeah, dude. Movies used to be a nickel.

868
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,020
Yeah, that's when that came out.

869
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,020
Yeah, no, that's seriously true.

870
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,020
Yeah, that's why it's called a Nickelodeon.

871
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,020
Exactly, yeah. That's true.

872
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,020
Yeah.

873
00:50:53,020 --> 00:51:00,060
I'm trying to think there was another movie that had like a subliminal fight club. Yeah fight club actually has dots all over the place

874
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:05,400
Yep, they put their penis frames to though. Yeah, shut up. There is you're lying

875
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,140
There's frames where it just flashes a giant dick for one frame. Do you think I want to imagine that right now?

876
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,500
Google it. Okay fight club penis

877
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,940
My phone's on the ground. I'm not gonna pick it up to look there was a penis dude

878
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,940
You're trying to trick me to being gay right now. I think it was the Olympics

879
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,820
There was a

880
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:37,580
No, there was a I think it's the Olympics I don't remember if it's the Olympics or something else

881
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,080
There's actually really interesting. There was a really interesting

882
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,180
Subliminal message in the Olympics where you can actually see a Chinese guy swimming in the pool

883
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:53,620
McDonald's logo for like a second and somebody found it on like TV. Yeah, I'd have to look that up

884
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,120
I bet that was just like I don't think started to run an ad

885
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:02,720
Yeah, like if I see although I will say McDonald's specifically if I see a McDonald's ad immediately I want

886
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,940
Yeah, yeah, I want nuggets. So there was

887
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,300
The yesterday a day or two ago

888
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:14,300
My younger sibling got McDonald's and they didn't finish it and just left it on the table all day and it was the most intense

889
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:19,340
psychic torture just to smell McDonald's for an entire day. Yeah, that'll ruin you.

890
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,900
Yeah, just like driving me nuts. The other day I woke up at 8 in the morning and I

891
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,860
walked to McDonald's because I like had had such a desire for McDonald's the

892
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,580
other day and I thought that the McDonald's was like this is how deep it

893
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,980
goes. It's like I think in my brain the McDonald's in my neighborhood is like a

894
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,020
200 foot walk. Yeah. Because it's I just want it so bad but it's a mile and a

895
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,140
and a half and so I fucking walked a mile and a half in the rain when it was like

896
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,660
30 degrees outside yes and I got to McDonald's and I was like worth it dude

897
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,380
so fucking worth it yeah it's incredible yeah just a hot just an old nugget yeah

898
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:03,780
you know it's like fucking bubble gum wrapped in leather yeah I'm just fucking

899
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,740
yeah loving it I haven't had the the griddle McChicken yet they just hold the

900
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,220
pink slime in their fist and they squeeze it until it turns white and

901
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,620
that's the nugget. And they have four guys who all have a different hand shape.

902
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:20,620
Yeah. Yeah and then they just yeah yeah you know one guy's a boot hand. Yeah. One

903
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:25,020
guy has a I don't remember what the other one was. Chicken hand.

904
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:31,260
The round of course. The beak. The neck. The chicken bone.

905
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:37,020
Chicken bone. Chicken bone. That was something. Yeah. Wasn't that a

906
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,460
story somebody found like an actual beak in their nugget? I think it was KFC. KFC. Well that's

907
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,860
I feel like that's assuring. If I find a beak I'm like, "What?"

908
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,860
At least it's chicken.

909
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:52,460
Yeah, like I didn't think this came from anywhere but a chicken.

910
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,460
You know, like this is good. If I found a hoof, that'd be one.

911
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,060
It's crazy to think, because you think of like McDonald's and stuff,

912
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:05,460
at least this is how I think about it, is like, yeah, there's like a bunch of them around the country.

913
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,460
Yeah.

914
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,460
I've never like--

915
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,460
I think that way too.

916
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,460
I do think that way about McDonald's.

917
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:15,140
No, but like just to think about like the amount of chicken that they must kill to make it.

918
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,340
Oh yeah, how many chickens they just throw into the grinder?

919
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,340
Oh dude, yeah.

920
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,340
Billions of chickens.

921
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:26,500
Dude, like it's insane how much, like I don't, I could never go like vegan or like pescatarian

922
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,500
again.

923
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,500
Yeah.

924
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,380
But the thought of that gets me so mad.

925
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,740
I do think, I think like...

926
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,220
Oh yeah, it's so, it's so awful dude.

927
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,540
Eating meat is something that's like, I think clearly morally wrong and like at some point

928
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,620
you should. I think that's my... I mean I might do what my grandpa did and just go

929
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:46,380
vegan at 40. It's just one of those things like I think it's honestly one of those

930
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,820
things like like every like thing that we look back on in history and we're like

931
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,620
that's horrible where people just didn't try not to think about it at the time.

932
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,660
They probably knew it was wrong but they're just like yeah well it's easier if I don't

933
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:01,660
think you know. I bet the one that's after after that like like in like 50 years is

934
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,300
people are gonna look back and we were like why did we think it was okay to own

935
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,380
pets? Yeah. I bet that's gonna be one after that is like... Except for my

936
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:14,660
beautiful baby doll. Except for my beautiful genetically modified Pomeranian. Yeah listen

937
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:23,900
my pitbull or my fucking pug has not taken a breath in his life. This pug, this Pomeranian mix, oh man. He vomits out of love.

938
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,620
Yeah yeah yeah he has he's never inhaled he just has he's just been gradually

939
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:32,540
deflating his lungs over his lifespan and once they're empty he's done for. Those

940
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,740
fucking dogs are so fucked up dude. It's insane. Dude pugs are like, pugs

941
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,940
shouldn't exist in nature. Pugs try actively to commit suicide. Yeah. They're just constantly

942
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:48,340
trying to fall off the couch enough times that they die. Pugs and I think like any like

943
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,220
teacup poodle. Or like a chihuahua. Teacup pet. Yeah. Chihuahua though. I think a chihuahua

944
00:55:54,220 --> 00:56:00,220
is like a normal dog. There is no such thing as a normal dog. I think all dogs are pretty

945
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,380
fucked up. All dogs are completely fucked up. That's why they all get like insane cancer.

946
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,380
Yeah, they all just grow like tumors at the end of their life.

947
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,380
Yeah, they just grow tumors on their legs.

948
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,980
Everybody's dog who dies are like, "Yeah, well, we had to cut one leg off and then another

949
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,980
leg off."

950
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,980
Right.

951
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:18,460
People keep their dogs alive longer than they should.

952
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,460
I think.

953
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:25,500
I feel like, I don't know, people have a dog that's just limping all the time.

954
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,860
Yeah, it's like a dog that's blind and can't smell and has no tongue.

955
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,860
And they're like, "Yeah."

956
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,860
Right, a dog with no teeth at all.

957
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,660
And they're like, "God, he loves watching TV."

958
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,660
Yeah, he has a hole in the side of his body.
