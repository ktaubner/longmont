1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,340
- Okay, I'm changing the calendar to October.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,220
Let's see what it is.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,100
- Okay, let's see which fireman

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,700
is on the calendar this month.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's see, Thomas.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,620
- Missed out on him.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,740
- How old is he?

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,980
- 16.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,140
- Oh, his underwear says help puppies.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,220
- Whoa, puppies, remember that?

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,060
Did you guys remember?

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,420
- Oh, puppies!

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,920
on wrestling? The old guy? I don't remember that.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,460
Wait, they got a big boy.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,460
Oh, Jordan.

17
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,220
South Metro. Can you read the text?

18
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,220
It says #HelpPuppies.

19
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,100
All of their underwear says #HelpPuppies.

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,280
They all have the Help Puppies underwear?

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,180
Yeah.

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,100
I need some of that underwear.

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,900
I wonder who made that, like PSD.

24
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,060
Honestly, if I had underwear that said #HelpPuppies, I'd be sagging all day,

25
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,060
every day.

26
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,060
Constantly.

27
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,700
That was good.

28
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,340
It looks like Jordan at South Metro has been eating a little too much candy this

29
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,420
October. He's not quite as shredded as the rest of these firefighters, man.

30
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,780
So if the house is on fire and he comes up to pull you out of bed, you say,

31
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,740
"Mm-mm." No, because he's trying to find my candy stash. Exactly. He runs in as

32
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,740
fast as possible, opens the fridge, everybody else is... Or he comes out,

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,020
he's got like a giant log of salami that he's fireman carrying over his

34
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,780
shoulders. I know he's taking it from my house as a tip. He sees some smoke

35
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,500
coming from someone's backyard and he runs back there pretending he's going to

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,140
put out a fire, but he's grabbing the meats off the grill. It's brisket.

37
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,260
You know, it's a thankless job. I do this every day. Do you have to tip

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,340
firefighters? No, but that's what I was thinking. That's what I was thinking.

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,200
Do you think like a firefighter every like, you know, while they're saving

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,100
somebody out of their house or whatever, like they're throwing a bucket of water

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,540
around and shit. That's what they do. Do you use the thing that you think they

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,540
take stuff? This has to have been talked about, right? Yeah. That in a comedy

43
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,780
sense, so to speak, in an essence that a firehouse you're just getting paid.

44
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,980
First of all, after nine 11, my dad was like, fuck firefighters.

45
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,320
Cause he was a city worker and he was like all these fucking fight. He's like,

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,140
first of all, they'll work like two days a week and then they pull scab jobs.

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,460
The rest of the week they're fucking building decks and shit.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,200
They don't do anything. And he was like complaining that like,

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,900
all they do is like sit around the firehouse, making spaghetti,

50
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,220
you getting better, better be careful. My Uncle Bobby, he's a fire. I got a I got a

51
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,020
cousin firefighter, yeah, and my dad would say this to his face.

52
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,660
That's bad ass, dude. It does seem like I get to ride the pole. They get to

53
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,460
the pole. You just get to hang out with your friends all fucking day. The pole

54
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,780
can't be that much faster than the stairs. No, you're running down the

55
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,580
stairs. That's such a 1920s, like faster than we go to pole.

56
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,300
I need to get in my cool car now. I need to be in my truck immediately. I

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,080
you feel like when you're like seventeen, you don't know what the fuck to do with

58
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,140
your life. Instead of doing the military, you should just be a firefighter. That's

59
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,200
where yes, there's zero chance of you ever die. Oh my God, being a

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,740
firefighter is literally the midpoint between joining the military or running

61
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,240
away to join the circus. You're right, the pole, the pole, the fire truck, like

62
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,060
the clowns. Yeah, you're so fucking right. It literally that's what you do.

63
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,120
If you can't decide and there's a dog you get to play with all day, you and all

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,020
your you and all your co workers own a dog named spot name spot because of his

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,480
spots because of his spot. You get to do calendars. And not only that, gay, straight, bi, Latino,

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,840
white, black, all people turned on by firefighters. Yeah, true. You're going to have to rescue

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,240
me or you're going to get a sick shift. All the firefighters, every fight, there's first

68
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,520
pan firefighter. Do you think this is going to be, it probably isn't now, but do you think

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,080
in 10 or 20 years this is going to start being a serial, a speaker, a side. Oh my, and it's

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,960
a fire truck. A siren going off right now. They heard us talking shit. Yeah, we're pretty

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:53,380
close to what basically this podcast studio is a like our it is basically if

72
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,620
you live in a firehouse it's a fantasy factory yeah you have foam pits you have

73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,700
unlimited snacks you get to do whatever you want they're smoking weed I learned

74
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,500
lockers you have lockers what's that about you should you should watch a

75
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,460
little show called rescue me because I learned that sometimes my dad's favorite

76
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,260
impression same with my mom my dad said rescue me changes his life rescue me and

77
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,580
Sons of Anarchy, my mom loved everything on FX.

78
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,980
- Yeah, I was doing this joke for a little bit.

79
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,060
Didn't really go over it too well,

80
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,760
but I guess it'll probably go over better on a podcast.

81
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,780
Just like this holiday season,

82
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,540
go home to your uncles and your dads and tell them,

83
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,040
did you hear they're rebooting Rescue Me?

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
And I'm like, no, I didn't.

85
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,420
And they're like, yeah, they're rebooting it,

86
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,940
but it's an all NB non-binary cast.

87
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,380
And here's the fucked up part, Dennis Leary is switching over to NB to still be the lead.

88
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
Because he's got the haircut.

89
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:55,540
He does look like, when I was a kid I got him and Glyn Close confused all the time.

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,420
Thought they were the same person.

91
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,720
He really is like a, it's such a misstep if you're, we got a lot of Irishness on the pod

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
right now.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,140
If you are Irish, you cannot for one second think that you look hot or cool.

94
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
No.

95
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,700
It is the worst thing ever. We have something wrong with us.

96
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,980
There's something in the back of your head all the time that is like,

97
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,660
you have to put it in the back of your head and say like,

98
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,100
I look like a piece of shit right now. God said,

99
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,140
we need people dead in the first five minutes of every war.

100
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,620
Somebody's got to be on the front line.

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,660
Even I feel like hot Irish celebrities all still looked at like they may be.

102
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,400
so you can be that fucking guy from the killing of the sacred deer. That's

103
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,560
what I'm saying. He literally looks like

104
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,760
really

105
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,540
just like a rogan. Huh? Yeah,

106
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:52,320
yeah, whatever that guy's name is a hoban go. Yeah, you know, I know exactly

107
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,320
the guy you're talking. He looks like a barry keegan. Yeah, he looks like a

108
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,280
changeling. He looked barry keegan. We look up barry keegan for real. We need

109
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,220
to see and he has a bad spelling of his name. Yeah, just search barry. Oh,

110
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,600
He's the first one. He's got an O in it. Key Hogan. Look at this guy, dude. Oh, yeah. He

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,040
looked like he, the elf on the shelf come to life. Look, they even tried to hot him up.

112
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,660
They even put him in underwear. Yeah, they put him in pink underwear. Buddy, it looks

113
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,480
like he got four bellies. I mean, this is that country putting their best forward. Yeah,

114
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,600
this is their absolute top of the line. And we were there together. Yeah, we had a little

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,200
a little rendezvous. We had a rendezvous and I remember thinking like everyone,

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,840
first of all, everyone in North Ireland looks like Mr. Beast.

117
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,000
That would be hard for me. Everybody in Ireland was so ugly. It kind of blew my

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,880
mind. It was weird because there were people... I mean, yeah, what I was saying

119
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,960
before is like, I feel like obviously, I think on average people are fatter here.

120
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,120
All the guys look fucked. Yeah. But I saw maybe, I feel like three of the

121
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,920
the fattest people have ever saw in my life were in Ireland. Yeah, they all they

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,000
eat is like carvery and shit. Yeah, well, that's what you said the rise with me

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,560
forever that you said that they eat Thanksgiving every day.

124
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,000
He said every restaurant is Thanksgiving.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,120
It's so crazy, man. It really blew my mind how they live over there. Yeah, I

126
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,000
think they're so cool. They do think we have beer y'all yeah. We have a we're

127
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,580
depressed. No, you're not no I'm done with this shit. I'm a hundred percent

128
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,820
Irish or close to you're not no, no, no, we did your results on the air. I don't

129
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,920
I did a twenty three and me episode. What are you a hundred percent Irish? Nice

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,540
are you also a hundred percent? I think I'm twenty five percent English. Yeah,

131
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,020
I think that's good. I think that's good. Yeah, I think that's good. Yeah, I just

132
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,320
remember that because of the civil war shit, I don't think that I got I got full

133
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,500
citizenship though. In Ireland? Yeah, foreign birth registry. Lucky. What the hell? How

134
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,860
does that work? They're desperate for citizenship. Yeah, if your grandma. If you can trace back

135
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,660
your lineage. I can't. Wait, really? Two generations, yeah, you get citizenship. It's two generations,

136
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:12,460
right? I think so. You get passport and then. If my mom gets a passport, because she can

137
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,100
trace it back two generations. But then I think I'm the cut off. Like two generations

138
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,140
ago somebody had to be in Ireland. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, my mom's my grandma.

139
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,860
There ain't no shot like four or five. I think it's like I think me. My entire

140
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,060
lineage is Irish people fucking each other in America for like the last 200

141
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,220
years. Yeah, just like shitty poor Irish people. We went back and visited the

142
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,980
family and like saw that like little one car garage that like both sides

143
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,980
lived in. That's a man jerking off. They got a year each other. Did you meet

144
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,180
anybody. Yeah, I did. I met the family and they're they're fine. I don't know.

145
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,460
You expect like something like, oh my God, be careful. You're listening to

146
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,060
this. They are listening. They're watching this. They're watching and

147
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,580
listening right now. I did. I googled the village that like my dad was like,

148
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,940
Oh yeah, our family is from like this village and I looked it up and yeah, I

149
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,820
feel like you kind of expect to be like, Oh wow, this is like Ireland, but it's

150
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,500
just like a it's a town. It's a shitty town. Yeah, should be town. It's a

151
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,800
the village in my head. It probably it looks probably like exactly like

152
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,980
northern New Hampshire. I'm imagining that my family lived in like Elden Ring

153
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,420
world.

154
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,500
Well, that's the thing you go overseas and you don't realize like in Italy,

155
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,340
they still have to have a gas station. So yeah, I still go to the grocery.

156
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,260
Yeah, there's still just like random shit that looks terrible Irish comic

157
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,860
shinglif.

158
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,860
Hold on clipper shinglif shinglif.

159
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,500
you don't shame. Clearly, no, I

160
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,980
got your man. He looks just like him. You're making this guy up on such thing

161
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,880
as shingles

162
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,200
shame Clifford. Oh, okay, yeah, I know about that guy and he was

163
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,100
a manager of a grocery store in like Western Ireland and

164
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,780
yeah, it just sounds horrible. One like his existence was horrible, just

165
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,980
fucking manager, media light and flower. They all live in them. They live in

166
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,960
some of the most beautiful land in the world and they all hate it because

167
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,800
they've been there. And also it's rainy every day. Yeah. I don't want to live

168
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,880
there, man. I won't live there. Talks weird. I refuse to... Hey, if you try to

169
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,320
get me to live there... Not gonna do it. Uh-uh, not happening. They also don't

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,800
have a... Again, they don't have a great entertainment export, right? There's

171
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,620
no... They have bag... Nope. YouTube. Except for bagpipes. They don't have

172
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,440
bagpipes either. Well, that was Scottish. That's Scotland. Yeah. Oh, you're right.

173
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
They don't even have dry British comedy.

174
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,940
Exactly.

175
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,440
They have this kind of wet comedy, kind of Mrs. Brown's boys.

176
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,440
They do have the, I mean like they're the only country to like recognize Palestine.

177
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Mm-hmm.

178
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,940
That is true, but they're a little too proud of it.

179
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
They're a little bit.

180
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,940
They're a little too.

181
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,440
That's one of the first things our tour guide told us, is like, yeah, in Ireland, like we kind of, we believe in the underdogs, so yeah, we all support Palestine over here.

182
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,080
But I think that there's something like, you know, your uncle who's like a

183
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,040
construction worker or whatever and he's like, "I'm actually a Lib."

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Oh, yeah.

185
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Like there's that energy.

186
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
So it's like, "All right, I'll support you."

187
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,920
It's crazy to say it like as a country.

188
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,640
Like, "Yeah, so in this country, we actually support that."

189
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Support it.

190
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
Saying it, supporting the underdog, too.

191
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I know.

192
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
It's fucking nuts.

193
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,280
I think that I've had a couple of family members that have become, like after Trump,

194
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:35,280
like Democrats, and I think I would have rather them stay fully. Yeah, my mom now loves Pete

195
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,560
Buttigieg and she used to say that Obama was using swine flu to put Christians in FEMA

196
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,600
camps. And then 10 years later, she's like, Pete Buttigieg is awesome. He reminds me of

197
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,880
Subway. My family and my family fucking loves Pete, too. Yeah. What is that about, man?

198
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,280
Because they get to be like star on my shirt. I voted for a gay guy. Yeah. Yeah. Which I

199
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
I mean he's not even gay.

200
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Nah.

201
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
He's fucking pussy left and right.

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
He loves it dude.

203
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,040
He's at the Elysian every night in LA.

204
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Yeah.

205
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
He's with Pat Gilman.

206
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,800
The stories that I've heard, the stories I've heard about Pete Buttigieg.

207
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,400
First of all he's eating ass and working the clit and going like that.

208
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,160
That's why people thought he was gay.

209
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,120
Just soaking down his arm.

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,120
I've heard that he'll book an Airbnb and he'll put a sign on the outside of the door that

211
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,280
says no boys allowed.

212
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
He always walks around.

213
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,680
He literally has 12 girls in there.

214
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,640
he literally walks around east east la walking around with it looks like he

215
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,380
just finished like eating a watermelon like a cartoon. It's just like dripping

216
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,760
down

217
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,020
and he says smell my finger arms and

218
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,800
smell my leg up to my knee.

219
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
He's he's going up to my but

220
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,720
he's telling these twelve girls,

221
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,760
girls,

222
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,040
I was like pussy.

223
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:00,840
I was fucking a girl with my butt.

224
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,760
Here's what I was thinking.

225
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,040
Pete's got a concave chest and he's telling the girls,

226
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,920
like you sit on my face and you don't leave until it's filled with nut,

227
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,520
with female nut. And then I want all the other girls to suck it.

228
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,960
He's crazy, man. Yeah, dude.

229
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,420
I fully completely he has a sibian that he has on wheels that he

230
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,880
can you

231
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,040
got a

232
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,960
in the back.

233
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,600
Can you imagine how bad camp David would have smelled if he had been elected

234
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,360
president? Oh my God, so much pussy walking left and right. Secret service

235
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,220
like assassinating people. I'm going to go public that he's straight and he

236
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,720
made me come harder than anyone else.

237
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,520
Robocop bang

238
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,920
stick.

239
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,720
I heard that he has one leg.

240
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,320
He's like FDR. He's like a penis. So I got that he's always got a blanket on

241
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,060
his lap. So no one

242
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:07,300
no, he's hard all the time. He's like only the blue shoes. Not only is he

243
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,140
straight, he's like the most perfect type of straight. He's only into like

244
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,000
thirty five and above yeah. He's like I don't and he's learning that yeah,

245
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,780
PETA bra. Yeah. Oh my God. They do the Drake bra thing at the Pete Buttigieg concert. Oh

246
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,380
yeah. Oh my God. You should see the bras that Buttigieg has in his basement. It's just like...

247
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,260
His basement looks like a bar in Florida where they staple bras to the walls. Yeah, it's

248
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,900
just dollar bills and bras stapled all across the fucking ceiling. I remember being a kid

249
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,020
in places like that and being like, "This place is awesome." My version of that. My

250
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,460
my parents never took me there. I feel like there's always like you're there's

251
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,860
like a place where it's like this is a scuzzy like yeah, yeah, my mom's take me

252
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,320
to this bar to play pool. She would just play pool and I would and drink and I

253
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,240
would sit there and there was they had my version. I was they had flat bill

254
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,760
hats

255
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,780
I was like this is paradise. I would sit there and look at all the hats. You

256
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,480
ever went to to Charlie's in Harvard Square? No, that was where my family

257
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,700
Charlie Steaks in the mall in the square.

258
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,420
- Do you guys have, where you're from,

259
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,660
I know there's none in New England really,

260
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,060
but in the Midwest, is there bikini barista places?

261
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,900
- No.

262
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,380
- Not bikini barista places,

263
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,760
but there was a place called Krabby Kim's on Western Avenue

264
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,960
that was next door to like the last arcade

265
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,560
that ever existed.

266
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,700
And they had bikini girls, and my dad knew Kim.

267
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,540
- Whoa.

268
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,360
- Wow.

269
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,200
- The Krabby Kim?

270
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,520
- The Krabby Kim.

271
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,360
And then it became--

272
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,180
- Woman on business.

273
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,780
Crabby Kim had like a long, prolonged death

274
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,720
or my dad was like one of the only people. I was like taking care of him.

275
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,360
He's like I gotta go. Oh, my God, I can't everybody who owns a local

276
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,500
cavalier and everyone who owns a local business dies the most atrocious as

277
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
possible and you and it's so public. You seem like shaking

278
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,600
who ran this paintball field in North Carolina, so obviously he's fucked.

279
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,380
He's going to die in the most awful way and a paintball accident. He had

280
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,680
He had diabetes, the paint balls, he had diabetes and then he lost both of his

281
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,380
legs and then he but he wore like prosthetic legs to drive and then he

282
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,840
died. He was taking a van full of kids to a

283
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,840
paintball competition. He had a heart attack while he was dry. He like crash.

284
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,120
I think it wasn't like a he was like at a stop sign or some shit. It was like

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,360
not nobody got injured, except for him, a mentally, maybe yeah, and so kid was

286
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
like yeah, it looked like he got shot by a

287
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:47,660
would you use training kids for a militia at the yeah yeah they were using

288
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,160
the big like the paintball guns they had in child's play three that looked like

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,180
real guns. If you own a barbecue place, you get struck by lighting yeah that

290
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,720
simple. It's the worst because you're so fucking stress all the time and you're

291
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,380
right. I need to make thirty cents this month or I am like going to have to kill

292
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,860
myself.

293
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,080
The margins are so thin yeah. There's a bakery in my town that exploded

294
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,680
really. I think somebody maybe got hurt. I don't think anyone died, but it fully

295
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,520
it blew up. Wow, like windows blowing out of the front. That's a giant fireball.

296
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,360
That was an insurance money scam. Greek lighting. What's up Greek lightning?

297
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, yeah,

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,160
across the street, but I remember it was called Olin's bakery and I remember I

299
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,880
saw after it happened. I saw somebody driving around with a bumper sticker

300
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,280
that said Bush did Olin's.

301
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Ohlins fans. What's that?

302
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Just kind of a play on it.

303
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Oh, I just got it.

304
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Oh, shit.

305
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Okay, I got it.

306
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Oh, shit.

307
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Now that bumper sticker will say Ohlins fans.

308
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
True.

309
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
That could be good.

310
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
And now it is.

311
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
It would be interesting.

312
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Yeah.

313
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
All these beautiful women on the computer.

314
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,080
There's this place in, I think, did I take you guys to Flamin' Amy's when you came here?

315
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Yes, you did.

316
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
We did go to Flamin' Amy's.

317
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
That place used to be so sexually charged where it had like bikini photos all over the wall.

318
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,800
over the world. That's because you live near the beach like me and Cameron.

319
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,720
I've died. There's no, if you were, if you got sexual,

320
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,640
if you got sexual in New England, it was like, it was over,

321
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,080
they would spray you with a hose. You can't be sexual. You cannot. No, no, no.

322
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,480
It's not possible. Not even, I mean, Hampton beach is like, that's people do

323
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,400
that there. And it's like, that's why everyone calls it the Walmart beach.

324
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,240
Bro. I remember fucking on Revere beach.

325
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,600
Yo, getting a Kelly's roast beef, put your dick in that.

326
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,360
Just on those rocks. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't be sexual.

327
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,900
we can't have like a it's all you know, there's left over a puritanism and

328
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,840
there's a water is too gross. It's nice in the south. It's too hot down there.

329
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,880
So like well, I got to take off my clothes anyway, but up north it's like

330
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,920
we'll be a bunch of rocky beaches. You guys don't have if you take your clothes

331
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,640
you guys don't have surfers. Yeah, that either is and on the Cape there was

332
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,440
this girl. I'm not as much probably, but there's this girl. I knew who was she

333
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,120
would surf. She was a big surfer and she was like she looked like a wallet like

334
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,360
the most fucked up skin of all time. And she, I caught two different times I pulled up to

335
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,860
her at a red light and I saw her smelling her armpits, just like driving and just taking

336
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,060
two big whiffs. Those happened two different times.

337
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
That's allowed. That is cool.

338
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,300
You can do that in your own car.

339
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,620
It's just like a different kind of person I don't see up here.

340
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
Speaking of.

341
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,540
You didn't fall in love instantly? Like when you saw like a girl being as dumb as you, you

342
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,660
didn't feel like, okay, maybe we should.

343
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,260
If she had like, if she had both of her hands, you know how when you sit at your house, you

344
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,180
put both your hands on your balls when you watch TV. I put my pinky in my balls. I have

345
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,460
one. Just the pinky. Yeah, just the pinky in there. Pinky through the waistband. Call

346
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,100
it Dr. Evil. My wife did not understand that for many years that I watch TV, if I'm wearing

347
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,180
boxers, both of my hands holding my balls. Put on a fucking episode of Married with Children.

348
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,340
Exactly. I want to see what the Bundys are doing. I hold my balls to Jeopardy. I'm doing

349
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,980
it in case there's a nuclear blast and I have at least a little bit of cushion. Yeah, you're

350
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
squeezing your balls because it's the buzzer.

351
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Do you ever kind of like take your balls and like

352
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
hold it up like a sheet and then

353
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
scratch it like that? Chicken skin.

354
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like chicken thighs.

355
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
From

356
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Waiting. Yeah.

357
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Oh yeah, Waiting. The Brain. Deadpool.

358
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
The owner of Mint Mobile.

359
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
Star of Waiting. This fucking

360
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
guy. Aviation Jin.

361
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Aviation Jin. I want to see him like

362
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
personally cancel people's accounts.

363
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
You know,

364
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,280
I don't fucking care. You fucking better pay the bill. You should have paid like

365
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,500
yeah, this is Ryan. And then he looks into the camera pool. We have sent your

366
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,500
account to collections. He says like, um, this is what happens when you don't pay.

367
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Jimmy, I want to hang out with him. So bag. It's so fucked up on aviation.

368
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,980
Jim make mint mobile prank calls to people. Oh yeah. Yes. You know, you know,

369
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,300
under with all the phone.

370
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,860
A binder. Yeah, you send out the alerts to every single person's account. It

371
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,460
says your phone will self destruct in five minutes and then

372
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,020
that said that there was a nuclear

373
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,380
mobile people got that. Oh my God, he could do some epic pranks with yes,

374
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,420
mobile and you're just wasting it. If you have this bill every day,

375
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,380
damn alert, it's not a good sell. Amber alert. There is a

376
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:18,100
did you guys see the video where Jim Carrey talks about he was in Hawaii when

377
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,100
the nuclear like alert went out like a couple years ago, no and it pissed me

378
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,260
off so badly man. He was like yeah, I got the nuclear nuclear alert on my

379
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,720
phone and I was at such peace just knowing that I was going to pass away

380
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,540
and I had the most amazing life ever. Well, I imagine I was finally going to

381
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,680
escape. I imagine you're like running away. You're like running to whatever

382
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,240
the newest the the closest like nuclear

383
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,860
basement, whatever that is, yeah, a shelter, yeah, and you see Jim Carrey

384
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,740
like just so he's got to know something that we see that's what he's completely

385
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,260
he's yeah he would be so happy if he died without anybody finding out what he was

386
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,380
doing true that's a very good to his yeah to everybody in his but he also

387
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,220
said he was there with his daughter and he was like yes she was freaking the

388
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,860
fuck out but I was just sitting there funny faces to calm down all this is all

389
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,660
you have no ideas it's all fantasy he says he was there to paint a palm tree

390
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,860
Is there to practice painting? Painting on the palm tree or paint a palm tree on a canvas?

391
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,180
Do you remember... He's painting a picture of Ronald Reagan on a palm tree. Do you remember

392
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:32,660
in like 2018 he posted a photo, a painting that he made of Trump as Darth Maul? That's

393
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:39,340
sick. It, genuinely I did want to buy it so bad. Trump at like CPAC with Darth Maul makeup

394
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:45,260
upon. Oh my God, that'd be incredible. Jim Carrey is the guy that the Dali

395
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,860
image generator is taking jobs away from. He is the one guy who is

396
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,620
peeping shit like Trump as Darth Maul. He's getting put out of work by the

397
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,340
AI images. And the AI is training on his images too. You can type in

398
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,380
the Dali three right now, you can type in

399
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,700
Trump eating poop in the style of Jim Carrey and it comes up.

400
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,500
Well, they won't do eating poop, as you found out. You have to say

401
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
eating mud. Yeah, you have to say a messy mud pie. Mud pie? Yeah, messy mud pie.

402
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,500
We had some Trump, is Darth Maul. Is there a photo of him? I don't know if there's the

403
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,500
paint. Oh yeah, there it is right there. Well, there's Jim Carrey.

404
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Wait, which one? I think if you click that article it'll show up. When I was in first grade I watched

405
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Pet Detective a thousand times. Yeah? Oh yeah, dude,

406
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,500
of course. Oh, well it doesn't have, oh my god. They took it down.

407
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,500
They took down the picture. Wait, who did? Click the picture. Who's in power?

408
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,040
you're taking down who's in power. I don't know man. I'm taking off of X. I

409
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,840
can't believe we figured this out. I think carry going on. This is sad as

410
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,740
fuck. So what are your thoughts on the machine? I'm all in on X. I bought a

411
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:53,360
bunch of stock. I've been Xing all day. I just constantly Xing. I X like it's

412
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,500
two thousand nine like got a sandwich today like you might like doing like

413
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,380
pedophile jokes like X, you know, two thousand nine pedophile jokes just

414
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,140
trying to be epic on the computer non stop, but it would give me an example of

415
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,440
a two thousand and nine pedophile joke. You're doing it's like I'm a pedophile.

416
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,640
I'm a pedophile said no one ever

417
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,200
that actually can you and then you're a part of it and say, except for

418
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,840
pedophiles, except for pedophiles and then ten years later, you have to you

419
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,080
have to make some post under that one. I don't understand what this means. I

420
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,720
did not mean I don't even remember posting this at the time. I think I got

421
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
act. I think I was

422
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,720
honestly. I was probably off that scissor. Yeah, yeah,

423
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,800
all those posts of like comedians from two thousand and eight where they're

424
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,840
being racist and they just respond like the opioid epidemic has affected us all

425
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,480
at the time. I just I had broken my big toe. I learned what Percocet was a

426
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,040
semi home with four thousand pills and I just started micro blogging. I figured

427
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,600
out if you crush the oxys and cook them, you can shoot it just like her.

428
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,920
No, sorry, sorry, not sorry.

429
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,240
And here's how you smoke oxys off a tin foil.

430
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
Have you guys ever taken a bunch of barbiturates or downers?

431
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
No.

432
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,400
I've taken, I used to steal, not steal really, I used to just take oxy out of the medicine

433
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,800
cabinet in my house because my mom hurt her leg when I was a kid.

434
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,800
And I just did it a bunch but I didn't like it.

435
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,280
It was just funny to do drugs I think.

436
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,520
How many did you do?

437
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Just take like one.

438
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Oh wow.

439
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,560
You're just taking what the doctor said to do.

440
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,200
Yeah, I would take one and it would make me really tired.

441
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,560
I just had one beer. What the fuck? I'm supposed to be drunk.

442
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,360
I did that too. I had a space heater and what I would do is I would take one of the oxys

443
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,680
and then I would sit in my bed and put the space heater under the blanket. Insane fire

444
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,200
hazard and I would just like cook myself for three hours.

445
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,520
Three different things you're supposed to like.

446
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Yep.

447
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Parental supervision.

448
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,080
Steal a Mike's Hard Limited, sit down there, one oxy, Mike's Hard, space heater, fall asleep

449
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
listening to a Pete Holmes.

450
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:04,000
Rainy day, y'all. Oh, I'm cozied up. I'm listening to You Made It Weird, the John

451
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,080
Glazer episode where he gets mad about the E-Trade babies. Damn, that was pretty

452
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:16,640
epic. I've been saying this for a while. We need to have more like comedy drama

453
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,880
like that. Just for the wax, you know what I mean? Yeah, we need more beef. I

454
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,200
I feel like the only people who are still beefing like that is the comedy mothership guys down

455
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
in Austin, Texas.

456
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,480
And all that stuff is such a mirror of, "You drank my special bourbon."

457
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Yeah, exactly.

458
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,920
Kind of like what my brother and his friends are beefing.

459
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Yeah, exactly.

460
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,480
"You drank my horse's tail bourbon that I had in my cabinet."

461
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,160
"That entry is $80!"

462
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,640
You don't touch Bert's bourbon.

463
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
No, no.

464
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Nuh-uh.

465
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,040
Obviously, I've seen more videos of these people than I've spent time with my father in the

466
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,200
past five years. I'm so aware of Bert's drinking and what needs to happen with it.

467
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,240
Do you watch Too Lazy to Try?

468
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,720
No, I might not.

469
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,360
That YouTuber that just like...

470
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
He goes over all the dramas.

471
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Yes, yes.

472
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
He does the commentary.

473
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
He's the best.

474
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
We love him.

475
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
I watch him before I fall asleep.

476
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
If you're...

477
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,400
Shout out, Too Lazy to Try.

478
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,920
He makes these videos where he's like always saying like these people are stupid, fuck

479
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,680
these people, but it's clear that he listens to every single one. He's like in hell. He

480
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,960
has to listen to every single one of these. He just watches them do good. It is from a

481
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,960
place of love. It's like he's a fan. So Theo Vaughn and Brendan Chobb are officially beefing

482
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,760
because Theo went on this podcast and didn't even acknowledge him, which I don't even know

483
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,760
know why he would do that. That's every single video. I want to be. He has to

484
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,360
make them. I think he's like a more evolved human being. He is a historian.

485
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:58,040
No, he's like a parasite of what he has to live inside of these guys. Yeah.

486
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Brains. He also dies. Yeah, this is one way to think about it. He's also probably,

487
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,960
I mean, we should, I think he's making money off of these videos. Yeah. Oh,

488
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,560
yeah. Yeah, he's got a Patreon where he details like the craziest, the craziest

489
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,680
stern clips and stuff. I've been going the best and clips old. Oh, me too. I

490
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,820
think that if this the if the like Bert Kreischer documentary guy wasn't doing

491
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,620
that, it wasn't making money off that he would be like a like a civil war

492
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,080
story.

493
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,400
That's the thing.

494
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,000
He's a big history buff, like if Kafka was alive now, he would just be like

495
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,880
trying to fuck people in Ridgewood.

496
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,760
You're doing like weird tweets, everyone

497
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm going to stand in front of this girl's apartment for the next three hours acting

498
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
like a bug.

499
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm dressed up like a spider.

500
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm acting like a bug.

501
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm trying to climb up the building.

502
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,260
Instead of writing one of the most epic, weird, crazy...

503
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,260
It was odd.

504
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,600
It's really, I read it recently.

505
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
The transformation?

506
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Yeah.

507
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
The metamorphosis.

508
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Metamorphosis.

509
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,800
I read it last year.

510
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah, it is funny.

511
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,120
I read like his collection of short stories.

512
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
I bought it, yeah.

513
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
It was cool, man.

514
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,640
He's just a classic pervert weird guy, alone in his room.

515
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,000
All the best authors were huge perverts.

516
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Oh yeah.

517
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And alcoholics.

518
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,960
You ever think about, there's all this stuff coming out about alcohol recently where they

519
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
say it's bad for you.

520
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Blame it on the alcohol.

521
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
That was the beginning.

522
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
That was the beginning.

523
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Beginning of the end.

524
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,220
And then this fucking piece of shit Andrew Huberman started saying, yeah, it's bad to

525
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,220
drink alcohol.

526
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,220
You gotta get drunk every day, all day.

527
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
That's what I'm saying.

528
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
Especially if you're doing comedy.

529
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,820
I had a couple drinks on the drive over here.

530
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
Thank God dude.

531
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,340
You think that's straight Canada dry?

532
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
Nuh uh.

533
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Pure green alcohol.

534
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Aviation gin up in there.

535
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
Canada wet.

536
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
Canada wet.

537
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Completely wet.

538
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,180
All these old authors also, I was talking to somebody about this, that they all were

539
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:06,180
in a studio apartment and then there was some 15 year old girl would bring them a two-year

540
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,820
a tray of broth every day. Yeah, just like and then they want to marry her

541
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,820
really written because some yeah some like thirty seven year old guy had the

542
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,780
most terrifying obsession with another person in the world. Yeah, it's all and

543
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,780
it's always either yeah. It's always either like a thirteen year old girl who

544
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,660
lived across the street from them or it's like a seventy year old guy, but you

545
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,660
weren't that they had a crush on, but weren't allowed to be gay. Yeah, there

546
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,160
is every every piece of

547
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,000
now every in like all their porcelain mugs had lead paint on the side of them.

548
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,540
So they're drinking just straight lead.

549
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,120
Every now everyone who would be everyone who would be a Melville in a Hemingway

550
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,620
or whatever nowadays, a Jordan Peterson, they go on Twitter and they can say I'm

551
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,100
thirsty AF for this guy. True. They're allowed to publicly be gay on Twitter.

552
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,060
Well, they're allowed to yeah have multiple personalities in line like be

553
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,440
you know.

554
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,940
That's why nobody's writing books that are longer than two hundred pages

555
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,580
anymore. No, no, no, damn true.

556
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, but that's what that's the thing. Speaking of books that are longer than

557
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,900
200 pages, maybe that's actually it. Oh, you want to do you want to say this

558
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:14,660
about just talking to Steve Smith about this, about going to like PTA meetings

559
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,340
is like a father getting at like the podium and be like reading. Fuck it

560
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,940
sucks.

561
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,940
Like kind of like anti groomer, but like for reading it's fucking sucks. It's

562
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,020
stupid. It's boring.

563
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,700
Stupid. I want the whole library gone

564
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,680
the ban all the books, ban every single one of the books, burn every book

565
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,040
replacing with a lazy to try video, too lazy to try and all the books in the

566
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,880
library are going to be replaced with DVD. Well, that was when I first started

567
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,640
putting your in a library. I said I like this trend, but then it stopped with

568
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,920
eight. Yeah, they never had more than like eight DVDs in my fucking line. I

569
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,200
had a crazy array of DVDs at my library. Really? I love to look at them. Was it

570
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,360
encroaching on the books? No, they had a whole section. See, I would like to go

571
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,440
to be a library science type of person if it was like basically a blockbuster, but

572
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,000
I guess not.

573
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, wait, I have to say one more thing. We were talking about Stern. Sam sent me

574
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,960
a screenshot the other day of somebody, somebody, you know, people just post

575
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,840
like videos of Beetlejuice on Twitter all the time. And somebody replied under

576
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,400
it and was like, "Who is this guy and what the hell does he have?"

577
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,880
He sent me a screenshot, like a YouTube short where somebody is explaining

578
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,560
Beetlejuice and it's just like the thumbnail is a photo of Beetlejuice and

579
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,760
the caption is just "What is mentally wrong with him?"

580
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,960
Our goal is to get him on here.

581
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,200
Does he live in New York?

582
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I think so.

583
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,360
Yeah, he lives, he's like an Upper West Side guy.

584
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
People see him often.

585
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,280
Yeah, he walks around, he's got a schnauzer.

586
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,600
How come nobody has photos, you know that photo of, what's his name?

587
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,600
the guy that directed Annie Hall. Woody Allen. Woody Allen and Epstein.

588
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Nobody's put Beetlejuice in that. All three of them walking down the street.

589
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,040
Well, if you follow him online, he probably will do that. Because he puts himself on like

590
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,120
Manny Pacquiao's body. He does everything. He puts himself on everybody's body.

591
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,640
Yeah. He's a pretty beast. Maria Waza, man. Oh, yes. We have something special to show

592
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:25,440
you, Conor. Which also, our guest today is Conor. Yeah. What's up, y'all?

593
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Thank you so much for having me.

594
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Of course, of course.

595
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
What does this look good?

596
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
You have like gum in your hair or something.

597
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
Yeah.

598
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
You're trying to give yourself a middle part of the hair.

599
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
In my hair?

600
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Oh, thank you.

601
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Yeah, I think I'm going to keep rocking this for a little bit.

602
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
We did an episode a little while ago, which maybe Julio will find the number right now,

603
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
but it was about martial arts.

604
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Yes.

605
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
And I found this guy who invented his own martial art online.

606
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
Really?

607
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Yeah.

608
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
His name is Eddie Vuittonnet and he's a martial artist.

609
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
He's a guy who's been doing martial arts for a long time.

610
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
He's a guy who's been doing martial arts for a long time.

611
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
He's a guy who's been doing martial arts for a long time.

612
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,440
was about martial arts. Yes. And I found this guy who invented his own martial art.

613
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:58,440
Really? Yeah. His name is Eddie Vuitton. And he is he invented a martial art called

614
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Murillo Waza, which he calls the way of unlimited techniques. And so we did if

615
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,440
you we did a whole thing about him in this last episode. So if you haven't heard

616
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,440
that you want some more background on him, you guys can listen to that. But he

617
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,440
has he wrote a book. I ordered this book off Amazon. Jesus Christ. It's fucking

618
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,240
fucking giant. It's like a textbook. Yeah, it literally is a text. There is. Yeah,

619
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,560
I marked out some good parts in here to read through. There's a quiz at the end

620
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,760
of the book too. So, Muria Waza, the way of unlimited techniques, a guarded,

621
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,480
exclusive and confidential course written and illustrated by... And that's

622
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,620
the important part. Wait till you see the illustrations. The illustrations are

623
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,600
great. Grandmaster founder, the deadliest self defense system in history.

624
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,360
This reminds me of the guy that created Spawn. Do you guys know him? I've been

625
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,280
reading Spawn, yeah. Have you seen any interviews with this guy? You know the

626
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,480
like clips that that play at the beginning of the like animate yeah.

627
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,480
He is the man. I love him. What are these clips? What is he where he's like he

628
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,360
like introduces all the episodes like he's doing like a broad serling ma kind

629
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,240
of, but he's like he's like a very nerdy looking guy and I'll be sitting on a

630
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,960
stool in like speech impediment and yeah he'll be like in like a his like

631
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,360
artist studio, but it's got like chains and skulls on the wall and stuff and

632
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,800
I'll be like

633
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,880
it's what would you do if your best friend raped your wife and you got sent

634
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,320
to hell?

635
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,220
that's the answer or I'll be like the question. Yeah, swords. What would

636
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,740
happen if you got stabbed by

637
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,760
and every spawn episode opens with one of those yeah that's amazing dude. It's

638
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,040
he's a type of guy that just doesn't exist that much anymore, like the the

639
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,480
really, really like the already Magda yeah, the really nerdy dude who like is

640
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,120
super into nine inch nails, though, and he's wearing like the like the spiked

641
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,460
dollar. You spiked collar guy, leather jackets, just snails guy. Yeah,

642
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,000
so this is an about this is the about the author section as a little recap for

643
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,160
okay. Yeah, okay, so about the author, Eddie Vuitton is a native of south

644
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,980
Texas, who primarily writes about particular periods of places and people

645
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,260
within the realm of modern day history. Doctor Vuitton enjoys meticulously

646
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,140
dissecting recorded history, especially historical events that are known to have

647
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,520
culminated over time and ultimately led to changes in families, societies,

648
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,640
cultures and even civilizations.

649
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,720
The print is so big, it's huge, it's giant and it's probably a two hundred

650
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,500
page book. It's so he can read it. I would say about seventy five percent of

651
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,800
this book is pictures. Yeah,

652
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,720
Dr. Vujicinet began his writing career as a young man, teaching his martial

653
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,480
art style, which he named Muria Waza. As part of the Muria Waza discipline, he

654
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,440
wrote numerous instruction manuals and study guides that afforded him a wealth

655
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,440
of experience in bringing the written word into formative thought and

656
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,120
subsequent technical action. Over time, Eddie was provided the opportunity in

657
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,840
the mid nineteen seventies to further sharpen his authoring skills by writing

658
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,400
and implementing several traditional and non traditional youth development

659
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,400
oriented programs for the city of Fresno's community development program.

660
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
Wait, he's from Fresno,

661
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,800
maybe Fresno Texas says he's from Texas, Texas. Okay, his interest in writing

662
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,600
turned toward a more creative form of expression in the one thousand and

663
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,740
ninety when he began writing fiction, non fiction and short stories, and here

664
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,980
we find ourselves today and there's a picture of him. So the thing that we

665
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,240
found out about him last time, like the first time we looked into him, was that

666
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,520
he was like a judge who got disbarred from yeah, I forget why, but there's like

667
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,400
a whole thing. It's like the third thing that comes up when you google it. Yeah,

668
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,040
there's some document about he had to resign and the first and second things

669
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,080
are these animations that he's made and like he covers an animated movie.

670
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,680
He has a

671
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,660
he's he's got he makes also like graphics. You can hire him to make

672
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,520
graphics for you. It's a fiver guy. He is a

673
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,160
did he is, but he also invented the most deadliest martial art of all history. So

674
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,720
here's the core of Maria was a is victimology and here's how he defines

675
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,480
victimology. Wait there it is sorry. It says right there. January two thousand

676
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,600
four, a complaint was filed with the state commission on judicial contact

677
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,480
containing allegations of and then it doesn't say what

678
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,180
all right. What does it say here's victimology noun, the study of the

679
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,360
victims of crime and the psychological effects on them of their experience.

680
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,480
That is, if they survive the assault, holy shit, that's the core. I'm sorry.

681
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,000
I was distracted because does he have an album? He has a

682
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,160
cover of heaven knows I'm miserable now by the Smiths. He does a ton of covers.

683
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,520
He has some just a regular guy trying to make it in America. That's yes, no,

684
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,400
Steve, we today in the time travelers is his band. So how old is he? He is

685
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,320
probably fifty no older than that older than that, yeah, because he was doing

686
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,100
shit in the s. I feel like he's when did this book come out? This book is from

687
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,860
twenty twenty one. Okay, so here's our first illustration. This is I just want

688
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,520
to show you this is the vibe of the illustration. The etymology these are

689
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,440
these are kind of moves that he teaches people. You can see there's a lot of

690
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,520
arrows. He uses a lot of symbols and a lot of animals. It looks incredible. Yeah,

691
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,600
These are it's really well done. These are arboreal locomotive hands and body

692
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,100
language projections. It looks a little bit like E. T. Yeah, that's what I

693
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,920
thought. I thought that that was a photo of E. T. I forgot that that's the

694
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,080
cobra. I'm in graduate smoking weed with E. T. I want to do so bad. God, wait a

695
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,640
minute. We have the E. T. Mask over there. We can make this. Let's pause the

696
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,680
episode right now and we're going to do a two man sketch of smoking.

697
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,600
Oh, man.

698
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
He lights a blunt with his finger.

699
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
I eat Reese's Pieces.

700
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Is this his...

701
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Is this a picture of the man?

702
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Yes.

703
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
This guy looks like...

704
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
He looks like he...

705
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
I just picture him...

706
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
When I see somebody like this, I just instantly picture them fucking.

707
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Yeah.

708
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
You know he has the most...

709
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
He's wearing a weighted vest.

710
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,240
And you know he has the most insane

711
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,940
tumors tan of all time yeah. It's amazing yeah like his arm has like a

712
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,840
tumor yeah

713
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,940
he's going so here

714
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,700
yeah.

715
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,500
I'm going to teach you guys a new move. Okay, this is called this is called the

716
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,700
willow leaf block. Okay, I'll read this to you and I'll show you the diagram and

717
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,880
you we can maybe try it out and see if I'd like to try this out yeah. So this

718
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,280
says our arbor a boral locomotive hands and then there's a copyright symbol. The

719
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Yellow tree symbolizes faith, hope. It reassures a warrior by its mere

720
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,720
presence that there will be a path back to where he or she was before any

721
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,020
ensuing battle. Its characteristics and the knowledge of its behavior can

722
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,020
provide calmness under fire, calmness in the form of prudent and metered

723
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,620
sensations of confidence. Its essence will inoculate in any astute observer

724
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,720
a profound feeling of hope and knowing that there will always be healing

725
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,420
mentally and physically as he or she emerges on the other side of a battle.

726
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,720
and then it shows here the willow leaf block. It says willow leaf block and

727
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,120
then a tiny rotate hand up to ninety degrees horizontally opposite way

728
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,660
negative ninety degrees windshield action elbow can move up and down rotate

729
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,000
arm elbow vertically like a pendulum back and forth leaf with like blocks or

730
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,640
slaps

731
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,460
convert to spear hand caster clock attack eleven slash one or convert to

732
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:06,040
back knuckle caster clock attack twelve or twelve F. So wait, so you're waiting

733
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,280
you wave your hand

734
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,000
I think you need to make a more menacing and then you also need to hold your

735
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,120
other hand like this for a counter move, which can convert to a castor spear

736
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,420
hands. This actually could work. Do you think this could be a good technique?

737
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,320
Yeah, because you you block this because okay, you wave your they would have to

738
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,160
have perfect timing to get past it. Yeah, this is called this is called

739
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,240
windshield action. So you're making a shield of wind. Is that is a person in

740
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,180
the they're wearing a gator? I think that's supposed to be him. Yeah, it's him

741
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,420
with shades and a gator.

742
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,940
- The gator is the coolest thing to come out of the pandemic.

743
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,780
- Oh, absolutely.

744
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,060
- When you would see a guy with a gator.

745
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,980
- Is that what that is?

746
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,180
That's what that's called, a gator?

747
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,020
- Yeah.

748
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,840
- Those things are bad-ass.

749
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,380
- They never fit correctly,

750
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,900
so it's always like a little baggy

751
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,380
and they have to keep yanking it up.

752
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,000
- And there was some study that said that like,

753
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,420
they actually spread COVID.

754
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,260
- Yeah.

755
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,660
(laughing)

756
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,500
- I remember that.

757
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,320
That was like the first week of like March.

758
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,620
- The problem is 'cause you see 'em

759
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,700
and you're like, let me wear that shit right now.

760
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,540
- Let me try that on.

761
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,900
- Let me put that on my mouth right now.

762
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,720
I literally want the gator. They're just breathing all of their covet germs into

763
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,240
like the space between their chin and neck, and then when they take it off,

764
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,160
when they get home, it just releases. Yeah,

765
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,280
full much out. Yeah, here's another move. This is an attack move. This is

766
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,560
called toss the tea cup.

767
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,220
Do you need a tea cup in your hand or no? No, the tea cup, I think, is

768
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,380
metaphorically. Yeah, there the tea cup looks like a cloud of smoke. Maybe it

769
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,800
says these do look like coal cush models. Yeah, it's a cool. Yeah, I

770
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,040
They look amazing lunge and lean body toward the right while twisting at

771
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,280
waist clockwise at same time, toss the quote tea cup toward the target inverted

772
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,380
hand acts as plate and all so the hand is the plate. The hand is the plate and

773
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,880
the energy. I just can't help it like as soon as you start reading and just zone

774
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,620
out. It's crazy man. It's like well, it's ideal for a rich hand strike to the area

775
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,220
under the nose or used also as a rich hand strike to an opponent's throat. So

776
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,920
I mean, so you do. Oh, I feel like you're like you're throwing a frisbee. I

777
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,740
think yeah, I guess, but and then the other to try the other hand is holding

778
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,020
straight up kind of like she's has one prayer hand and it says next to it a

779
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,920
picture of a knife and it says knife warning. Oh yeah, that's the whole thing

780
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,760
with this is that you're trying to project power to really it's really more

781
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,800
about scaring the people yeah and it also says danger keep off on her stomach

782
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,020
see that would maybe keep anybody from from attacking you that might be the key

783
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,720
Have you seen this like older, fatter guy on Instagram who like goes into like public spaces

784
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:38,120
and he's like basically like doing that bullshit science of like body language but for spaces?

785
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:43,120
Really like being a target and be like, "Okay, so what information I'm receiving here is

786
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,800
that there's no cameras above like the children's clothes, so that means that this is safe.

787
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,200
But if you go over to the electronics, there's tons of cameras."

788
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,160
So that's a place, a lot of shoplifting.

789
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,520
Like it's just kind of like basic--

790
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,480
- It's feng shui.

791
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,520
- Feng shui, but like he's just noticing stuff

792
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,240
and saying it in like a smart--

793
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,800
- Yeah, yeah.

794
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,280
- I have all this QAnon information

795
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,960
I need to switch over to something.

796
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,320
- 'Cause now that that's over.

797
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,080
Yeah, I mean, I do feel like we'll get

798
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,840
some giant groundswell of amazing art

799
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,620
out of the people who are putting all their energy

800
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,540
in that for so long.

801
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,880
- I mean, yeah, look at this book.

802
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,720
- Yeah, exactly.

803
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,120
- This is fully what QAnon people sublimate

804
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,120
into. I feel like yeah, once they forget about yeah, I mean the goat David

805
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,120
D's, he's dead like Hollywood in the fifties. How there's like a bunch of

806
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,620
German and Jewish expats who came and like did like noire and all that. Yeah,

807
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,440
we'll have that with we'll have that with yeah,

808
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,080
this is also just one text box on this page. This is a woman who's holding both

809
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,640
their hands up and it says willow leaf, willow leaf, and then it says why

810
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,880
willow leaf and not willow tree, willow tree knife at hand edge faces opponent

811
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,980
yellow leaf palm side of knife hand faces opponent and then it says in big

812
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,160
yellow letters with quotes around it. Windy time, that's a special move that

813
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,960
you can actually see this for a second. I just want to leaf through it. He has

814
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,440
so many special. I think I have some good special move stuff marked out in

815
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,000
here. Yeah,

816
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,760
it's it's so everybody at home. This is like how big the text is. It really is

817
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,200
like truly like a freshman in high school. The other thing is, I think that

818
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,900
this book is maybe not supposed to exist because in the front of it, it says, I

819
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,060
it says like I only released this book in an electronic format. So I think this

820
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:28,240
is like an auto printed Amazon thing that he didn't mean to man. I think this

821
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,900
is just supposed to be this is against his will. Yes, logo up here is

822
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,580
incredible. He has such good graphic. Yeah, he's amazing. He is the man. All

823
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,120
right, show us some special attack. Wait a minute. Did you know I might be

824
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,620
talking about a school a little bit here, but this is before my time before

825
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,780
I got to New York, but there was a guy in New York who like made a post. Some

826
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,840
my friends know him and they'll remain nameless, but that he invented a new art

827
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,720
form called stand-up philosophy.

828
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:01,080
And it was like this and then like it was like a blog post and it was like him

829
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,800
detailing like but it's basically like stand-up comedy but you don't have to

830
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,080
have punchlines just go up and like say philosophy and then like everybody was

831
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,400
like commenting below like that's just spoken word.

832
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,480
broken word. Bro, you're ripping off Henry. All you need for a new art form,

833
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,480
though, is just a name for it. Yeah, that's what makes it a new thing. And

834
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,420
that's why everybody here is so lazy in the pornography is stealing our

835
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,280
attention. Every time you open up Instagram, I must be a simp instead of

836
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,200
being, you know, two hundred years ago, each of us would have had at least

837
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,080
fifteen art forms and I would have, I would have been drawing different

838
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,320
kingdoms. Here's what I would have done. You know, the Leonardo da Vinci drew

839
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,560
this naked man. I would have been drawing a naked woman. What the hell is

840
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,780
What the hell was that noise? That's a click. He was trying to, he's playing

841
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,820
Valorant on his computer right now. That's scary. He was looking up

842
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,580
Appalachian Trail earlier. I think that's the Google Doodle for the day.

843
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,540
Huh? The Google Doodle for the day. I don't know what any of that shit is.

844
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,780
I got, I got. You know the Google Doodle? You don't know the Google Doodle?

845
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,740
You know the what? Oh, up in the thing, that's what they call that? Yeah.

846
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,380
It's the special Google. You sound old as hell. You sound. Up in the thing.

847
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,220
Come on, man. Google, Google's like the base, the. You fucking boomer. You

848
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,580
I am. I am. I am a proud boomer. I'm 65 years old. I have 15 classic cars.

849
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,420
Really? Name all your classic cars then.

850
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:27,860
1986 Chevy Caprice, 1984 Chevy Impala, 1986 Cutlass Supreme, 1990 Chevy Cavalier.

851
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,220
These sound like jalopies to me.

852
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:35,940
No, well they're works in progress. Basically, you remember when Tim Allen was

853
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,380
making that fucking car in his house and his wife was such a fucking bitch.

854
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,380
Why doesn't she let him be normal?

855
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,060
She would not let him touch his tools.

856
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,140
Here's my problem with that.

857
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,260
Why are you talking, you're yapping at your husband all the time.

858
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,540
He's on TV, bitch.

859
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,260
Shut the hell up.

860
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,460
Shut the fuck up.

861
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,620
He should have taken a little bit more of a Stephen Crowder approach to her.

862
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,100
Yeah.

863
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,780
He should have been sitting in the living room with a table that said,

864
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,860
I need a beer, change my mind.

865
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:11,960
that video is so funny where he talks to her like she's three years old, like a

866
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,400
dog. He's like no bad wife.

867
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,260
The Steven Crowder video, it's like a ring doorbell video of him in his

868
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,800
backyard and she's like, I'm going to take the car to my sister's and he's

869
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,140
like, no, watch it, watch it, don't take the car. I think she was like, I'm

870
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,820
going to get groceries. Yeah, it was some shit. It was so like innocuous. He

871
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,340
didn't want groceries. He doesn't want groceries. He wants no restaurants. I

872
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,120
sushi yeah, I want to build a restaurant in my house.

873
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,260
Sell sushi at the grocery store. I can get you sushi there. You know I'm

874
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,700
building a restaurant in the basement. Why would we need groceries? How are we

875
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,560
how are we fucking up so bad that he got offered fifty million dollars to do a

876
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,080
podcast and he said not enough money and we barely get offered two or three

877
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,520
million dollars. Yeah, I deal we haven't even have it. We don't even have an

878
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,840
article about us about we need an article so that we need some

879
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:04,500
We're gonna get us an article. We need complete controversy now.

880
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,960
It does feel like any time I try to do anything in show business, I have to like apologize

881
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,160
for it. I have to like, sorry. I'm sorry I wrote this. I'm sorry. I'm a fucking idiot.

882
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,000
I was thinking today about, can you believe that people make stand up comedy show posters

883
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,960
but it has their face on it? Yeah. I can believe, yeah. Why? It's just weird to me. Maybe I'm

884
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,960
just ugly now that I think about it, but I was like, I don't think I'd ever put my face

885
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,480
on something. Alright maybe we need to take a moment right here. Uh-huh. The three, the

886
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,160
two, three of us and let our friend Caleb know that he's, he's, he's, he's looking

887
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:45,720
good. You're handsome man. You got a new haircut. Is it my haircut? Dude your haircut looks, see you just gotta know how to do it up.

888
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,840
How to style it. You just gotta know how to style it. Yeah I got a new haircut. It looks good man.

889
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,080
I went to one of the Turkish barbers, it cracks your back.

890
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,080
so

891
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:00,320
like this. I walked in, they put a bunch of green stuff on my entire body. They

892
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,280
crack my back forty times. They pull on your shoulders and crack your back and

893
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,440
your hair falls out. They cause a cut a couple of my my arteries and then here

894
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:08,560
I

895
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,520
so hard that your blood pressure just

896
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:20,760
the videos of the guy wears a road mic on his arm and he just like punches the

897
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,920
shit out of people and yeah he should be putting leeches on their ears. That guy

898
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,080
haven't seen that guy dude. The turkish have found a way to make they figured out

899
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,680
everything coffee in the center of everything. They're in the center of

900
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,800
europe, africa, asia, they take all the knowledge, literally, literally, they're

901
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,800
a leech of human knowledge. That's why they are leeches. He said this live.

902
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,800
This is going on. They said turkish. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing. What's his

903
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,080
name? The little guy? The little guy is, oh I think he's Chechen. He's Chechen, but he

904
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,560
spends time, he fucks with turkey, right? Yeah, he fucks with turkey. He definitely fucks

905
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,200
with turkey. But what was that chef that fucking, there was Salbe, he's in Bubarak or whatever.

906
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,000
Oh yeah, who like got really sick. He got sick? What? No. I feel like there was an arc of,

907
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,960
the guy that would make the big pots of shit and he would like flip it over. Yeah. And

908
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,400
he smiles? He like. The smiling chef. He got really sick. He burned himself. Really? He

909
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,400
got sick? Yeah. From his food? We're gonna have to see. He ate too much, the smiling

910
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:23,600
He's not called the smiling chef. He does come up. First result for the smiling chef. The

911
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:30,040
smiling chef's sick was an auto-complete of the smiling chef. This was last year? This

912
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,160
was a year ago. Yeah, there was kind of an arc of him. Oh my god. The president of Turkey

913
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:42,800
would come. He got shot? No, he was shot to fame. Yeah, you got to think there's so many,

914
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:49,820
know I guess Ramsey I know but I know so many Salt Bay this guy yeah I feel like

915
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,420
there's another Turkish guy with like a big like he looks like surge from system

916
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,980
of a down and he's got like a big Hassan Piker he's got like a big like curled

917
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,820
mustache oh really is he a chef or a barber what is like a meat sword guy

918
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,940
okay he's making the picanha they don't make picanha there dude they do well he

919
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,180
could be doing that. All right, what do you got for us? So this is he has a bunch of animal

920
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:19,780
styles that he calls calamitous patterns. So yeah, you know, like in this was still

921
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,220
my coffee for that. And they got all the different animals. Yeah, they got this. But he's got

922
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,180
a bunch of different animals. We already did some of these in the last one. So he has obviously

923
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,660
as he has a style, Maria was a tiger style, cobra style, human style. He has to human

924
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:37,860
style was really good. I remember style. These are fighting styles are different fighting

925
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,560
like styles that have special moves, but the one I want to show you today, it

926
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,960
was carpenter and one of them

927
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,560
what is that different? He has two different styles for the African and the

928
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,280
Indian elephant. He has African elephant style and Indian style. They're

929
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,260
different, but this one this is one that I just saw today that has most of them

930
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,320
are like okay. It's like monkey size like monkey fist. You use a surprise

931
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,020
punch. You know it's all it's different moves. I would think that would be human

932
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,920
style human style. You spears and yeah, oh, I remember that use technology. Yeah,

933
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:12,740
This is Dragon style. Oh my God. He developed. And so here are some of the special moves

934
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:18,500
that he writes you can do if you're using Dragon style, Muriwaza. So yeah, to compare,

935
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:25,740
for example, like crane beak is when you use your fingers to peck the throat and eyeballs,

936
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,140
right? Like that. Yeah, exactly like that. Like Kill Bill. I had a fantasy where I did

937
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,660
that to a bear the other day. I had a dream that I was being attacked by a bear last night

938
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,840
and I was punching it in the face. I was sitting on my couch imagining I had to go upstate

939
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,840
for something and then I was sitting there and I was like what if a bear comes and I

940
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,840
was like well I'll simply take his eyes out of it.

941
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,840
It goes up to the car?

942
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,840
Yeah.

943
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
While you're driving upstate?

944
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,640
Did you see the video recently of the guy like shooing a bear out of like.

945
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,400
Oh and the bear scratches him?

946
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Yeah.

947
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
And he's like get out of here!

948
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,400
And he scorns the bear.

949
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,920
He's just some guy in like suburban Philly or whatever.

950
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,600
And he goes up and he's like yeah somebody owes me a beer after that!

951
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Water!

952
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,600
Water!

953
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
I need water.

954
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,860
water. I need water. I need a glass of water. There's a girl that transferred to

955
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,380
my high school from Philly and she'd be like, "So what comes out of the faucet?"

956
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:17,400
And I'd be like, "Water?" And she'd be like, "No! Water!" Why would she be

957
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,140
making fun of herself? She's the only person there who knows- She's trying to

958
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,400
change the world. Who doesn't know how to talk, whatever. She just wanted to be,

959
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,560
there's like, "Oh yeah, that's Philly girl." Dragon Punch, okay, which it says

960
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,160
Dragon Punch and then in parentheses under it, Dragon's Fire Breath. Wow. So

961
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,440
that's you can use fire breath. If you're using dragon style, you can also use

962
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,620
tearing bites, which says dragon eats you. So that's another special move. You can

963
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,580
eat your opponent.

964
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:47,060
They also have straight arm hand slaps, dragon slaps, tail bent wing slaps,

965
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:52,520
dragon protects den, low backward kicks, dragon's escapes, stiff leg wheel kick,

966
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,320
dragon whips tail, and then it also says in big letters at the top, dragon pulls

967
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,000
you to only vanish. Wow, this reminds me of when I was a labourer for

968
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:06,060
construction, I was working for this Irish guy and he was like, "Yeah, I used

969
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,700
to drink with this..." He was like, we were talking about redheads and he was

970
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,740
like, "They're fucking out of their minds." And he was like, "I knew this

971
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:16,820
one redhead in Ireland who got so mad that he was in a bar and he was

972
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:22,460
holding a pint glass and he got so mad like that. And he bit the pint glass.

973
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:27,700
Oh my God. Just to prove how mad he was. And he was like, he just cut his

974
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,500
fucking mouth open so bad. Jesus Christ. That's my favorite prank video.

975
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,740
Have you seen that prank video where the guy goes into a-

976
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,460
No, what did you think of the one I sent you?

977
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,460
Which one did you send?

978
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
Butterstairs.

979
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,460
Oh, Butterstairs.

980
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
What's Butterstairs?

981
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,460
We might have to watch that.

982
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,460
We might have to watch Butterstairs.

983
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,460
I gotta see it.

984
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:49,580
There's a video of some guys where they get the edible glass and they put a Bud Light label

985
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:56,100
on it and they put some empties on a bar and they walk into a bar, they order a drink and

986
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,940
whoever is sitting near the empty glass, they go like, "Hey man, you gonna finish that?"

987
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,640
and the guy's like, No, I'm not going to finish it. And he takes the glass and

988
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,860
just starts eating it in front of

989
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,800
and one of the most of the people are just like, what the fuck like ignore it

990
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,660
and then one of the guys like, Oh my God,

991
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,940
and starts taking out his phone and filming him eating it. He's like he

992
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,860
eating the glass y'all

993
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:21,760
he eating the glass. I found this video on Instagram of this woman

994
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,500
being like, No, I pulled my kids out of the pool. This is fucked up. And then

995
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,080
she like points her camera at the lifeguard.

996
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,360
She's like, "This lifeguard is a A.I."

997
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,200
- Oh yeah.

998
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,920
- I did see that, yeah.

999
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,640
They're doing the, yeah.

1000
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,480
- That's apparently some shit that lifeguards

1001
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,920
are supposed to do to get like to watch the most

1002
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,760
- According to the comments, yeah.

1003
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,320
- This guy is so susceptible.

1004
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,200
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1005
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,800
- According to the comments, what do you mean?

1006
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,640
- You believe the community notes.

1007
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,520
- That was a community note.

1008
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,840
- I bet you believe the community notes.

1009
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,120
- I believe the community note,

1010
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,080
'cause I believe in--

1011
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,720
- Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

1012
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,200
- Yeah, that's the kind of shit

1013
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,860
I push it in the community note, then I believe it. Fuck you. This entire

1014
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,060
section of the book, get the fuck out of here, bitch. I can't right here.

1015
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,100
It's probably about 60 70 pages is I'm not going to read it, but it's

1016
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:12,700
literally just a list of every robbery on an armored car that happened in the

1017
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,000
last

1018
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,660
did you read this whole thing? I did not. I skimmed it. I've read parts of

1019
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,060
it here. I'm going to skip to some of the good parts. Wait, what Connor,

1020
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,960
what do you think of our idea for a sitcom, which is three guys in an

1021
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,840
armored car. Isn't that a good idea? Yeah, really good idea. You think this would make

1022
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,640
it? Three guys who work for Brinks. All right. Spoiler alert for this. If you don't want

1023
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,080
to hear the ending of three guys in an armored car. We had a name for it. I don't remember

1024
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:43,320
what it was. Yeah, what was it? But the last episode, you guys are just chilling and all

1025
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,880
of a sudden you look over to the side, big semi truck comes, hits you. You go into a

1026
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,680
fucking car dealership. All of a sudden there's a shape, shape, charred blow. You guys get

1027
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,640
get robbed in heat. Oh, you are the opening. Oh,

1028
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,960
that's an idea I had when I was a little kid. I had an idea for a movie that's

1029
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,680
about a henchman. It was gonna be called Henchman, and it's about a guy's entire

1030
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,200
life, and he works in organized crime, but he's just like a lowly underling,

1031
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,520
right? And then the end of the movie is he's just like sitting in front of a

1032
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,800
room and like a John Wick guy, like snaps his neck, like the actual main

1033
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,160
character of the world, and then it's just dude, faded black henchman.

1034
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,920
wouldn't that have blown your fucking mind?

1035
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,920
Well, maybe the movie shouldn't have been called Henchman.

1036
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Well, but the entire time you're like, "He's not a henchman, he has a daughter?"

1037
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,920
Maybe it's the type of movie where you don't know the name until the end.

1038
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,920
Yeah, I put a question mark on the poster.

1039
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,920
It's called the Mystery Movie.

1040
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,920
You know what they tried to do with Terminator 2?

1041
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,920
And if you watch it, they tried to make it so you don't know that Arnold's the good guy.

1042
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Yeah.

1043
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,920
Like the first twenty minutes.

1044
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,920
He's the buffest one.

1045
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
Yeah, that's what I usually go by.

1046
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,920
Kind of a good guy.

1047
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,920
Yeah.

1048
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:57,420
But it's kind of, you know, not really henchmen. Henchmen is kind of a one-on-one idea.

1049
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,420
Three guys in an armored car. What is the...

1050
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,420
It's like the office.

1051
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,420
So it's like single cam.

1052
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,420
It's like a comedy.

1053
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,420
Single camera and then one of us is like the bachelor.

1054
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,420
One of us is like the bachelor of the group.

1055
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,420
We've got a little bathroom in there, man.

1056
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,420
No, they just live in it.

1057
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:15,420
Yeah, oh, that's what... yeah, we get the job, the three of us.

1058
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,420
We get evicted.

1059
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,900
and then we get evicted and we're like, "We need a place to stay.

1060
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,580
Armored car, 24 hour security." Okay. Well... And it's parked in a dangerous neighborhood.

1061
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,980
Like, I'm having great episode ideas just sitting here. Yeah. Exactly. Teaming

1062
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,820
with that. What do you have? First, Patrick is... You guys fire him and he's

1063
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:35,180
like, "Well, whatever. You can't evict me." And he uses his part of the

1064
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,820
armored truck to start a food truck. Yep. I think we came up with that. I think

1065
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:42,060
we actually did a food truck. I think we actually did that. Yeah. Oh yeah,

1066
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,660
we were shoving... You're shoving taquitos through the little holes where

1067
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:50,220
Can we get ChatGPT up here? Can we plug? Because I recently did this where I asked

1068
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,820
ChatGPT to come up with a pitch document for a show called "Roommates" and it's

1069
00:59:53,820 --> 01:00:00,100
about Donald Trump and Biden being roommates. Oh my god. In Brooklyn. Yeah.

1070
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:06,020
But what was the other one? There was one episode where one of us is the bachelor

1071
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:10,060
and they're trying to bring home a girl but we're all, it's like, we have to hide.

1072
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:14,960
You have to hide under the money. Yeah, hiding under the money or like being in

1073
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,080
the front of the car. And is this set in New England? This is set in a truck.

1074
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:26,280
Yeah. So anywhere, literally, literally be anywhere. Anywhere that has a road.

1075
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,600
It's mostly under the bridge. Anywhere that's not in the water or the air.

1076
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,560
Just not water, yeah. Yeah. Anywhere that's flat. And honestly, it could be

1077
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,880
in the air. Yeah. I mean, it could be a flying truck if we don't see the

1078
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,120
outside. Drove on one of those. And honestly, it could be an underwater

1079
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,520
truck too. Twist ending. Yeah, if you put a little... Wait. Oh my God, this

1080
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,520
it's completely getting it so well yeah. It does it really well. I mean

1081
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,320
this is great. This is too long. It's way too long. Yeah, we just need a

1082
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,780
synopsis for an episode. I yeah it's

1083
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:58,680
corn honks causing everyone to armor truck is talking in that script. Yeah,

1084
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,740
it's Lisa Mike. Can I can I can I be a can I be an EP on this? Yeah,

1085
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,100
non writing. No, what?

1086
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,880
Come on, you just want the money. Dude, I'll literally use all my X power on

1087
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,760
axe to get this made. I'll be DMing Sarah Cooper.

1088
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,880
If you think we wanna be associated with X... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1089
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,760
That's actually an amazing idea. She has trumped the whole show, right?

1090
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,820
She's trumped the whole show. We're using AI to get Trump's voice so that

1091
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,600
she and we're having him say like, "We gotta get rid of the armored car.

1092
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,400
We don't like the armored car." We don't like the armored car, Joey, folks.

1093
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,920
But she is lip syncing that,

1094
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,840
and that's like this, "Oh my God, we have to watch the State of the

1095
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,240
Union, Sarah Cooper right there on the screen. I do think it's so funny

1096
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,880
Trump. I do think it's so anytime you guys turn on the radio, the armored

1097
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,360
car, it's

1098
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,280
driving around.

1099
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,840
I hate politics. I fucking, we don't even realize it's a

1100
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:00,840
keep the politics out the car. No, what did we say? No politics in the

1101
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,560
car. You guys, the car must be stopped. The car must be

1102
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,940
all the media that is like seen in the background. Yeah, they're all about

1103
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,160
the

1104
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:16,400
every newspaper on every news. Yeah, the weather today. Well, it doesn't matter.

1105
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,160
You're going to be in an armored

1106
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,520
the weather. The it's going to be bright fluorescent in the back of the weather.

1107
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,000
The AC will be on if the car is running

1108
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,880
outside. I think it's a great idea. I think such a great off mic really,

1109
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,040
really deep. This

1110
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,460
our table over there and we're going to be got the white board up and it's

1111
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,940
sitting on a table. It makes sense. Okay, guys, here's what you do in the

1112
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:44,480
hero's journey writing is a racing hero. It doesn't make sense for him to eat

1113
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,440
his own shit. That's what everyone says to me when I try to this is what you've

1114
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,440
all been. This is what you do if you're attacked by a mob. Okay, your house.

1115
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,380
Okay, I'm going to read a few paragraphs. Is it a woke mob? Yes, well,

1116
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:58,040
you'll see absolutely probably just pull up a fucking clip of me playing

1117
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:02,740
posters. Here's what I stream. I designed the civilian anti victimology survival

1118
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,260
scale to provide a private citizen, a series of active slash passive acts and

1119
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:10,300
actions they can enact when faced with a real time physical threat to self

1120
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,900
friends, family or property. These are violent times whereby literal mobs are

1121
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,820
attacking people in places with very nefarious intent. I understand that a

1122
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:23,620
mob of hundreds of people is virtually impossible to defend against and then he

1123
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:28,740
says couch taters, senior citizens, children and the disabled have obvious

1124
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:34,000
limitations. Nonetheless, Murray Waza can even things out by turning disability

1125
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,040
into an ability. Well, because it's so deadly, I guess you can do that. Oh my

1126
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:42,200
God, there was one thing that he let me see if I can find the

1127
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,400
is it the one that's bookmarked? There's something before the one that's

1128
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,960
bookmarked. I think that I learned, but that's okay. If I can't find it anyway,

1129
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,800
they call him this section is headed. They call me Mr. Show off and it says

1130
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,520
the more you show luxury to the outside world and keeping up with the Joneses.

1131
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,920
the more you are putting out a subliminal signal. It's a gold mine in here. A thief will seek

1132
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:08,800
the path of less resistance and try to converge your stuff into theirs, devoid of conveyance,

1133
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:14,120
gratuity, barter, trade, gamble pay, work, or outright purchase. That's the concept.

1134
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,840
Your Honor, they can converge their stuff into mine.

1135
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:23,820
Keep your garage door closed when access is not necessary, for it projects a carnival-like

1136
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:27,000
atmosphere such as one feels at a flea market or a yard sale.

1137
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,440
Especially my shit, dude. I got all these vintage Pac-Man cabinets in my shit.

1138
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:30,940
Oh, man.

1139
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,440
Yeah, your garage is sick.

1140
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,440
I got street shirts.

1141
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,440
My garage is badass.

1142
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,440
I have a fridge. Keep it open.

1143
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,940
I got all these stop signs.

1144
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,940
We have 50 stop signs up in my garage.

1145
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,440
Bunch of just rusty-ass stop signs.

1146
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,440
Bunch of those old Coke cans where they don't have the lip on them.

1147
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,440
One day, those will all be a table.

1148
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,440
Yeah, once I'm done. Once I'm done with my project.

1149
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,940
Don't you remember feeling like a responsibility? Maybe you guys didn't have this so much.

1150
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:56,440
But like a responsibility to not, like, you should not open up your Happy Meal toys.

1151
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,160
those will be worth a lot of money. Yeah, Beanie Babies. Why is it though that

1152
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:06,440
you say the thing about the stop sign table, why is it that like every friend's house that you would

1153
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,920
go up to, like go to their house growing up, you'd always go into the garage to get a soda

1154
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,120
and there would be like their dad would have made like a couch out of shoes. Yeah. And you'd be

1155
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,360
like, "What's that about?" Ah, he just likes doing that. That's dad's new project. I think it's like

1156
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,920
when you are a father, you're essentially castrated. That's like my dad made... You need to put all

1157
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,800
all your energy into something. My friend's dad would make him skateboard obstacles.

1158
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,920
My dad made boxes and stuff to grind.

1159
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,800
My dad took a bunch of wine labels and modged podged them onto a canvas and then started

1160
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:42,560
giving that for like four years in a row as Christmas gifts to people. Just wine that

1161
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,200
he had drank, he'd take the label off and modged podge it and be like, "Here you go,

1162
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,200
mom. Here's all the wine."

1163
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,720
Yeah, you can hang that on the wall.

1164
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,200
My dad did the elevators at the Prudential building in Chicago, did the maintenance for

1165
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,320
him and then he would just like knew the building really well and was friends

1166
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,460
with everybody. So he completely furnished our basement with like a stolen

1167
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:06,720
materials from the brunch room. Like square carpet, like the drop

1168
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:12,800
ceiling, the like wood pan, he just all that was just his whole. He made it look like an elevator.

1169
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:18,560
He can go anywhere if he's the king of the elevator. Yeah, he would always say...

1170
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,960
My uncle did that shit. Your uncle was an elevator guy and he put on the

1171
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,240
on my cousin's closet, he just put the up and down button.

1172
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,240
He installed it.

1173
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,520
Wait, what are the two elevator brands?

1174
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,520
The big ones.

1175
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,520
Otis.

1176
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,520
Otis Schindler and Tiss & Crump.

1177
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,520
Tiss & Crump.

1178
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,520
Oh yeah, which are you?

1179
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,520
What team are you?

1180
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,200
Here's the thing, you bounce around on all of them when you're an elevator mechanic.

1181
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,200
You bounce around?

1182
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Yeah.

1183
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,200
To test them?

1184
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,200
You're like, "Oh, fuck this.

1185
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,200
I'm quitting.

1186
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,200
I'm going over to Schindler."

1187
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,200
Oh, I thought you mean you get in them and you jump a bunch of times to try to see if

1188
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,440
it'll fall.

1189
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,440
No.

1190
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,520
My dad would get in the elevator and rock them back and forth.

1191
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,960
this one's good. This one's good.

1192
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,480
That's the best job ever

1193
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:03,240
try to break this mother fucker next building jumping up in the middle of it.

1194
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:09,020
Here's what you do when the intruders are at your house. Okay, you will need

1195
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:12,140
at least you will need at least three basketballs

1196
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:18,120
a few quote old school clipboards, which will get into what the clipboards we're

1197
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,260
having the boys get run in suicide, three basketballs and some old school

1198
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,460
clipboards. He says

1199
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,820
memorize the following short brief statement to ensure the intruders are

1200
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,820
aware that the police are coming. You are home and they can leave unharmed in

1201
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,680
a loud voice state policea coming

1202
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,780
then throw or bounce the basketball away from you. This will confuse them and

1203
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:43,320
distract their intention. The basketball should not be over inflated. Only have

1204
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,780
enough air to bound to be announced around

1205
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,020
which misspelled you now.

1206
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:53,660
Well, that could be a around a few that is a that is a technique next squat down

1207
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:57,420
bend your knees and yell the following with greater force. Hey boys, they're

1208
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,660
here. Whoa, the use of the term boys communicates to the intruder that there

1209
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,660
is more than two to three dedicated men at the sheltered in place in the house.

1210
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,900
The use of the term there here is even more chilling. So this is like home

1211
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,460
alone when he has a fake party. Exactly. And you throw basketballs to make them

1212
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,340
think that they're people and then the and here's what the clipboard I got a

1213
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:20,380
bunch of NBA players in here. I'll kick your ass. The clipboard is for the

1214
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:26,680
clipboard gunshot sound trick. Oh, where you snap the top of it, but that's

1215
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,460
actually smart.

1216
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:31,960
You have to mark and do not fire closer than one foot to the ear and body

1217
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,240
of the clipboard gunshot, because then they'll know yeah

1218
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,760
then yeah I'll just like I kind of want to just show us some of this stuff.

1219
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,980
This is Gemini clock theory he invented.

1220
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:43,980
Okay.

1221
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,980
Clock theory.

1222
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:45,980
Yeah.

1223
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:49,180
He calls it Gemini clock theory and twin clock theory.

1224
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:53,700
Here's an example how to use Pollock's clock in a stance and this is Malvolio's spider.

1225
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,620
The 12-legged spider acts like the hands of the clock.

1226
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,620
Holy shit.

1227
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:58,620
Malvolio.

1228
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,740
This is him diving into the full, he's going into it.

1229
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,740
Yeah.

1230
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,940
I want to take you guys back to 2003.

1231
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,140
I'm there.

1232
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:16,400
there. Jay-Z is in a big conference room with some record executives and there's a

1233
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,040
skinny little guy that comes in and he starts talking about how he's gonna be

1234
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:25,040
such a great rapper and he gets up on the table he starts rapping along and then

1235
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,100
he leaves and they say that guy's an idiot he's never gonna make it to

1236
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:34,900
anywhere. His name is Kanye West. Oh my god. That's what this guy is. You're saying in

1237
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,800
in ten years. I'm saying it's making such perfect sense to him and society has

1238
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:43,900
not caught up to him yet, because it is like there is some logic or it does

1239
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:48,860
look like he it makes sense in his head. It's incredible. It's Gemini clock

1240
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,860
theory and here's a section on Japanese proverbs.

1241
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:54,920
Wait, isn't he? Is there a good one? I'll read you one right now. Does he

1242
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:00,100
have children? Fifty at least? Yeah, here's his first Japanese proverb. He

1243
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:03,500
has. We are fools whether we dance or not, so we might as well dance

1244
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,920
gas. That's actually kind of cute, old tea and cold rice are bearable, but

1245
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,960
cold looks and cold words are not. That's something you say to your wife. Yeah,

1246
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,320
this is this one. Something you can say when you make my tea that can be cold,

1247
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,360
but the tongue is but three inches long, but it can kill a man six feet tall.

1248
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,560
Wow, going back to booted. Yeah,

1249
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,880
oh my God,

1250
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,280
the bodies are stacking. That's what they sent him to Afghanistan to eat

1251
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:33,120
people's pussies. Yeah, this is his section on compromised organ malfunction.

1252
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,700
okay, where he's talking about his different attacks that you can use on

1253
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,880
different parts of people's bodies. Oh, this is the part I wanted to read. He's

1254
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,980
talking about groin attack. He has a huge section about groin. Oh, come on, he

1255
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:47,280
fights like a girl. Come on now, come on man, can't be getting up.

1256
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,780
Let me read this section about

1257
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:57,380
oh, here we go. De gloving, this is an injury where the scrotum is torn away,

1258
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,080
similar to removing a glove from a hand. A Maria was a grab and twisting attacks

1259
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:05,800
can mimic that. He say you rip someone's nuts off. I think wrote him off the

1260
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,520
balls, right?

1261
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,240
The balls there just

1262
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,600
hitting each other's D. Glove the skin. Yeah, screw it. He also he has a full

1263
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,660
section here on female groin attacks. He says a well placed knee smash kick,

1264
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:20,680
blunt weapon or opportunistic hand slash arm blow to castor six slash Pollux twelve

1265
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,040
groin area is a devastating injury. They'd probably like that shit. The

1266
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,800
vulva includes the labia minora labia majora and clitoris, which are easily

1267
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,660
compromised by a kick or a focus knee smash. Tell me why he knows this shit,

1268
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:35,540
but my dad don't. The perineum is the space between the vaginal opening and the

1269
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:39,680
anus. The perineum is affected primarily by a well placed opportunistic kick or

1270
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:44,060
regular upward knee smash, the latter usually by a short front lunge or snap

1271
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:47,940
kick. So his idea is to somebody attacks you, you start just like fingering them

1272
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,780
and fucking grabbing their ass. That's so weird. Make them kuruwaza, dude. Fight

1273
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:53,740
love, fight hate with love. Oh yeah, then they fall in love with you and then

1274
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,940
they get attached. So, and this is some lore that I just discovered. And then

1275
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:02,160
power over them. This truly cements him, I think, as one of the geniuses of our time

1276
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,360
and one of the most inspiring stories of all time.

1277
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,040
So fellow Mur- he's talking about head injuries. So fellow Mur-Yawazin, be very careful. On

1278
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:16,620
December 26th, that's the day after Christmas, 2019, I tripped, fell, and struck my head,

1279
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:21,520
which caused a debilitating stroke and traumatic brain injury. Several bouts of chemotherapy

1280
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,360
had weakened me. I'm still unable to walk, however I can still teach through the web.

1281
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,360
Thanks, Eddie Voitakoff."

1282
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,360
Wow, this guy.

1283
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,360
He writes it like he's signing off but there's so much left in the book.

1284
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,520
Have you guys ever seen somebody on the computer pretending to be sick?

1285
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,520
Yeah.

1286
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,520
On Facebook or something like that?

1287
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,680
I just re-watched the first Saw movie because the new one came out and I forgot that one

1288
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,640
of the traps that Jigsaw sets in the first movie is literally he puts someone in a thing

1289
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,160
thing where there he covers them in oil and he's going to light them on fire and

1290
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,000
he goes for years. You pretended to be sick.

1291
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,040
Whoa,

1292
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,260
that's one of the things he's punishing somebody for to be sick. Well, now it

1293
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:04,600
is it be left and right go fund me go fraud me defraud defraud you by she's

1294
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,340
got to do something about go fund me yeah. You should shut the whole thing

1295
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,220
down. Yeah,

1296
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:13,020
I'm a certain Biden impressions. We need more Biden impression. This is it.

1297
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,460
This is your fucking walks around y'all bro. You're kind of like a video game.

1298
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,760
Yeah, Jim Carrey famously played him on Saturday Night Live.

1299
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,960
In Sonic the Hedgehog the movie.

1300
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,260
I got recommended something on Instagram where they're like,

1301
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:30,460
it's still Jim Carrey. Like Jim Carrey is actually playing him for real.

1302
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,560
Yeah, like a guy that's like, yeah.

1303
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,860
He's doing an amazing job.

1304
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,660
I've heard there's three or four.

1305
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,560
He's wearing a, he's wearing a skin suit.

1306
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,960
Who's the, who's the senator, the big ugly troll that they say?

1307
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,460
Federman.

1308
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,760
They change his head.

1309
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,360
Yeah.

1310
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:42,860
What?

1311
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,860
They took his mustache off and put it on his beard.

1312
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,660
They screwed his head off.

1313
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:49,540
Why I mean yeah, that's what I always pop it off like a Lego man. What is he

1314
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:54,200
doing where they're like we need to change his head? Yeah, so make it like

1315
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,820
different like he has depression, so they probably took it off and we're

1316
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:00,120
messing around. They're probably trying to solve it with a magnet. How does that

1317
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:04,420
work? So you're pulling all the metals out that make you depressed, all the

1318
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,060
hard metals, cadmium,

1319
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,420
the surface.

1320
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:12,500
The last thing is the last thing in this book, this last section, this from here

1321
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,220
to the end. All of this is a quiz.

1322
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:20,620
about what's in the book. Oh my God, all multiple choice quiz questions with no

1323
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:24,900
answer. No answers list. Ask me one. I bet I'll get it. I bet I'll get it. You

1324
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:28,020
don't even need the key. Okay, let's see here. Just have me one question. I got

1325
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:28,260
you

1326
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:35,300
number question number twenty. Okay, nervous people often began to speak

1327
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:41,820
faster than normal. What are the answer a yes or be no that's a no man nervous

1328
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:44,560
people they shut down as soon as you start talking to him. We don't know

1329
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,060
there's no answer. I guess we'll never know. Did you try flipping the book

1330
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:52,000
upside down? Maybe there's an answer key. There's no answer key here. Maybe

1331
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,060
you email him afterwards. Oh yeah, contact him, get the answer key. Okay,

1332
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:00,140
here's one for you. Okay, you are roused in the middle of the night to someone

1333
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:04,980
inside your house. What level in the CASS system can you immediately enter?

1334
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:13,780
A level three B level seven C level eight or D level six was my training seven.

1335
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,100
Okay, I'm not at eight yet. Well, we again we can't

1336
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:22,080
neither confirm nor deny. Yeah, just you escalate it pretty fast. Yeah

1337
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,500
escalations

1338
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:31,900
this everybody in the eighteen hundreds was like this guy yeah and like now

1339
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:35,580
Now we're now it's all coming back. We only think that this guy is crazy

1340
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,620
because he tried to make a martial art in twenty twenty one instead of back in

1341
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:42,060
the day. If you had said a hundred years ago, the way this is called a karate

1342
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:45,780
chop. Yeah, you invent a karate chop. You go like this. You finger people when

1343
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,940
they attack you, you throw basketballs to make to make them distracted. They'd

1344
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,420
say, what the hell is a basketball?

1345
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,500
It would have

1346
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:57,980
isn't born yet. This guy two hundred years ago would just be like in Illinois

1347
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,480
thing like this is okay. We're going to call this rant to Illinois. I'm the

1348
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,120
mayor, yeah, exactly, and this is what the and everyone's like, I guess we have

1349
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:06,880
to do what he says.

1350
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,320
Anybody who ran against Lincoln, everyone just attacking each other, it would have

1351
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,200
just been like you want to die a much worse death.

1352
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:18,420
Any person who covered their eyes with sunglasses or whatever the past version

1353
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,260
of sunglasses were and couldn't walk probably commanded like seven hundred

1354
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,560
people, yeah, because they're scary. You never know what they're capable of. They

1355
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,100
haven't entered. That's what people would be like. This man has like a

1356
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,160
bewitching energy. They just meant that he wore dark clothing.

1357
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,600
That's what I was thinking about. I mean, there's no wonder his stuff is so sexual

1358
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,120
because can you imagine you're attacking him and he fingers you and puts your own dick

1359
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,120
in your own ass. He literally calls those attacks, he calls them insertion attacks.

1360
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,800
Yeah, makes you fall in love. And then he's, yeah, once you fall in love with him, he's

1361
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:48,040
making you drop out of college and do just anything for him. You're moving across country.

1362
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,800
You get like his name branded on you. You're following him on tour. You're like, do you

1363
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,720
want to go to some NXIVM cult that he started? Yeah, you love watching his stand-up sets.

1364
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:02,040
Mr. Russell Brand. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that what D'Elia did? Yeah. Making girls get tattoos.

1365
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:08,360
Yeah. He had like a whole sex. He had sex in his bedroom, I hear. These guys, they dream

1366
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:13,120
too big. They try to build up to having a whole island. Nobody would, they wouldn't

1367
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,000
find out if you weren't trying to make all, if you weren't trying to turn your weird sex

1368
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,240
stuff into a big thing. Exactly. Leave it in the locker room, man. This is the hope

1369
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,240
Leto.

1370
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,880
These guys can go do this stuff in the metaverse.

1371
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,080
In front of thousands of little kids who actually got an Oculus.

1372
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,080
I don't give a shit.

1373
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,080
It's fine.

1374
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,840
Let Jared Leto run around there, his dick out in his Morbius suit.

1375
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,840
Yeah, let him do his thing, man.

1376
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,840
Remember Mordecai?

1377
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
Mordecai.

1378
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,840
Johnny Depp.

1379
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,840
Oh, yes, yes.

1380
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,840
Twirly mustache Johnny Depp.

1381
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,840
Comedy.

1382
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,840
It was a comedy of Johnny Depp.

1383
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,840
2015.

1384
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,840
It was going up.

1385
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,840
That movie was going up against The Force Awakens.

1386
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:57,480
was it had no shot. It's trying to be funny. It was was it on that Rango style.

1387
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,000
It was more to die and you know what would happen is these movies would come

1388
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,200
out and then it would be like kind of like a safe target for like late night

1389
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,040
comedy shows where they can make fun of like okay. This is a bomb. They're

1390
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,400
putting it out in January. We can pile up like chappy was one more to Chi.

1391
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,280
They're all like burned into my brain. Chappy was fucking just because I

1392
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,640
remember being like people worked hard on that. Why are you making fun of it?

1393
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,640
That's right. What a nice guy.

1394
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,640
We can make fun of Chappie, but we can't like, you know...

1395
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,640
But we can't go to war in Iraq again, man.

1396
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,640
Because we have so much knowledge of how to do it right.

1397
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,640
Exactly. Why are we wasting our time with these movies, man?

1398
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,640
These late night jokes? We should be doing late night rallies.

1399
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,640
We should be doing...

1400
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:39,640
We should be rallying our citizens to all get on a plane, fly over to Iraq right now,

1401
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,640
and we'll do that shit right.

1402
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,640
Don't drop bombs, drop me.

1403
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,740
late night jokes, all this roasting going on on late night, late night, we should

1404
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:51,260
be asleep. That's a good point, man. We gotta get six, twelve hours, sixteen guys

1405
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,800
from bedtime inflation, seven PM to seven AM. I'm talking some bedtime

1406
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,600
inflation, you know what I mean?

1407
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,300
Blood. Yeah, dude, inflate a little pool and sit in it. Blowing bubbles in my

1408
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,780
penis. Yeah, get these, get sixteen guys from Saugus, Massachusetts to get on a

1409
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:10,380
plane, all edging together on the flight over to Iraq. I think the moment that

1410
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,540
people from Saugus and people from Saudi Arabia realized that their places share

1411
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:17,760
the first same three letters. They're going to change the world in the world.

1412
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,440
Okay, so there's a cataclysmic event, Joe Biden's brain explodes live on TV,

1413
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,840
it's been revealed that it's just nothing but vanilla ice cream. The world

1414
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,800
goes into hell verse and the United States breaks up into different sections.

1415
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:34,720
New England and the Midwest, are they allies? They're allies. Really? What are

1416
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:40,040
they allies of? Fighting against, you know, South. Well, South is cool. Well,

1417
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,960
We talked about this before we've talked about civil war two. We talked about

1418
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,940
this a couple of weeks ago, but it's over what would it be? I mean probably

1419
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:51,560
over like ashes to like cedar point and theme parks. Oh,

1420
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:57,960
it's gonna be over restaurant. They're trying to get they're trying to get fun

1421
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,600
spot out of Laconia, New Hampshire. They want the world's biggest arcade in the

1422
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,640
south and cedar point.

1423
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:07,760
Oh my God, that's what the civil war two it's gonna be over the fast food

1424
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,300
places and in California they're going to be having the in and out their

1425
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:15,560
soldiers are going to be relaxed and lax and lazy and sloth to much and a

1426
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,060
beef, too much beef, too much smoking weed and then going to in and out, but

1427
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:22,820
up in New England we got the dunks. We got we're basically going to have like

1428
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:25,860
Jacob's ladder and Kelly's roast beef soldiers true

1429
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:29,940
honey do crazy. Now why don't you two talk like

1430
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:33,060
Kenneth Banna? What's his name?

1431
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:38,860
Mr. Feeney? No fucking... You want us to have Boston Brahmin accents? I want you to talk

1432
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:41,620
like Ben Affleck from the Dunkin Donuts commercial. I'm pissed off because my dad had a Boston

1433
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:45,280
accent when he was a kid and he trained it out of himself before I was born, so I could

1434
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,860
have probably had one. You met my whole family. It got stolen away from me. Patrick's mom

1435
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:55,380
is a baddie. Yep, so true. Thank you, man. She's a baddie. Thank you. Yes, we've had

1436
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,900
it confirmed by somebody who's not doing it to me. It's been confirmed by a celebrity.

1437
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:03,220
Yeah, it's been confirmed by my fucking eyes. Well, first of all, Patrick opened for me

1438
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,860
in Boston, which was nice, but we drove around his old neighborhood and he was

1439
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:09,380
like, "Man, whoa, I can't change so much." And I was like, "Oh yeah?" He's like, "Yeah,

1440
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:16,980
that... I can't believe that CVS is closed. I used to go there." And that, man, that 7-Eleven is...

1441
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:21,300
Oh, I would like go there and get Gatorade. Yeah, he's got to be the worst

1442
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,900
person to travel with ever. And it was like a moment where I was like, "Oh yeah, you're like 12."

1443
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:30,260
The world has like not changed that much. No, no, no. The neighborhood is different though.

1444
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,260
My old neighborhood.

1445
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,260
Great Scott's gone.

1446
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,260
I played there once.

1447
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,260
Yeah, I saw you there.

1448
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,260
Yeah.

1449
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,260
But...

1450
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,260
The Blueberry Tour.

1451
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,260
I saw you on that one.

1452
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,260
Blueberry Tour.

1453
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,260
There was...

1454
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,260
Oh, yeah.

1455
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:46,780
When your mom said to me after your show, she was like, "I actually liked it.

1456
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:47,780
I was really surprised."

1457
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:48,780
I wasn't expecting to like it.

1458
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,780
I was like, "Oh, thank you.

1459
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:50,780
That's very honest of you."

1460
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:56,700
She was like, "I didn't think I would get it."

1461
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,780
Not only is she bad, y'all, she's nice, too.

1462
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:59,780
She's nice.

1463
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:00,900
Which is good to hang out with.

1464
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:08,660
That was, my youngest brother, two days before that, called me and was like, "Yeah, I want

1465
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:11,820
to see your show, but I don't know.

1466
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:16,200
I was working in this basement of this retirement home, and I guess there was a huge carbon

1467
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,700
monoxide leak.

1468
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,700
I don't remember.

1469
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:19,700
I woke up in the hospital."

1470
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:20,700
Oh, yeah.

1471
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,180
He had carbon monoxide poisoning.

1472
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,180
I forgot about that.

1473
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,500
It was so bad that like...

1474
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,420
But then he fucking showed up to the show still.

1475
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:34,420
he like just got out of the hospital and was like, he couldn't fucking, we were

1476
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:37,960
like talking to him afterwards, just sitting there just like, yeah, I don't

1477
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,460
know man.

1478
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:43,920
That reminds me of my friend from high school, this guy named Uchwald, Polish

1479
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,140
guy, doesn't matter. We're in Ridgewood, so watch out, they got shooters. Hey

1480
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,880
man, I'm from Chicago, so watch out.

1481
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,660
That's the new Civil War.

1482
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,780
Polish gangs on Obla.

1483
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,940
holding the gun backwards. Hey, come on. What are you doing?

1484
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:05,940
Oh my God, screen door butterfly doors.

1485
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:13,420
Me and Dan Licata had a, trying to come up with new Polish jokes and we were trying to

1486
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:20,020
figure out something where they, like, you ever see somebody eating a CD-ROM? Yeah, that's

1487
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:27,900
a Polish guy eating a Norton antivirus. But my friend Uchwald was a lifeguard in

1488
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,700
Chicago and he saved somebody from drowning and the person was

1489
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,660
developmentally disabled and he pulled him out of the water and Uchwald was

1490
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:39,100
like kind of fucked up by this. He was like revived them on the beach and like

1491
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,500
brought them back to life and it was like kind of crazy and he just was like you

1492
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:48,180
know it's exhausting to like go in the water to pull out another body and he was

1493
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:53,420
just like sitting there kind of grappling with like I just saved somebody and I

1494
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:56,980
have no idea like just kind of like feeling cut. He was like a teenager too

1495
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:04,060
and the guy that he saved was was sitting next to him and the paramedic was like

1496
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:09,740
so how you doing to the guy and he went not too good I drowned it today.

1497

and watch a spoopy movie.

1533
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:08,140
And then I said, because you text me something like this pretty much every day, and I responded

1534
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:11,900
Can you read the text I sent you before that?

1535
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,820
Yeah, hold on.

1536
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,780
I responded and I said /srs?

1537
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:19,220
Because I wanted to.

1538
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,220
But why didn't you tell me that?

1539
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:23,620
Because I wanted to have a conversation about what soup we would eat.

1540
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:27,780
I was trying to set up back here so that it wouldn't be on my computer all episode.

1541
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,260
Too busy to send one text?

1542
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:33,260
It was really hectic over here.

1543
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,900
before this weather literally makes me want to eat good soup and watch a scary movie popcorn

1544
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:43,340
emoji. Before this he said, "Bruh, what did I eat last night? My diarara smells so bad."

1545
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:52,340
Skull laughing, crying laughing emoji. Diarara. Diarara. And then before that I said, "Bubes

1546
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,700
or badonkadonks?" And he said, "Broher hair."

1547
01:26:54,700 --> 01:27:00,340
[laughter]

1548
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,820
I hate you.

1549
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:08,060
We okay so the funniest thing about that the my the my mindset when I text this stuff is

1550
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:15,500
that we are co-workers and imagine getting like imagine you work at a restaurant right

1551
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:19,620
and you're like basically we're at a restaurant yeah pretty much this is a restaurant.

1552
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:25,960
Here's another one the room is like the worst the best worst movie of all time.

1553
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,180
So we're co-workers and imagine you're at a restaurant and you give your co-worker like

1554
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:33,460
your phone number because you like hung it you smoked in his car or something

1555
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:40,420
yeah and then he just texts me the room is trying to trying to become like

1556
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:47,340
better friends with you yeah the talking period the talking period the period of

1557
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:52,020
co-worker I have been in a talking phase with every manager I've ever had never

1558
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:58,140
gone but they are brutal yeah hey ever get a nickname from your man they're

1559
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,780
- They put you in the talking phase and they're like,

01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,580
hey, Kathleen called out sick,

1561
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:05,100
