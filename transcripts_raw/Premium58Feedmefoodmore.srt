I lie down in the bathtub.

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
I go down the stairs.

98
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,780
Yeah, across the street there's a bench.

99
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,780
Yeah.

100
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,780
I can sit here.

101
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,420
I have a great place to hide.

102
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,740
I would never tell you where I hide though.

103
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,740
Where would you hide it?

104
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
The attic.

105
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
*laughter*

106
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,740
You immediately told me dude.

107
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
This is terrible security.

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,740
This is like the worst episode of the show right now.

109
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,740
What do you mean?

110
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
You're like blowing up your whole spot.

111
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
You fucking spoiled the Mandalorian.

112
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
So if anyone's angry about Patrick spoiling the Mandalorian,

113
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,740
you know exactly where to find the chips.

114
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Go to that, excuse me.

115
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,740
I just thought it was crazy that they had Anthony Anderson on.

116
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,740
I don't know if Anthony Anderson is.

117
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
You probably could have stopped at that.

118
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
I said to him.

119
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
He doesn't kill himself.

120
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
He does. He commits suicide.

121
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,740
He doesn't kill himself. No.

122
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,740
He does suicide by cop.

123
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,740
He does.

124
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,740
At the end.

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,740
They take, um, what's his name?

126
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,740
The guy who played Gus Fring.

127
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,740
The guy who played Gus Fring.

128
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
I mean, I already spoiled it.

129
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
Why not just keep going?

130
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Might as well spoil every TV show.

131
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,740
Speaking of Gus Fring, what happened to the name of Breaking Bad?

132
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:28,180
that

133
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,540

134
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,680

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,180

like I feel like every single amusement park I've ever been to someone has told

182
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,660
me you know a kid lost his hat under one of these rides oh yeah I need to get it

183
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,960
and he got his head that was six like chopped off that was six like that one

184
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,640
Superman ride though it happened at every know that water slide where the

185
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,320
kid got get decapitated you know like most fucked up stories I've ever heard

186
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,840
dude tell it to me the kid was going down a water I forget which park it was

187
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,320
at but it was like a it was like a bring your kid to work day so that like this

188
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,480
kid was going down a water slide and like he was like below the weight limit

189
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,480
or something so he was like bouncing around in the water slide and there's

190
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,900
like a net and he bounced up and that like like there's a net with like a

191
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,760
metal bar and he bounced up and his neck hit the metal bar and his head flew off

192
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,920
like into the air and the like his whole family and just a bunch of people just

193
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,320
all waiting at the bottom of the water slide and they're just like waiting and

194
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,080
and they just saw just a bunch of blood come down

195
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,280
and then just his headless body.

196
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
- Whoa.

197
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
- I would hate that.

198
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
- It's like insanely like so--

199
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,680
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

200
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,400
- I couldn't handle that.

201
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,440
- His whole family dude, like his siblings and everything.

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,520
- If that didn't happen, if that happened to my son,

203
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,000
I probably wouldn't play video games for like two years.

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
- Yeah.

205
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,680
(laughing)

206
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,500
- I'm serious.

207
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,340
- That's it, two years?

208
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,180
- He's so upset.

209
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,020
Yeah, I mean I do that.

210
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,840
- I mean, yeah.

211
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,440
- Granddad thought of six as boss.

212
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
- Yeah, I knew I came out.

213
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,880
- I hate people in that decapitation.

214
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,720
- Yeah, God, I beg to hate that.

215
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,000
I did. You just got decapitated. I did. No, but the, uh,

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,560
the, uh, six flags, decapitation, the guy with the hat,

217
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,720
that was at the, uh, that was at six flags, New England.

218
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,080
See, that's what I mean. I think I couldn't go to,

219
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,480
I couldn't go to amusement parks until I was 13 because of that.

220
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,080
Cause they thought that you, why did you buy mom?

221
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,960
No. Okay. You know what?

222
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
Also, your mom, I don't believe anything that she has ever said.

223
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,840
You know why I couldn't go to amusement parks until I was 13?

224
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,160
Is she saw a psychic and the psychic told her

225
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,480
that I was going to have an accident at an amusement park.

226
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,160
So until I was 13, until I was 13, I was like, Mom,

227
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,080
you know, all that's bullshit.

228
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,280
Let me go to Canby Lake.

229
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,160
The future. You did facts and logic on your mom when you turned 13.

230
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,920
let you know when I was 12 when I was 12 because I went to change that story.

231
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
This is all a lie.

232
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,420
It's not all.

233
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,860
I would.

234
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Oh, you know, my mom well enough, you're lying.

235
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,820
Psychic told her something.

236
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,100
She would believe it.

237
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,920
You are. Look me in the eyes and tell me you're not lying.

238
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm not lying.

239
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,600
Why do you have your tongue out?

240
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,860
I always do.

241
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,060
I call them retriever.

242
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,060
I'm reading this article about that kid who got decapitated on the water slide.

243
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,060
It was in Kansas and there's the guy the the owner of

244
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Schlitterbahn water parks and resorts.

245
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,560
All right.

246
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,260
Well, all right.

247
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,760
That was it says like that.

248
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,860
They that they built like a prototype of the water slide without like

249
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,060
testing it and they knew it was dangerous and it says mr.

250
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,760
Henry who is also one of the water slides designers expressed concerns

251
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,160
before the slide open that he could be hurt or killed riding it.

252
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
According to records obtained by investigators.

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,460
it is a seriously dangerous piece of equipment today because there are

254
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,720
things we don't know about it the indictment quoted him as saying

255
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,680
there are things we don't know about it do you think that news stories what john

256
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,440
how john Knoxville got the idea for action point

257
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,660
yes

258
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,100
is exactly it

259
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,560
i'm gonna do that

260
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,800
and then he did see did you see there was already two accidents on the set a jack

261
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,920
ass

262
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,000
uh...

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,400
no i get going on our jackass dude

264
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,880
Yeah, yeah, they're gonna beat us.

265
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,440
They're gonna beat us to jackass for dude.

266
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,800
We have to beat them.

267
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,600
Well, let's think of some stunts we could do.

268
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay. Okay.

269
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,320
What if we get like a crane, right?

270
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,140
And we bring it up like--

271
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,760
I like where this is going already.

272
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
We bring it like the biggest crane in the world,

273
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,840
like thousands of feet in the air.

274
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
A mile.

275
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,400
A mile in the air, maybe a mile and a half in the air.

276
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,520
Two miles.

277
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,280
We're gonna put Pat in the crane.

278
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,120
No, why do I have to be in the crane?

279
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,480
It'll be like, just shut up.

280
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,400
No, I don't like heights.

281
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
I'll throw up.

282
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,060
Shut up, please shut up.

283
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,900
I'll throw up.

284
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,720
- No, that's okay.

285
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,560
That'll make it funnier.

286
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,940
- Because of the ending, it won't matter.

287
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,360
- No, I'll throw up.

288
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
I can't do this.

289
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
I have to quit.

290
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,140
I have to quit this.

291
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,060
I have to quit.

292
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,260
I have to quit Jackass 4.

293
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,060
- After doing a podcast and we get to get your money from it?

294
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,020
- No, no, I have to quit Jackass 4.

295
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,280
'Cause I'm gonna throw up.

296
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,420
- Can you let me finish?

297
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Okay, you have a blindfold on.

298
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,260
- I'm already gonna throw up.

299
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,180
- You have a blindfold on, you won't even see it.

300
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,540
- No, but I know that I'll be up there and I'll throw up.

301
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,580
- You're a mile in the air.

302
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,820
- I'm gonna throw up.

303
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,880
a claw machine type situation,

304
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,480
and then I get to press a big button

305
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,580
and it just drops you.

306
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,580
- That was what we had to get through all that

307
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,500
just for that?

308
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
- And then you die.

309
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,260
- Patrick's trying to make himself throw up.

310
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,340
- I don't wanna do it!

311
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,620
I don't wanna throw up!

312
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,820
- Okay, how about this?

313
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,660
- I don't wanna throw up,

314
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,380
but I'm gonna have to do it through a point.

315
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,300
- This is better, this is better.

316
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,820
We put you in a cannon, right?

317
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,660
- Okay, cannon I can do.

318
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,200
- And we aim you at the sky,

319
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,640
and we shoot you into the sky.

320
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,040
Where do I land?

321
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,080
The ground.

322
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
How about this?

323
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
We get a crane

324
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,000
one inch tall

325
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,960
so he doesn't throw up.

326
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,240
One inch tall

327
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,840
with a fifty foot crane. That's what I was going to say.

328
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,260
We lift that crane

329
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,120
to a mile. Okay, no, we take the one inch crane

330
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,000
we shoot that out of a cannon.

331
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,820
okay then he's technically he's only lifted one inch off the ground even

332
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,540
though he's launched into the sky

333
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,400
if you think about it in a technical sense

334
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,440
what if we shove you in a volcano? what if we shoot you into a cannon and you get caught by a crane

335
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,120
that'd be a cool stunt

336
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,520
I think claw stunts are cool

337
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,520
every stunt has to involve either a cannon or a crane

338
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm gonna put you in a field and you're gonna be a human scarecrow

339
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,580
oh ho ho, okay

340
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,340
yeah what we're doing we have a funny like a funnier thing

341
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,200
like a uh... you don't have a brain

342
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,780
no no but do we have like a 'cause you know like

343
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,640
what like

344
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,660
in jackass they'll have like a thing

345
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,940
but do we have a funnier thing than a crow?

346
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,260
okay alright but do we have a funnier thing than a crow?

347
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,780
than a crow. There's nothing funnier than a crow. We put crow food on your balls and they

348
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:32,380
have to come eat it off. There's nothing funnier than a crow. Alright, you know what Cameron?

349
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,740
That's real shit. I didn't think about that. What do you even mean by that Patrick? He's

350
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,780
saying like could we replace the crows with like toucans. Yeah, no, you know like in Jackass.

351
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,780
and

352
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,780
I was on your side for a minute.

353
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,060
No, but you know, can it be like Jack in the boxes?

354
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,620
Maybe that'd be pretty funny.

355
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,780
No, you know, like Jack ass like, like there's got to be some gay twist to it.

356
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,500
Like Margera sitting on the, uh, the, the hammer, the carnival hammer thing.

357
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,840
You are the twist.

358
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,700
You are the gay twist in this scenario.

359
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,820
I'm the gay twist.

360
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,540
So it's the, so the, so the stunt is called the gay scarecrow.

361
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Yes.

362
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,100
You just and you look at the crows and you say hey

363
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,840
And they all fly away. I love that. I'm honestly I'm on board

364
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,260
All right. Do you have anything to add to jackass 4?

365
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,540
Also you're gonna be on a hundred foot crane when you do that

366
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
No!

367
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,740
Yeah you're on a stick in the field that's a thousand miles in the air

368
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,100
You're on the edge of the atmosphere. Yeah, and the crows are being shot at you out of a cannon

369
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,820
It sucks

370
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Yeah, I've got

371
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,780
Hmm

372
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,300
So what if we get like a little person that looks like Caleb

373
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,500
not hard

374
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,940
And put them on I could just get surgery

375
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,580
Okay. All right. We make a tiny we make sure we shrink a cut

376
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,780
I think you could do that right just cut my spine down and my arms down and my legs down and

377
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,900
you can donate those to like

378
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,820
And make my head bigger yeah, yeah, yeah, so

379
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,200
So we do that and

380
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,800
So get the little Caleb and then we put him on a crane

381
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,260
I'm fine with that. Yeah, it doesn't bother me thinking about Caleb on a crane and

382
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,900
we drop the crane into

383
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,140
Into a piece of into crap

384
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,440
I can in big enough to shoot a crane

385
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,980
Yeah, I agree that would have been really scary in world. Yeah

386
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,140
Yeah, we're shooting cranes

387
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:02,180
Yeah, the axis. Yeah. Well the Germans the Germans are shooting cranes at us and you want to know what's in the crane

388
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:09,840
Nazi Hitler. Oh my god. Yeah, and he's gonna use the crane to start picking people up. I'm not

389
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:17,620
Places they would have won the war if they just like put Hitler on the front lines. I wish I'd gotten really psyched out. Yeah

390
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:28,380
Like the medieval warfare thing where you just like use a catapult to shoot stinky stuff at your enemies

391
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,940
Just like they were just like rotten fish and stuff cuz they're like this will really grow

392
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,080
We surrender

393
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,080
he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

397
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:17,520
the

398
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,360
and native americans had to teach them

399
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,600
that rules

400
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,000
it's just so funny to select the i'd just don't understand like this we're

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
like fetishes patient that is a jaded with the big

402
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,580
but you have to get their time for a durst is a soon

403
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,680
this is a

404
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
of like

405
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,080
other races

406
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,880
to a point where it's like

407
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,080
we were so stupid

408
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,800
as white people were so stupid until these magic white people are superior to

409
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:53,800
the other

410
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,160
that's what you're saying

411
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,100
that's what you're saying

412
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,500
i'm so i'm saying what you're saying

413
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,420
i'm not saying i'm just saying what you're saying

414
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,060
okay patrick stupid

415
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,260
you saying what i'm saying

416
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,560
yeah i think uh...

417
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,960
i i i i think they have probably could have invented if no one told me about it

418
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,840
i probably like i would have done it by accident the thing about the people are

419
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,800
but i bet that like in the sixteen hundreds a bunch of people were trying

420
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,960
to invent bathing but every time they went into the river like this got bit by

421
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,280
a snake

422
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,400
through which i have been bathing but then they would keep throwing like

423
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,920
onions and carrots yeah yeah i couldn't lose a little bit of a little bit of a

424
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,280
group of myself

425
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
I was in the water.

426
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
It was trial and error.

427
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
And the Native Americans, they were mad smart.

428
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,280
They like didn't put a single piece of doo-doo on themselves when they were bathing.

429
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
No, they put no poop in it.

430
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Yeah, that was like a new sort of invention.

431
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
You know?

432
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
That was like their version of jazz.

433
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Yeah.

434
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
The thing about the bathing thing is like,

435
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
I'm sure people did bathe, but also like in London,

436
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
they were just, in the fucking like 1900s,

437
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
they were just like pooping on the street.

438
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,280
there

439
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:32,800
on

440
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,760
on your own the street like you gotta be pretty shameless to do that now

441
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,780
okay

442
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,960
and that's how that's also what people thought that that that's how you got

443
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,900
sick was just because it smelled so bad in the city

444
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,200
because it is a male yeah they thought it was they thought it was smells that

445
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,120
may be sick

446
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,800
probably a little chance when they put that's where they had the plague doctor

447
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,760
masks with the uh...

448
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,560
to my bathroom and it's not a six sometime

449
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,480
it puts them down and walk into my bathroom and i'm like

450
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,880
i need to go to the doctor

451
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,640
i guess this is making me smell like a so sick or for we recorded i

452
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
i took a

453
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,620
i think the new key you want this to be just like a nasty disgusting show

454
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,480
where you talk about your shit all the time is that what you want? is that the direction

455
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,000
you want to go in? i don't talk about my shit nearly as much as you. me neither. i never talk about my shit.

456

Would you let him fuck your mom?

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
No.

Why?

505
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,600
Well, your mom would not do it, but him.

506
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,280
It's not my place to let anyone do anything in this world.

507
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Exactly.

508
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
That's actually so savage.

509
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah.

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Wow.

511
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,680

I do.

513
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Really?

514
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Yeah.

515
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
It should be called The Monk.

516
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
It's on.

517
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
It should be like a cool white monk.

518
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
It's called Monk.

519
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Yeah, that'd be perfect.

520
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Yeah.

521
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:46,120
Well, you guys have never seen my show Columbo.

524
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880

It was a voodoo magic man living there, but I discovered it first.

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,880
He turned me into a frog.

I want to do that so like what like the Rock Gods of yesteryear

597
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,460
We could go to do it like a world tour and just have like two people come to every show

598
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,820
We could have like a Van Halen style rider too and just be like

599
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,820
Dude, and we could have a van and we could drive across the world.

600
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
I'd love to be a diva.

601
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,820
We should, we gotta get some roadies dude.

602
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
What are they called?

604
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,220
I'm gonna be the biggest diva on the whole tour.

605
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,580
Yeah where you already are.

606
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,820
Patrick, Patrick you have to be on the show.

607
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,500
I'm not going out until I get six hamburgers.

608
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,660
I'm not going out until my dad hugs me.

609
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,620
Dude, the record label's gonna drop us.

610
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,780
He's thousands of miles away, Patrick.

611
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,780
I'm not gonna move until I get five dollars.

612
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
You have to pay me up front for this show.

613
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,740
We spent all your darn money on hamburgers for you.

614
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,860
I'm not coming out on stage until you say hello to me.

615
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Yep.

616
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Where's my hug?

617
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
That's all I'm asking.

618
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
Where my hug at?

619
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,940
I just want you to listen to my problems for a little bit.

620
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,940
- You have to listen to my EP and then I will come out.

621
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,860
I've been working on EP over the entire tour.

622
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,160
It's techno, it's techno jazz industrial.

623
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,820
It's six hours long, it's terrible.

624
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,500
You have to listen to it and then I'll come out.

625
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,800
- And you have these audio engineers

626
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,620
playing other people's music before the show.

627
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,700
What's that?

628
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,540
- Yeah.

629
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,360
- What's that about, man?

630
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,320
What is that? We're here for our music.

631
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,760
You should be playing an episode of the podcast before we come out as a warm up.

632
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,640
And what is this? We weren't good enough for you? You got a band to play before us?

633
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,660
That's what they do at podcast live shows is they just play other podcast episodes.

634
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,520
As a little warm up. So people start laughing.

635
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Yeah.

636
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,600
Okay, but not too much. You got to play something like "Wait, wait, don't tell me."

637
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,880
people are like, and then they get ready.

638
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,680
And then we come out and they're like,

639
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:38,280
this is the French, the French show. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

640
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,120
We probably don't have a single French fan. I think, I think they're,

641
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,000
I think they're too cool for us, man. No, we're like Jerry Lewis.

642
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,720
Probably was Jerry Lewis big in France.

643
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,120
We were like huge in France, like Jerry Lewis.

644
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,380
and we like

645
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,700
just didn't know about it

646
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,740
that's where all our money was coming from

647
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,500
that'd be cool what would you guys do

648
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,240
i would assume that they were laughing at us

649
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,460
about french

650
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
people

651
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,140
what did you say about french people

652
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,380
they

653
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,260
be eating snails

654
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,300
they be eating snails

655
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,620
that's what you got

656
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,700
maybe they would like that we make fun of

657
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,980
cajun people

658
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,820
that could be true i'd yet i don't know that he has a very well you know they got

659
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,380
there

660
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,300
you know that there's like a french chris rocker does a french versus cases

661
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,700
routines somewhere

662
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,740
it

663
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,140
do you know more on the uh...

664
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,340
but i think that the thing they hate canadians are or

665
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,500
or probably probably could work well people

666
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,100
you are not going to be quite a private cases his cases are not

667
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,140
french at all but some they claim a little bit of it

668
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,980
Canadian people at least like they have like a functioning society.

669
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,980
You know?

670
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,300
Occasion people like trade each other leaves for meat.

671
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,340
Occasion people have a voodoo government.

672
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Exactly yeah.

673
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Yeah.

674
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:09,620
They're like we're gonna make a law where you can't smoke a cigarette anymore and they

675
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,300
just they take out a little doll that has a cigarette and they throw it into a blender

676
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
and that's how they make laws.

677
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,500
Yeah, anybody who had a cigarette in their mouth is now dead.

678
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Yeah.

679
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I don't think this is true about Cajun people.

680
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
It's true.

681
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,700
Okay, what do you think is true about Cajun people?

682
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Oh, now we've gone too far for Pat with the Cajuns.

683
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,020
You should hear this guy off mic.

684
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,420
He's going insane on us.

685
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,240
I think they have a big-- He thinks they're subhuman.

686
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,460
Can I finish?

687
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,580
No.

688
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,780
I think they have a big crocodile in charge.

689
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,060
Okay.

690
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,380
Yeah, like Donkey Kong.

691
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,820
uh... yes he did i have to tell you that i would like to go to a great big

692
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,060
it'd be difficult

693
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,780
it's all about the end of the country

694
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,260
so that the homes

695
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,700
and we're having been a little bit

696
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,020
he had to have a good news that you see on the path hanging out with your nephew

697
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,940
hang out with your nephew and you know that i have a it's all about having a

698
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,220
family where you were all of your first names are just adjectives

699
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,220
"Oh, that's Stanky. Stanky the Gumbo."

700
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,220
"Stanky Gagnon."

701
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,220
"And that's Little Guy Gagnon over there."

846
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,540
in scuba gear but the shark has the clear advantage.

847
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,660
True, well because they'd have to do it in the water for the shark.

848
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
Uh huh.

00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,880
deep blue sea that you may unravel the song's true meaning I'm gonna go on

878
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:49,920
every like Korean rap page on genius and do that exact same paragraph the ocean

879
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,580
is also home to sharks creatures that served as inspiration for LL Cool J's

880
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,680
hat the Sharks fan is considered by sharkologists to be the hat of the shark

881
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:06,440
sharkologist excuse me I'm switching careers yeah sharkologist I'm a

882
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,200
scientist but only about sharks I study what part of the shark is the hat anything else about sharks

883
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:19,320
I can't I can't say the title of this song but Rayquan and Ghostface

884
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:31,800
is

885
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,300
They made a song called shark and words.

886
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,160
Is it lighter?

887
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,300
Is it swag?

888
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,460
That's a parenthetical.

889
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,340
It might be good.

890
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,600
You hate biters. OK, well, that would be the problem with sharks

891
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,500
is that they would keep biting other people's.

892
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,700
Oh, no, it's a skit.

893
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,600
Steez. Oh, it's a skit.

894
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,200
It's oh, I'm sorry.

895
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,360
It's just a skit.

896
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,500
Yeah, there's no rap in this.

897
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,740
I think a lot of animals would make great rappers.

898
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,960
True. Yeah, I think an anteater in a beanie would be funny.

899
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,220
That would be cool.

900
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,020
Yeah.

901
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,100
Do you think of an anteater rap to be like...

902
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
[mimics anteater]

903
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,100
'Cause his mouth is so long.

904
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,100
Yeah.

905
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,600
It'd be like 6'4" 5AR.

906
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
He would have the best ad-libs.

907
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,600
He'd have like a little like...

908
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
[mimics anteater]

909
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,100
And he would just go like...

910
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,300
I'm eating ants! I'm eating lots of ants!

911
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,600
I'm wearing cool pants!

912
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,600
When he has the ad-libs, it's just like him going...

913
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
[mimics anteater]

914
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,600
[laughter]

915
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Exactly, dude.

916
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
That would be the advantage of an animal rapper

917
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:46,560
or

918
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
Oh my god.

919
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
Yeah.

920
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,360
And you would say like, "I don't hang out with that stupid ass Tony."

921
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,360
Mm-hmm.

922
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,360
Yeah.

923
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,160
And I'll eat you like you were bologna.

924
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
Yeah.

925
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,960
I'll eat you like Carole Baskin's husband.

926
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
Oh my god.

927
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,160
Like, "The white man's trying to turn us all to Tonys.

928
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,120
I'm gonna turn them to bolognas."

929
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,560
Something like that.

930
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
You know?

931
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Yeah.

932
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,400
I'm gonna eat you like Carole Baskin's husband.

933
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,200
I'm gonna throw your ass in the cage that I came in.

934
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Didn't rhyme.

935
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,200
Y'all watch Tiger King.

936
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Y'all watch Tiger King.

937
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
He's got a different flow.

938
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
Y'all watch Tiger King?

939
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,200
I'm the King Tiger.

940
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,200
That's what he would say.

941
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Whoa!

942
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Oh my god.

943
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
Yeah.

944
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,120
You look at my thing, my thing get wider.

945
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,120
That's right.

946
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,680
That'd be kind of a funny way to get a boner is that it just goes wide like an umbrella.

947
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
Yeah.

948
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
Like you're resizing it on Photoshop.

949
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
Yeah, exactly.

950
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,680
Yeah.

951
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,760
And you don't click lock ratio.

952
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,680
It just gets wide but not any taller.

953
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,520
That could be some pretty funny ass shit.

954
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
That could be funny.

955
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,520
Dude, raccoons...

956
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,520
Er, what am I talking about?

957
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,520
What?

958
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,520
I don't know.

959
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,520
I saw a picture of a raccoon.

960
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Dude, what are you talking about?

961
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,520
Dude, that was sick, man.

962
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,520
You saw a picture of a raccoon and you just went, "Raccoon!"

963
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,320
And you're like, "Oh, what am I talking about?"

964
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:13,520
That's literally like, fuckin', like, cartoon ADHD.

965
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,400
*laughter*

966
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,700
I'm straight up half cartoon idiot

967
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Just saying everything that you see

968
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,180
Why are you looking at a picture of a raccoon?

969
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,980
It popped up!

970
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,320
Did you search animals? What did it pop up on?

971
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,960
I was looking up animal rappers

972
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,960
*laughter*

973
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,080
Raccoon

974
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,360
Raccoon, oh raccoon!

975
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,120
It would have been worse if I saw like a fucking squirrel or something

976
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,120
that's like straight up, god damn.

977
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,120
It's out of Over the Hedge.

978
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
I'm the stupidest guy of all time.

979
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,120
You are the dog from Over the Hedge, man.

980
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,120
Yeah, how does that feel?

981
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,120
What if the animals in Hoodwinked could rap?

982
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,120
Then it'd be called Hood Hood.

983
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Oh my god.

984
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,120
Oh my god.

985
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,120
Didn't they have a rap at the end of the movie?

986
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,120
Yeah, they did. Come on.

987
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,120
I remember in one of my college classes, we like showed our professor Hoodwinked,

988
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:25,120
and

989
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,520
She has a whole crew of like AAV affecting animals.

990
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,920
Yeah, and the wolf.

991
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,020
He's cool.

992
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,620
Dude.

993
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,700
It's so that the CGI in that movie who were talking about this

994
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,100
last night, but like the CGI and like so many things that we

995
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,320

996
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,420
And it's so scary.

997
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,120
Yeah, like hoodwink looks terrifying.

998
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
It looks insane.

999
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,500
It looks like one of those like kids YouTube videos made by a

1000
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,020

1001

jimmy neutron

1019
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,740
in real life

1020
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,840

1021
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,480
what's k_s_i_

00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,740
k_s_i_ he's the guy that boxed jake paul

1023
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,140
uh... is jake paul gonna is he just gonna become a boxer now

1024
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,820
yet it is

1025
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,980
way where did you find that that review of jack at her of uh... of

1026
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,460
uh... what was it was c_k_y_ c_k_y_ a letterbox

1027
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,840
is that like someone you know

1028
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,060
no at some of the i found because i was looking through all the reviews of c_k_

1029
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,680
y_ to see if

1030
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,900
and said anything bad houses

1031
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,660
i was a bad i was there

1032
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,100
i was thinking it'd be really funny to like

1033
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:36,460
only use letterbox to defend the cky movies you probably have a lot of work to do yeah

1034
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,300
i assume there's a lot of reviews like that where it's like right but it's like immature

1035
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:45,100
what is it is like oh if you love destruction of property then you're gonna love this

1036
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:52,460
right if you this is basically jake paul of the 90s it's like just how if you're looking at cky

1037
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:58,620
or jackass it's like from like a film perspective you're fucking you're just a pussy dude you're

1038
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:05,620
you

1039
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:11,820
the bromance of jackass. Is that true? Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Dude, that's sick. The bromance

1040
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:19,580
or is he insinuating that they're gay? I haven't read the book. I think it might be an insinuation

1041
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:27,820
of like the homoerotic relationships. Somebody in jackass is fucked. Yeah. Right? I mean,

1042
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:34,420
just look at Bam and Ryan Dunn's relationship. If Jack had... No, I didn't even think... Oh,

1043
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,420
Ryan Dunn's dead, oh crap.

1044
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,500
God, I didn't even think about it. No, but like thinking about like, uh, fucking...

1045
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:47,140
Someone, there's definitely, because I found it on, I found it for South Park, but like the people

1046
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:53,380
who do like ships on Hauler. There's definitely a Ryan Dunn, Bam Margera ship somewhere.

1047
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,220
Like a cartoon of them fucking?

1048
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,300
Yeah, like cartoons of them kissing.

1049
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,100
There has to be.

1050
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,340
Fanfiction.

1051
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,940
Especially after Ryan Dunn died, maybe, maybe Bam is like, like kissing like, like an angel.

1052
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:23,740
a

1053
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:32,060
die no that's the first scary part and then you you go you start you an escalator a shining

1054
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,020
golden escalator appears and you look and you have wings and a halo and you're so excited

heaven there is yeah well and ghosts do you think ghosts go to hell? Do ghosts go to hell?

1059
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,540
Do ghosts go to hell? Here's the trick. Do you think Bigfoot is gonna go to heaven or hell?

1060
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,660
Bigfoot? Um... You think goblins? Where do you think goblins go? Can I just do one thing at a time?

1061
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:15,900
Bigfoot is going to hell. Where do you think Anthony Bourdain is? Hell, definitely, with Bigfoot. Okay, and goblins?

1083
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:32,420
died BAM came back from the skate demo tired bruised and horny as hell although

1084
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,500
it was nearly 2 a.m. before he got to the castle his first order of business was a

1085
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:41,740
text to Ryan hey bitch my ass hurts from skating get over here and ice it for me

1086
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,240
Bam smirked as he set his cell phone on the dresser in his room.

1087
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,440
He began shedding his clothes as he made his way towards the bathroom,

1088
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,440
looking forward to a relaxing shower.

1089
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,440
The sound of the water pelting toward the base of the shower filled the room

1090
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,440
and Bam left the water running so it could get nice and hot.

1091
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,040
As he stood in front of the mirror, he rolled his head from side to side,

1092
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,240
loosening his...

1093
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,240
The word "neck" is in bold.

1094
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,240
[laughs]

1095
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,240
Loosening his neck muscles, his eyelids heavy as he studied his reflection,

1096
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,240
he watched himself trail his hands over his taut chest and pecs,

1097
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
down to-

1098
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,740
*laughs*

1099
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,240
-towards over his abs and further towards his pubic-haired cock.

1100
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,240
He imagined his hands were Ryan's slightly larger hands,

1101
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,240
working their way all over his smooth, tattooed flesh,

1102
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,240
teasing him and making his dicks-

1103
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,740
his dick-

1104
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,740
DICKS STIR!

1105
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,240
*laughs*

1106
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,240
-and Ryan Doman my dick stirred.

1107
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,240
-MAYOR DUNN, YOU BETTER GET OVER HERE AND MAKE MY DICK DICK STIR!

1108
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,240
(laughter)

1109
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
Oh my god.

1110
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,240
As the steam from the shower filled the room, Bam walked in and stood beneath the powerful jets,

1111
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,240
the tension and aches soothed by the hot clean water.

1112
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,240
Bam was lost in his own thoughts of pleasure and the feel of his hands on his skin,

1113
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,240
so lost in fact that he was oblivious to the sound of Ryan in the bathroom,

1114
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,240
stripping his t-shirt and shucking off his trainers into the corner.

1115
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
While he was content to watch his lover,

1116
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,240
he turned slightly to the side as he bathed and teased himself,

1117
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,240
nonchalant and unaware of his presence.

1118
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,960
presence. Ryan watched as the rivulets of water trickled seductively down Bam's

1119
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,400
back and sides, tracing his butt and ass crack like ghostly fingertips.

1120
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,600
What did they know? What did they know?

1121
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,600
Oh shit, dude. Fuck.

1122
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Yeah, and then Ryan died in a car crash.

1123
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Ryan chewed his lower lip as he imagined his tongue, instead of the clear droplets, mapping the soft flesh.

1124
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,280
As his belt buckle clacked on the cold tiles, Bam finally turned to lock eyes with his scruffy

1125
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,460
blonde lover, pinching the water from his eyes with his thumb and forefinger.

1126
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,480
He met Ryan's gaze and licked his lips.

1127
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,120
"You get off watching guys get clean, Ry?"

1128
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,240
Silently, Ryan acknowledged the lack of pleasantries.

1129
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,340
Not that he was complaining, he had enough plans for Bam's sweet mouth without banal

1130
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,840
banter taking up precious time.

1131
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,000
Fuck, this is so well written.

1132
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,460
i know

1133
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,700
you're always dirty bam bam his eyes glistened at the double entendre

1134
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,800
and the miniscule non sexually charged portion of his mind marveled at the fact

1135
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,000
that he knew what double entendre meant

1136
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,400
all of our and all my god

1137
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,840
they have noticed ryan casually caressing his balls that looked tight

1138
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,800
against his skin as he spoke to him he joined bam in the shower and became

1139
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,680
immersed under the pelting water

1140
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,240
his eyes darkening in random trips falling into his eyes

1141
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,560
you look damn drip hot dripping wet in the shower

1142
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:41,560
you look hotter dripping in my fucking car

1143
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:47,240
at that day i'm one of the feral growl press slips are against ryan's

1144
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,480
right is to recruit for bans supple asks in the flesh he could have been sick

1145
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,240
it's large pops

1146
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,360
uh...

1147
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,120
you loaned from the dual assault of the water over his body in the heat from

1148
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,320
Bam's fluid tongue fighting with his own. They didn't kiss like girls, all sissy sweetness.

1149
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:09,200
They kissed firm, hard, hungry for satisfaction and power. The heat in the shower increased

1150
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,020
when the passion emanating from the two men. Their moans and pants echoed around each other

1151
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:17,640
as their hands roamed over each other's saturated bodies.

1152
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,220
As Bam tightened his grip at Ryan's soaking strands of hair, he felt Ryan slip his hand

1153
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,520
between their bodies and surround his hard cock, the head twitching with every long stroke

1154
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,880
as Bam sighed against Ryan's neck whilst he attacked it with lips and tongue.

1155
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,200
"Fuck, Bam.

1156
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,920
You're so fucking hard."

1157
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,640
"Hard for you, baby.

1158
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,320
Wanna make you cum so bad."

1159
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,520
Em's breath caught in his throat when Ryan held both erect dicks together in one hand.

1160
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,960
The tight, warm, slippery from the shower felt so good to both men.

1161
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,320
Then Ryan began to feel familiar pressure in his groin, but it wasn't an orgasm.

1162
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,320
"Oh shit."

1163
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,760
He murmured, slowing his ministrations.

1164
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,960
Bam looked dazed as he looked at Ryan.

1165
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,440
"What the fuck, Ry?

1166
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,440
I'm so close."

1167
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
"Uh, sorry, Bam."

1168
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,520
Ryan tried to edge towards the door of the shower.

1169
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,800
"I gotta piss."

1170
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,800
Bam paused, smirking.

1171
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,800
So?

1172
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,720
Ryan wasn't quite sure.

1173
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
No way!

1174
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,960
But he could have sworn that for a split second, a defiant red glint flashed in Bam's blue

1175
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:41,820
to

1176
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,220
the older man's both still

1177
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:51,060
at heart and dripping bam felt seconds away from exploding

1178
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,280
right didn't know what was happening only that he knew he had to piss badly

1179
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,820
that's a bad the first bad sentence

1180
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,080
it's not only bam was leading into ryan's ear panting as his fist were

1181
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,060
quickly on his cock

1182
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,780
piss on me rye

1183
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,740
ryan's eyes rolled up into his head at the words

1184
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,140
he mumbled a few fucks as he held his full cock

1185
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,500
Jesus, Bam.

1186
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,380
Ryan looked into his boyfriend's- his boyfriend's eyes.

1187
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:14,880
What?!

1188
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,420
They were clouded with sheer animal lust, the complete willingness to experience every avenue of sex and play with him, and only him.

1189
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:21,920
*Gasp*

1190
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,360
You want my piss, baby?

1191
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,300
*Laughter*

1192
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:32,140
Bam nodded, his hand cupping and tugging his fold balls, the other hand rubbing his leaky cock.

1193
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:32,860
*Laughter*

1194
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,700
Ryan felt the hot piss poise for release.

1195
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,140
You gonna take my cum too?

1196
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,580
Fuck yeah, Ryan.

1197
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,700
Fuck, fuck.

1198
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,020
Fuck, I gotta piss Bam, where do you want it?

1199
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:53,540
Bam was panting, feeling the orgasm bubbling, his balls tightening, on my dick when I cum.

1200
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:58,740
His knees shaking as he pumped furiously on his dick, fuck Ra, do it, do it.

1201
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,860
Standing close to Bam, holding him steady by the shoulder, Ryan moaned as he pissed

1202
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:07,020
a hot golden stream onto Bam's engorged cock, sticky white ropes of cum spurting out as it

1203
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,580
mingled with the urine, some of the release sliding over Bam's hand and dick.

1204
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,820
Bam breathed heavily as he came down from his high, his eyes mesmerized by the remnants of

1205
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,980
cum and piss, not yet washed away by the rapidly cooling water.

1206
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,180
Ryan still held his dick, surprised to feel it was getting thicker so soon, but his eyes

1207
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,460
were locked on Bam and his reaction to the new game they just played.

1208
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,340
He tilted Bam's face upwards and looked at him intently.

1209
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,700
So how was it?

1210
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,780
Bam brought his hands down towards his face and examined the last drops of both men's

1211
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,380
released that still remained on his digits.

1212
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,380
Lifting his eyes to meet Ryan's, he brought his fingers to his lips and sucked them hungrily,

1213
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,780
cleaning them of all the liquid.

1214
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,780
That was cum-fucking-tastic.

1215
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:52,780
Ryan was speechless as he witnessed his lover accept both tangy and bitter juices.

1216
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:57,380
Looking behind Bam with his free hand, he turned off the shower, looked Bam dead in

1217
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,180
the eyes and said two words, "Bedroom.
