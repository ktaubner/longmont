66
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,940
Yeah, Celebrity Deathmatch is maybe the most influential

67
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,260
thing like piece of media

68
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,460

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,460
Celebrity Deathmatch was this MTV show where they just had they did a claymation version of celebrities

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:10,260
and they would just like have like Paris Hilton like kill OJ Simpson in like a wrestling match.

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,500
That's cool. When I was a kid I thought it was the funniest thing. It sounds fun. It was so fun. Yeah

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,580
it used to have um what was it it was like Andy Milonakis versus Gary Coleman. Yeah there's some

75
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:26,620

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,820

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,180

83
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,780

84
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,220

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,340
He was talking about like his wild boys.

102
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,820

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,140
those early 2000s comedies and just every joke is a gay joke. Yeah. That's the only

yeah it's actually a statement about how fat people are statement about robots

130
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,500
when you think about that movie actually makes a statement it's uh it's you

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,020
should never let a fat person drive a spaceship yeah or really because the

132
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,200
thesis of that movie is fat is contagious yeah yeah no I've never seen

fan theory that- Oh, you know what it is? It's probably like a- Oh, here's a list. We

I don't want that.

142
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:03,820
Nine ways today's society is like the one that filled earth with... garbage in wall.

- Yeah.

170
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,320
there's this one guy there's this one writer for bloody disgusting

171
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
who does movie reviews

172
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,920
and his name

173
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
is william b_ b_ on e

174
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,800
so billy b_ b_ on e

175
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,200
and he uh... it'd be be be that he's like notorious will be be

176
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,320
he just gives the most bizarre reviews like his ratings just have no like

177
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
like uh...

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,720
they don't they don't match up like he like

179
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,720
he rated once upon a time in hollywood half a star

180
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,920
and then he rated the gallows act to like four stars

181
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,000
and it is like makes no sense and none of the reason make any sense at all the

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,760
comments and also be as it is like

183
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,200
classic baby i think it

184
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,240
she is the craziest guy what is the content of the review

185
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
uh... a lot of times he he just like

186
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,580
he like describe the movie but just won't

187
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,540
like i don't know why he didn't he's like

188
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,320
it's a survey committee he's confusing he's cause all the characters billy

189
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Bibiani. Yeah. I really loved Billy Bibiani's performance in Star Wars

190
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:57,380
Revenge of the Sith. Five stars. Yeah. Now in this movie Billy Bibiani, you don't see

191
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,820
that much of him but he is on the poster. In Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Billy Bibiani

192
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,820
plays opposite Angelina Jolie, his real-life wife. There's actually a pretty

193
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,920
big plot twist in this movie where you discover that Billy Bibiani and Billy

194
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:18,100
Bibiani are the same person yeah I'm wearing stupid socks he's just a stupid

195
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,560
socks I'm not wearing any socks yeah you're going commando Billy Bibiani only

196
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,880
has 15 minutes of actual screen time he actually is the person who stands out

197
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,400
the most in the film I give silence of the Lamb a career-making performance

198
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:45,240
from Bibby Bibby Bobbo from Bobby Bibiano. A must see. I give this Billy Bobbo's.

199
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,360
While I found the movie funny I didn't believe Billy Bibbiani would do any of

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:57,880
these things in real life. Therefore I give Bruno two stars. I give Billy. Billy

201
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,480
Bruno. Billy Bruvo, Billy Bruvo Annie. I hated

202
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Quentin Tarantino's new movie Billy Bibbiani's Big Adventure. Billy Bibbiani. I felt it was

203
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,600
disrespectful to Sharon Tate. That's the one other person that he knows. Classic review

204
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:28,960
time. Billy Bibbiani goes to jail. Oh no. I drank a Coke Zero. I'm washed today. Oh no.

205
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I drank a Coke Zero.

206
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Shit.

207
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
That's their slogan.

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Yeah.

209
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Oh no.

210
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
I drank a Coke Zero.

211
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,600
You get to the bottom of the bottle and it says that and it's printed on the bottom.

212
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,880
So when you look in it says, "Oh no, I drank a Coke Zero."

213
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Yeah.

214
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,240
More drinks should have stuff printed at the bottom.

215
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
I agree.

216
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Yeah.

217
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
That'd be cool if you had to look into your drink at the end.

218
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,720
You should just have an ink cartridge at the bottom of the soda so that when you're finished

219
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,960
it can blow in your face and people will know you drank a soda.

220
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Yeah.

221
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,560
Yeah, it's a pretty good idea.

222
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,040
Yeah, they should put ink cartridges like they do on pants.

223
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,160
They should put that on sodas from the vending machines so that those hackers on YouTube

224
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,720
can't put their hands in and steal one.

225
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
What?

226
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
You know.

227
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,200
They put ink cartridges on pants?

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,160
Have you never bought pants?

229
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
What do you mean?

230
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Oh, that's why you never.

231
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
Cameron doesn't buy pants.

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,760
I forgot you don't have pants.

233
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,680
put these little thingies on pants like a JC Penney that are magnetic ink

234
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,000
cartridges that if you so if you steal it oh those are ink yeah I know it I

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,960
didn't know those are filled with you try to fuck like take them off they just

236
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,400

237
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,100
something no it explodes that's sick yeah they should make it explode with

238
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:51,880
shrapnel yeah yeah and as soon as you walk out of the door yeah it just

239
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,320
explodes and kills whoever is at your waist level. Flattens the store. Whatever kid you

240
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,960
took to the store with you loses their head. Yeah. Yeah. Or when your beautiful girlfriend

241
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,040
is giving you a freaking, one of her classic trademark PJs. As you walk out of the store.

242
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,080
Yeah. Yeah. Cause she's like, you're so cool for stealing pants. Yeah. And you'd say, yeah

243
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:20,760
I am. Oh, you're dead. Oh no, you died because I was walking while I was leaving the store

244
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,120
and your head was down there and I snapped your neck with my thighs while I was trying to walk.

245
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,080
[laughter]

246
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,000
With my strong, strong thighs.

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,680
My thighs, my thighs did a kind of like a, like a, like a stick motion when you're trying to

248
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,440
make fire with a stick and it moistens out.

249
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,400
They rubbed together.

250
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,120
But it lit my GF's damn brain on fire.

251
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,400
And the friction caused your head to catch on fire.

252
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,160
Yeah. And you died over a span of 10 minutes.

253
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,320
Yeah, you died of Ghost Rider's disease.

254
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
[Laughter]

255
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Ghost riders set it up.

256
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
That's when your head, anytime your head is on fire,

257
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
you have ghost riders disease until you die.

258
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
[Laughter]

259
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
That's true.

260
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Yeah.

261
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
It's really easy to diagnose.

262
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
If my head caught on fire, my last thought would be,

263
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
"Shit, I look like Ghost Rider."

264
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Yeah. Does anyone have a motorcycle?

265
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Just come on, I'm going to be alive for 90 seconds.

266
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Let me ride your motorcycle and fulfill a lifelong dream.

267
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
This is going to be sick.

268
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
This is gonna be sick.

269
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,320
What does he even do in that movie?

270
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,600
He rides his bike.

271
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
He rides his bike.

272
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm sure he fights people.

273
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Not that cool.

274
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,940
Doesn't he have like chains?

275
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,940
Like flaming chains?

276
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,680
Yeah, he throws chains and shit and he like...

277
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,360
Oh, what does it say?

278
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,400
He says, "I'm a ghost rider."

279
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Oh, I'm a freaking ghost.

280
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Ghost rider.

281
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
God, I'm a ghost.

282
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Shit.

283
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
He goes, "Ooooh."

284
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
"Suck me off!"

285
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
And everyone screams and runs away.

286
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
And he rides hard.

287
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
He says, "I'm the ghost rider, suck me, fuck me off."

288
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
"Suck me, fuck me off, please."

289
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
"Please."

290
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Yeah, that's his superhero origin.

291
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
No one would suck him, fuck him off.

292
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
And so his head caught on fire from his rage.

293
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Yeah, he got so angry that his head burst into flames.

294
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Yeah, that's true.

295
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
He was waiting in line at the DMV,

296
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
and he got so steamed,

297
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
he Bilbo-freaked out at the DMV.

298
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,900
He Bilbo Baggins freaked out. He Billy Bob-

299
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,100
He Bilbo Baggins, evil Bilbo, looking for the- trying to grab the ring away from Frodo.

300
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,060
He did that.

301
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,660
And his head caught fire.

302
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Yeah, Billy Bob Baggins.

303
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,400
And Sam...

304
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,900
Sam I Am.

305
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Sam Jelena...

306
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,400
Jolie. There we go.

307
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Sam Jelena Fro-do.

308
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,900
Fro-do-lie.

309
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Fro-do-ro.

310
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Would it be funny for my first tattoo to get, um...

311
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,540
my first tattoo to get a tattoo. Would it be funny for the the tattoo that Angelina Jolie got

312
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,260
on her arm that said Billy Bob? Yeah. That's funny. Have you seen that tattoo?

313
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,860
Yeah of course. I haven't. It's really good. Cameron hates celebrity gossip. I just

314
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,060
don't know any celebrities. I know who Angelina Jolie is. I don't know who

315
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,860
Billy Bob is if I'm being honest. Billy Bob Jordan? I've heard that name. That was...

316
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:13,560
He's Bad Santa. I haven't seen Bad Santa. Hmm. That thing's kind of... The thing is

317
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:19,480
it's kind of bad ass. What's under Billy Bob? It's a really cool tattoo. It's honestly fucking tight.

318
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:27,080
It's like uh it's Mushu from Mulan. Yeah nice. And it says Billy Bob. Yeah it says Billy Bob in like

319
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:34,280
sort of old English but... Old Chinese. Old Chinese is what that is because there's a dragon under it.

320
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,320
Yeah. Yeah. You should you should get it but it should say Patrick. Yeah. That'd be kind of funny.

321
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Patrick Bob

322
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,160
Yeah, and then a drag underneath

323
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,040
So confused

324
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:56,840
Patrick Bob or Billy Bob Patrick, but like the Patrick it like doesn't look like it

325
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,560
Looks like you added Patrick to the side like you don't even center the dragon already did this here

326
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,280
He put Billy Bob on him. He already has the Billy Bob tattoo. No, you need to add it the Steve-o tattoo on your back

327
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,700
Yeah, oh yeah, no, that's how I one-up him. Yeah

328
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:20,580
You say you got Angelina's I got yours bitch Steve-o Patrick. Yeah, Steve-o Patrick

329
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,880
You're kind of Steve you're the Steve-o of the group yeah, yeah, I'm

330
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,960
I'm Steve-o and I'm BAM and Johnny Knoxville and I'm Preston Lacey and

333
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,600

334
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,860
Exited me from the other room and said to see if Oh seriously have Angelina's Billy Bob

335
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,600

495
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,960
under the fireworks I was yeah you are you born on fireworks make their own

496
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,240
stars. That's true. Whoa. So there's actually a whole separate zodiac. There's 12 signs

497
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,640
within July. Yeah, there's 12 signs within. And the signs are red firework, the

498
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,960
firework that looks like a flower, the American flag firework, just normal

499
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,560
bomb, the Mickey Mouse firework, ones that wave around. The dragon one.

500
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:00,280
The dragon one from Lord of the Rings. One that spells out a word,

501
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,520
it doesn't matter what word. One that spells out fun. And then one that spells out fun is also,

502
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,680
that's a separate one. That's a separate one. And then one that doesn't go off, a dud. Until

503
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:17,000
you get close to it and then it kills your uncle. And then there's like another one probably. Yeah,

504
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,240
one that looks like a big genderless bathroom sign. Yeah, that's the 12 kind of firework.

505
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,600
Yeah, that's what people want now. So that's what July is. So July's it's separate. The July Zodiac.

506
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,000
It's based on what firework hit you when you were born. August is, um,

507
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,680
August is... No sign for August. Yeah, so you get skipped over. Yeah, no signs. September is...

508
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Uh, school. Well, we don't want to... Nerd. It's a nerd. September is nerd.

509
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:52,920
You were born and went to school. September is da nerd. Da nerd. Da nerd. Da nerd into hood.

510
00:31:52,920 --> 00:32:01,720
The Nerd in the Hood is September. October is The Nightmare Before Christmas.

511
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,320
So is December. December is also, because you can watch it either time.

512
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah. November is the

513
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,760
The Mustache.

514
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,960
The Native American Man.

515
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Yeah, yeah. But it's the Italian guy who played the Native American guy in that PSA for littering.

516
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,040
He's the Native American man. When he cried.

517
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,160
Huh?

518
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,120
You've never seen that?

519
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,600
No.

520
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,440
There's that old ad. It's like somebody throws something out the window of a car,

521
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,160
and there's just like a Native American guy who sees it and looks at the camera and starts crying,

522
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,680
and it's like don't litter but that guy is not he's just like an italian dude oh no no it's so funny

526
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,080
of movies. Oh have you seen Creepshow 2? Yeah, you know like Chief Woodenhead, that part in Creepshow 2.

527
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:21,320
Yeah, in Creepshow 2, they literally, they just have a white dude in brown face. Yeah. And the whole time

528
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,920
he's like, "I'm gonna go to Hollywood. Do you see this hair? This is the hair that gets you

529
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:34,200
fucking famous." Yeah, it's crazy. He's like, "I hate my people. I hate all of you."

530
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,920
It's great dude. And I watched this movie today called Humanoids from the Deep and there's a

531
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,000
character who's supposed to be Native American and he's literally just a white

532
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,520
guy they didn't even put him in brownface they just like he just has

533
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:52,080
dark hair and they just named his character Johnny Eagle. Okay I see what

534
00:33:52,080 --> 00:34:00,320
this is. The specific dude from the PSA I'm talking about he was like he was a

535
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,040
Native American in like every movie for some amount of time like he was the guy

536
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,240
and I'm the guy they gave it like like the like the Cherokee Nation or whatever

537
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,000
gave him like honorary membership because he did he like spent all of his

538
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,680
money on like activism for native people that's crazy he's kind of he's got him

539
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,760
it's kind of a baller that's pretty cool yeah and I think he like didn't he like

540
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,120

00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:30,020
This is a band... Incredible. They made a band for owls.

572
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,020

Hooty and the hoot and the owls. I'm deliriously tired I'm gonna put this

576
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,980
I found a pair of headphones that are an owl.

577
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
Whoa.

578
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,900
But I can't find an owl wearing headphones.

579
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,980
You're like the radio show intern who just like, you're constantly like pulling things

580
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
up to show us.

581
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
Yeah.

582
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980

00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,640
Jamie, Jamie, pull that up.

584
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,400
I found this article called Celebrity Headphones a while ago and it's just about how celebrity

585
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,240
headphones are going to kill people.

586
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,740
Like celebrity endorsed headphones.

587
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,180
How are they going to kill people?

588
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,220
uh... wall on the air it's about it says like the people in a crash their cars

589
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,300

590
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,220
wearing celebrity headphones

591
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,500

Wow, they used Photoshop?

599
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,420
They used Photoshop on the pictures.

600
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,900
Here, we used the healing power of Photoshop.

601
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,740
To make it look like--

602
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,020
To make it look like there's John Legend headphones.

603
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,780
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to find this,

604
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,500
but I don't think I can find it.

605
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,420
Sorry.

606
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,380
Okay, well while we're making things up,

607
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,620
I read an article yesterday

608
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,140
about how I'm the richest guy on the planet,

609
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,700
but I can't find it right now.

610
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,060
I learned that Caleb gave me all of his money.

611
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

612
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,300
That was a misprint.

613
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,140
No.

614
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,360
They misprinted that.

615
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,320
They didn't misprint it.

616
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,420
They forgot to print that.

617
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,260
I actually read the article

618
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,860
and it said that we did not misprint this.

619
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,180
It's already an absurd premise

620
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,820
because it necessitates you being able to read.

621
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,900
And as we already proved with you saying garbage.

622
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,420
I've been reading, I've been reading the whole time.

623
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,260
Oh, you've been reading?

624
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,140
What's the last book you read, Patrick?

625
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,980
Last book I read?

626
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,460
Yeah, what's the last book you read?

627
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,420
(laughs)

628
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,620
What's the last book you read?

629
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,500
Yeah, what's the last book you read?

630
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Now that you mention it, the last book I read was...

631
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,460
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

632
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,300
The Lyrics to Karma Chameleon.

633
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,140
- No.

634
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,020
- For me, I read Infinite Deaths like 10 times.

635
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,780
- I had to read from my Latinx literature class

636
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,600
two years ago.

637
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,580
- Latinx.

638
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,900
Whoa.

639
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,220
- That's what the class was called.

640
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,380
- Neil asked me--

641
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,020
- I had to read Junot Diaz, who's canceled.

642
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,900
- Oh yeah, Junot Diaz, he had sex.

643
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,580
Yeah, what did Juno Diaz do?

644
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,080
I don't know, I hope it's not worse,

645
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,460
I hope it's not like the worst thing imaginable.

646
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,720
And where it's like, what the fuck did he do?

647
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,560
Don't care.

648
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,140
I'm gonna look up what the fuck did Juno Diaz do.

649
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,420
Did you read the brief and wondrous life of Oscar Wow?

650
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,260
Oscar Wow, yeah.

651
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,740
It's a good book.

652
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,340
I read excerpts from that.

653
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,180
Oh, damn.

654
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,340
I read excerpts.

655
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,740
Juno Diaz is a full on rapist.

656
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,900
Oh yeah?

657
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,740
Yeah.

658
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,580
Full on?

659
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,400
Full on.

660
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,240
Full on.

661
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,060
Shit.

662
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,520
He maxed out?

663
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Yeah. Damn. He maxed it out. Bad move.

664
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,260
Juno. You guys see that picture I just sent? Oh an owl wearing headphones.

665
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,860
Two pictures.

666
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,660
Yeah. Nice. This is giving me serious OVO vibes.

667
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:13,260
Thinking about an owl. He's probably listening to Drake or another OVO artist. Yeah.

668
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,860
Yeah. He's probably listening to freaking... He's listening to One Dance by Drake. He's listening to Owl City.

669
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:28,740
listening to an Owl City parody of Fireflies called Owls. You would not believe your bowels

670
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:39,700
if 100 owls, however many in the song, owls all said "Hoo." Came up your owls. And they ate your

671
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:46,740
freaking Tootsie Pop in one bite. Yeah. Yeah. You would not believe that shit. You would not

672
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,740
believe your eyes if the owl ate your tootsie pop in one bite.

673
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,740
Alright, that's our new parody song.

674
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,740
You would not believe your eyes if da owl ate your tootsie pop in one bite.

675
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,740
Wouldn't that suck? That's the only lyrics to the song.

676
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,740
It's actually, it's three, two licks and a bite.

677
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,740
No. Yeah, but it's only one bite. Two licks and a bite, but he eats the whole thing in one bite.

678
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,740
A lick is part of a bite.

679
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
That's not true.

680
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,740
No, no, no, no.

681
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,220
Listen, we could sit here all day and argue about owl licks and bites.

682
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,820
Oh, wow, you found a curtain with the owl headphones on.

683
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,820
That's good.

684
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,500
Yeah, you walk into your, into, oh, is that a curtain or a shower curtain?

685
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,100
I thought that was a shower curtain.

686
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
I think it's a shower curtain.

687
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Oh, cool.

688
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,340
You walk in your bathroom at night and you freak out because you think an owl wearing

689
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
headphones is going to kill you.

690
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
Yeah, you do it every night.

691
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
Yeah.

692
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:44,340
At my brother's house, he has a giant stuffed panda

693
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,340

727
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,800
baristas are millennials. And then the millennial gets the coffee and drinks it

728
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,320
and goes, "Ouch, I burned my tongue

729
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,440
"'cause I drank this before it was cool."

730
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,280
- Yeah, I'm gonna need it.

00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,440

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,800

734
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800

735
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,840

- I'm gonna buy $500 worth of coffee and tip you one penny.

737
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,760
That's what millennials say at restaurants.

738
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,280
- Yeah, and then the business owner says,

739
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,800
"Sir, that's not necessary."

740
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,920
And they say, "Sir?

741
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,920
"Did you just call me sir?"

742
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,800

00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,640

Motherfucking piece of shit. So what are the traits of Generation M?

751
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,240
Generation M is a new species. It's mutants.

00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Justin Bieber has a giant Deadpool shaped hole in him.

790
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
We have to take him to Cedar Sinai.

Sorry to get political, but I had to.

793
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,500
And then they wheel him into the emergency room and then like the nurses prep him

794
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
and they're like, "We have to do surgery right now."

795
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,980
and then they bring him into the operating room.

796
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,500
And right as he's going under,

797
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,740
the doctor pulls down his surgeon mask

798
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,300
to reveal that it's Deadpool actually operating on him.

799
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,900
- And he looks at the camera and says--

800
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,220
- I know that I'm a movie.

801
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,680
- And he says, "This movie just got crazy."

802
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,520

00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,380
- You thought this was Justin Bieber,

808
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,660
Never Shout Never, whatever that fucking movie was called.

00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:48,540
This is badass. Wait. What if homer simpson actually was a fighter instead of what about homer simpson versus baracka?

823
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:56,140
Whoa, yeah, baracka barack obama. No, that'd be kind of funny. I didn't think that the rock obama

824
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,300
Now that's some fuck up shit. Yeah

825
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,300
The very thought of that is making my brain hurt.

826
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:02,800
It'd be funny-

827
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,300
It's giving me a mind-

828
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,800
It's giving me a mind-

829
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,300
It's giving me a mind-

830
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:04,800
-grain.

831
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,160
Jesus.

832
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:06,660
Oh.

833
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,160
Justin Bieber-

834
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:07,660
I just-

835
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,900
They found out Deadpool was the doctor!

836
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,180
They renounced the police.

837
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,300
It's a SWAT team headed to the hospital to try to kill Deadpool.

838
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,900
Guess what, bitches? He's invincible.

839
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,120
Yeah.

840
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,620
You'll never kill him.

841
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,300
He can regenerate.

842
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,580
He can never die.

843
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,420
It'd be funny to have a Deadpool mo-

844
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,620
Like, to have the Deadpool movie, but like, from a different camera angle.

845
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,100
So he's just like, looking into the distance and being like,

846
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,780
You guys are my biggest fans just like not looking at the camera.

847
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,380
Just like looking in the wrong direction. Deadpool is the Jim Halpert of

848
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,380
the Marvel movies. He keeps making Jim face to the camera. He keeps

849
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:43,660
pranking. He keeps fucking sucking Pam.

850
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,580
Yeah. The Deadpool version of Pam? Yeah you guessed it, Pam Anderson, the biggest

851
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,580
boobed bitch in the world. Right there. She's sucking his burnt

852
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:56,460
dick. Yeah. He goes, "I'm about to chimichanga

853
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:06,620
on you Pam Pam Margera Pammer I thought you said ma'am ma'am Margera

854
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:15,940
bimbofied bimmer is ma'am Margera yeah here's another good moogin fight

855
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:23,300
Marge BAM era the annoying orange no whoa spongebob squarepants versus baby being

856
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:30,300
you

857
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:37,300
mod

858
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,900
I tried to make my own Mugen characters in the sixth grade.

859
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,060
It's like a fighting game that you can like mod and just put in whatever characters you

860
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,060
want.

861
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,900
Like it's like open source and shit.

862
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,820
So we could put- And people would just make mods of it.

863
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,820
Us three.

864
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,380
We could, if somebody wanted to, they could put us in Mugen.

865
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,380
Okay, I'll do it.

866
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,380
Do it.

867
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,380
Okay.

868
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,380
Fine.

869
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,060
What would you guys special move, uh, Patrick?

870
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,260
What would you guys special- I'd probably, I'd have the same moveset as Deadpool, but

871
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,860
also- But also a hundred bucks.

872
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,860
Yeah.

873
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,860
A hundred dollars.

874
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:12,420
Yeah, I'd be like rich Deadpool. Yeah, cuz Deadpool notoriously zero money you

875
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,940
Patrick's would be eating a hamburger

876
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:20,980
Cameron's would be being on the computer mine would be I don't go on the computer mine would be karate Jackie

877
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,980
I don't go on the computer. I'm gonna be

878
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:30,300
I would summon Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee and first my special would be that I kill both of them with my hands and then I

879
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,460
Also, and then I once I do that then I use my special ability

880
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:40,940
They also have intros for the for the characters you're forgetting that my intro my intro I run in and I say

881
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:47,780
Watch out here. I come my intro. I said, but and I do flip my intro and then I do another flip

882
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:56,700
I do a backflip a little bit and then I reverse time and I go back to the dinosaurs

883
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:01,280
And I bring back a t-rex to kill and I kill the other but then I just make the t-rex my pet

884
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,820
And I'm gonna teach him try do it like meet the Robinsons. I do the flip

885
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:10,700
My intro is that Cameron does all that and then I come out and I fuck him in the ass

886
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:17,060
Yeah, you do all of that but then I'm actually the character

887
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:23,580
And I just fucking I just you drain me with your fucking but

888
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,740
Is a chain Patrick high fives me and but Patrick does that a he go face?

889
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,520

It turned out to be true who runs tweet of God was he ever doxxed. Oh, he was yeah

898
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,080
It was uh, it wasn't that he was doxxed. It was that uh,

899
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,160
He was a writer on the Daily Show

900
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,480
That's so funny. Yeah, he wrote that he got that fucking

901

00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:57,600
yeah was it called it was called tweet of God I don't hold on that's actually kind

905
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,440
of ironic because Jim Parsons was the lead in one of the one of the greatest

906
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:08,160
pieces of atheist media of all time the Bing Bang Theory yeah David Javerbaum

907
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:15,520
David Javerbaum? What the fuck? Probably Javerbaum? No it is Javerbaum for sure

908
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,120
No, it's Javen Jaegerbaum.

909
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,120
That's a cool-ass fucking guy.

910
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,620
Yeah.

911
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,120
John Jack Daniels.

912
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,120
John Daquiri.

913
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,120
Michael Beer.

914
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
[laughter]

915
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,120
'Sup, I'm Mike Beer.

916
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,120
Oh, shit. He, yeah, David Javerbaum, Javerbaum or whatever,

917
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,120
created Disjointed.

918
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,120
Oh.

919
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,120
That fucking Kathy Bates show on Netflix.

920
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,120
Awesome.

921
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,120
About how, like, what if an old white lady had weed?

922
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,120
Yeah.

923
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,120
That is insane to me.

924
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,620
Old white people be smoking weed.

925
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,120
Yeah.

926
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:53,120
Her character in that movie where she breaks that guy's legs probably could have used a little weed.

927
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,120
What's that movie called? Agony?

928
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,120
I don't know.

929
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
What?

930
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,120
The Kathy Bates movie where she's crazy and takes the author.

931
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
Misery?

932
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,120
Misery. Agony.

933
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,120
Is that Kathy Bates?

934
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,120
Yeah.

935
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,120
That's like her biggest role.

936
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,120
I haven't seen it.

937
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,120
That's Stephen King.

938
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Yeah.

939
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,440
She's the queen though.

940
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,440
Stephen Queen.

941
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,440
Stephen Queen.

942
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,040
Now that would be pretty funny.

943
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,440
What about a freaking girl version of Stephen Queen, Stephen King named Stephen Queen and

944
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,320
instead of it, the book's called Her.

945
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,320
Whoa.

946
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,800
And it stars Joaquin Phoenix even though it's a book.

947
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:36,400
Instead of the stand, it's called the Sit While You Pee.

948
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,680
Sometimes I sit while I pee, every once in a while.

949
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,800
I mean yeah it's comfortable.

950
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,080
I learned that my dad sits while he pees.

951
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:50,520
One time when I was in the bathroom and I was like brushing my teeth and he just like

952
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,640
fell asleep on the couch I guess and then just like deliriously walked in while I was

953
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,120
brushing my teeth and started sitting down and peeing right in front of me and then just

954
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,840
did not notice I was there because he was just like sleepwalking essentially.

955
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,560
And then the next day I was like, "Dad, do you sit to pee?"

956
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:12,720
he was like have you been watching me? I had to explain like no no you robot walked

957
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:18,640
into the bathroom you did the robot into the bathroom and he sat down and

958
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:26,640
deposited oil. It's just generally I say when I pee when I'm at work because I

959
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,640
can spend more time away from being at work. Oh yeah me too. I go to the bathroom at work all the time I just

960
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:39,280
fart into the toilet and just his brows. I don't do anything. I just read. Yeah.

961
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,480
Yeah. Well you guys have like office jobs or whatever. I have fucking, I got a call

962
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,440
from my fucking manager the other day. Whoa. In the bathroom. You got a call? Oh okay.

963
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,280
You should have said that immediately. I got a call from him while I left, I was at the register and I left and

964
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,040
then I went to go take a shit. I guess I was gone for too long because he called

965
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,080

Okay.
