00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,020
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,860
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,200
(explosion)

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,900
- Shut the fuck up.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,740
- We already started.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,660
- He's playing with Dom's yarn ball.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,640
- Oh no, he's playing with,

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,880
the cat is playing with a yarn ball?

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,720
- How dare he?

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
- He can't do that.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
- That's what cats do.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,720
- We have Felix Biederman

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:48,280
of

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,160
hour for me. Yeah, of course. I'm glad that we are not important enough to jump out of

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,160
one of the 500 Counter-Strike games that you play every day. And don't improve at all.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,840
Don't get any better at it. Yeah, just losing over and over and over again. I'm glad that

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,280
we didn't reach that threshold. Not learning literally anything. What would make you stop

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,280
playing? I don't know. I think if like, I think if like I dated a hot woman who like

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
kind of hated me and she did one of those things where you break up for a week and

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,200
then like you reconcile and then she's like you have to stop playing

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,920
Counter-Strike and I'm like okay but then we just like do a mutual activity that

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,920
made us both resent each other and then we would just stop talking to each other

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,320
like one of those breakups where you just don't talk to each other anymore.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,200
So this woman is what it would take. That's it. Not all the fucking like the hacks that

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
just happened.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,720
Yeah, not the stuff that gets on your personal info.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,960
I don't give a shit.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,520
Buy something with my fucking stupid debit card.

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
You think I fucking care?

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
That's just another phone call I have to make.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
Go ahead, buy a fucking $500 knife skid with my debit card.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
I literally don't fucking give a shit.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,840
I fucking do it.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Who cares?

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,120
No one's having sex, no one's fucking doing anything anymore.

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
No one's ever going to get pussy again.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,200
We're going to run out of kids.

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Fucking buy your stupid knife, you dumb piece of shit.

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
I guess you're right.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Money does...

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Read my DMs, there's nothing good in there.

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
You know what my DMs are?

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,360
It's just a bunch of people being like, "Oh, have you heard of this?

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
It's Rick Roll."

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Like, I don't give a shit.

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,240
You're not going to get me in trouble.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
You can't cancel me.

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,360
It's just going to be me and different group DMs talking about how, like, you know, anyone

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,800
who hates me on Twitter, I want...

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I think they're hot.

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I want to fuck them.

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Go ahead.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,880
So you're not going to find the secret fascist, crypto fascist DM?

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Yeah.

56
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,640
Yeah, look at me in Ape Chat.

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Yeah.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
I don't care.

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't give a shit.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,760
Ape Chat is the crypto-fascist leftist DM.

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
Yeah.

62
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
That's where we come from.

63
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,480
It's the most fascist DM ever.

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Oh, DMs are fucked up.

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
It's because of the apes, yeah.

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,840
Y'all, did you know that the Nazis loved nature because they thought it would represent order?

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
And these MFs have Ape Chat, but y'all sleep though.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,840
The ape represents raw power.

69
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Yes.

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Yeah.

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
And nothing else.

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
And they loved apes.

73
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,380
Alex is right now at the Chapo headquarters, which is a big building with Will Miniker's

74
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,720
face on the front and it says "CCCC" over and over again.

75
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Yes, yeah.

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
No, it is.

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,320
If there's anything we do, it's...

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,920
Well, I like that thread because it was saying that we're not really fascist, but we just

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,680
want people to be fascist, which is...

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
That's cool.

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,440
That's the ultimate activist move.

82
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Yeah.

83
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,520
That's like being in the opposite of Oscar Schindler.

84
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,080
Shepherding people into fascism even though you yourself are not one.

85
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,040
Yeah, I mean that's the way, that's how you stay the prominent voice of the left.

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,820
You make sure there's no one else on the left.

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,560
You get everyone else over the right.

88
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
That's the trick.

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah, you take down such leftists as Michael Rapaport.

90
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,240
You know what I mean?

91
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
On a daily basis.

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Yeah, the most important socialist voice we have.

93
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,160
You gotta put him in his place.

94
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,880
I love Michael Rapaport because his main thing is, he's like one of those old comedians, he's

95
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,120
not really convenient like one of those old guys who's like yo yo why y'all

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,960
getting offended by anything but he sees any post by a young person like even

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,960
referencing like Columbine like today right yeah he's like yo there's some

98
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:24,840
things you do not joke about that's the best part about it is like he's not he's

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,280
not a stand-up like he was an actor who is in like a couple of mob movies and

100
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,480
they're not for teens romance yeah and now he like goes and like edits himself

101
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,560
into episodes of tough crowd and then just talks about how offensive it is that

102
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,480
fucking somebody made a Columbine joke.

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Yo on that episode with me and Patrice I fucking...

104
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Patrice O'Neal was a legend dude he was one of my closest friends I try to emulate him in every way including speech patterns.

105
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Yeah and diabetes.

106
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Patrice O'Neal gave me cardboard from his house to spin my head on.

107
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,640
(laughing)

108
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,440
- Yeah, Michael Rapaport, dude pick up a mic dude,

109
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,840
come fucking, come on the pod.

110
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,720
We'll get you and Thomas, we'll squash it, you know.

111
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,280
- Yeah, I had a few with Rapaport before anyone,

112
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,120
by the way. - Really?

113
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,280
- Yeah, I'm really getting into like,

114
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm really like, I'm becoming one of those

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,920
like old Hollywood guys, it's like,

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,800
or like more like Trump, I was actually the first to.

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
(laughing)

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,640
He, so everyone knows Eli Lake,

119
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,120
Eli Lake was the guy everyone made fun of until...

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Yeah, the egg boy.

121
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,800
He kinda looks like Harold.

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Yeah.

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,960
It was before Twitter added new NPCs that you could fight in raids.

124
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,080
And Eli Lake was just... he's like a shitty neocon who everyone hated.

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,320
And for whatever idiot reason, Michael Rapaport was like, "Yo, this boy comes with the knowledge!"

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,880
And really liked Eli Lake.

127
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,720
So he went on Eli Lake's podcast, which I don't think runs anymore, and talked about how he

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
was getting made fun of on Twitter a lot by me.

129
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,600
And he said, "Well, one of the trolls is actually very talented and does a piece of political

130
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
satire I think is very good, Carl Diggler."

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,920
And then Rappaport went, "Yo, fuck Carl Diggler, Duke!"

132
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,400
That was the origin of the feud.

133
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,980
He's I don't hear every week. It seems like he there's a thing. We're like black people like can you stop?

134
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:37,360
Doing everything you're doing. Yeah, meanwhile. He's saying. I don't know what you're talking about as he's injecting himself with sickle-cell

135
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,160
Well, he like yeah, he attacked I think a friend of the pot about list universe today

136
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:02,220
Me

137
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:10,100
Basically immediately at any he was like this is this might be bad because Michael Rappaport as a picture of my penis now forever

138
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,060
I was like it's it's gonna be alright man. You can win this you could live with that

139
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,080
You can say that Michael Rapaport hacked him.

140
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Right?

141
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Yeah, exactly.

142
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
He got into my iCloud.

143
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,520
He's in the jail.

144
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,360
I think Thomas is 14 anyway.

145
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Yeah, Thomas is a kid.

146
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Yeah, what's Michael Rapaport doing with that boy?

147
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Thomas is 14 but he looks like that.

148
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,320
He's a very high T child.

149
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,560
I played Warzone with him last night and I hope he doesn't mind me saying this.

150
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,520
He told me that his mom did like a 23andMe thing and found out that his family is in

151
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,360
the 99th percentile for Neanderthal DNA presence.

152
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,880
I thought you were gonna say that.

153
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I thought you were gonna say that.

154
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
So good, dude.

155
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
It makes perfect sense.

156
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,400
Well, but Neanderthals, Neanderthal, like they were kind of, like it's kind of a good look

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,480
if you're like a human.

158
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,400
I have like very low, I got 23 and me, very low Neanderthal and I wish I had more Neanderthal.

159
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,520
Damn, you gave up the DNA, bro?

160
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I got a little bit.

161
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
You gave up the genome?

162
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Yeah, man.

163
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,840
Well, my, someone, my friend got it for me and it's like, then you have to do it.

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,920
Yeah, you gotta put your spit and sin in the mail.

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,760
I got a lot of mileage out of it though because it was like you are 99% Ashkenazi.

166
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Oh dude.

167
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Cool.

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,040
Well it ended, we had an Elizabeth Warren type family myth where like my mom thought that

169
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,200
we were like half Spanish, like the sexy kind, the Sephardic.

170
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
And it's like no.

171
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
No.

172
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,480
We're all the fucking beet farmer kind.

173
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,040
That rocks dude.

174
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
I did that.

175
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,760
I got a, I'm like 92% Irish.

176
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,240
I think I already posted about it, but I have like a 14th great-grandfather named Connor O'Connor

177
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:52,960
Wait, didn't you you texted us and said that you're like 9th grade? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

178
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,600
Amaziah Harding. Yeah

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,440
My my ninth great-grandfather in like this 1700s or something like that

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,480
Killed his wife and tried to weekend at Bernie's her

181
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,840
When the coroner came to like his fucking shack or whatever

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,960
They were they were like now hold on

183
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,860
Like he said oh, no he said that she died at natural causes, but like yeah, I don't know

184
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,420
So he when you say he weakened it burnt did he walk her around town?

185
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,520
Hammer stuck in her head. No. No I was reading his will

186
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,400
It was easier to kill your wife back

187
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Oh, it was way easier.

188
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
You knew uh...

189
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah, the staircase would have been the shortest documentary ever in 1750.

190
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Pat, you knew...

191
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
It would have been like, yeah, he pushed her down the stairs, of course.

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,400
That's what you do when you're sick of your wife.

193
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:03,400
You knew he weakened at Bernie, her, because his will said, um, he's leaving his, his, his uh, really complex marionette set to his son.

194
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
(laughter)

195
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
His robot exoskeleton.

196
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Yeah, he had a robot exoskeleton in 1792.

197
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
He had a piston suit, a hydraulic.

198
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
He had a steampunk mech suit.

199
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
(laughter)

200
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Well, that's how they created Gundams.

201
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah.

202
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Every Gundam has a dead wife in the middle of it.

203
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
(laughter)

204
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,400
A guy during one of the Shogunates killed his wife,

205
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
and he was like, "Oh, I'm gonna get in trouble for this."

206
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
That's the actual plot of Evangelion.

207
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Yeah, I was just about to say it.

208
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
[Laughter]

209
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Literally, yeah.

210
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Eva, yeah, like, uh...

211
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Uh, fuck,

212
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
what's his name again?

213
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Uh, Genki...

214
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Fuck, the doctor. The dead wife guy.

215
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Oh, uh, uh, fuckin'

216
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
uh, Gendo.

217
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Yeah, Gendo Ikari,

218
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
like, he's...

219
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
It is cool that he

220
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,080
just made a child wife.

221
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Yeah.

222
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,440
Like, the one thing that was wrong with my wife was that she wasn't 14.

223
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
Yeah.

224
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,800
And also she couldn't pilot a giant robot.

225
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Those licked her mind.

226
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,240
Those are the two bad things about my perfect wife.

227
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,840
Alright, so Felix, obviously you're a gamer.

228
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
You know, I think that's no secret.

229
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,280
You have a headset on as we speak.

230
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:34,160
I feel like this was the... Halo is a big part of this show, just 'cause, you know, I love

231
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Halo. Although if...

232
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,840
I fucking adore Halo.

233
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,760
You gotta love Halo, baby. If the Secret Service is listening, I've never played a first person

234
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,600
shooter in my life. I just appreciate Halo from a very far distance.

235
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
He reads the novels.

236
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:56,040
Yeah, exactly. I swear to God, the first like real book that I read was The Fall of Reach.

237
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,680
I don't think that's a real book. I don't think that counts. It's the first real book. I think

238
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,320
it was whatever you read after that.

239
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,480
Real book. No. That was my first real book.

240
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,160
Your mom made that book for you so you would start reading it.

241
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
It was a custom book.

242
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
No. No.

243
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
It was just pictures.

244
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,920
Yeah, it was not like it sold so well.

245
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,840
Your mom went on like Vistaprint and then made that.

246
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,640
No, I got it at Walmart and it was $7.

247
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Oh, okay.

248
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Come on, dude.

249
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
That confirms it.

250
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,640
We did, I picked out some lists from the top tens,

251
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,600
which is a website we use a lot

252
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,860
that are Halo themed vaguely.

253
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,760
They're about, so the first three,

254
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,940
these are all people arguing that other games

255
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,080
are either better than Halo

256
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,120
or Halo is better than other games.

257
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,920
So this first one is top 10 reasons

258
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,480
Minecraft is better than Halo.

259
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,640
And I don't know how familiar you are

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,600
with this website, Felix,

261
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,200
but basically the entire website is children fighting about video games.

262
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Top 10? I think I've like...

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,200
I like list websites like this because it's like...

264
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,900
It's the last thing you do.

265
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,300
You just read those to have white noise in your head.

266
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,800
That's the thing you do before you like try to kill yourself or call the suicide hotline.

267
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes, this like creates schizophrenia.

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,500
Like this is the... this is how it happens.

269
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,000
And this website does is...

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's different from Ranker or other ones that have an editorial staff.

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,680
This is just a crowd-sourced voting website.

272
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,360
Yeah, it's their user submissions.

273
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,800
And yeah, they're all 13-year-olds who are just struggling on the internet.

274
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,320
13-year-olds and us.

275
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,440
Yeah, and we're a year and a half into talking about it every day.

276
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,960
[LAUGHTER]

277
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,480
I think it would be awesome if that was the only media job left,

278
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,600
was being the editor for Top10.com.

279
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,720
all these all these people who like wrote articles that are like well Bernie didn't

280
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,100
literally rape but he is kind of like a rapist doesn't everyone agree like they

281
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,880
have that's the only they become they become journalistic serfs we have to

282
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,020
work for the yeah they're just like they're just getting bullied by like the

283
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:09,440
Glen Greenwald of top ten the best top ten list just keep this is still have

284
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,840
Top 10 reasons Justin Bieber is gay and just get him flamed on the internet.

285
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,440
That's his most viewed article.

286
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
That's like the Snowden article.

287
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Dude, that's the thing, this place is the final frontier of posting.

288
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,760
Oh yeah, it's got a ranking system, you level up on here.

289
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,680
Yeah, you can finally put a level, they finally gamified posting.

290
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,440
Yeah, the person who wrote this article is the vicar of St. Louis up the cream bun and

291
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,040
Jam. That's a level four.

292
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,540
Wow.

293
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,440
That's only level four.

294
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,040
Level five is mayor of Michelle Delving.

295
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,160
Awesome, dude.

296
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,080
What, who is Michelle Delving?

297
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,680
Where do you think this website comes from? Like what, what

298
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
country did this?

299
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,320
I'd say probably like one of the countries that like, used to be

300
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,440
in the USSR. But then when you read their Wikipedia, it's like

301
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,920
the age expectancy, or life expectancy after 1993 is

302
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
26 years old.

303
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,920
The chief exports are second-hand coffins.

304
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,920
It's whatever country Tom Hanks was from in the movie Terminal.

305
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Yeah, yeah.

306
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Just one of those landlocked piece of shit countries.

307
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Yeah, that all of your relatives are from.

308
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Yeah, well mine, yeah.

309
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Mine, yeah, definitely.

310
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,520
number one reason according to uh... the top tens white minecraft is better than

311
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,600
halo it doesn't have any inappropriate violence

312
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,560
that's all

313
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,260
that is true is only a program i'm crafton

314
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,560
you have a very appropriate violence in uh... uh... slaughtering house jenny

315
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,620
goes

316
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,160
yes i mean i'm all hitting a pig with a pickaxe or something

317
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,680
you know what he did come out against the animal yet

318
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
The creepers are subhuman.

319
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
[Laughter]

320
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
[Laughter]

321
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
When you really think about it.

322
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
To look at a-

323
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,680
To look at an innocent person's house and to blow your cell phone.

324
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
[Laughter]

325
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
It's absolutely abhorrent.

326
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Minecraft is responsible for a lot of-

327
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
This is- This is violence in the way that

328
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
people in academia say it, but

329
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,680
you know who Tfue is?

330
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Yeah, vaguely.

331
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Yeah, so he's like one of the biggest streamers on Twitch

332
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,400
and he's like, he's the guy who said that ninja sucks. Yeah, he called ninja a pussy recently.

333
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:40,200
That's what it is. Well, he was playing Minecraft with a 15 year old streamer and just said the n-word like the soft a

334
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Damn

335
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,560
It was like, it was cool. Like he like it was like everyone was cool with it

336
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,800
Like he didn't get in trouble, but it's like how do you say that during Minecraft?

337
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
*laughter*

338
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Yeah, yeah, what what what part of Minecraft will drive you to the n-word?

339
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,320
He wasn't even mad though, he was just like doing this weird move.

340
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
He's yelling at the villagers.

341
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
He was!

342
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
He was!

343
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Oh no!

344
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Oh no!

345
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Oh my god.

346
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,360
That's the highest level is calling the villager the soft day at work.

347
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,920
Please, be Minecraft.

348
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,120
Yeah, the term of endearment version.

349
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Yeah.

350
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
To the villager.

351
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,400
Yeah, the Michael Rapaport version of it.

352
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,080
Yeah, exactly.

353
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Yeah.

354
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,480
I was trying to say they weren't my friends.

355
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Just...

356
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Yeah.

357
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,840
I watched today, just because Michael Rapaport was driving me insane, I watched a like 20

358
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:43,280
minute interview that he did with Taleb Kweli and he keeps saying, he keeps saying, he keeps

359
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
calling him Kwa, first of all.

360
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,720
He's being like, "Kwa, you know me, dog.

361
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
You know me."

362
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,960
And apparently there was some controversy where he like made fun of a woman for having ashy

363
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
ankles.

364
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Oh my God.

365
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,220
(laughing)

366
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,160
- And Talib Kweli is like,

367
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,920
"Why are you calling black women's ankles ashy online?"

368
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,580
And he's like, "Yo, I just call it like I sees it, bro."

369
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,600
(laughing)

370
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,840
I fucking love him, dude.

371
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,360
- My friend trolled Talib Kweli

372
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,440
for about seven years, I would say.

373
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,520
- He's one of the all-time,

374
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,240
just like he'll respond to anybody.

375
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,360
- I've been thinking, when I got my check,

376
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,840
I thought he will definitely respond to me now,

377
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
but it's like, I couldn't think of anything.

378
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,120
But that is a great guy for Michael Rapaport to talk to.

379
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,680
- Oh, yeah, absolutely. - That is top level.

380
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
- Yeah.

381
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880
- He should wear the hat, honestly.

382
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,440
The black thought, telepoly, most F hat.

383
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,660
He would look good, man.

384
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,720
- Do you remember the New Danger?

385
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,560
- Yes.

386
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,760
- I got a $20 iTunes gift card in Christmas of 2004,

387
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,880
and it was, I had my first PC ever,

388
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,320
like Half-Life of Two was out, I was playing that,

389
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,400
and I was like, oh, what am I gonna listen to

390
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,880
while I play Half-Life?

391
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,360
Oh, I know, Most F, because I liked the song Mathematics

392
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,160
and I bought the new Danger on iTunes,

393
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,800
and I was like, this is dog shit.

394
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,440
- Oh, it sucks, dude.

395
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,520
- That's, I think that's what got me back

396
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,720
into pirating music.

397
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,400
He says like, I think I like felt bad about pirating,

398
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,260
and I was like, I'm not gonna do it,

399
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,960
I don't wanna like get my parents sued,

400
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,840
I'm gonna stop doing it. I'm gonna use iTunes and then I bought the new danger and I was like now fuck this

401
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,300
Do you like the video do you remember the video of most deaf?

402
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,960
He goes through the tube feeding process that they did to the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Yes

403
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,120
It feels like a dream yeah, there's a video that

404
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,960
Like he did it with like like vice or something and it's him in a white room in a in an orange jumpsuit

405
00:19:47,960 --> 00:20:00,200
and they stick tubes in his nose and he is hamming it up so hard and and then like

406
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,400
as soon as it's in and then out he's like yes that's basically what they're

407
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,920
doing thanks to George Bush this was it was in like 2013 this is it this is from

408
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:19,120
an alternate universe that only you and Felix know about. In our world this was the biggest

409
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:28,040
video. This was the first viral video in Calebverse. It's you, it's you, Felix, and Michael Rapoport

410
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:35,120
and you guys. I would love to live in the Michael Rapoport alternate universe. In his

411
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
I want to do I'm gonna do being Michael Rappaport

412
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,160
So fucking badly it's just it's just different rooms of him hanging out with a tribe called quest

413
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:52,080
You go through the little door and then it's just like you have to like go to some bodega in Brooklyn and like

414
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,000
Everybody in every scenario calls him black Michael Rappaport

415
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,000
Michael Rappaport, I was, I forget where I was talking about this, but you know how like

416
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,820
the my favorite like New York slang was when guys would call each other God because it was like the

417
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,280
5% nation thing where every black man is a God

418
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,880
And I think Michael Rappaport's probably the only white guy who ever tried that. Oh, he said God

419
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,540
He says he still uses B all the time. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, so like in the telequality interview

420
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,420
So he's like, "B, you gotta listen to me on this one.

421
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm spitting facts right now."

422
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,160
What was the interview only about?

423
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,820
Because I remember when he got catfished for that.

424
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:47,180
I saw one section of it, which was 20 minutes, but the full interview is like two hours,

425
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:54,180
and I will never watch two hours of him telling Quillian.

426
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Why was he interviewing him?

427
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Go for it.

428
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,260
30,000 views on YouTube.

429
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,180
And it's Talib Kweli doing some,

430
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,860
doing like some podcast that he did for like six months.

431
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,700
And he's talking to Michael Rapaport.

432
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Oh, is that the Barstool one he got fired from?

433
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,380
No, that's Michael Rapaport had a podcast.

434
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,220
Oh, oh, oh, right.

435
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,420
And he got fired from for beating his wife or something.

436
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,260
Yeah.

437
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,340
(laughing)

438
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,480
I think it was, I don't know,

439
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,900
I may be making that up.

440
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
I think you might be.

441
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,560
No, no, I'm actually not.

442
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,100
He beat the shit out of his wife.

443
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,940
No, he absolutely did.

444
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,100
Wait, did he?

445
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,660
Dude, he killed his wife, dude.

446
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,500
Oh, wow.

447
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Wow, that's what I know.

448
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
That's what I know, dude.

449
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah, dude. He killed his wife and he held the gun sideways and shot her.

450
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
[Laughter]

451
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm serious.

452
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
I'm serious.

453
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,500
He said, "That was awesome," and then he threw her into the Hudson River.

454
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,500
And then they fired him from Barstool Sports for that. Can you believe it?

455
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Yeah, and Portnoy does not abide with killing your wife. He's a responsible man.

456
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I respect Dave.

457
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,500
He's a real Boston Catholic. He doesn't abide by the law.

458
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
And nobody from Boston ever hit their wife.

459
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
No. No. It just doesn't happen.

460
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
It doesn't happen.

461
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,500
People in Boston, like, people have this like, bullshit attitude about Boston

462
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
because they themselves are too cowardly to drunk drive in Boston.

463
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Right. That's right.

464
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Finally something happened.

465
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
That's right. That's right.

466
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
That's fucking right.

467
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:25,180
Well, I if I was so I've been fantasizing about the breakup of America and obviously I would go back to the Midwest to try to

468
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,580
Become like, you know the Charlemagne of the Great Lakes, but one of my first actually made the God

469
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:38,560
The God was on radio and was like, yeah, so I drugged and raped

470
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:46,300
Yeah, and then like just nothing

471
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:53,780
No one gave a shit, but I thought it was awesome. Yeah, he was like yo, that's how we do it

472
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:13,700
But no I more like the French Charlemagne, okay

473
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
One of my first dad.

474
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Prince Charlemagne the god.

475
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Oh that's even, he's even worse.

476
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
He's a way bigger rapist.

477
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,700
He does that all the time then.

478
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,700
I would, I would like create a drug driving license.

479
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Yeah, oh smart.

480
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
That's one of the things I would do.

481
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Yeah, an endorsement for your license.

482
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Well yeah, you should be able to.

483
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,700
It's like, yeah.

484
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,700
It's a, it's a little beer emoji.

485
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,700
At the bottom of the license where it's got the heart for organ donors is Nick Nolte's

486
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
mug shot.

487
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:51,620
I've been trying to like pretend to be a drunk driving advocate on Twitter and no one's yelled

488
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,620
at me for it.

489
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
Yeah, absolutely.

490
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
Yeah, no one's taken the bait.

491
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
Because I know you're right.

492
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,060
I think people are going to defend it.

493
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,060
What are you going to do?

494
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:07,460
I want Rappaport, I wanted Rappaport to like notice the emojis in my name, like the clicking

495
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
beers in the car.

496
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,980
Oh yeah, and be like, "You scumbag drunk driver."

497
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,980
Yo, drug driving killed some of the best hip hop artists of all time.

498
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Bushwick Bill?

499
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,980
Fucking Bushwick Bill?

500
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Fucking I don't know who else.

501
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Bushwick Bill is like in Michael Rapaport's brain, it's his mini me.

502
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:39,980
He walks out of his Brooklyn apartment and it's Bushwick Bill.

503
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Alright, back to this list.

504
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,980
Number two, you get to be creative in Minecraft, I guess, unlike Halo.

505
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
You can be creative in Halo.

506
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Forge, baby.

507
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,980
The top comment here, "What about Forge?"

508
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
"Oh, burn."

509
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
"What about mods?"

510
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
"Castles?"

511
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
"Pixel art?"

512
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
"House statues?"

513
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
"Oh, burn."

514
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Definitely seven-year-olds.

515
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Fucking do notice, baby.

516
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Fucking destroy.

517
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,020
Well the reply to that comment doesn't realize that they're talking about Halo and thinks

518
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,300
they're talking about Minecraft and says "Do you realize that those can be built in Halo

519
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
as well?"

520
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,660
Damn, I love the confusion.

521
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,180
Yeah, no one's getting like, I don't know what.

522
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,940
You can build whatever you want.

523
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,300
Also, you can like think about the greatest cop player of all time.

524
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:37,420
about Walshii and like Bestman, even my own friend, girlfriend Haver, they're incredibly

525
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,880
creative players.

526
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,820
That's what makes competitive Halo awesome.

527
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,560
And that's why it's like one of the first eSports in America.

528
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,900
So take that you fucking idiot seven year old fucking moron.

529
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
You fucking pussy.

530
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,060
It is funny that this whole show is yelling at children.

531
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,620
But they're wrong!

532
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,060
They're fucking wrong all the time!

533
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,380
That's what keeps us going, is that we know that we are right and they are wrong.

534
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,640
Like number three, you can install mods.

535
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,460
You can install mods on Halo, man.

536
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,140
You can do the Master Chief Nude mod.

537
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,140
I know.

538
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
Yeah.

539
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Oh, trust me.

540
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:24,220
Why doesn't this fucking kid get a job, buy a PC, it's only $3,500 for everything.

541
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,140
Yeah, get an RTX card.

542
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,380
get all of it, get a good motherboard, then you can play Halo on PC and then you can mod

543
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,660
it instead of just playing on an Xbox like a fucking imbecile like you are.

544
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,660
You don't even need to get all that shit, you can just download the Halo CE demo and

545
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,940
download a Mario map into it.

546
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,700
I've done it.

547
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,860
You can download the fucking Mushroom Kingdom into the demo of Halo CE.

548
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,340
How many Cortana nipple mods exist?

549
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,940
Oh a billion.

550
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
Yeah, with all different lengths.

551
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,940
[Laughter]

552
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:06,940
I like that in the later bad Halo games, that they realize that every player's fantasy is to fuck Cortana.

553
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,940
So like, "Yeah, she's like kind of a woman now."

554
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
I don't know.

555
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,940
Yeah, they also make her butt crack longer and longer in every single version of her.

556
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
It's awesome.

557
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,940
They made her the Siri for the Lumos.

558
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Yeah, I talk to her on a daily basis.

559
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
That shit is so funny.

560
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
Yeah.

561
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,140
Awesome dude, and guess what the icon for Cortana is?

562
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
A hole.

563
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,500
And you want to tell me you're not sexualizing her?

564
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Microsoft?

565
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
No.

566
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,060
There have probably been a lot of guys who, like, after a schizophrenic break, probably

567
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,660
during quarantine, have killed themselves while operating Windows 10 because they think

568
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,940
like Cortana's in love with them and they want to live in their computer.

569
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:55,340
Yes, dude, that's the danger of the AI version of Clippy or whatever, is that it talks to you.

570
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
What?

571
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,940
It's like every sci-fi movie has always had an evil robot with the exact voice that's on my computer right now.

572
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,940
Well, Clippy, everyone knows Clippy was for gay men.

573
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,940
Yeah, Clippy was fan service for gay men in Microsoft Windows.

574
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,360
So like once straight men started buying computers, they introduced Cortana.

575
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,120
Straight men didn't buy women.

576
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,100
So everyone has something and that's like why I'm a Windows guy.

577
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,700
Because they like, they accommodate people.

578
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:31,300
Apple just like, Siri is just like a fucking sexless whatever.

579
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,220
Absolutely no pussy on Siri.

580
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,520
There's no clippy, there's nothing for anyone.

581
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,340
You can make Siri Australian, I know that.

582
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Okay, alright.

583
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
That's something.

584
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
That's something.

585
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
Yeah.

586
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,900
I have an Australian male Siri.

587
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Yeah.

588
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
You would, dude.

589
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Yeah, you would, dude.

590
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
No, I do.

591
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Yeah, you would.

592
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Yeah, you would be- you do because you would.

593
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Yeah, you do, dude.

594
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
What?

595
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,500
That doesn't even make sense, you gay bitch.

596
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,100
Number four, um...

597
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,940
Number four, if you die, you can get your stuff back.

598
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,740
Wow, that's fast.

599
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,500
Have you ever played Respawn or campaigned with checkpoints, you fucking moron?

600
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,780
God, it's like these kids, I think they misunderstand Halo because they are not old enough to buy

601
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,380
it from GameStop without a parent's ID.

602
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
Facts.

603
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Yeah.

604
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,140
From Fed, download it.

605
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,420
Learn what Steam is.

606
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:33,780
I remember I had, when I was growing up, I got the Modern Warfare 2 at Costco and I bought

607
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,940
it with like my birthday money or whatever and we we my dad was with my dad

608
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,860
because I didn't have a Costco membership I was like 14. Did they have any like

609
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,100
Costco exclusive items like they do? No no but when I bought it they were like

610
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,260
the guy at the cashier said to my dad... Like some Kirkland signature like...

611
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,260
The guy said to my dad... You get a Kirkland signature item in game.

612
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:01,260
You get a Kirkland signature... You get yeah you get a chicken bake icon in Modern Warfare 2.

613
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,660
You can only get that. I would love that.

614
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,420
Dude, yeah, they did that with Skate 3 and Miracle Whip.

615
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
[Laughter]

616
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,900
But the cashier, he looked at my dad, he was like holding the game, and he was like,

617
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,420
"Sir, I'm legally obliged to tell you that this game has a mass shooting scene in it.

618
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,900
Are you sure you want to purchase this for your son?"

619
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,860
[Laughter]

620
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,900
He said that he was legally obliged.

621
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,940
[Laughter]

622
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,300
Like there was some fucking, some law that uh, kids couldn't play the most awesome part of the game.

623
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,800
Sorry.

624
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,940
There, when I was like uh, when I was like 12, my dad like, I guess he was like kinda interested in it.

625
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,140
And I couldn't think of what mission to like, make him play.

626
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,860
Like I didn't think like, oh maybe do like the combat training mission.

627
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,820
So I made my dad.

628
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,180
You made your dad play No Rush.

629
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,580
Yeah I made my dad play No Rush and he was like, wait I'm just mowing people down?

630
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,700
What the fuck is this?

631
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,260
Hey this is kinda fun Patrick.

632
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
It would have been worse if he really liked it.

633
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,720
He was like, "How many more levels are there?"

634
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,220
Are they off?

635
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,220
That would be so fucked if you made your dad a mass shooter.

636
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,220
With video games.

637
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:16,220
I show my dad NoRussian, then like next week he's got like Postal 2 running on the computer.

638
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,720
What was that fucking game, Hatred?

639
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Yeah, yeah, I was just reading about that.

640
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Yeah, he becomes the Hatred guy.

641
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Yeah, they're putting that game on Switch, which is so funny to me.

642
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
That's hilarious

643
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,580
That's the only people I know switches are like

644
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,280
women

645
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,940
My late my like young very young cousins

646
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:43,520
Yeah, there's no there's no real games on the switch except Zelda and

647
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was so fucked up, dude

648
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,160
Come on guys. I'm sorry vote to really

649
00:32:52,160 --> 00:33:04,500
I use it for Halo. I throw it at my wife while I'm on warzone and say like play

650
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,400
play gone home or something. Here you can play too, here's your controller.

651
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,680
Your controller to other people. Yeah I tape a screenshot of Lizzie McGuire to the front of it

652
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Just let her press all the buttons for a while.

653
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
[Laughter]

654
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Number five, uh, it's controlled by keyboard and mouse.

655
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Again, it's- these kids are so oblivious.

656
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
[Gibberish]

657
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I'm getting so pissed off right now.

658
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I have to take a- I'm fucking pissed off.

659
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
I have to take a leak. You guys handle this one.

660
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I can't even fucking speak.

661
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,680
These kids have never used, like, a Razer Deathadder Elite.

662
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Gotcha, yeah, so, okay, so let me get this straight.

663
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
You ever heard of the Master Chief Collection?

664
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
Yeah.

665
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Ever heard of that, like I said earlier, the Halo CE demo?

666
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Yeah.

667
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Oh, Felix actually, we can say whatever we want about him right now.

668
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Um, he, uh, Felix, fuck, he, um, shit.

669
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
His favorite candy is Tootsie Rolls.

670
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Oh shit!

671
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Dude, we have to edit that out.

672
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
He's gonna be so pissed.

673
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
He's gonna be so pissed off, dude.

674
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,320
His favorite candies are Tootsie Rolls and toothpaste.

675
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,680
He told us before we started this that he likes brushing his teeth.

676
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,080
He eats floss.

677
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,280
Yeah, fuckin' sicko.

678
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,020
Number six, there's no war going on.

679
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
That's not true.

680
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
Yeah, ever heard of it?

681
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,560
There is a war going on in the Ender, or whatever.

682
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
The Ender Dragon.

683
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,560
There's a war between the creative geniuses and the griefers.

684
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,440
Yeah, a never-ending war.

685
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,520
And the griefers are winning.

686
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,400
We need more creatives in Minecraft.

687
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,000
Everybody get on Minecraft.

688
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,560
Kill your local griefer.

689
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,960
Just DIY kids walking around with that on their shirt.

690
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
It's got like a creeper.

691
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,640
It's like one of those big back patches.

692
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Add it to the teespring.

693
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,800
Yeah, kill your local griefer.

694
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,800
That's gonna be the second Minecraft themed shirt on our merch store.

695
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,400
There's already a Minecraft shirt.

696
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,960
We already have a shirt that says "I went to your mine and nobody knew you."

697
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,760
And now we're gonna have "Kill your local griefer."

698
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,120
How do you grief someone in Minecraft?

699
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,920
I like literally never played Minecraft.

700
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
You just, okay, so there's a-

701
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,160
You take down their house.

702
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,720
There's a Potabat List Minecraft server that somebody started.

703
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,720
And I spent like two days at the beginning of quarantine building a very cool modern

704
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,280
house designed by an idiot boy on a chair.

705
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,240
It was not a modern house.

706
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,800
It was a tower of wooden blocks that had no windows, no doors.

707
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
It was just a tower.

708
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
No, no, no.

709
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
At the top I built the house.

710
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Maybe you never saw it because you were invited.

711
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
It was a platform.

712
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
It wasn't a house.

713
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,280
But in the middle of the night, two griefers joined the server and burned down my house.

714
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,760
And it was like, it was a heat in my body I've never felt in my life.

715
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,120
It hurt so bad.

716
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,060
And I asked the guy who mods the server, I was like, "Is there any way you can fix this?"

717
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,560
And he went into the code and reversed what they did.

718
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,240
But for those few moments where I saw my creation on fire, I wanted to kill myself.

719
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,880
That's what John Wick felt.

720
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
Yeah, exactly.

721
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
The exact same feeling.

722
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,320
Yeah, that's what happened.

723
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,520
That house was a gift from my dead wife.

724
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Like, he met his-

725
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Well, John Wick had a-

726
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,360
John Wick had a 15 year old, like, dyed hair Minecraft wife,

727
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,760
and that's why- he's like a morally complex character,

728
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,280
'cause you shouldn't do that as a 45 year old man.

729
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,000
True, yeah.

730
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,320
But also, like, that was his Minecraft house,

731
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,240
so it's like, that's why I like that movie,

732
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,480
because there's like- you don't really know who the bad guy is,

733
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,400
or who the good guy is, but you can appreciate

734
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,800
how good John Wick is at action.

735
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,300
Yeah.

736
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,800
Yeah, that's reasonable.

737
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
And how cool his house was before it went down.

738
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,300
He did have a very cool house.

739
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,800
Yeah.

740
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
I never found it-

741
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
I've started that.

742
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,300
What is he-

743
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,300
What was his job?

744
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Why was he so rich?

745
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,800
Why did he have such a cool house?

746
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,300
He probably saved a lot of money from being an assassin.

747
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,800
Oh, true.

748
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,300
He probably like-

749
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Because he was retired and it's like-

750
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
I presume-

751
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Well, I'm something of a financial expert.

752
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:20,800
Yeah.

753
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,300
So, with John Wick-

754
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,800
John Wick probably got paid like a million dollars per hit.

755
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
And what he probably did was-

756
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
He bought these things called municipal bonds.

757
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
And when you buy-

758
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,360
it's those are corporate bonds the interest in corporate bonds is taxed at

759
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,200
uh... the rate which we tax capital gains

760
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,340
but the interest on uh... municipal bonds is not

761
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,520
so if john wick bought you don't say five million dollars worth of huntsville

762
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,240
alabama municipal bonds paying out at three point five percent

763
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,320
that's like

764
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,080
he made so much money none of those taxed

765
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,520
he got the original five million back and he retired he was done

766
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,880
and then he also had pirates coins

767
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
in a briefcase

768
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
it's true

769
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
they also found a pirate's chest

770
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
which is a used coin

771
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
that was like one of my fantasies

772
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
as a kid

773
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
finding ancient money

774
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
dude pirate coins are so cool

775
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
for some reason old money, old gold

776
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
feels like it should be worth more

777
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
that was my thinking

778
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
if you find the equivalent of a million dollars

779
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
from ten thousand years ago

780
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
it's like a billion dollars now

781
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,420
give it to me a child yeah you go to the you go to the exchange the money

782
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,040
exchange in the airport and get good give them your doubloons and you can

783
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,260
there's a great exchange rate on the millions of one million dollars in a

784
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,040
briefcase just in case yeah I said earlier before we started recording that

785
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,500
oh yeah yes yes for you his ancestry told him he has pirate blood I would like you

786
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:56,380
explain what that means I am related to someone who has captain in their name

787
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:04,660
according to ancestry.com that's and you just that's all I needed to know it's

788
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,580
all I needed to hear where else would he be the Irish Navy like I don't think so

789
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:17,940
yeah exactly 70% from Ireland 30% from the sea 99% bitch I could just be named

790
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:28,340
captain I mean yeah I have mafia blood yeah oh yeah yeah my my like a Jewish

791
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,140
mafia no no he worked for Capone. No, 3/6 Mafia.

792
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me rap before baby.

793
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,140
Yo, this goes back centuries, blood!

794
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:45,060
Um, no, it was, uh, he worked for Al Capone and stole money from him and then got

795
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,060
nervous and killed himself.

796
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
(laughter)

797
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,060
So yes, Jewish Mafia.

798
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,060
He fucked up. That is the Jewish Mafia.

799
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
"Oh God, they're gonna be so mad at me!"

800
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
(laughter)

801
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
"Oh God!"

802
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
"I should just die!"

803
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
(laughter)

804
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
I have,

805
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
and then like another ancestor,

806
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,060
like the biggest thing they achieved

807
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,060
was he was a piano player in the Russian

808
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,060
Imperial Army. Oh nice.

809
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:19,300
Yeah, well he played the Halo theme like so that was he played it on cellos like yo-yo mob, but yeah

810
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,740
I'm just imagining a version of casino where every character is Robert De Niro in that movie

811
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:32,720
That's like your whole family yeah, no, it's they were not an accomplished gang

812
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,380
They didn't they didn't get a whole lot done before like the 1900s. They were

813
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,340
They just lived in like you know

814
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,860
The worst part of the Russian Empire and like oh my dad's side

815
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,060
Pretended to be German, which is a very ignominious faith

816
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,980
That is cool though. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they pretended to be German Jews

817
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,820
They were like we're still Jewish, but we're like the the fancy kind

818
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,820
Did that get you points back then it did well it should have because like

819
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,540
Do you know who invented the word kayak?

820
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,740
It was German Jews describing Russian Jews

821
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,900
But they were probably right because they'd like they swear they could speak German and they like can't

822
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:18,180
That's kind of like that's kind of like me I took two years

823
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,300
- I feel like your goal in life should be,

824
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,260
when you're 300 years in the future,

825
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,100
when your ancestors, your descendants do 23andMe,

826
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,540
they'll be like, "Oh, he had a podcast."

827
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,420
- Yeah, yeah, they'll be able to tell.

828
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,260
- Podcast or what?

829
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,740
- It's just like the pirate thing.

830
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,060
It's just like the pirate thing for me.

831
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,720
It's just, I talked about, I made fun of little kids.

832
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,860
- Yeah, he made fun of little kids online all the time.

833
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,900
He loved eating cheeseburgers.

834
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,740
It says right here.

835
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,260
It says right here that your grandfather was addicted to cheeseburgers.

836
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,420
It says right here he tried to put a bunch of chips in a 7-Eleven hot dog and choked at

837
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,740
24.

838
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:19,860
That's like your version of Final Destination, is you see that vision as you're sprinkling

839
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,180
the chips on the hot dog.

840
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,940
You can't help yourself, you just go, "Oh well."

841
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,780
It's like, "Ah, I'm dead.

842
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,780
I gotta do it."

843
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,500
There's no choice.

844
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:38,180
It's lunch time, I gotta do it.

845
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,380
Let's see, what else is good on this list?

846
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,060
You've got a little own here.

847
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,220
You can play with six or more players and then two comets back to back.

848
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,100
It says you can play with 64 on Halo.

849
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,540
I don't think I ever did a 64 person Halo match.

850
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,620
You could, you could, you absolutely could.

851
00:42:54,620 --> 00:43:02,620
I played Halo Reach for a while, but then I went to Battlefield.

852
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,460
Bad Company 2 is so good.

853
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,620
Best FPS of all time.

854
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,380
We talked about this.

855
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,500
It was cool to blow up a building.

856
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,060
Oh, didn't you?

857
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,740
Caleb, weren't you ranked or something?

858
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:24,740
So like at the beginning, when Bad Company 2 first started being like a competitive MLG

859
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:31,940
game, me and a friend started like a clan that there was nobody in it except us, you're supposed

860
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,340
to have like 8 people at minimum, and we registered on the MLG website.

861
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:42,520
And then our first week we got paired with FaZe, and we started the match and there was

862
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,240
only two of us so we had to forfeit but they reported that it was a forfeit and

863
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,960
we reported that it was a win and for some reason the energy system it got

864
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,520
they've just believed us and so for like two weeks we were the number one bad

865
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:02,880
company clan in the world and we never played a game. That is, no, that's well

866
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,200
that's gonna be on the 23andMe. Yeah. When they got the stories on the side of

867
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,520
ancestry and it's like oh my uncle fell down a fucking elevator shaft or whatever

868
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:21,040
it's just Caleb lied about gaming when he was 15. He was ranked number one for two weeks.

869
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,800
Your uncle rocked. Those were, Battlefield those are the best games because they

870
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,400
were like openly ridiculous but then when that, Battlefield 1 happened because

871
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,720
like enough people at DICE were like war is serious. Yeah, we need to do the

872
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:44,960
least fun war. I also think Battlefield is the ultimate pipeline to the actual military

873
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:53,200
for kids. As far as games go. Because the thing is, because of the bullet drop with the snipers,

874
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,760
a kid gets good at that and they're like "I could do that in real life." It did almost

875
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,240
happen to me. I would play Battlefield, I would play Bad Company and be like, I would

876
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,360
ARCA shot and be like, I could definitely do this.

877
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,800
- Yeah, it'd be easy.

878
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,080
This is so accurate.

879
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,400
- I probably have talked about this on the show before,

880
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,960
but did you ever play America's Army?

881
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,120
- No.

882
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,560
- America's Army, it was just Operation Flashpoint,

883
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,320
but re-skinned by the army.

884
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,160
And me and my friends, I was,

885
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,280
'cause I'd given up the idea of getting posy in high school.

886
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,160
I played Operation Flashpoint all the time.

887
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,000
- Nice.

888
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,900
- And me and my friends were amazing at it.

889
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,160
So we, like American's Army was a recruiting tool,

890
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,680
but we would absolutely like wash

891
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,660
just like dumb people from Mississippi

892
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,800
who were like, they thought it was gonna be like COD

893
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,760
or something.

894
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
We just fucking decimate them

895
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,560
because we were fucking nerds.

896
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,720
And I think we probably kept a lot of people

897
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,560
out of the military.

898
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,400
(laughing)

899
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,240
- Damn dude.

900
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,720
That's praxis.

901
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,000
That was the start of my journey as anti-imperialist.

902
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,520
Yeah, it was a good buck.

903
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,680
Owning my cousins on America's Army.

904
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,520
Yeah, yeah.

905
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,360
That rocks, dude.

906
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,320
Thank you for that.

907
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,160
No, you're welcome.

908
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,980
Thank you for your service.

909
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,320
I kept them out of Iraq.

910
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,160
You did.

911
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,980
Yeah.

912
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,820
That's true.

913
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,840
All my cousins who joined the military

914
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,840
just like went to San Diego

915
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,440
and then convinced themselves that they were heroes

916
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,560
and then came back with the worst tattoos

917
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
that anybody's ever had.

918
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,880
And now they work as electricians.

919
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,680
They ate a bunch of California burritos

920
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,800
with the French fries in them,

921
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,240
and they're like, "Yeah, that's the same

922
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,600
"as doming some little kid.

923
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,160
"I don't care what you say."

924
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,080
- Exactly.

925
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,400
- The coolest thing that I ever heard a veteran say

926
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,680
was when I bounced at a bar when I was in school

927
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,760
in Minnesota, there was a guy who was

928
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,120
in the Air Force Reserves who we were throwing out,

929
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,120
and one of the bouncers, he was 19, 20,

930
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,320
he was just like, I don't know why

931
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,640
they made him a bouncer, honestly.

932
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,360
He was very diminutive.

933
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,180
but he had a camo like flat brim on

934
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,500
like a camo twins hat flat brim

935
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,620
and the air force guy was like I'm a veteran I fought for your right to wear

936
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,380
that hat

937
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,180
*laughter*

938
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:16,180
I fought for your right to wear a fifty nine fifty

939
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,740
*laughter*

940
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,540
I didn't want to throw him out

941
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:26,300
to get a little bit yeah yeah he did he did he killed rob dear dick and still

942
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,900
have a

943
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,860
yeah

944
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,720
iraq's that veterans are all veterans are smart and should be respected

945
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,780
you know that you're on the rock that's what we say that we say at the

946
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:42,060
beginning of the episode every week before you know yeah we have a clear

947
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,020
clip like we like mark marons lock the gates but it's a status that the

948
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,660
veterans

949
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,740
that that bill

950
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:54,260
There was, I worked at a, uh, I, there was this gym in Brooklyn that I left because of a veteran.

951
00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:00,820
It was like, Oh my God, this guy, he was like, I don't know if he was an actual operator,

952
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,820
just pretend and be a veteran, but he's like one of those vets who like has a dog because

953
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:11,140
the war scared him. Oh, yeah. Like, Oh, yeah. Oh, I need to, I need this dog or else I'm going to

954
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:17,300
scare my wife. Uh, but he would like bring the dog to the first floor where all the Olympic shit was

955
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,060
and would throw the tennis ball everywhere for his fucking shithead dog

956
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,580
and the dog would nearly get killed by weights every day

957
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,780
Jesus Christ

958
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,620
and I was like I don't want to deal with it like I'm done

959
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,420
I'm dead

960
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,900
Yeah that's the last time you go to Chris Dorner's pump house

961
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:38,180
Yeah

962
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,500
Because it was just like I like I like catastrophize sometimes but it was like

963
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,860
what if I got into an argument with this guy and it became this whole thing

964
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,060
and it would be like, "Socialist Podcaster Yells at Veteran."

965
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,900
(laughing)

966
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,740
For having dogs.

967
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,540
- Yeah, that'd be such a good Joey Salads video.

968
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,300
- It would ruin my life.

969
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,740
It would ruin my life.

970
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,140
Because I would be on video like,

971
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,340
"Well, you didn't even have to go to the fucking war.

972
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,260
"You don't even need that fucking dog."

973
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,500
(laughing)

974
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,700
- You're still lifting as you yell it out.

975
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,540
(laughing)

976
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,620
You're squatting.

977
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,860
- It'd just send me down a really dark path.

978
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,140
I'm glad I didn't engage.

979
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,900
Yeah, I used to work at a gym

980
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,960
and people would bring dogs in all the time

981
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,820
and they would ask if I could keep them behind the desk.

982
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,020
Which is such a weird thing.

983
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,340
I'd watch my fucking dog.

984
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,340
Yeah, it's completely crazy.

985
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,660
I worked at a very high-end gym too

986
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,020
and I was making minimum wage

987
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,780
and it just felt so goofy to be also somebody's dog sitter

988
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,220
for 12 bucks an hour.

989
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,220
That's the job they did hire me.

990
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:49,220
Yeah, Patrick applied at that job and something about him threw them off.

991
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,220
Yeah, I don't know what it was.

992
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,220
At a gym.

993
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,220
Maybe you were eating a burrito in the interview.

994
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,220
I did get a 7-Eleven. I can't go to 7-Eleven.

995
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,220
I know you did.

996
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,220
You got one of the chimichangas in the bag.

997
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,220
No, I got the hot dog. I got a hot dog. I'm standing by mine.

998
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,220
I want a 7-Eleven microwave with the numbers on it.

999
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,220
Yeah, that would be sick.

1000
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,460
So much better, I never have to look at the wattage,

1001
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,100
I just know that this is a four.

1002
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,900
I'm looking up right now if you could buy a 7-Eleven

1003
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,020
microwave on eBay.

1004
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,620
Probably $10,000.

1005
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,860
Yeah, okay, 7-Eleven microwave.

1006
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,460
They have to have it, you have to be able to buy it.

1007
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,700
Oh, no, you can get pre-owned microwave filters.

1008
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,780
(laughing)

1009
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,500
That is, what is happening if you're buying that?

1010
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,720
What is happening if you're selling them

1011
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,120
because they're $3, like how bad do you need $3?

1012
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,040
- Yeah, and also, I mean, a microwave,

1013
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,240
microwaves are free.

1014
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,560
They're like couches and white fridges.

1015
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,800
You just get them on Craigslist on the side of the road.

1016
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,620
- Yeah.

1017
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,040
- The microwave I got came with the apartment.

1018
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,880
Have you seen that?

1019
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,960
- Same with me. - That's a come up, bro.

1020
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,800
- Same with me.

1021
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,080
- No, the one that looks like the TV

1022
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,280
from fucking Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

1023
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,320
- You have like a microwave that looks like

1024
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,240
what Walt Disney thought a microwave was gonna look like

1025
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,080
in 50 years.

1026
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:16,440
It's like it's fucking huge and then like you open the door and then the opening is like the size of like a box

1027
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,840
It's not even looks like you looks like you put a little bit

1028
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,800
It looks like you put a cube in it and a steak dinner on a plate comes out

1029
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,160
Spy kids microwave I

1030
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:35,080
Know I don't know how my mom always had it

1031
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,120
It's like one of those things where like yeah your mom has the best version of it

1032
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,680
You don't even know where she found it my mom has some like fucking chrome bullshit microwave. That's really good

1033
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,660
I'm like Rome yeah Michael Rapaport would love

1034
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,980
Yeah, oh man, man, I'm running spitter in my popcorn.

1035
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,980
[Laughter]

1036
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,980
Damn, you got a chromed out microwave.

1037
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
[Laughter]

1038
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,100
Felix's mom, you'd pop his hell for that one, bro.

1039
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,100
He's got hydraulics on the microwave.

1040
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,100
[Laughter]

1041
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,100
[Laughter]

1042
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,100
[Laughter]

1043
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,100
That's how it pops the popcorn and chips it up.

1044
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,100
He's just got a hot pocket bouncing in there.

1045
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,100
[Laughter]

1046
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,100
[Laughter]

1047
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:25,260
God damn dude, he's just got the Saints Road 2 microwave, it's got like the Saints fluor

1048
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,260
on it and shit.

1049
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,260
Oh my god.

1050
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,060
It's chrome and purple, all the buttons are purple.

1051
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,500
Dude, you know what I saw the other day?

1052
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,500
I saw the Call of Duty Black Ops 2 F-150.

1053
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Woah.

1054
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
On the street, dude.

1055
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Wow.

1056
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,500
You get a pic?

1057
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Oh my, no, no, it drove by, it was so fast.

1058
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,740
(laughing)

1059
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,380
- He was going so fast.

1060
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,280
But dude, I forgot about those.

1061
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,140
That is the ultimate fucking boss car, dude.

1062
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:53,980
So cool.

1063
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,820
- That, oh man.

1064
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,660
- People, I mean, that's what I would do if I had money.

1065
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:02,840
- If it didn't cost like $500,000 a year

1066
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,220
to have a car in New York, I would buy that.

1067
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,480
I would start going to media parties again

1068
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,300
and just pull up in that.

1069
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,260
- In a fucking sweepstakes car?

1070
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,260
Yes, yes, yes.

1071
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,260
It's so sick.

1072
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,260
Halo 2, Hummer 2.

1073
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,260
Imagine your dad picking you up from school on a Call of Duty truck.

1074
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,260
Oh my god, dude. You would get so much pussy.

1075
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,260
In a Baja Blast Morita Fiesta.

1076
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:31,260
Yeah, there's a Baja Blast in the cup holder.

1077
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,260
It's got a dispenser.

1078
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,260
And that's right, no ice, because ice is a waste of soda room.

1079
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,260
Yeah.

1080
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,260
It comes out cold. It uses the AC.

1081
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,260
That's correct.

1082
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,620
Dude, I would just do the pimp my ride.

1083
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,620
I would just put a PS2 in that thing.

1084
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,620
Yeah.

1085
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,020
And fucking, oh, I would never leave.

1086
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,540
I thought that was the coolest, if you had a PS2 in your car when I was a kid.

1087
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,860
The most impractical thing.

1088
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,860
First off, you have to have at least, you have to have somebody driving.

1089
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,860
For it to make any sense.

1090
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,140
You have to have a chauffeur or a parent.

1091
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,860
And parents are very adverse to putting PlayStation 2s in their cars for whatever reason.

1092
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,360
would put a homework machine in the car.

1093
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
That's right.

1094
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,360
Yeah.

1095
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,980
Parents would put dishes in the car.

1096
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,460
Yeah, they're gonna put freakin' broccoli in there, dude.

1097
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,460
You're gonna have to eat broccoli.

1098
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:24,380
Yeah, Felix, we should have told you, we're very anti-parent, pro-kidding, anti-grounding.

1099
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,780
I'm really not trying to get in trouble here.

1100
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:32,820
I mean, like, I understand that vulnerable communities have attitudes towards homework

1101
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:40,220
and dishes, right? They think that they cause harm and in the liminal spaces of homework

1102
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,700
cause these issues.

1103
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,020
You're almost sounding pro-chores right now, Felix.

1104
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,980
Okay, well I'm very sensitive to the issues of the child community, but also many of my

1105
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:58,500
listeners do assign homework and do assign dishes in those liminal spaces of chores.

1106
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,260
Maybe that lady was right.

1107
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,260
Yeah.

1108
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,260
That's all I'm gonna say.

1109
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,260
Yeah, name three toys, Felix.

1110
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,260
Yeah.

1111
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,260
Okay, alright.

1112
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,260
I shouldn't even dignify this.

1113
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,260
I shouldn't even dignify this.

1114
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,700
But if you really want to call my activist credentials into question, the Tonka Truck

1115
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,420
is a classic one.

1116
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,100
The Tonka Truck?

1117
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,260
Okay, someone's out of touch.

1118
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,340
Yeah, somebody just Googled "toy."

1119
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:33,220
googled toys you click the first three answers like that info box popped up and

1120
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:43,020
said the Tonka truck the Tonka truck the Hess truck and the jump rope I was gonna

1121
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:50,020
say Jenga next? Jenga is a game, you absolute lepton. Jenga is a game. What is wrong with

1122
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:59,380
you dude? Alright, I guess I shouldn't give my third, well it's um, I was gonna say a

1123
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:06,380
Playmobil set. Playmobil is a tool. It's a material. Yeah, that's actually an imagination

1124
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:17,780
aid completely different category I just like people the only thing we could do

1125
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:23,340
to unsubscribe would be to come out against homework insurers are you guys

1126
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,940
you guys would lose a lot yeah that's true yeah you guys are

1127
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,700
like oh go below us today we had somebody on our on our patreon edit

1128
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:37,740
their $40 pledge to $5 and it just was it was just a shot to the heart why was it

1129
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,660
- Okay, was it $40 'cause he was like,

1130
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,820
I really believe in the mission and then like $5?

1131
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,260
'Cause he's like, I still like this show, but it's like--

1132
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,860
- It had to have been an accident.

1133
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,700
- Okay.

1134
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,540
(laughing)

1135
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,360
- 'Cause they--

1136
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,200
- I like to think it wasn't,

1137
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,460
because it's like he was just like,

1138
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,740
I support the mission,

1139
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,140
but you're not making any progress

1140
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,100
against these seven year olds

1141
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,300
who are still making these posts.

1142
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,460
You're not putting a dent in that.

1143
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,540
(laughing)

1144
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,700
- Yeah, yeah, we're not making any of them log off.

1145
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,660
The thing is, oh, speaking of,

1146
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:09,980
this this list has a the reasons Halo 3 is better than fortnight the second list

1147
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,780
has trigger trash kid on it

1148
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:16,460
whoa sort of one of our there's a rotating cast of characters and ne'er

1149
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,980
do wells from the top tens that we interact with or don't interact with the

1150
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,980
we view yeah we do not interact

1151
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,900
yeah and trigger trash kid. Caleb interacts. No I don't. Patrick interacts.

1152
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,820
No. We interact with each other.

1153
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,500
Caleb interacts with the... Trigger Trash Kid is one of the all-timers though.

1154
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:41,060
He says, "Life is a meme, sarcasm is an art.

1155
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:46,260
Cows go quack." Was Trigger Trash Kid the one...

1156
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,900
Was he the dangerous ISIS weapons?

1157
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:53,060
I think so, yeah. Oh, so he's kind of like a more worldly

1158
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,780
seven-year-old. Yeah, he was the one who said that

1159
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,780
if isis ever got uh... a hold of the dubstep

1160
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,580
uh...

1161
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,620
you know that all the time

1162
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,700
isis is constructing the dubstep gun

1163
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,500
what is the dubstep gun?

1164
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,140
i think it's from worms

1165
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,540
no no it's in saints row 3

1166
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,740
it must be in worms from saints row then

1167
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,180
or the other way around

1168
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:22,180
it is in worms uh... worms whatever one that is

1169
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:27,620
worms reloaded or worms unloaded worms gun loaded worms dirt loaded

1170
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,620
They were trying to do a pun and they fucked up.

1171
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,620
[Laughter]

1172
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,620
Yeah, if Ice just got the dubstep gun, that would be truly catastrophic.

1173
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,620
So I was on a Saints Row play. I played Saints Row in...

1174
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:41,620
Just when I was waiting, I think in between GTA San Andreas and GTA 4.

1175
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,620
Because I was like, "Alright, we need some..."

1176
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,620
Which Saints Row? The first one?

1177
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,620
I think two. And it literally depressed me too much.

1178
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,620
Like, it made me depressed.

1179
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,620
It was the only one I ever played.

1180
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,620
Because it was just like...

1181
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,620
I got this feeling where it was like, "This just isn't..."

1182
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:02,540
Oh shit, hold up. It is in GKE. This isn't legal, it's too crazy.

1183
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:09,220
Michael Rappaport was the voice of the one white guy in Saints Row 1, the one

1184
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,540
white guy in the game. You know he was pissed when he started it up and he was

1185
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:19,780
white in the game too. He's like, "What the fuck?" He's the informant. He's the fucking, he's the

1186
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:30,620
undercover and they made me a fed he's like he's a he plays like a fat Italian

1187
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,580
guy with a middle part I gotta find a picture of this Michael Rapaport

1188
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:42,020
St. Joe - I'm looking this is a throw one is uh it's like Troy I think oh damn

1189
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:49,040
dude Troy yeah he's the chief of police in Saints Row - oh my god

1190
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:55,100
well my girl Berg probably like wishes he looked like like he obviously primarily

1191
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,260
wishes he was white but like well yeah because this guy has this character is

1192
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,820
like a pencil thin mustache that he maybe could play off for Puerto Rican

1193
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:07,300
but yeah I mean Michael Rappaport cannot grow facial hair no he can't he has a

1194
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:15,120
smooth but bumpy face. He's a smooth but mold face. Yeah, no he is he's half mold

1195
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:20,740
he's half fungal. Yeah, did you guys remember when he got in some fight with

1196
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:27,220
Dan Levitard and Levitard kept posting that. Dan Levitard from ESPN. That's his name?

1197
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:36,020
Yeah, Levitard, that's right. He kept posting that picture of Michael

1198
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:40,060
Rappaport with that that fucked up red spot on his chin. Oh yeah the herpes.

1199
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:45,100
And yeah and then Michael Rappaport was like he went on his on his like radio

1200
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,540
show at the time that has like he had like a hype man and I just remember

1201
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,460
listening to it because I kept up with the beef and Michael Rappaport was like

1202
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,620
and you had the nerve to bring up that photo of me with a lesion on my face

1203
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:04,420
it's not herpes it's a lesion and then his hype man was like yeah that's right it's a lesion.

1204
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:13,460
Well, he had a weird like pro wrestling-esque bit on his show that his son, he had a young

1205
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,960
assistant who was rebelling against him, but I think it was just him.

1206
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,200
It was very strange.

1207
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,900
It was a very strange act of theater.

1208
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,900
Theater of the mind.

1209
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,260
Dude, he's a comedian, capital C. He can't stop.

1210
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,260
He's an entertainer.

1211
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,340
Dude, he's like Kaufman Reborn.

1212
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,340
That's right.

1213
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,700
I think he wanted to call himself Michael the Entertainer.

1214
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,540
[LAUGHTER]

1215
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,420
Yeah, no, he wanted to go with like--

1216
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:43,540
he wanted to do like a hamburger-esque food name,

1217
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,100
but like soup or something.

1218
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,100
[LAUGHTER]

1219
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,580
Soup.

1220
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,080
Yeah.

1221
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,060
Soup.

1222
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,180
Bread.

1223
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,700
That's how he ends all his jokes.

1224
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,200
Soup.

1225
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,620
[LAUGHTER]

1226
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,940
He fucking rocks.

1227
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,540
All right, we're--

1228
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,260
We're at an hour.

1229
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,460
You did your time, Felix.

1230
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,460
Okay.

1231
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,460
We can let you go.

1232
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,460
I'm sorry.

1233
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,460
You talked about toys and Michael Rapoport.

1234
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,460
I probably was about to do it.

1235
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,460
Well, I embarrassed myself talking about toys.

1236
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,460
You did.

1237
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,820
I lost a lot of activist cred.

1238
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,760
You're always welcome to come back on and correct the record.

1239
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,760
I would love to.

1240
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,760
I would love to.

1241
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,300
But for now, you are known as sort of a crypto parent.

1242
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,300
A pariah.

1243
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,300
Crypto principal.

1244
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,300
Crypto principal.

1245
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,300
Well, I am teacher adjacent, unfortunately.

1246
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,040
Yeah, you are.

1247
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,480
You engage in teacher spaces a lot.

1248
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,720
It's kind of sus.

1249
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,720
Thanks man.

1250
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,020
I'm not going to ask if you have anything to plug.

1251
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,760
This is sus episode four with Will Maneker.

1252
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
I just posted.

1253
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,760
Okay, all right.

1254
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,840
All right, go for it.

1255
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Go listen to that.

1256
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,840
Thanks Felix.

1257
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,840
Thanks.

1258
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
Thank you.

1259
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
Hey, what's up?

01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,240

That's a sick fucking name.
