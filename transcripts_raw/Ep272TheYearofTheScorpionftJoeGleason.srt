1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,780
That's good, I think. I think so. I did not see very much. Yeah, that might kind of complicate

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,080
it, but maybe not. I don't know. I gave one big one. I drink a Celsius this morning and

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,080
then because I wanted I went like NPC walk cycle and went to the coffee shop and ordered

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,080
a ham and cheese croissant and a cold brew because I thought that I needed to get it,

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,800
even though I didn't. I fully grabbed it and then got back here and was like, "Oh yeah,

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,940
this is going to be too much caffeine. At some point, I'm going to get scared that somebody

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,760
knows my address in the middle of the episode." I can't see anything. Bro, that is so NPC

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,760
of you. It's crazy to get a normal ass thing from a store. No, you know what I'm saying?

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm saying like I get this with the ham and cheese, Chris on every single time I

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
come here and I'm saying Chris Scott for some reason.

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,080
I don't know what the hell is have well guys. It's the new year twenty twenty

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,800
four and we've decided to make a permanent change to the lineup of the

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,560
podcast

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,440
guys. I'm just happy to be here. I like that your glasses say two hundred yeah

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,800
two hundred with a I couldn't exclamation point or maybe a one two thousand one

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,040
two hundred year two hundred. I'm pretty excited about two hundred. This two

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
hundred is going to be big. I couldn't find any other ones yeah, but I'm happy

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,780
be here. I mean, I wish Caleb the best in his. So the story what happened is what

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,560
happened is Caleb last night, our friend Brian, who has been on beers, we drank

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,940
and stuff. Brian comes home from Texas and he's like, oh, I've got a bunch of

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,840
freeze dried, like

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,120
Texas barbecue,

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,760
and I want you all to come over and eat it and we're gonna gamble and stuff.

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,520
And so Noah is also, Noah comes home last night, also sick as a dog from this

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,960
food. I think he said that he threw up and then he was in my bathroom all night.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,240
I like that you led with also

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,280
yeah okay,

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,920
Caleb got food poisoning for meeting five year old barbecue that was a day old

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,880
barb that was in space orbit yeah for two days. So he's sick, he's sick, he's

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,760
got diarrhea and throwing up and Noah came home last night, but the thing is

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,100
Okay, he's saying Caleb saying he's got food poisoning, but that's because he

32
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,900
always get he thinks he's sick right now from that Noah told me that they drank

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,800
they they drank a shit ton of like Noah came home with like six bottles of

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,400
booze.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,900
I think that he's maybe just hung over and also a little bit sick from the

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,200
food, but I think that he's completely exaggerating how sick the food made.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,100
He told me he slept two hours last night.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,400
He said his phone is broken and he's been communicating with multiple people

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,540
all through only me so far today. Wow, I feel like I've been the conduit for him.

40
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,140
That's a thing that a drunken mistake person does a person who's made a drunk

41
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,460
mistake. I feel like he's like a mistake, an Olympian, you know, like I feel like

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,660
he just eats the same thing every single day and if his flow gets disrupted, he's

43
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,380
just going to like shit guys. I don't think any of this matters. I think we

44
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,240
need to be excited about twenty twenty four. We should be I'm excited, excited

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,900
about twenty twenty four of the year. I have to take these off yeah. Those are

46
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,420
It's so funny that like blindfold for so many years. We had a perfect place to put

47
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,420
the eyes right and now

48
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,120
two. Oh, we had a perfect place for the eyes. We fucking you can't keep we got

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,420
to get rid of these. The eyes are twenty years gone. It's four years. No, it's

50
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,420
no, it's not. It's a twenty because twenty twenty had two zeros, but yeah,

51
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,120
but but twenty the twenty tens were not good. I years either. Well, the two

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,920
thousands were the last time that these really made sense, but every now and

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,940
way of a digit that has a proper hole in it yeah every now and again yeah two

54
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,280
thousand and eight two thousand and twenty two thousand and four

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,660
two thousand four. You had two holes. It's the O's yeah

56
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,740
two thousand and twenty five will make a little bit of sense because you could

57
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,120
put the the hole on that five hole. The hole is never going to make sense again.

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,920
No now last time the one nine hundred and ninety s were good because you had

59
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,100
the two holes in the nines. Twenty twenty six distant yeah two thousand

60
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,140
were great. Twenty twenty six will be back. Twenty twenty twenty thirty twenty

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,540
forty twenty fifty. You know those these are all great. I can't I can't wait man

62
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,340
so the twenty yeah there's listen it's, but we have to give it up for twenty

63
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,140
twenty eight. Twenty twenty eight will be okay.

64
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,580
Twenty twenty eight that will be a

65
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,720
sideways. You can put just to use the two holes in the eight. There's going to

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,220
be interesting glasses. There's going to be a little renaissance twenty eight

67
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,980
twenty nine twenty thirty twenty thirty is going to be some exciting stuff, but

68
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,880
they're not twenty twenty four. We're not going to stop. They're not going to

69
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,340
stop making the glasses. No, they're going to push a square peg into a

70
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,620
circular hole every year from now on, just because we had those golden years

71
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,600
the two thousand look at how bad this is. Look at how bad the glasses start.

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,000
Did they start in the how long it had to have been two thousand, but I guess

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,760
that yeah, that's the only way you would think of doing that. She does this

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,400
one where it's the most exciting like one thousand nine hundred and ninety

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
two. That would be a good year because you can get put in the nines, but you

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
wouldn't see these people have one thousand nine hundred and ninety one.

77
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Oh, they were patented in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two. That's

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,280
exactly what I said. One thousand nine hundred and ninety two would be a good

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,200
year. Yeah, yeah, the one thousand nine hundred and ninety two makes sense, but

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,120
it makes this is this is this is complicated. This is fussy like this is

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,100
pretty much go. You know what here's my thing. I think the night these these

82
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,540
one thousand nine hundred and ninety two glasses wait. They said they were

83
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,900
invented in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two. This woman's wearing

84
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,040
one thousand nine hundred and ninety one that woman is a time traveler that

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,900
is she would believe that that is a butterfly effect, but here's what I'm

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,980
saying the one thousand nine hundred and ninety two glasses. These have had

87
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,140
to have been invented by either a time traveler or a schizophrenic person

88
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,380
because who looks at the number one thousand nine hundred and ninety two

89
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,980
and says oh glasses yeah. I want to make two thousand you're like oh glasses

90
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,360
glasses or handcuffs or bubble wrap would be great to merge this off of but

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,020
nineteen ninety two is a psycho number to look at him. Look at this guy.

92
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,000
We're in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,080
That's Jerry Lewis

94
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,200
right there. That's Jerry Lewis, but look at this. It's two twenty, twenty

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,760
four. This is like when you like you're like like you know somebody that's got

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,960
a dog that should be dead. You know it's like it's like oh yeah that dog to live

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,360
in our stolen hours. Yeah, that dog is like it's like oh yeah. This is my

98
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,240
thirty four year old dog. Yeah, that's what these glasses are. We got to put

99
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,820
them down. It's time to put them down until it's time for them to come back to

100
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,080
we're going to feed. We're going to feed the dog a Big Mac with the we're going

101
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,740
to feed these glasses a Big Mac and then they're going to where they're going to

102
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,920
pass away. Why is there liquid all over? Don't worry about it. What the fuck

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,120
happened? Nothing happened. What did you guys do? Come on man? Nothing. It's

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,040
disgusting. Nothing bad happened

105
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,760
And we're back with amazing Brandon Wardell from Los Angeles, California, man.

106
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,920
All the way from LA.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,420
Let's see, what is Los Angeles?

108
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Holly, Holly, weird.

109
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,420
You hear a lot of this over there in Los Angeles, huh?

110
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,420
Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Yeah.

112
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
We got a little bit of soundboard today.

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
I'm on the soundboard. I always do it loud and proud.

114
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
And if you're near the... Oh my God.

115
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Yep. Jesus Christ.

116
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Still the entire...

117
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Oh no.

118
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Let's see.

119
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
I got to turn this off.

120
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Nothing bad happened.

121
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Were you not here for?

122
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,180
not here. I was not here for whatever happened here. Patrick, what happened? I

123
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,100
there don't worry. We did it. It was you did it didn't you Patrick could have

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,180
been Caleb, this famous spiller. Clearly you know, I think it's sticky on the

125
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,380
I spilled in an accident because you want to this. That's crazy. How do you

126
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,380
do that? What did you spill? Tell me what you spilled. Caleb was drinking

127
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,860
Coca Cola. It was Coca Cola and I was going to press the button for I'll

128
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,900
he admitted a flop joke you would you were made a joke and you went to press a

129
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,740
soundboard button and he got that's what happened. That's what happened. I'm

130
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,940
sorry. Well, we're going to forget that in the new year. That's how the last

131
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,660
year ended. That's how last year and we're and I'm forgiving. It was that was

132
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,260
three weeks ago. Yeah, that's the other thing that we were back in the stew.

133
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,240
It's been a minute. It's been since before. It's been a long. I there's a

134
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,540
lot of changes that happened in my life that I don't want to get in. Look at my

135
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,660
new hat. I got for Christmas

136
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,260
Wow for everyone who's listening audio, it's a sour patch kids hat that's

137
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,500
on yellow wow and green wow and it's squishy. What else did he get or was it

138
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,280
just a hat? It's just a hat. I got a family. I'll pitch

139
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,580
charlie bucket style. We're here with Joe today because Caleb is completely

140
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,420
sick. We've gone over this. I guess we're starting off the new year one

141
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,020
member down a new year, new team, me or new team member and I'm wearing. I

142
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,260
I realized just now, I forgot when I put this on, that this hat has reflective stuff woven

143
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
into it.

144
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,420
Oh, this is one of those cool hats.

145
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,900
My head is completely shiny on this camera.

146
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
That's pretty cool.

147
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,740
That actually does look dope.

148
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,060
We actually both have cool neon vibes.

149
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,100
We have neon hats today.

150
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,220
And Joe kind of didn't get the memo, did he?

151
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,420
Yeah, no, my hats aren't special enough.

152
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,860
No, it's a New Year's hat.

153
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,180
It does look special.

154
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,820
So how did 2024 end for you, or 2023 end for you guys?

155
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,220
Well, we hung out together on New Year's Eve and I had a delightful new

156
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,180
experience. Yeah, it's changed me forever. What was it? It was smelling salts.

157
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,500
Oh, yes, we were doing a lot of smelling salts and it unbelievable.

158
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,260
Patrick told me in his new video, Patrick told me that he smelled about

159
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,580
20 of them. I did. I was a fiend. They were awesome. Have you ever smelled

160
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,220
smelling salts? I don't think so. So basically, it smells so bad that you go

161
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,820
like this, but it wakes you up. It keeps you you hyped and wired ammonia. Yeah,

162
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,140
it's ammonia. It was like so bring me up. It was called like like wild insanity or

163
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,660
something. It had like a you know the joker on the on the bottle or something

164
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,940
like that, and I was like looking at it because I didn't. I was like, oh, I

165
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,020
wonder if just like what it says like is in this or the side effects or anything

166
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,500
on the bottle. It says nothing. There's it's just it's just like yeah, evil,

167
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,020
evil serial killer bottle. If the joker's on it, there's pretty good chance. I was

168
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,900
Oh, I it was it was his own. They're the brand's own character. Yeah, joker, but

169
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,380
you know what I mean? The type of vibe, the pre workout vibe and I was kind of

170
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,620
powdered insanity, right? So yeah, something like that something insanity

171
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,220
and I was thinking, wow, this is incredible. The smell is so bad. I need

172
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,820
to get a bottle of this for myself so I can make myself do things and get hyped

173
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,220
up, but because it says nothing on this bottle, I have to assume this is going

174
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,860
to kill me if I do it multiple times. So I get home. I google it on my computer.

175
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,980
I Google smelling salts, long term effects, adverse side effects. I Google

176
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,240
all these keywords. Guess what guys nothing yeah, really not bad for you at

177
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,440
all. Isn't that unbelievable government websites dot gov dot gov dot gov. They

178
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,860
want you to do smell. They say it's dangerous to breathe in ammonia. If

179
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,680
you're in a room full of ammonia, but smelling salts, guess what it doesn't do

180
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,940
anything. It doesn't even do anything good. You just play with chemicals bro.

181
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,360
it's just chemicals. You just it's just a smell. It's so funny. It's a smell

182
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,020
that's so crazy that it makes something happen in your brain. Jack put out that

183
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,360
video today and it's like

184
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,700
he has a bit in the video for the smelling salts

185
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,440
and it's so funny the realization like, "Oh yeah, Jack just bought these for

186
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,500
like a three second

187
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,380
clinic video. I want them. I'm gonna buy them for myself. It's such a genius

188
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,820
idea. It's so good. I literally think I literally would like to do them before

189
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,620
every single episode from now on. I think right before hitting record, I

190
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,900
think it will power everything up. It really I was

191
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,440
yeah, I think your boards in his room. I was going. I would smell do the

192
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,780
smelling salts and then I would do like finger board tricks on his like little

193
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,740
bench thing. It was so sick, really productive with the smelling. Dude, I

194
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,500
need them right now. I think it's the same thing where you just build up a

195
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,560
tolerance to it and then you're filling your room up with ammonia and then

196
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,860
you're dying. Yeah, you're not filling your room up with ammonia. That's not

197
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,820
that leading, but I was that's what I was saying, though, when we were doing it,

198
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,000
I was like can you like I was talking about how I wanted to get some to to to

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
pop me up for when I need to be pumped up like when I'm going to kill somebody

200
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,480
or something yeah and chase something exactly a chase scene yeah and

201
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,180
well you smell it and it's so strong and it's so affecting and it feels like a

202
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,480
laser is going into your face and you go

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
oh my God, and I was thinking, can you imagine the moment in your life to like

204
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,140
it's like after you've done it the first time, then you have the montage of your

205
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,880
whole life after buying it and then the one sniff, the one that where you get it,

206
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,820
you sniff it and you just it's nothing. You don't react at all. You sniff it, you

207
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,240
go

208
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,140
right. You have such a because you built up such a tolerance to it. Wouldn't that

209
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,460
be so horrible? You're supposed to hold them like really low to yeah, we were

210
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,260
not doing that. No, I was straight up to the nose. Dude, Thomas did. Yeah, he put

211
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,420
this nose like on it and he sniffed in so much that he had the salts on his nose,

212
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,840
literally stone face, no reaction, terrifying yeah, scary yeah, no Thomas

213
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,520
was like a like a statue when he was going to get you on these yeah. I wish I

214
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,040
could try them right now. I wish I

215
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,020
really badly yeah. Didn't Caleb buy them and he was supposed to bring them with

216
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,100
him? I don't think he bought them. Maybe that's why he's sick. Yeah, he ate them.

217
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,580
He ate the smell. He thought they were for seasonings. Yeah, he put them on the

218
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,900
steak. That's probably what happened knowing him

219
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,160
yeah. I mean it's the same thing with neti pot. Have you guys used neti pot?

220
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Oh yeah. I'm a big fan of a neti pot.

221
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
How is it the same as a neti pot?

222
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Because it goes in your nose, man.

223
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
I guess it's the only similarity.

224
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
You use the saline solution

225
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
and the more you use it, the more of a

226
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
tolerance you build up to the saline

227
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
solution and then you need to just put a shit load of salt

228
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
in your nose to do it and then it doesn't work.

229
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Got it. Okay. You boil your water?

230
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
You gotta. Yeah.

231
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
I'm not getting brainwashed.

232
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm not getting brainwashed.

233
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
No, I learned about it in my high school class.

234
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
It says it on the moral too.

235
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:45,200
There's an episode of A Thousand Ways to Die where a person got like almost the same as like candy roo, but like for your nose and your fucking brain.

236
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
They got meningitis probably. That's what you can get from it.

237
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
No, they got a bug.

238
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
You can get flesh eating bacteria or meningitis or stuff.

239
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
They got a bug in their brain.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
A bug?

241
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
According to A Thousand Ways to Die.

242
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
That's definitely the TV version.

243
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,200
A reputable source. A very, very reputable source, A Thousand Ways to Die.

244
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,780
why I've been watching. Oh my God, wait, you just reminded me I've been watching

245
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,380
the best TV show of all time. Have you guys heard of this show Kung Fu from the

246
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,920
seventies? Yeah, you ever watch this? My gym teacher would quoted at me fucking

247
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,640
fire. My dad was talking about how he and his brother used to be obsessed with it

248
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,320
back in the seventies when they were kids and I've been watching it. So it's

249
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,940
David Carradine. Yeah, he plays a character named Kwai Chang Kane. Wow, he

250
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,580
they Chinese man cool and he how much do they do they? They give a lot. They

251
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,140
don't do it a lot. Here's what they do. They do they do it tastefully. They

252
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,060
blacken his hair. Okay, they make they straighten it and they give them to

253
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,500
give it that kind of spiky type of look, but that's and then they put him. They

254
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,820
put him in in in loose fitting clothing robes. That's a lot he's that's a lot.

255
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,740
No there's no makeup, there's no makeup. It's not a comparatively listen to the

256
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,480
the seventies it's not okay. It's obviously not great no matter what,

257
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,300
but it's not it's not. I've I'm watching the show. It's not it's not it's no

258
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,040
fucking you know, make you runny. Yeah, exactly it's a far cry from that, but

259
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,940
the thing that he he does really play it up he's acting. He doesn't do an accent

260
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,820
or anything, but he kind of he speaks in Proverbs and he speaks slowly and like

261
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,540
is anyway he's a he's a Chinese. He's a he's a what's it called

262
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:25,680
cow in monk and he knows kung fu. He was trained by Master Po, who's blind and he

263
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,700
basically has to grab a pebble out of the master's hand, and when he can grab the

264
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,220
pebble, it's time for him to leave. But he then he

265
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,660
he graduates from the monastery and he goes and now he's in the Wild West and

266
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,500
he's wandering around and he uses his Chinese ways and wisdoms to basically

267
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,180
solve these problems between cowboys and outlaws who are fighting each other, who

268
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,820
for example, stealing things or being racist or raping women or stuff like

269
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,160
that. And then he comes in and he kind of says like, oh, is not the way of

270
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,820
peace more whatever. Wow. And it's incredible. It's the best show of all

271
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,820
time. You know, David Carradine's brother is the dad on Lizzie McGuire.

272
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,980
Wow. Fun fact of the day.

273
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,720
I think his brother is in Revenge of the Nerds also.

274
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,880
but I'm a guy the guy from revenge of the nerds, we're talking Keith or Robert,

275
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,180
the one with the black hair goes

276
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,160
that one. I haven't seen revenge of the nerds. I just not good my show corner

277
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,820
Joe's, but I can I add one thing about Kung Fu before we go to Joe shows yeah,

278
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm ninety nine percent sure that Kung Fu is what Xavier Renegade Angel was

279
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,500
based on. Oh, okay, it's all him wandering through the desert and going

280
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,020
to towns and there's people fighting and he go. He says some kind of wisdom

281
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,220
adage. I don't know what that is either. Well, you'll get alt enough to be

282
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,240
watching a show like that.

283
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,680
My show, my show is also takes place in the s. The seventeen s. Well, so mine

284
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,420
was not doesn't take place in the seven is from the wild west. It's from the

285
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,640
seventy. It's from the seven

286
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,180
seventeen s. John Adams on a you have been watching that since I lived with

287
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,820
you. That's not true. I only want you one episode in in your move. You're only

288
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,660
watched one episode back then. I really I really dove in deep yeah and I'm doing

289
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,240
corresponding Wikipedia articles before they even pass the

290
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,880
the like alien and sedition acts. I'm like there's aliens in this show yeah

291
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,880
John Adams did well. I got a way better show idea than regular as John Adams

292
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,760
now. Well, I mean yeah, so it's really John Adams didn't seem to really be so

293
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,720
gung ho about the alien and sedition acts, but he left George Washington's

294
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,080
cabinet in

295
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,260
you know, he kept their jobs and they're kind of Hamilton's guys and Hamilton,

296
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,820
not as cool as we all think he is because I don't think he's that cool

297
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,580
because of because of the song yeah is the reason I don't think he's. I think

298
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,660
that every single one of these American history figures is fucking stupid

299
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,600
compared to like Willie Santos or like was that Keith, Kurt Heath, Kurchard or

300
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,740
any probably skateboarders. These are guys that are way cooler than the

301
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,040
founding fathers. It's just the thing I think about this John Adams guy. It's

302
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,280
just him and his wife. He absolutely loves her. He's she's his number one

303
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,220
confidant and he's just alive during the absolute craziest yeah man. I was to be

304
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,040
alive back in the day. There's basically there's no time period that I can see in

305
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,320
a movie that I won't as long as they show a house in a movie that's set in a

306
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,780
different time period. I think God I would love to be alive in that I couldn't

307
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,380
I wish I honestly now that I say that, even if they don't show a house, yeah,

308
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,260
it's old long enough ago that there's only jungles. I would really like to be

309
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,680
whenever I found fathers. You guys would be. Do you think I think you would be in

310
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,700
like a founding fathers? No, I would have I would have the ear of one of the

311
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,440
founding fathers. I would be like a worm tongue like yeah

312
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,940
I would I would be one of those people that dies from eating mud back then yeah.

313
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,520
I would I would eat a mud soaked pig or something and then I would get a

314
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,560
disease that like we've cured so many times over. You would you would eat mud

315
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,240
and then get sick and then they would like cut your stomach. Oh yeah, they

316
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,080
would cut my stomach open and take it out. You know,

317
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,480
why is it

318
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,800
what the fuck? What the incredible if you're around back in the in the

319
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,200
founding fathers days when they're starting the country and they're

320
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,480
writing the constitution, the declaration of independence and all this stuff and

321
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,160
you're like say you're like you're like a bandit or you're like a murderer. I'm

322
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,120
like a highway man. I'm a thief, I'm stopping people on the road and I'm

323
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,560
grabbing them and I'm killing them and they're in the they're in the room and

324
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,720
they're writing the constitution and they're like all right. We'll start

325
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,060
with like

326
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,160
let's see human rights and I'm like well. You should probably make robbing legal

327
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,160
and murder should be good and being right there in the room begin. Oh,

328
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,720
there's one guy. Yes,

329
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,440
I decree murder legal yeah. You should write one line in there. The guys are

330
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,800
the last name Smith get extra money from their job yeah and make sure it's

331
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,640
yeah the Smith. Yes, Smith gets money and he's writing it so fast, of course,

332
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,640
he's right by hand, yeah, they don't have a racers, but exactly it's ink.

333
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,240
They'd have to start

334
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,160
fucking, I can't believe Smith, because back then I mean nowadays, you know,

335
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,600
back nowadays people are like oh every crew they got the one manipulator. They

336
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,320
got the one bad guy back then every crew had the one serial killer. Once

337
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,320
serial killers weren't invented yet, the guy who's killed five hundred and

338
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,440
fifty five people, and so no way to track that and some not even a war. He

339
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,360
he just goes into the force and he kills people. Yeah, he finds people who are

340
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,420
camping in between towns and they're making coffee in their little pot and he

341
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,740
just kills them. It is a little crazy how easy crime was. Oh yeah, but the

342
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,480
thing I was really about the yeah, no, it's just like saying in the houses. I

343
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,920
don't know.

344
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,040
No, I didn't do that.

345
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,340
The first instinct when you kill somebody, it's like I guess I'll just

346
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,600
move yeah yeah, I'm going to leave this body here. I'm just going to go away

347
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,740
from it. There were no one will know there's somebody in my family tree. I

348
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,880
did like ancestry during cove it and I found that there is like somebody I'm a

349
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,020
distant, distant relative of in the seventeen hundreds murdered his wife and

350
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,640
then tried to like weekend at Bernie's her

351
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,880
there's like like an article or some shit where it's like something something

352
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,860
door in like like like this wife over the head with like a

353
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,240
and then props her up in the house. When, like the tech guy,

354
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,180
it's like I got also find the article. I feel like women got such like a low

355
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,340
dude, the funny level of respect that they're probably just like hello man.

356
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,740
Yeah,

357
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:47,120
she's very well behaved yeah, yeah, that's a good wife. The funniest part

358
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,420
of that is that, like back that like you like trying to weaken and burns your

359
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,740
wife is you could literally bury her in your front yard yeah and they would not

360
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,180
it would not be would be like yeah. She left well, you could also be like okay,

361
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,620
okay, she she caught like the bird disease yeah and now she's gone. She's

362
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,540
on her period, so she went to the woods yeah. She fell down the stairs and she

363
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,060
landed on my lacrosse stick yeah. I also I invented I invented a new sport and I

364
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,460
call it lacrosse. Yes, well stole it well yeah, yeah, I'm an eight American.

365
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,100
That's why I said lacrosse, because it would have been around back then, but

366
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,900
you were talking about how any time you see a house in a movie, you're like oh,

367
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,180
I wish that I lived back then. Anytime I see somebody cooking over like a fire,

368
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,900
yeah, that's where I like like the scene in Star Wars where he's eating that

369
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,140
fucking like chicken nugget over the

370
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,240
over the little ass lamp. Like man, I wish I could fucking eat that in the

371
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,400
woods man. Oh my God for me, you know what it is, it's more than a house, it's

372
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,580
showing a main street and I'm not showing main street. I'm like fuck John

373
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,660
Adams. They have a need to be a full scale old state house in Boston. Oh my

374
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,460
And I was like, that's fucking cool. How far into it are you? I finished it. Oh,

375
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,420
nice. How many seasons is one? It's one. It's seven episodes. We watched some of

376
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,540
that in eighth grade. They showed it. It was one of those TV days. They showed us

377
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,780
that part of that. They showed us the Patriot. Mel Gibson's the Patriot in my

378
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,060
eighth grade class. And there's a scene in that movie where a man gets his head

379
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,500
destroyed by a cannonball. And I was like, this is fucking yeah. What's Oh,

380
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,300
is it called? What's it called? Glory. Is that the one? Yeah, we watched that too.

381
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,340
Matthew Broderick and then no it's not Denzel is it don't know don't remember

382
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,340
all I remember is Matthew Broderick. No it's Morgan Freeman, but then there's

383
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,940
another one. There's another one of those kind of movies with Denzel in it

384
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,220
right or am I? I don't know. I don't usually watch movies that are set in

385
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,380
that time period, but then whenever I do I'm like oh. What John Adams is all John

386
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,580
Adams is like a hundred percent they shoot every conversation and just like a

387
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,900
super crazy Dutch angle and then you're like oh that's like a real guy like it

388
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,020
it makes it takes away all the like weird, boring shit. It's Paul Giamatti

389
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,940
right yeah. He fucking crashes it. My thing I gotta sign this fucking

390
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,940
declaration of independence. Damn it, I gotta fucking sign it. Oh Jesus Christ,

391
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,660
I'm going to fucking kill myself. I can't sign this thing. Any show with a

392
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,020
mug, a warm mug and a blanket

393
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,260
and you're saying anything over a fire doing that or I want to watch it. You

394
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,940
watch somebody drink a mug. Well, sometimes I'll do it simultaneously, but

395
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,460
it's like I'm, but your show

396
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,880
Yeah, I'm John Adams.

397
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,280
It's me John Adams.

398
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,760
Yeah, every day it's always for me. I'm watching something said in the old

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,440
West and I'm like and to my fiance. I'm like wow, wouldn't you like to live

400
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,400
back then? She's like no yeah, I don't care you're coming back. You're coming

401
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,680
back. I think if I get the time machine you fucking come and you're coming and

402
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,360
you're the furthest. I'm not doing this alone. Yeah crazy, the furthest back in

403
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,800
time I always want to go is like like nine hundred and seventy five something

404
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,400
like that. I don't want to be back in time any time after that. Well, we must

405
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,880
acknowledge our privilege and going back in time exactly. That was kind of my

406
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,440
joke with why my fiance doesn't want to go is because she's a woman in the old

407
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,040
west. You would probably be her body would be filled with mud yeah by a

408
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,240
person who grabbed her.

409
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,200
It's a horrible. I would want to go and me. I see it. I'm like wow. I would get

410
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,040
to eat lunch next to a cowboy.

411
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,120
I wouldn't necessarily be a cowboy, but I get to see the sheriff. You get to eat

412
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,400
like that's the thing you probably become a sheriff. If you just yeah,

413
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,800
talk smart enough, I was thinking about a guy who's like

414
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,080
who gets like pulled over by the cops and he's like like fuck the cops. Fuck

415
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,360
you like I'm not like I get out of my face and the guy's like I'm the sheriff

416
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,240
and he's like, Oh, my God,

417
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,560
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

418
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,520
The thing about like all that, like old when you see like the old food in like

419
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,240
seventeen. I'm so like this. The only thing I'm focused on, but like think

420
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,640
about just like eating like anything in like the seventeen hundreds or like the

421
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,320
cowboys and stuff. It's like all that probably tasted like shit. Yeah, it's

422
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,320
all bad. It's all like like food until like the eighties was all like bland as

423
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,800
fuck. Food was bad until twenty twenty one food is honestly for you. I know you

424
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,120
didn't. You just bad sandwiches. You would eat a turkey sandwich. That was

425
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,600
just bread. It's one slice of turkey slice of bread. Not true at all roast

426
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
way. First of all, Cameron is the type of

427
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,700
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

428
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,820
between the you think I like bread, bread, make you a throw perfectly to

429
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,580
shape the bread.

430
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,500
Now, if you think if you think I'm cutting or preparing any of my food in

431
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,580
any way, yeah, you've got the wrong. I always like well. I think that was what

432
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,540
Patrick was saying with your one. So I think cutting it to fit the bread. I

433
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,440
would never do that. No, okay, so no, it's free. It's pre cut. You brought

434
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
you bought the bread shaped like the turkey slice a

435
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:40,980
bread

436
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,000
bread shaped

437
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,800
turkey, but yeah yeah it's called turkey bread. It's a little turkey bread and

438
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,480
it's for you.

439
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,120
They made it for you. I sell it at the store this year. I'm going to start

440
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,840
making some putting some stuff in my sandwiches. Yeah, can you imagine a can

441
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,600
of beans you've been riding for two days? You need a hot can of coffee man.

442
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
it's always the coffee and the beans and it's just coffee with just coffee

443
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,000
grounds at the bottom of it and you're just drinking it's all it dude. It's

444
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,840
beans bread, but the bacon, though, but you gotta imagine you gotta imagine the

445
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,800
bacon is good yeah. Well, they're like the ham and shit. Well, you just have to

446
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,040
cut it up the cured like you got to make it all that stuff. I think that all like

447
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,360
all these delicious meats exist just because it's like it's not safe to eat

448
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,320
this shit. So we're just going to put it in a barrel of salt forever. Yeah,

449
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,040
yeah, it's going to be okay. It's like what's that shit called

450
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,820
ham hocks ham hocks is the hocks is the hocks. The part of the leg

451
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,420
ham. I think

452
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:49,300
it'd be so awesome to be like ham right now. What is it? What's a ham hock?

453
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,520
It's a hawk of ham yeah, but what I feel I think it looks like a cartoon.

454
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,760
It's the cartoon style with a circle in the middle. Yeah, I think so up. I'm

455
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,120
pretty sure I would love to try one smelling so you see what a ham hock look

456
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,740
like he's searching ham hock, H, O, C, K,

457
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,200
Amber,

458
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,900
what is a ham hock? Oh, it's a port. Let's go to images.

459
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,980
Okay, so it's a pig's knuckle. Oh well, it does yeah. It is the cartoon. It is a

460
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,400
yeah, yeah, but I didn't know it was the knuckle.

461
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,040
I would eat that actually. Of course you would. It's part of the pig. I would

462
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,820
eat it. If it tastes good, I would eat. If there's a big fat chunk of meat on

463
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,640
I was thinking about the fucking stupidest hypothetical we ever came up with the other

464
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,920
day. It was the one... Oh, fuck. I forget what it was, but I forget what the first part of

465
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,640
it was. But you said, "Would you rather do this or get a massage from an expert?"

466
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,920
I was just thinking about that.

467
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,000
Would you rather eat a food that's bad or get a massage from an expert?

468
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,580
this is I was on my way somewhere. I just started laughing. I'm not me. Would

469
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,560
you rather would you rather eat food made by an expert or get a massage from

470
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,140
an ex food? A thousand percent food. Wait is it the same expert? It's an

471
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,380
expert in both. Both I want food man, no matter what, but we don't matter what

472
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,260
the expert, no matter what in no matter what he is an expert, but we don't know

473
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,200
what he's an expert of no matter what he's you choose. He's doing the other

474
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,260
everything first okay. Here's what I don't know. We don't know what the

475
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,860
expert hands and he's massaging. Here's what we can reduce the question down to

476
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,760
using the using the power of mathematics. If we assume that so it could the best

477
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,220
cases that he's an expert in food, I see a

478
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,140
wait, wait, wait, expert expert equals x, but we don't know okay, but if he's an

479
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,980
x in something else, x the worst, the worst we can assume is would you rather

480
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,340
get a massage from somebody who's terrible at massages or food by someone

481
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,540
bad at making food easily the food, but he's an expert in something he's an

482
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
expert in something right.

483
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,860
He's a math

484
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,540
worst case thing. We got it with the thing we got to think about here is that

485
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,060
he is an expert in one thing. Well, how committed is the massage?

486
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,340
It's like sensual, but is it like is it a

487
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,460
well someone who's bad at giving a massage is just going to not really give

488
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,260
a massage. They can hurt you. I've been hurt by massage before me too. I've

489
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,140
my nerve was pinched by a massage in high school and it was excruciating the

490
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,700
worst pain of some of the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life. I

491
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,060
did she pinched your warm. She pinched my worm man and my shoulder

492
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,060
she pitched your work and your shoulder at the same time. Oh,

493
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,700
it hurts so bad. I literally think it's the worst pain I have ever experienced.

494
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,460
Only gotten one or now now to you know what the word I got one massage when I

495
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,100
was a kid because I hurt my arm or my back or something. My mom was trying to

496
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,140
for my depression and I massage. I was really nervous. I was really nervous for

497
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,000
me. I'm bright and happy on the new year. Well, I was nervous and then I just

498
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,840
immediately fell asleep. I didn't feel anything during the massage. You were

499
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,340
asleep. I just wasted it man. Yeah, I know. Well, you probably did you take

500
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,780
did you take your clothes off?

501
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,940
You don't okay. You remember you remember you remember. I don't remember

502
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,780
than a big smile. You had you had your winky out at full mass. I think I was

503
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,060
wearing shorts or like I leave on my leave on my undies. I haven't got a

504
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,820
massage since since that time that they killed me too scared yeah. That was a

505
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,440
good. That was an expert. I was pain bro. It's his worst any time and when I got

506
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,260
my I got my wisdom tooth out over the like the break that we were on and

507
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,620
the there's something called the sympathetic pain that you will get in

508
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,060
your mouth. Once a wisdom tooth is removed is what my doctor was telling me

509
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:43,380
and for some reason it was this tooth and the night before I was coming back here.

510
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,180
I could not sleep because there is a pain in the nerve in this to God and I was

511
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,580
just up all night just going.

512
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Yeah, that's taking these codeine pills. They gave me a pain is the worst. Oh my

513
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,680
God. I couldn't feel shit after that, but that's a little book. It's like a

514
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,980
tree. All right, guys, let's get some one New Year's resolution for him.

515
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,880
Everybody. Oh, I already said mine, but I'm going to get my money up and I'm

516
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
going to become strong. Okay.

517
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,160
I would say I want to do everything I do, but a little bit better and a little

518
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,640
bit more yeah, and for me it's year of the grind. Yeah, it seems like we're all

519
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,800
kind of in the same. Yeah, we're all what's what's it's a year of what

520
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,880
what yeah, what animal is this year? Well, I'm saying let's let's think of

521
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,680
one. I was making up a new animal year of the ham, you're of the scorpion.

522
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,480
Well, no, just like what is a year of what you know, like I just got chills

523
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,800
saying year of the score. The scorpion is too scary, but I don't want to live

524
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,240
the year of the score. I see no no no no, it's the year of this. It's the year of

525
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,280
the scorpion. We're going to take this frog out. I have no connection to a

526
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,880
scorpion.

527
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,760
No, now you do because it's the year of the scorpion. You subscribe to the

528
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,760
fable of the scorpion and the frog. Okay, we are the scorpion. I'm going to

529
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,560
need everybody. I need everybody to to google the scorpion and the frog right

530
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,760
now. The frog is all of you and we are the evil scorpion and we're going to

531
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,880
make all of you out. We're to get nowhere

532
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,840
we're not getting we're not mate. We're not making it across his river halfway

533
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,840
through the year. We're going to fall off or fall off the scorpions going to

534
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,200
fall off the frog. So the front the score is not skin stinging the frog.

535
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,560
We'll just all in the frog, the frog dies and the frog dies and the frozen

536
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,400
also dies. Why the hell did you do that? We're both going across the river

537
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,340
together. You guys see the I'm evil mother nature, because I'm a bastard.

538
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,320
Did you guys see the video of the ant like fucking people? Yeah,

539
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,280
it's pretty crazy yeah you're the okay. I guess it's not year of the scorpion

540
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,880
year of the aunt. You're the aunt, you're the aunt, I guess it could be

541
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,240
year of the aunt. We get into fine chardonnay, you're the baby,

542
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,680
you're the baby, fud, you're a baby fud, you're the baby. I mean it's like

543
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,080
obviously there's you have the hunted for us. The obvious answer here, the

544
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,420
year of the frog. You're the hunted is kind of cool year of Sullivan. You're

545
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,820
the frog. I guess wow I didn't even think about the scorpion and we need to

546
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,680
have a scorpion mascot. We need to have an enemy for Sullivan. That is a

547
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,760
scorpion. It's not a bad idea. That is a really good idea. I think it might be

548
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,980
year of the guy year of man, your boys, your human kind of human enough of

549
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,020
these fucking animals. Who is the who is your pick for twenty twenty four

550
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,360
person of the time person of the year. Okay, after that a little too early to

551
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,000
decide, but you just have to make a call. It's a yeah, it's a it's a

552
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,040
prediction. I'm going to say this year they're going to pick Travis Kelts.

553
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:44,880
Okay, I'm going to try and get like a long shot. I want to think of like like

554
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,320
for example, like a see who's a CEO of a company right now. That's not important

555
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,920
at all, but who like someone who's going to be who do you think is going to win

556
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,100
the presidency this year. That's an easy that's an easy winner of that, like

557
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,320
that's probably the odds on favor. It's just trump by yeah, but I want to get I

558
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,220
want to get like a long shot. You know, yeah, no, no, no, you want to make a big

559
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
yeah. I'm trying to thank here like I guess maybe like

560
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:14,060
maybe like somebody the ceo of a car company or something so like a ravion

561
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,620
what's that ravion? It's the crazy looking trucks and you know the new

562
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,440
Amazon trucks. No, let's see who the ceo of Rivian is RJ scaring

563
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,260
RJ scaring is probably my

564
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,580
times person of the year. RJ

565
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:38,840
reapers jeepers scaring. Oh my God, who does he looks exactly like somebody that

566
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,280
I can't put my finger on it. I don't know. He kind of looks like one of the

567
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,240
like face yeah. I know he looks like a I generated person. I'm going to say it's

568
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,680
the new I'm going to say it's the new guy who's now in charge of Argentina. Oh

569
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,880
yeah, that guy yeah, that's not a bad pick. I think he's going to do

570
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,680
something crazy yeah. He could do something crazy here's my here's here's

571
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,020
the next thing we have to decide on for twenty four. It's celebrity death pool.

572
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,080
Oh yes, yes, yes, I've been thinking about that. I'm getting a little. I

573
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,900
think Justin Bieber I've been

574
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,560
another car crash could go down yeah, that's true.

575
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,900
So

576
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,680
somebody's trying to get in. I'm going to go with a little grim pick. I'm going

577
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,820
so Brendan Fraser. Wow, that's not a bad pick. I saw that movie, the whale and he

578
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,040
was so monstrously fat. He looked close to death. I also just think there's a

579
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,460
thing of like his whole narrative had this thing of like great peaking Valley

580
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,980
and then now kind of back on this top and I do it's a like I don't want it to

581
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,100
be true. I don't yeah. What if him and I don't know how to pronounce the name

582
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,540
key

583
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,960
very key, can he hit Queen? Yeah, yeah, I feel bad. They both they put if they

584
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,440
both die at the same time buddy holly plain yeah or they do like who's the

585
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,400
third person that you don't really think of on the plane, because it's always

586
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
the big bopper who's there big bop

587
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,920
boppers flying to play a big bopper is the one the third guy yeah yeah hello

588
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,560
baby.

589
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,080
They're like

590
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,520
big boppers back from the day and then they're like

591
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,880
crash. They go wait. If you're here,

592
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,700
and you know it's funny as fuck when they say it because of their acting skills.

593
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,780
Yeah, it's a scene from a movie yeah yeah okay, who else under the age of

594
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,420
under the age of sixty who else

595
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:26,300
Helen Mirin, she's older than older than sixty Merrill Streep will die this year.

596
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,060
I have to actually you can't you can't have me say anything because there's

597
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:36,700
been two times where a celebrity has died who and a week before I have said

598
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,860
something who Betty White and Henry Kissinger, okay, but so don't read

599
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,040
twenty year old people. Don't know it over. Don't know. Do not everyone says

600
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,040
is going to die every single week yeah, but the timing that when I say it is

601
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,580
crazy,

602
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,440
Gus and I happened it happened. No, I you know what happens is I say that I'm

603
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,640
going to kill them and then they die within like a week. Why would you want

604
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,020
to kill Betty? What I don't know why I said it I was being random. Okay, say

605
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,660
one right now. Oh, it's not a young. Who are you going to kill? Who are you

606
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,100
going to kill? That's what I was going to say. It can't be an old person. I'm

607
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,340
saying

608
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:14,860
old person boring for celebrity death pool. Yeah, Ryan Reynolds Deadpool,

609
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,940
that's too much. That's that's way

610
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:23,640
is on a stunt. I could see TJ Miller who does their own stunts and movies right

611
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,100
Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise could have a stunt go wrong. That would be one of the

612
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,540
most incredible ways for him to die of all time. Oh, you know who does you know

613
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,220
he does his own stunts. I think the guy from I think Homelander from the boys

614
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,040
does his own stunts some of the time. What if Harrison for over sixty,

615
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,660
over sixty Harrison Ford passes away, that'd be a crazy celebrity. I have it

616
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,380
all the

617
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,900
Elgort. Okay, that's where we draw the line, because I don't want to talk about

618
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,300
celebrity deaths anymore. Okay, we should talk about celebrities being born.

619
00:38:52,300 --> 00:39:00,120
Who's the there will be a new singer born this year? I think Amelia Amelia,

620
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,100
singer will be born this year. I'm going to say, you know what? There's going to

621
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,720
be a new teen actor who has amazing chops. When he gets older, they're going

622
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,520
to be like he used to be in like a Disney show, but now he's like a 20

623
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,820
2044. Amelia's first album will be drawn dropping and 2024 beautiful flower

624
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,520
2044 44 20 year old. Her first album will be dropping and it's called

625
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,520
beautiful flowers in the sky. I'm also keep an eye out for that. I'm getting

626
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,880
like a feeling about a world leader whose last name is Gonzalvez. You know

627
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,140
know that spelling of Gonzalez with a V yeah it's that's going to come up.

628
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,720
That's going to be born born this year. Okay, okay, guys, we got some

629
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,140
predictions here, but I've pulled together some predictions from the

630
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:43,080
internet from for us as well. Here we go. Can we pull up what the before we go

631
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,640
any further? Can we pull up what animal this year is yeah search zodiac year?

632
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,040
Yeah, I do want to know everyone guess everyone guess

633
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,800
rabbit rabbit. Oh, it's like rabbit year. I'm going to get all dragon. Oh

634
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,240
Wow, actually this year, wait, twenty, twenty four will be the year of the

635
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,420
wood dragon. Whoa, that's the lamest possible dragon. No, no, no, what dragon

636
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,200
could look cool? You know the thing about dragon is bad because it implies

637
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,060
the dragon is artificial. Anything else air dragon, fire dragon, water, no,

638
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,020
it's like it's like a dragon that it's like it's a dragon that

639
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,380
breathes out grass. It's like an end to dragon. It's a dragon that has grass

640
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,640
breathing ability. It's imagine a way to picture this. Imagine going into an

641
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,780
old forest and old Chinese forest and you see a massive tree and then you look

642
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,020
away and then you hear something move and then you look back.

643
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,840
I think eyes open up and it's going. Have you ever seen like a tree that like

644
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:39,260
one of those trees that like like has a curve that goes up like it's like a pine

645
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,600
tree that grew wrong and then like yeah and it's a way nerves and then you're

646
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,920
like you're like oh this tree kind of looks like a dragon and then you sit on

647
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,360
it and it fucking gets up and flies away. There's like a big branch. I got big

648
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,180
fucking dragon's dick and it fucks you

649
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:59,420
but it fucking fucks you. Can you isn't it funny that dragons are just dinosaur

650
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,780
bones?

651
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,860
You're not always you ever think on that you see on that mind blowing. Can you

652
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,580
imagine apparently that's why Thomas back to bring back to the

653
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,940
apparently that's why Thomas Jefferson sent

654
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,920
Lewis and Clark West was because he on his giant property on in Monticello. He

655
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,700
found dinosaur bones and he just assumed that those creatures still existed yeah

656
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,160
in like the unexplored you would

657
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,060
like you it's way harder to be like oh, this was a millions and millions of

658
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,180
millions of years ago. Yeah, it just bone exist. It's so amazing how stupid

659
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,740
everybody was back then, because they didn't have the phone to look up and

660
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,620
correct themselves.

661
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,780
I would give Thomas Jefferson a phone. I go back in time. I give Thomas Jefferson

662
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:46,620
a phone. I would show him squirt off work videos. I would squirt and I'd show him

663
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,800
world star immediately. I would get back in time talking to Thomas Jefferson. I

664
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,820
be like all right first off buddy Thomas Jefferson it's out from now on

665
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,940
you're TJ yeah TJ, TJ Malone

666
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,740
and you're a singer.

667
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:06,220
This is called a microphone yeah. I would I would I would sit I would sit

668
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,500
him down and go TJ Malone and then I'll just press play on a beat.

669
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I play him. I play him like I play him. I play him the instrumental of mint

670
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,060
condition, pretty brown eyes and I'd say you have to sing over this right the

671
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,360
fuck back then in those times they would have been the most incredible

672
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,780
freestylers ever, because this is the age of people saying stuff like in dubit

673
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,100
ably and the pursuit of happiness, so they would be going fucking crazy. Oh

674
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,980
my God guys, it will be unreal. I was thinking of Thomas Jefferson more like

675
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,780
slow R and B style singing type of thing, because I think we just invented

676
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,660
epic rap battles.

677
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,220
They don't do that on epic rap battle of history, though they modernize it,

678
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,580
I say and what's more I fucked your bitch and it's like they wouldn't say that

679
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,220
back down. They would say I per I engaged in adultery with your woman. I aged in

680
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,820
adultery. Now we had you writing for epic rap. I see adultery, got a

681
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,620
poltice

682
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,180
these burns. You can't hold this

683
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,900
hot like a coal is I shot you off in a catapult. This yeah show catapult is

684
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,220
exactly show Thomas Jefferson a pogging would change his life. I would show him

685
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:16,600
pogs. I would show him pogs and the paper and also the white women. I

686
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,280
would show him like none of it. Nothing will get done yeah

687
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
America

688
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:28,920
ten seconds in the time travel.

689
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:38,540
You go back, you go back and it's like America. You go to the future, you go

690
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,280
like to twenty twenty four and there's literally dinosaurs again.

691
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,280
All society has completely crumbled

692
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,720
it's plan of the a three hundred years yeah you're like you have ten seconds

693
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,540
you're outside of the room. You open the door from across the room. You show

694
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,320
them your phone.

695
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:03,900
You look in your wallet and all of the all of the money. All the president's

696
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,680
faces are gone. They just have squirrels and

697
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
I

698
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,040
don't know what happened.

699
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,680
You go back to the future. There's like a like a primitive style and a planet of

700
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,380
the apes type man. He says I don't know what somebody went back with a device

701
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,000
and showed him what women could do with their butts in the future.

702
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,760
Change the courts of history. He lost to try to invent all the humans invented a

703
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,880
time machine. They went way too far in the future. He lost his mind trying to

704
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,020
replicate the squirt

705
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,800
he's it he's up in the like in the in his attic like in like nightmare before

706
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,180
Christmas when he's trying to re engineer Christmas, but he's like you

707
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,680
show it in Howard Stern, so they just compilation everyone everyone in the in

708
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,060
the town is like down on the ground level, like looking up like what's he

709
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,440
doing up there? There's like flashing lights and liquid squirt got to the

710
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:55,640
way

711
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,580
stockboard is like

712
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,460
what's this yeah

713
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:12,780
it's exactly nightmare before Christmas, but instead of Halloween and Christmas,

714
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,380
it's Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson and squirting yeah Jefferson,

715
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,740
making squirt, a gang squirt

716
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:28,260
women squirting. It's hers this time okay. Twenty twenty four predictions. I

717
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,840
got these for a bunch of different websites and blogs. I pulled them all

718
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,420
together. I kind of got just a wide range of all these possible different things

719
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,480
that people say might happen in twenty twenty four. So

720
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,460
I'm going to

721
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,740
go ahead and go through these and read this out to you guys and we'll see what

722
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,520
we think. If we think that these things are likely to happen in twenty twenty

723
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,720
four, okay, wait, wait, wait, so okay,

724
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,100
just a bunch of different stuff. All right, so let's let's check it out here.

725
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,220
This is not this is not by this is by Cameron. Let's go ahead here. So first

726
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,340
yourself. We have this blog called Stout Standards. You can say they are place

727
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,560
you'd think it would be, but you can see here they have their different. They

728
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,820
have their different sections on the website, like welcome the Malamute

729
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,560
Saloon,

730
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:11,020
coin Saloon as beer coin hunting, wet articles, brain farts, treasure, Expo

731
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,860
photos, how to use a shovel, etcetera. Now let's go to the next slide here and

732
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,100
you'll see that this is actually musings from an old beeper

733
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,900
is the header of this blog, and so I bet you're wondering what a beeper is. Oh

734
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,600
my God, here's his article. He says twenty twenty four what to expect and

735
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,300
here's a picture of him holding a crystal ball with a picture of him in

736
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,900
it yeah and here's what

737
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,680
in January Garrett issues press release stating that will it will indeed

738
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,560
introduce a metal detector. He's a beeper. He's a metal to

739
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,980
that will be capable of joining the never ending bitching bash with mine

740
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,580
lab and nocta and John Hallen goes off the wagon two days after getting on it.

741
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,680
I don't know who John

742
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,480
must be another be. I think it's just another

743
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,320
this guy does not like or is like good friends with and it's making a funny

744
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,380
yeah more likely, but it's funnier to imagine he's he hates him. He's trying

745
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,480
to ruin his he's trying to tarnish his name and then in October, the

746
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,040
manufacturers start refining their holiday ads by finding new synonyms for

747
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,540
words like deeper, amazing, visual, lightweight, multiple savings, etcetera,

748
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,760
but then realize the average techie, which I guess what they call detectors

749
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,660
won't know what they mean and go back to using deeper, amazing, lightweight,

750
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,020
et cetera. This is a beautiful painting of a community that I had no idea was

751
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,520
so yeah and here's the second thing that happens in October hottest new item

752
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,720
for techies in October, O D, olive green t shirts for privy diggers with

753
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,260
sayings like show me your shit and I love to think

754
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,360
did he

755
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,880
so this guy's the beep. This old beeper predicts that in October, twenty

756
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,420
twenty four, we will see a lot of people wearing shirts that say show me

757
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,000
your shit and I love to stink.

758
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,400
did he go is this in order or did he skip I'm skipping around yeah there's a full

759
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,980
it's all there's twelve different months. I'm not taking everything from all

760
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,440
those websites, just like that he had like three prediction yeah and we had

761
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,080
like twenty four twenty four predictions for twenty twenty four. I just realized

762
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,460
that two for each month. This guy's pretty smart yeah yeah and then in in

763
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,200
December he says detector sales soar as many newcomers enter the fray after

764
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,200
seeing how quickly you can become financially independent digging in the

765
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,000
dirt and dick stout. That's this guy's name stout stout, whatever it whatever it

766
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,940
if he is still around yeah, Dick Stout, he's like eighty something years old. I

767
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,720
found on his website Dick Stout. If he is still around, we'll put up his Christmas

768
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,920
tree, put a wreath on the door, pour a glass of red, celebrate making it through

769
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,280
another year and start working on his predictions for twenty twenty five.

770
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,000
Isn't that so cute? And then here's what he puts at the end of his article. I

771
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,960
love Dick Stout. Happy New Year and cheers and it's a glass of red. It looks

772
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,320
Dick Stout Dick. You are the man. I love you. What do we think about Dick's

773
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,720
predictions? Dick? I hope every single one of them comes true. I will personally

774
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:48,200
refund and olive green t shirt that says I love I love to show me your shit and I

775
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,640
love to

776
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,040
that's an incredible from an eighty something year old guy coming up with

777
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,120
the idea for an olive green t shirt that says show me your shit is unreal. It's

778
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,760
incredible all right, the next blog we're going to look at here. He does

779
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,820
call you know what I should say okay. It says show me your shit and then on the

780
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,640
back it says copyright dick.

781
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:12,240
Good idea, I would say she should also be a metal. The I should be a metal. The

782
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,000
is a good idea because it's funny because it's for privy diggers, which I

783
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,080
guess there's what people who go into the septic tanks and stuff, but yeah,

784
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,800
who would think that who would not even I don't even want to say privy diggers.

785
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,640
No, I just does it sound does not it sounds like a it sounds like a slur

786
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,120
from like one thousand and thirty. It really does it could be this guy's old.

787
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,440
We don't know back out. We have no yeah there's no sign of how yeah, nice of a

788
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,840
few born and born in what one thousand and forty yeah, some one to for he looks

789
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,980
like a face at he really does. I thought he was at first. The next blog we're

790
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,740
looking at is it ain't holy water,

791
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:51,900
and this is what what this blog says here. Chief knows wetter, but he says

792
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,000
what many are predicting for twenty twenty four. We have an image

793
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,840
in

794
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,120
twenty twenty one. It shows a bunch of people who just got their vaccines in

795
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,160
twenty twenty four. It shows the same amount of gravestones. Are we rocking

796
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,080
with this prediction for twenty twenty four? I don't know. I don't think so. I

797
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,920
I hope not because I got fucking I got tricked into that.

798
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:17,420
I'm going to say no. No, we're not rocking with this one with with it ain't

799
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:22,660
holy water. No, I mean I would say because also you know I would say graves

800
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,660
are less and less popular to yeah. People are getting put up into space on

801
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,140
hot air balloons taxidermy days burnt to Chris. People are getting stewed. Can

802
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,020
you go back one slide? I just want to read what this says. Oh yeah. Chief

803
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,140
nose wetter sarcasm derived through the bottom of a glass. It's a picture of I

804
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,240
think whiskey. Okay, so this is an alcoholics blog. Yeah, it ain't holy

805
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,300
water. If you understand the man, it looks like he created his web page on a

806
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,820
power point. Yeah, it really does doesn't all right. What's the next? What's the

807
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,780
next? What's the next prediction here? This is this is I'm just going through

808
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,140
random stuff here. It's I'm not that was his only prediction. Okay, this was a

809
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,140
news article. It says time will tell I'm a time traveler from twenty six two

810
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,140
thousand six hundred and seventy one. My seven wildest twenty twenty four

811
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,340
predictions from UFO discoveries to whole countries disappearing. I love I

812
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,260
love a time traveler coming back from sixteen from twenty six seventy one and

813
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,460
writing a like shitty little article. This is an even better than this. This

814
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,820
article is not written by the time traveler. It's written by someone who

815
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,540
saw the time travelers predictions, which are all on tick tock.

816
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:25,100
This is a very audacious time traveler to who has some very interesting things

817
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,740
to say about twenty twenty four. We'll see if these happen. The self

818
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,460
proclaimed time traveler first predicted that on May twenty first,

819
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:35,820
twenty four, a cloud would be made self aware by an alien species. He said the

820
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,300
cloud would turn hostile and attack random cities around the globe, so

821
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,460
specifically San Francisco, Berlin and London, followed by quote terrible

822
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,440
thunderstorms and flooding. He says there's going to be a living cloud on

823
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,180
May. Twenty first okay, this that's

824
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:53,220
we think that might happen. I feel like that's like not out of the realm of

825
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:57,500
possibility, a self aware cloud yeah. I mean I feel like who are we to judge

826
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,500
whether or not it is self aware right exactly, but I can imagine that this I

827
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,000
could see it. I can imagine these things happening and I can imagine a large

828
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,740
faction of people believing that this cloud has been angered by something

829
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,440
definitely. I would say that it's a it's not a sentient cloud. I think I would

830
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,720
think that it was that the aliens have a cloud shaped ship or like a cloud gun

831
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,780
that shoots a cloud around or just global dorm to go global dorming. Yeah,

832
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,180
visible dorming. What's all right? What's next here?

833
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:30,860
The last prediction a lyric made is that a species of bird previously thought as

834
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,680
extinct would reappear and begin to hum a scary melody. He said people who hear

835
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,240
the sound would lose control of themselves and hundreds would begin

836
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,420
passing away every single day. I think that's true. I think I what bird

837
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:49,300
didn't they didn't they clone the dodo bird and bring it back. I don't know if

838
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,600
that's something that I saw that was fake and then it just didn't didn't care

839
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,100
enough and just believe they haven't brought them back, but I'm sure they've

840
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,820
either synthesized their meat or they're capable of bringing them back. They

841
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,860
synthesized woolly mammoth me yeah, but I think they also did dodo maybe

842
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:05,440
I was anyway, though, after eating that shit, I don't know what the hell my

843
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,560
body go back, go back the dodo, I think is the obvious choice, but there have

844
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,580
been a lot of birds, but don't those are history. Don't those bird don't those

845
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,340
famously some type of moa. What about the you know the what's it called the

846
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:23,940
like gigantic crazy albatross thing that's like a fifty foot wing. What's

847
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,900
it called a terra torn or a fucking

848
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,820
there's some kind of New Zealand eagle that's like gigantic. That would be a

849
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:35,820
good gigantic bird and also you go the like King Kong skull face thing yeah on

850
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,260
yeah,

851
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:43,300
that's not a bird. There's a sharp shin hawk on my in my tree in my backyard. I

852
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,900
saw a hawk pick up a mouse from the median. We take on the highway. Oh yeah,

853
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:50,240
we both were texting each other about hawk stuff. I remember this yeah, it's

854
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,040
cool to see hawks all right. Here's the next prediction. That one's fucking

855
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,400
scary. This one I don't like this scary one to in March. Twenty twenty four, an

856
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,480
ancient artifact is found known as Pandora's box. It is opened and releases

857
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,060
many unknown mysteries. I hope not the intrigue of these things went out the

858
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:10,000
window with that one yeah that this one we know where you got this idea yeah

859
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,540
you're not cool yet. Not original

860
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,240
this ain't cool. Listen, we all read these these Greek myth books. Back when

861
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,060
we were kids, we all read Percy Jackson, an ancient artifact. I don't know,

862
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,800
maybe Pandora's box and something like that. It's opened, I guess, and what

863
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,400
happens when it's open something I guess many unknown. I know you should

864
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,280
be released. I hate it when an unknown mystery is released. Let show me a

865
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,080
known one, like although I will say maybe we don't know about Pandora's box

866
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,360
happening, but I can't imagine some unknown mysteries happening. Yeah,

867
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,920
here's the next prediction. Every day is an unknown mystery. Despicable me for

868
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,840
makes a billion

869
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,520
all right yeah. I can see it is that coming is that is that confirmed coming?

870
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,640
I don't know maybe

871
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,680
so this is kind of could be a shot in the dark yeah

872
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,600
yeah. I mean I would say they I don't I don't think they would do despicable me

873
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,200
for they, unless it would make a bill. I'm saying it unless it would make a

874
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,520
bill right. You trust them. They are going to be so that dream works that is

875
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,460
Illumination Illumination. Well, they just did Mario. Did Mario make a bill?

876
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,080
Not maybe Mario made a band almost a hundred percent. Mario definitely made

877
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,720
one band. Yeah, it made a band at least it at least made at least made one

878
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,880
band. Yeah, yeah, one point three six bill Jesus Christ. If you look in every

879
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,200
movie, it makes so much money. Mario's like all anything will despicable me.

880
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,400
Anything animated is going to be like every single country is going to have

881
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,000
the most famous actors doing the voices in it on the press. Before is definitely

882
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,460
making a bill yeah I'm all in lock it in like yeah. Do you have like a good

883
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:47,620
sound effect for lard? What's it called going draft kings put this in lock it

884
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,820
in? I might have a better one, but anyway

885
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:55,380
pickable me makes a bill yeah. Oh, I don't have a better one. These buttons

886
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,580
are so sticky. They are they're just like sticking in when I press the no

887
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,540
it's fine to the one again.

888
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,100
like it yeah. Well there we go to sound of action. There's two sound of eggs.

889
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,980
Now Julio, you have to use the audio, so this is the lock in sound and then when

890
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,120
we don't like a prediction

891
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,480
okay here, wait, let's go back and do all no we're not going to

892
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,340
and guys we need at the end of the year. We're going to come back. We're going

893
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,400
to see what came true. That's another creation, including the trend cheddar

894
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,060
chops. Some people don't know anything about cheese in twenty twenty four.

895
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,120
Other people will have hashtag cheddar chops. They're just charming and good

896
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,420
ground cheese talking about it, tasting it, sharing it this one. I do I

897
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,200
actually do think that this will happen because

898
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:44,220
I think Cheddar Chops. I don't think it will go by this name, but I do think

899
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,040
that a like what was it all out? What was it last year? What was it last

900
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,240
year? Everyone got into really into Cheddar Chops is going to be the big

901
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,340
cheddar. I don't think people got into church. People got into charcuterie, so

902
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,920
I think the next logical step did that. Yeah, well, yeah, but you're learning

903
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,920
you're learning the basics of meat and cheese that go, but I feel yeah, I guess,

904
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,860
that wouldn't cheddar chops already wouldn't they have already have burned

905
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,600
the cheddar chops with the charcuterie like when it moved to some people, some

906
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,760
people, I guess well there's two fact in twenty twenty four. Some people will

907
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,920
know about cheese that's going to be true. This is

908
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:22,360
I would I'm debating the opposite. This is hinging on this going viral and be

909
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:27,760
right. Okay, a viral cheese, there's no fucking way. You don't know that there's

910
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,640
absolutely the by and the impetus for the viral trend is not that anything

911
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,140
happens. It's just that the viral trend right now is that some people have

912
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:40,600
hashtag cheddar chops yeah and there's yeah also. I feel like viral shit hinges

913
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,120
on the ability for people to just copy it and do it right, whereas getting into

914
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,920
like well, maybe people are going to be posting pictures of cheese and say

915
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,600
hashtag cheddar shops. I mean this is a you guys,

916
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,560
if you want this to happen, you guys have to twenty twenty four, flex your

917
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,120
influence as much as possible. A new set of drops. Okay, everyone post a picture

918
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,860
of your cheese that you're eating and do hashtag

919
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:06,420
god post a picture of what has to be cheddar. All right, it has to be cheddar

920
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,380
in the well, cheddar chops is speaking for cheeses and for all, then it should

921
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,080
be cheese chops. Next prediction

922
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:17,600
a mysterious plague will spread all over the world, which will cause people to

923
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:22,980
sleep and hence will bring a halt to the entire world. Lock it in, lock it in

924
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:28,020
right now. Happened in twenty twenty yep, it's going to happen again. I

925
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,060
actually know I have been saying I think a new disease is on its way. I've been

926
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,760
saying this a lot. That's maybe my prophecy. I think that there's something

927
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,180
is going to

928
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:37,340
it's going to have been around for a minute. They're going to be we just

929
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,700
we've been seeing. We didn't know what to test for, but now we've seen that

930
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,260
this has been taking over. I don't know about the sleeping part, but I really

931
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,100
like the picture, too. I think that's supposed to be Nostradamus. Oh,

932
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,120
definitely an AI photo. Yeah, I mean I think I think if twenty twenty proved

933
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,540
anything, I think it's that we are definitely susceptible to sleeping to

934
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,220
sleep to a major halt of the earth via the sleep. What do you think? Are we

935
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,880
locking it in or are we boning it? I think we're boning it. I would say

936
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,640
because it's not original. It feels at this point like whatever I say you're

937
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,860
just going to do the opposite. So

938
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,160
what do you want? What are you talking about? I said no cheese chops and then

939
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,700
we it was cheddar chops, cheddar cheddar chops. You already forgot cheddar jobs.

940
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,620
yeah there was no she's. It was cheddar chops. I like cheddar chops now,

941
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:23,380
because this one okay, mysterious plague, yes or no, no,

942
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:28,540
it's a bone, it's a bone, it's a bone, cheddar chops. I want to hit

943
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:34,740
the good. The good one, a popular talk show host is rumored to be considering a

944
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,340
career change that could shock their loyal. This already happened. This

945
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,620
already happened with drew Barrymore's breaking the strike,

946
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,580
but she's not that there was no career change.

947
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,160
there was a well. There was a mean, that's not a it's a career change.

948
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,620
What's the word I'm looking for here a

949
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:56,440
people a people, she can change right, but this says a career, so do they need

950
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,340
to be a sitting talk show host now because Conan's new show is going to

951
00:59:59,340 --> 00:59:59,780
come out.

952
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,840
Maybe that's what they mean is the career change like into back into being

953
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:08,140
a talk show host. Well, his new show is just him doing the remotes yeah, okay,

954
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,960
well, then that, but I will say I do think I can see Kimmel and I can still

955
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:16,520
Jimmy Fallon switching it up, Kimmel Action Star, Kimmel Action Star,

956
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,620
Kimmel, Tom Cruise dies in a stunt in dead reckoning to he's. He gets the

957
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:24,620
bends from a submarine stunt. Jimmy Kimmel takes his place as his care as

958
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:31,420
Ethan Hunt's son or or Jimmy Fallon returns to musical comedy. Yes, only

959
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,780
found back to stand up, drops the show and goes a full stand up. Yeah,

960
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,820
do you remember he had an album of songs? No, I two thousand and three. He

961
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,920
albums, music, he goes, he's full rap, comedy, rap,

962
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,440
what I wouldn't give to see Jimmy Fallon drop some some bars. Yeah, oh, I

963
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,080
couldn't imagine it. I couldn't buddy there. There's a segment on the tonight

964
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,320
show that you need to see. I don't watch it very often. I'm on the I'm on the

965
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,780
tonight show. Everybody shut up bro. I was I was on the tonight show.

966
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:05,220
There's a at the you can see me in the crowd at the end. That does not count.

967
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:08,160
Yeah, it was it was all right. I mean wait, wait, look at look it up, look it

968
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:13,220
no one last look at it. I got a one. I it's not Kevin Bacon and Greta Gerwig

969
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,220
episode and what's his name? We have to get through Nickoon did stand up and

970
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:22,060
I'm in the credits and I high five Jimmy Fallon that okay. You're disgusting

971
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,460
you're a bug. No one's going to look

972
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:30,460
okay. Popular talk show host changing career. We did not even think about

973
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:36,660
Colbert leaving to become a minister or president yeah or or president as his

974
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,380
character

975
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,380
oh

976
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:42,220
we're locking it in next one. This is a series of

977
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:46,460
stuff from a form. I found I did a reading yesterday about the state of

978
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,620
female rap and what events will be taking place in quarter one January,

979
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:53,560
February, March, the chair car. There's a tarot reading for the state of female

980
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,960
rap. Okay, the chair card implies a departure or vacancy. There might be a

981
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,420
notable figure or influence leaving the female rap community during this period

982
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,900
that creates a shift in the dynamics. When did they predict this? When was

983
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,640
that, because remember Doja Cat said that she was leaving for twenty twenty four

984
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,220
for the first quarter. Okay, can you maybe have a swap between late night

985
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,880
host and female rap star? Not a bad idea. There's more though. I'd keep going

986
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,900
here post to a female rapper changes her image. A female rapper will be taking

987
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,580
chances when it comes to her image and exploring news, aesthetics or themes in

988
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,060
her music career. This new image could be risky, indicating a departure from

989
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,300
their previous image or works, but I'm seeing them willing to try new things

990
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,580
for this female rapper. I think that she is taking a lot of initiative when it

991
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,820
times to creativity and projects, and she is confident in what the future holds

992
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,320
for the outcomes of these projects. This will come with a lot of like having to

993
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,200
defend her choices, but I'm seeing her have a bold demeanor. Who is the female

994
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,480
fucking lame prediction? Just be like yeah, someone's going to change all the

995
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,960
stuff and I'm so proud of her. There's one more female rat prediction. We can

996
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,560
do these all as a group where we can decide whether to lock these in or not.

997
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,560
Number three, cardi B's overall twenty twenty four career prediction. There

998
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,560
will be discord or issues within cardi B's social or professional circles.

999
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,280
there might be challenges related to relationships that could impact the

1000
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,480
trajectory of her career. She will be experiencing feelings of depression,

1001
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,400
anxiety or a sense that someone might be working against her. There is

1002
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,640
potential emotional challenges that could affect her well being and

1003
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,200
professional outlook. Cardi B may find opportunities to take breaks or enjoy

1004
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,080
moments of leisure. This could be important for maintaining balance and

1005
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,640
rejuvenating her creative energy. I'm seeing she's going to step back and take

1006
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,440
a vacation of some sort. Let's lock that one in. Let's lock that one in.

1007
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,840
so I'm pretty happy with that. I think the first two such a good prediction.

1008
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,480
Yeah, I think

1009
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:43,280
party B will go in twenty to Miami for vacation will go on a vacation and I

1010
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,880
think she will shake her butt. Yeah, I think she'll probably take a break and

1011
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,760
go on vacation. I think she will isn't this. This is like didn't her and her

1012
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,480
husband just divorce offset yeah, I don't know her husband is still offset.

1013
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,600
Did they divorce they divorce? They have not been together for a while and she

1014
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,780
she announced in a I think it was a definitely that did not happen in the

1015
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,220
she announced in an X space

1016
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:08,680
or no. It was an instagram live. We haven't been together for weeks is what

1017
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,500
I saw, but and also she announced in a twitter space. You were like

1018
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,100
commenting on it as it was happening.

1019
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:18,820
Cardi no card, I'm so sorry this happened to you

1020
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:24,180
party. I hope this is not affect your musical career to go on vacation. I

1021
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,500
swear to God. If you don't, I take some time for you. Enjoy some moments of

1022
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:31,340
pleasure card, I'm going to do a tarot reading for you yeah. So what but what

1023
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:35,740
I'm thinking from that is that isn't because she just got divorced from

1024
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:39,660
offset, which you could call him now off off off the picture out of the

1025
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,060
picture could be his new name. Yeah, maybe there's someone in her circle

1026
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,940
who's still working for him and that could be the discourse. She's going to

1027
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:51,700
experience. She's trying to hide all her income because he's going to try and

1028
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,300
take her money in the divorce. They were in the baby shark. Move the most like

1029
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:59,120
schizophrenic thing just like party. There's someone is working for offset in

1030
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:04,840
your in your crew. Some one in your crew is a mole. There's a mole out now.

1031
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,520
You need to go to my

1032
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:12,040
to go to go. You need to take moments of leisure. Cardi drink some tea, shake

1033
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,480
your butt

1034
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:19,360
card. I know that card relaxes you card. I know I know that this is your. I know

1035
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,040
you can't go back. You can't go back. It's I know that you're going to be

1036
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,120
Cardi, I know you love the game. You will be completely you will be

1037
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,800
completely swayed by

1038
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:32,440
your appearance in the baby shark movie. You will think that you'll have to get

1039
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,600
back with him because he and I are in the baby shark movie together. You need

1040
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,800
to stay the fuck away. You need this by the way, Cardi. I also heard that in

1041
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,280
female rap there will be one female rapper who is getting a departure from

1042
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,960
her image. Do you know who that could be? It got to be you and you could start

1043
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,240
doing death metal and heavy rock. Let us know. Do you like heavy rock? Do you

1044
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,720
like heavy rock? Do you like Metallica style music? Yeah, do you like I don't

1045
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,460
know? Maybe you could start singing like instead of doing rapping, you could

1046
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,080
start doing like a kind of like

1047
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,800
rap meets rock type of music. There's there's a there is a mole in your in

1048
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,100
your crew. By the way, like rock and roll, do you like rock and roll? Do you

1049
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,860
like rock and roll? Cardi? I saw your divorce, please for the love of God,

1050
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,960
hold off the proceedings for at least six to eight years, because I am going

1051
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,000
to law school right now.

1052
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,460
I've just enrolled in law school. I will win this case. We help you. I will save

1053
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,700
you. I'm the type of lawyer who will kill offset for you. I am a great

1054
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,260
lawyer. I am going to be the greatest lawyer on the I'm a great or I'm a

1055
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,800
great lawyer. I pass the bar. I will be so I am the rock and roll lawyer.

1056
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,700
Trust me,

1057
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,100
I know I know I know I am a lawyer

1058
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,040
and

1059
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,100
this and then like after yelling seven thousand text messages, finally

1060
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,500
response and it's like hey man. This is not car.

1061
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:48,060
if you are please stop texting, just trying every number until you get one

1062
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:52,580
all right, let's look at the next prediction here. Let's see this here a

1063
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:55,480
few. These are a few pop culture predictions. Okay, Taylor Swift will

1064
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,820
finally come out as a lesbian slash by director. Brian Singer will be exposed.

1065
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:03,660
Lizzo will have a massive weight loss. Chucky, the killer doll tv show will

1066
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:08,140
come out of the closet and fat people will disappear. People disappear. These

1067
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:10,900
are some pop culture ones that I found. I don't know if I think about the doll

1068
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,400
Chucky the doll announced that he has a non non binary son that it was years ago

1069
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,400
child. I was twenty years ago. Have you seen that one clip of Chucky

1070
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,360
announcing that the the the Chucky's non binary son is from two thousand and

1071
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:32,920
four nine non binary child, but they they confirmed on the show last year

1072
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:39,000
that Chucky respects the Chucky Chucky respects the non binary and stuff. He's

1073
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,800
a killer, but he's not an asshole. He's not a monster. Yeah, he's not a monster.

1074
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,180
He's a living doll. Yeah,

1075
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:48,120
I can't speak for the Chucky one, but I don't think he'll come out of the

1076
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,200
closet. It feels like Brian Singer is kind of already been. Yeah, I know

1077
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,920
singer's been exposed for a while. Yeah, I don't maybe they mean exposed in a

1078
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,480
different way, exposes being innocent.

1079
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,960
There'll be a dirt on the line here and let's quickly. I would say the Taylor

1080
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,800
Swift one could happen if her and Travis don't make it. Yeah, maybe is Travis. If

1081
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,080
Patrick's man of the year prediction comes true. Maybe something has happened

1082
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,880
man time person of the year, the man who turned Taylor Swift gay

1083
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,540
yeah

1084
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,080
Brian singer, that's a lot yeah,

1085
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,540
because it just happened already. He'll just get exposed by one more okay,

1086
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,780
fair enough. The list of thing I'm Luke warm on. I don't know. I don't think

1087
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:32,460
she'll know. I can't lose weight. Okay, Pat says she can't lose. He thinks he's

1088
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,640
incapable. No, it's not that she's incapable. It's that she's not allowed

1089
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,140
to. I think Chuckie is also I'm also not letting

1090
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:46,800
Lizzo. Don't you dare? Don't you dare lose any weight texting two phones,

1091
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,620
texting, cardi B and

1092
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:53,900
oh wait a minute, wait a minute. What that's the image change? Whoa damn, oh

1093
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,600
my God, I didn't even think actually you know what Lizzo because we already

1094
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,660
locked in the other one. Get on that fucking treadmill right now and wait

1095
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:04,840
maybe also for tying them together. Maybe Brian Singer will be exposed to

1096
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,780
the mysterious things that come out of Pandora's box. He's exposed to the new

1097
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:09,320
disease

1098
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:13,920
you will not come out of the

1099
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,880
to yeah, that's definitely

1100
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,720
people would disappear, but his wife too much not feeling that one. So my

1101
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,120
feels like it, maybe it's like a commentary on the Osempic rage, right? I

1102
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,320
still don't think that's going to happen. The six hundred past this I don't

1103
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,720
or no longer six hundred. All right, we got a few more predictions here. Let's

1104
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,600
see what else we got

1105
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,500
here's a three a triple water disaster. Let me read these out already. One is

1106
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,740
these are what these are going to get specifically because there's a big

1107
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:45,320
bulging thing. It's also there's a an earthquake and tsunami in Japan yesterday.

1108
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:50,540
Oh my God, okay, so this is let me read these out. Then water disasters, fires

1109
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:55,020
at homes and businesses. So those waters and fires and occultic practices could

1110
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,120
increase because of hardships.

1111
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:02,360
all of them lock yeah easy. These are easily I could see these so easily.

1112
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:06,180
There is a pending water disaster over there yeah. There's something really bad

1113
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,800
happening, but there's a water does and every now and then it happened. There's

1114
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,480
the earth. There are noises from that water over there. It's going to burst

1115
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,840
and I think I saw somebody's house on fire on the news. Yeah, I saw there was

1116
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,520
a volcano last year at the end of the year in that country,

1117
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,520
volcano country, volcano world, okay, not down

1118
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,640
yeah volcano topia. All right, what's the next? What do you guys think about a

1119
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,180
occultic practices could yeah. What are you talking about if I can everyone's

1120
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:34,760
about everyone's a fucking witch now? I guess you're right. Everyone's got these

1121
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,140
Betty page bangs and all doing which stuff they got a whole witch story and

1122
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,180
over in damn Bush. Everyone's got these shirts that say let's summon a demon

1123
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:44,340
yeah. Let's play with this. We do you say that my neighbor, you know,

1124
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,260
practices could increase because of

1125
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:53,740
Joe wearing by a full set of shirts wearing only those shirts of like a fun

1126
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,640
graphic tea. Yeah, I don't really wear graphic. I know you wouldn't actually do

1127
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,600
it, but I could imagine you doing that in a day back in the day. I was a big

1128
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,620
graphic tea guy yeah, then I realize I just can't keep living that way. No, no

1129
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:08,180
there's an age you get to it's time where it becomes time and you can't wear

1130
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,560
a tom and jerry hood is sweatshirt anymore. Yeah, you can't wear be walking

1131
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,720
around wearing a sour patch kids hat. There's an age you get to and it just

1132
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,180
you look like a dope yeah, look like a dunce yeah.

1133
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:24,080
some of us you have to graduate to yeah yeah, you have to graduate your style.

1134
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,780
You got to start wearing sports merch for teams. You don't know anything about

1135
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,320
yeah,

1136
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,160
it's what I do

1137
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,560
one shot where one shot two kills yeah

1138
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,800
Hiroshima carp,

1139
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,500
they're the carp. That's a good name. Yeah, that's cool. Sometimes you could

1140
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:46,040
like you turn twenty six and you decide I'm not going to wear. Are you twenty

1141
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,580
six? Yeah, you turn twenty six and you're like I'm going to wear

1142
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:53,280
here. I hear your old as I'm going to wear loafers. Okay, wait, I'm changing

1143
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,460
my celebrity death pool for

1144
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:00,980
about how old old as Patrick is old Patrick. That's scary. I hope you don't

1145
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:04,060
die. You start wearing loafers every day instead of normal shoes. For some

1146
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:07,180
reason, I'll never understand a loafer. Oh, I just thought of something really

1147
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,640
run for twenty twenty four, but I were in their late twenties in twenty twenty

1148
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,740
four. They're not on today. Get get with the loafers and stop with the stoffers.

1149
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,640
it's good. It's good right. I would say I would say don't wear loafers, so no,

1150
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,540
I just think loafers are kind of clown con shoes. Well, the ones that I have

1151
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:29,460
have tassels and killed their kilt loaf. Oh yeah, that's way cooler. Stop wearing

1152
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,660
the hokas and start eating the poke. Have you seen the hokas that look like

1153
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,160
they're like

1154
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:38,560
like a backpack? Yeah, they're kind of cool. What do you mean they're like

1155
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,820
weird? It looks like a kind of look like a squishy backpack, a squishy backpack,

1156
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:49,140
a shoe that looks like a back pack. They look cool in what way

1157

Patreon show added to the podcast about list Patreon this year, but I don't know

1234
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,560
if I want to do it is an incredible value guys. There's over to you're

1235
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,640
going to do one over to

1236
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:48,880
Patrick is going to do a show. Patrick's thoughts may be coming back monthly.

1237
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,120
It's going to happen. I promise,

1238
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,100
but I don't know if I want to do it yet. That's going to happen. I think that I

1239
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,220
have to change the format and restructure to us on you to follow us on

1240
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,600
every social media platform. Send all the episodes to your friends and your

1241
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,840
family. You just saw them for Christmas. You saw that uncle you hadn't seen a

1242
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,880
while. Let's keep a connection. Let's send him this episode. Let's see what he

1243
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:12,540
thinks and and we're going to have a poll that says should should Patrick's

1244
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:16,420
thoughts come back as a music style show and Patrick's got a poll. Patrick has

1245
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:20,720
been killing it in the stew. He's been going crazy in the stew. That's true.

1246
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,120
He's every time I see him now he's touching a piano.

1247
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,260
Well, I guess that's about all the housekeeping we got to do for twenty

1248
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:30,720
twenty four. Happy New Year, everybody, and get ready to become significant.

1249
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,120
Thank you. Goodbye.

1250
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:42,760
This is my first ever post on that website. OK, OK. TuneZone.net. I was

1251
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,660
thirteen years old and this is

1252
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,800
Subject line, "I went to the carnival recently."

1253
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,600
Dot dot dot.

1254
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,100
Wow.

1255
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,300
I like it already.

1256
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,700
So, family guy does come up.

1257
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,200
Uh, "Yesterday, I went to the carnival.

1258
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,200
While I was looking at- walking around, I saw plenty of games.

1259
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,200
At those games, many character-based stuffed toys were there,

1260
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:08,200
including cartoon characters such as Spongebob, Superman, Nemo, Batman, and a few of the Simpsons.

1261
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,200
But the character with the most toys was..."

1262
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,200
Dot dot dot.

1263
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,600
Stewie Griffin!

1264
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Oh my god.

1265
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,600
That's an adult animation!

1266
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,100
Yeah.

1267
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,600
Stewie says "bitch!"

1268
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,100
I was really concerned about this.

1269
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,600
They ranged from massive to very small.

1270
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,100
Brian, Peter, Meg, Chris, and Lois also had toys.

1271
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:32,600
I even saw plenty of toddlers with Brian dolls, which there's no way.

1272
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,100
No.

1273
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,100
You lied.

1274
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:34,600
There's no way.

1275
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,100
You lied.

1276
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,100
I had to have been lying.

1277
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:36,600
Yeah.

1278
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,600
I've never seen a Lois doll.

1279
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,600
I've seen one.

1280
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,100
I understand that.

1281
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,600
He makes them.

1282
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,100
I've seen one. I've seen quite a few.

1283
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:49,100
I understand that many adults and teens go to the carnival too, so I was not very surprised.

1284
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:52,100
However, many of the games with the Griffin clan...

1285
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:57,100
[Laughter]

1286
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,100
The Griffin clan is crazy!

1287
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,100
The Griffin clan!

1288
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:07,100
I love when, like, it still gets me every single time when somebody talks about the Family Guy characters

1289
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:10,100
as if they're like, like family friends, you know?

1290
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:13,600
You're an amazing writer as a child.

1291
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,600
Oh, because I also wanted people to think I was older than I was.

1292
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,600
That comes across.

1293
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,600
So, I had a sign saying "12 and under."

1294
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,100
I was somewhat surprised by this.

1295
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:26,600
I also recently saw an action figure featuring Jasper, which I forgot about Jasper.

1296
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,600
Who the hell is that?

1297
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,600
Oh, yes, yes.

1298
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,600
The replacement Brian.

1299
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:35,100
With the message on the package "8 and up," I know that Family Guy gets wonderful ratings

1300
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,260
from the 9 to 14 demographic,

1301
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,180
but wouldn't Fox want to hide that fact

1302
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,740
rather than embracing it?

1303
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,060
- Oh my God.

1304
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,380
- That's crazy.

1305
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,220
- It's so funny.

1306
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,040
- No, I like--

1307
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,300
- It's so funny you're trying to sound older in those posts.

1308
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,340
- But your subject matter is giving.

1309
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,580
- You accidentally, you were trying to sound

1310
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,960
like 10 years older,

1311
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,620
but you accidentally like sounded 30 years older.

1312
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,100
You sound like a Christian mom.

1313
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:57,940
- No, it's--

1314
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,520
(upbeat music)
