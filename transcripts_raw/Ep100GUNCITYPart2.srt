Yeah, I'm pretty impressed with all of you. I'll help you out now.

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He grabs one of your cyber maps and he says, "Now look over here. There's a tunnel.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you go through there, you'll be able to come topside without anybody really noticing.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,040
The only thing is this is the posters underground. I'm scared as shit.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,280
Yeah, Patrick's scared as shit. I grab Sullivan by his lips.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:11,440
Alright you funky little frog, you're coming with us. What? Okay, can I just go pee first?

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,600
Absolutely not. Lead the way. Oh, jeez.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:38,120
And yeah, so you, you sort of grab Sullivan, you tell him to lead the way. And so he does. He sort of scared walks you guys to the tunnel. Yeah, and you see it's just like huge like opening like squirreled away way in like the deep, deep, deep parts of the of Guns Titty.

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,960
This is it, but if you guys you know

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,240
You know a good luck. I guess in there I

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,560
Put Sullivan in my pocket

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,440
Okay, yeah, he just easily goes in there. He's so scared. I fed him a cracker

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,400
Terrified and it is like kind of like oh

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,880
They could kind of happy gets a cracker

26
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,160
It's a smile. It's an oyster cracker - it's not that big of a cracker

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,440
Thanks, man

28
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
You know us little guys got to stick together

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
It looks big in our hands because of how small we are. That's right

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Yeah, he's like he's like kind of like oh one of those days

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,680
Carted around yes, you guys want to go into the the posters underground. Yeah, yeah, fuck it

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,400
Let's go and as we as we walk in Patrick looks really scared

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,020
He's turning white like a sheet, and I say I look at the camera, and I say man. He looks like he just saw a post

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
That's an automatic one.

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
(laughter)

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
So what does he say?

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,200
So the producers of the movie are crying because they just lost so much money on the movie.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Yeah, no, he says it perfectly, it's just such a dog shit line.

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Yeah, it's just one of the worst things.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
It might as well be a one.

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,500
walk towards that you pass by whoever this guy is going you just pass by him I

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,420
don't know and you enter into the posters underground so you know

43
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,780
underneath gun city is an abandoned tunnel right that's what this is it was

44
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,140
it's filled with freakers and bloodites you know anti-tech freakazoids the

45
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,780
scurriest scum this side of ebaum the habitable parts of it are known as the

46
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,180
posters underground a lawless criminal shit stain that some of the toughest

47
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,740
gunks and the slums won't go near. It used to be an underground railway system, the

48
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,060
last government-run project to exist in Gunn City, before Stakehams fully took

49
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,540
control and officially privatized democracy. Now the tunnel acts as a

50
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,740
makeshift sewer system after the previous one collapsed from all the

51
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,580
fucking shit inside of it. The brighter neons above ground become long, dim

52
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,460
streaks of lazy blue, coasting down the sides of the tunnel walls, flickering in

53
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,780
and out revealing the creepy creatures the nasty stinkers and lurk and do their

54
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,620
dirty deeds the creatures are one thing but the black depth oh that word is just

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,820
awful the black depth for my lisp of the posters underground means our heroes

56
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:49,140
can't see shit but Lord knows they'll be stepping in it so yeah you guys are here

57
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,740
it's it's you sort of here like drip drops you hear like a little like little

58
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,540
snickering from all these techno slime addicted weirdos. You thought the slums

59
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,540
were bad this is just like like not even the the mad suckler goes down here.

60
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,460
Okay I'm seeing all these all these freaks geeking off that freaky deaky

61
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,540
shit and it reminds me that I actually have a bit of a techno slime habit

62
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,060
myself and I need to recharge so I start I start puffing on that on that chiba.

63
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,940
Yeah, I'm I've been out of techno. Yeah, you know what wait wait wait hold on

64
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:31,580
Boys I had the most insane idea who wants to sash oh

65
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:39,900
Yeah, I'm ready to sash right now. I still have some of that good good I

66
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,300
Sullivan the frog is only 14 years old, but we're gonna let him smoke with the beer

67
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,700
We're gonna make you hit that techno bong till you fall sideways, you pussy bitch.

68
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,700
We're all 19 years old and we're letting a 14 year old smoke with us.

69
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I'm 37.

70
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
In frog years.

71
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
In frog years.

73
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh yeah, I forgot.

74
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Yeah, you all take techno slimes.

75
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
So all of you roll a d20.

76
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Okay.

77
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Alright.

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,580
yeah i don't even need to recharge my points i'm just doing it because i like

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,060
it

80
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,500
i got it too

81
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,220
i also got a two

82
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,300
okay

83
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,520
so

84
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,040
alright this is where the uh...

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,620
folks at home this is where the techno slime addiction system comes in

86
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,540
uh... so

87
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,720
uh... on your first failure

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,740
so you guys all sort of inject that techno slime and then you also smoke it

89
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,040
uh... it's like a weird double way to take the drug

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,400
Blowtoss and Ray William Johnson, you only get half your points rounded down.

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
So you guys only recover two points.

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,400
And you're gonna have disadvantage on your dex rolls for the next in-game hour.

93
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
No!

94
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,080
Okay, okay, I pause for a minute and I say, "What's the 27 club?

95
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,200
We ain't making it past 21."

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
*laughter*

97
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
*laughter*

98
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Yeah, you're like kinda woozy,

99
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
you're kinda out of it.

100
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Um, uh,

101
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Yoda, you take it like a fuckin' champ.

102
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
You've done so much more

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
in your time.

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
I'm a Tick Street.

105
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Yeah, this is easy street for you.

106
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
But you two guys, you guys are gonna be pretty messed up.

107
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
What did, uh, what did

108
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Sullivan the Frog get?

109
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Oh yeah, let me see how he did.

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:40,200
he doesn't have any moves right? he'll die in one hit. he'll die from one hit of techno

111
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:50,560
slime? yeah no he's okay he's vomiting. I take him out of my pocket. I don't want him vomiting

112
00:07:50,560 --> 00:08:02,360
in my pocket. It's like, "Oh God, oh geez, this reminds me of frog college." I pick out

113
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:11,360
the cracker from the throw up and I eat it. Okay, I set Sullivan between my horns. Okay,

114
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,680
yeah, he's sort of woosily in between your horns and just sort of like hanging in there.

115
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,800
uh... yeah what does it feel like the to get fucked up on time

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,080
on my god it's a rush like none other i can see numbers in my head

117
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,600
for me actually all it does is it gives me a book of her

118
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,400
it's all it's literally all of us it for me it feels like i got a brain freeze

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,560
but if my brain was hot instead of cold

120
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,920
okay to get a hot brain

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,000
uh... amazing okay cool that's that's that the effort for

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,280
uh... solve it's just makes him vomit a lot

123
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,640
and thinks a little bit more about his dad and how

124
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,280
he misses his dad

125
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,720
uh... yeah so you guys are yeah you guys are sort of walking through the tunnels

126
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,560
uh... following the uh... did you guys know that wizard of oz syncs up with the

127
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,000
pink floyd album

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,560
I just had to blow Sullivan's brain real quick.

129
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, Sullivan is sort of just like, "Are you fucking kidding me?"

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,320
Yeah, man, dark side of the moon, check it out.

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I'm serious.

132
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Shut the fuck up.

133
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
There's no way.

134
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
No way.

135
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,360
I have a torrent of it already pre-synced.

136
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,120
Yo, so hit me with that shit.

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
You wanna watch it?

138
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Hit me with that right now.

139
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Absolutely.

140
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
We can watch it.

141
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
We spent an hour and a half.

142
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,240
It's like 10pm, you have till midnight.

143
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,240
You guys just take an hour and a half, watch Dark Side of the Moon.

144
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,240
We'll listen to Dark Side of the Moon and watch what it is.

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,240
It takes us 30 minutes to figure out how to sync it up.

146
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,240
The audio is already sucked up.

147
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,240
We spend 30 minutes trying to sync it up and then we give up.

148
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,240
We don't actually watch it.

149
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I'll just listen on my iPod.

150
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
He has an iPod video.

151
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,240
He has the limited edition U2 iPod Touch.

152
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,240
And all the songs on it are Pink Floyd and U2.

153
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,240
It's money by Pink Floyd and all of U2's entire discography.

154
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Yeah, he's just listening to that and vomiting whenever U2 comes on.

155
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,240
And, uh, yeah, so you guys reach sort of like a fork in the tunnels.

156
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,320
and Sullivan sort of like wakes up a little bit of a stupor and looks at the

157
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,720
sort of the cyber map he's like uh-huh he's sort of like fiddling with it and

158
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,320
he's like doesn't seem to be a clear direction on which one to take what oh

159
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:01,360

Your monkey sucks. I say hey Patrick. Can you run down the tunnel on the left and check what's down there come back?

178
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,840
He's flipping out. He's checking his DMs. ApeChat's blowing up. He's sending selfies.

179
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:35,840
And he comes back to you and he sort of just like shrugs and he's like "Rawr, rawr, rawr."

180
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,340
Patrick.

181
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,340
Like he didn't really see anything down there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
You're able to read his mind perfectly.

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740

If there's a guy with blue spiral hair, I'm gonna kill him.

217
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,100
I don't follow.

218
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,900
Patrick, we should follow.

219
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Ah, okay.

220
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Okay, man.

221
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,900
I wanted to go the other way.

222
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,900
All right, well, let's follow him.

223
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,260
So you guys run down the side.

224
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:00,580
hear creepy creatures snickering as you run by and you sort of come across what

225
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:08,220
looks like the blue Grinch but when he turns to face you he has a regular guy

226
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:17,660
face. What? Not a Grinch face at all. Oh. And he says to you, "Hello my name is Benicio."

227
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Oh my god.

228
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:28,060
Okay, I download the old image macro of the owl and it says "Oh really?" at the bottom.

229
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,980
I just download it and look at it for a little bit.

230
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:41,580
I show Panisio my hoverboard, Panisio does not like it, and I don't know where to go

231
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
from there.

232
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,180
I say hello, I'll just say hi.

233
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,100

234
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,220

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,580
And he looks up at the frog.

236
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
Or a quad...

237
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,940
A quad...

238
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,140
You guys look like a group of guys that maybe...

239
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,620
Would be interested in some techno slime.

240
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,060

241
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
Absolutely.

243
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Ah, crap.

245
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100

249
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,420
I'm talking Tupac Shakur.

250
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,780
Tupac Shakur went to jail for rape Kush.

251
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,220
That's what I'm talking about.

252
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,460
(laughing)

253
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,940
He sort of starts to rant about how everyone

254
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,380
seems to forget about that.

255
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,620
(laughing)

256
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,220
I'm gonna stop you right there,

257
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,140
because I love California, love.

258
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,220
So we'll take the whole batch.

259
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,060
Okay, yeah.

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,220
So he, yeah, he hands you it.

261
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,420
He says, he says, "It's going to be $30."

262
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,340
That's not even that bad.

263
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,620
I mean, that's basically, I got 27 from Jamal.

264
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,540
So I just give him my real questions asked.

265
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,380
Yeah, you give him that.

266
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,220
I just give him 30 bucks.

267
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,580
And he now says, he hands it over to you

268
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,340
and then he pulls out a walkie-talkie.

269
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,180
What?

270
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,460

and he uh...

282
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:47,220
He says, "Good job, Penicillio! That's badass! That's totally wack-ass cool!"

283
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,340
And he holds out his fist for a fist bump.

284
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
And Penicillio bumps his fist.

285
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,200
And he says, "You fools think you can come down here and buy techno-slime?

286
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,680
Yeah, right! Not in these streets, not where I'm from!"

287
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
And he's very- he's pasty white.

288
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,540
And he's translucent, his skin. You can look through it.

339
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
I got a 1.

340
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,140
Oh, Pat got the one. Cameron, what'd you get? 21. Oh, it's so different than when I was

341
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:39,380
writing. Okay, let's see how fast Michael Rapaport is. He's with the quickness.

342
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:45,620
He's not that fast. Penecio is cowering away. He's just sort of an informant.

343
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:53,980
All right, yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, so you guys fight him. Cameron, you go first.

344
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Okay, I want to grab Penicill by his hair and swing him around over my head and throw him at Michael Rapaport.

345
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Absolutely. Roll a Strength check to see if you... I mean you could grapple him. He's like a civilian. I'm not even going to tell you to grab for that.

346
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:20,980
You just grab him and swing him around. And yeah, now roll... I would say roll a Dexterity attack. So like what you would roll for the Grinch Gun, basically. Roll that.

347
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:29,740
for the Grinch gun okay yeah an attack or a damage just for an attack so five okay

348
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:38,620
that's a 24 yeah you absolutely hit him you wall him roll now roll a 1d6 and add

349
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:46,740
that's roll 1d6 straight six nice yeah so you throw you whip around Pony CIO who

350
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,420
is just like oh no not again and you can get thrown directly into Michael

351
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,980
Rappaport's chest and Michael Rappaport falls over on his back he's not prone

352
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,940
I'm gonna say that that happens because that was a very cool move yeah yeah you

353
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,820
still have stuff you can do so we want to do okay I want to use my yo mama ability

354
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,300
to insult Michael Rappaport and cause him psychic damage so I want to I stand

355
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:22,420
over him and I say "hey pal, more like Michael Crappaport." Oh shit, okay he's

356
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,940
got a roll, let's see how he's not gonna do too hot at this. My spell check

357
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:40,300
corrects it to Michael Crappaport. And that gets saved to the dictionary. He does

358
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,860
okay he roll 4d4 and he's gonna take half of that damage he sort of brushes it off

359
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:55,540
he's like I've heard worse one time 40 monster sent me his giant penis I rolled

360
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:02,460
13 okay yeah so he takes yeah he's only takes like six damage yeah it still hurt

361
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,180
his feelings like you know he doesn't like being called that does he cry so

362
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,260
So yeah, he's not looking, he's not happy about that.

363
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,980
No, his lower lip starts to quiver, but he doesn't cry.

364
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,100
- What lower lip?

365
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,940
(laughing)

366
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,460
You fucking punk ass little bitch.

367
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,300
- Woo! - Oh damn.

368
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,140
- Take that shit, take that shit, bitch.

369
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,780
- Hell yeah, and it is now, with that sweet ass insult,

370
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,460
it is now your turn, Caleb.

371
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,460
- I stand in front of a stalactite

372
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,380
that's poking somehow out of the side of the cave,

373
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,380
sewer system kind of thing that's going on.

374
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,940
And I hold in front of it a Jamaican flag

375
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,880
as if I'm a matador baiting a bull.

376
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,400
And I dangle it and I say, "Reba, Reba."

377
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,700
And I try to, I'm gonna, you'll see what I do.

378
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,000
- Okay, yeah.

379
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,900
Yeah, let's see, he's gonna try to resist that.

380
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,340
That's pretty tempting though.

381
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,620
let's see how he does and give him disadvantage on that for sure he is oh

382
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,260
my god he is simply unable to resist every bone in his body needs to charge

383
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,340
that flag so he charges he charges he's gonna be said as he gets up from the

384
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:30,260
ground and charges. He says that. And I don't but he says that. Okay so right is right before he gets to

385
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:36,900
the flag I pull it out of the way and he runs into the stalactite. He absolutely

386
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,580
does. Let's see how much damage he takes. He's gonna take quite a bit I think. Yeah

387
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,940
he takes a solid 10 damage from that. He just gets his head just like boom like

388
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,900
Looney Tunes like he's got a big bump he looks right at the camera and he's like

389
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,260
he's like making a face. Does he have birds flying around his head? Yeah he's

390
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,560
the birds flying around this around his head they're all blackbirds believe it

391
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,660
or not so yeah which makes sense because it's his imagination so yeah he's uh

392
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,580
they're the they're the they're the black people Twitter reddit icon yeah

393
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,220
the Twitter bird with the with a yeah he's just like yeah he says under his

394
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:27,780
breath Liz Lemon style I want to go to there and yeah so yeah no you do that to

395
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:34,220
him now it is I believe it's actually his turn yeah so he gets up from that he's

396
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,540
pretty pissed off and he looks at you guys you're trying to make a fool out of

397
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,780
me I'm about to make a fool out of you let me show you my hip-hop keto so he

398
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:52,300
goes to a he starts to breakdance and and screams and screams New York style and

399
00:25:52,300 --> 00:26:18,700
he starts to spin around and and let's see how he does. Let's see if he knocks you knocks knocks you out. No, he can't he hasn't hit you. So he starts spinning around his head, but you pretty easily get out of the way. But then he sort of gets up and then tries to hit you with brass knuckles that are the same ones from Do the Right Thing. He tries to punch you with those.

400
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,900
Okay.

401
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
He succeeds. He's gonna win.

402
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
Oh, fuck.

403
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
Yeah.

404
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Yeah, he does four damage, though. He just sort of, like, knocks you on the head.

405
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:34,420
Sullivan the Frog, who's sitting on top of your head, manages to hold on, but just barely.

406
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Manages to hold on to your horns after you get knocked in the head.

407
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,420
Um, yeah.

408
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,420
And, uh, now it is your turn, Patrick.

409
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:51,100
Alright, so what I'm gonna do with my Techno Slime points, uh, I'm gonna play the bass,

410
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:57,940
and I'm gonna play fuckin', I'm gonna play, uh, I'm gonna play... what's that fuckin'

411
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,940
Snoop Dogg so- fuck, goddammit.

412
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
Uhhhhhhhh.

413
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Fuck, goddammit.

414
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:09,980
I'm gonna play "Ain't Nothin' But a G-Thing."

415
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,980
What's that Snoop Dogg song?

416
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,820
You know, that one, ate nothing but a G-Thing.

417
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:25,820
I'm gonna play that at Michael Rapaport, but also, just to distract him, but also to give,

418
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,220
cause he can't stop grooving once he hears it.

419
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,340
No he can't, yeah.

420
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,700
He says this is real New York hip hop.

421
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,380
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:41,260
Just not knowing, he doesn't know anything about Snoop Dogg it turns out.

423
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,740
uh... yeah let's see uh...

424
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,500
yet he's unable to resist

425
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,740
so yeah yeah you're right you guys are gonna uh... he's gonna have basically

426
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,460
uh... he's not he's gonna basically you're going to get an auto hit next

427
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,620
person hits it

428
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,380
because you have advantage and he's grooving too hard

429
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,540
uh...

430
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,860
he's losing it uh... you guys are going to be able to crush him so you're up

431
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,020
you're up cameron what do you do?

432
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,840
I go creature mode

433
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,100
and I beat him up I hit him on the top of the head and the

434
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:17,100
bottom of the butt. Alright, do it. Alright, let's see. That's a 24. Yeah, you do that.

435
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:27,420
Roll for damage. Woah. 20 damage. Max damage. Yeah, describe how you squish Michael Rapaport

436
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,380
between your two pipes to death.

437
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,780
- Yeah, so I hit him on the top of the head and he--

438
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,620
- Parody, parody.

439
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,460
(gunshot)

440
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,380
- He reverberates like a gong,

441
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,380
and then while he's shaking around,

442
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,820
I hit him on the bottom of the butt and it,

443
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,260
he flies up and he splatters on the ceiling of the tunnel,

444
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,900
and he just makes, he's like a flat,

445
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,020
just like Nickelodeon splatter with a face

446
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,940
on the top of the tunnel.

447
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,820
And he says, "Aw, man!"

448
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:11,420
Yeah, he splats on top and he falls down to the ground and you see two little feet come

449
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,020
up below him and he starts to waddle away.

450
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:22,220
And then out of the darkness you see some sort of beastly, hairy-looking naked man with

451
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:30,660
a huge swinging dick swing by out of nowhere and just scoop him up into the darkness.

452
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,100
He's gone

453
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
Just like that

454
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,300
Good riddance, buddy

455
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,220

459
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020

460
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,860
Okay, yeah, you don't have to roll an intimidation check he's totally scared

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,540
You say the third Reich are you a not so no no no I didn't start beating him up

00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,260
Yeah, you start beating him up. He's like. I'm not canceled. I'm not canceled, and he's like crying

465
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,180
Yeah, you beat him up. He's a total bloody pulp

466
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,540
I don't know if he took any information, but he said your third your third right the third right tunnel

467
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,040
The third entrance so yeah, you guys now know your way out of here

468
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,440
You guys beat up these guys who are both alive now. They're both alive and just squished

469
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,300
Yeah, so you guys keep walking and you we know where to go now. Yeah, you see that way

470
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,720
I can I check on Sullivan. I just want to see how Sullivan yeah. Yeah

471
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,340
Yeah, what do you say?

472
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,660
Hmm a little buddy

473
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:55,780
How are you? I got a little rattled when he punched you with the love hate

474
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:03,500
I hate, the love hate, you know, brass knuckles, but I'm doing okay otherwise.

475
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,100
Still a little woozy from the technosom, but I could use some more of that if you're willing

476
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
to say.

477
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Here, this will help.

478
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,540
I give him a pill that is, it's pressed and it says rehypnohal on it.

479
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
Okay.

480
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,460
Yeah, he takes that.

481
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
Okay.

482
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:27,860
Yeah, he takes that, uh, um, and he's, he is, his eyes like, just like go wide as shit.

483
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:39,540
He's just like, yeah, he is, he's just like, yeah, he's just like, like

484
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,800
staring straight ahead now with his eyes wide as hell.

485
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,940
And he's like, I can dig it.

486
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,140
And he's just totally calm.

487
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Alright, then we continue.

488
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Yeah.

489
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,300
Yeah, you guys keep going and you find that third right, which makes no sense the more

490
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,180
I say it, and it's just like a tunnel outcropping.

491
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:05,820
The creepy creatures scurry away, they see the light of the main city.

492
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,740
And you guys see a ladder, and you go up the ladder.

493
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,580
You end up in the main city.

494
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:17,660
So this is the main area of Gun City, so it's Gun City proper.

495
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,260
The streets, the streets are haunted.

496
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,460
First thing I do now that we're here,

497
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,240
I wanna get an authentic Gun City bagel.

498
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,780
Yeah, you can do that.

499
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:33,460
Hold on, wait, I'm gonna read the description I wrote.

500
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,100
And then I'll get a bagel.

501
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,620
No, you don't have to.

502
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,460
It's okay.

503
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:46,060
Yeah, Gun City proper, the streets a terrible chrome.

504
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,540
Haunted by, should I do the voice?

505
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
Do the voice, it's for consistency.

506
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Do the voice.

507
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Gun City proper.

508
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,540
The streets, a terrible, haunting black.

509
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,540
With the hulking hovercars cruising by,

510
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,540
the wealthy denizens walk by in their aluminum tube tops,

511
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,540
and their high quality, authentic Master Chief replica suits.

512
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,540
The air is sickeningly clean, the sky is clouded with holograms

513
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,540
of awesome looking Japanese women trying to sell you luxury underwear

514
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:23,080
can shit in while you work. The neons are bright, vibrant, reflecting, creating a picturesque

515
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,440
desktop background or cover photo of your lamest friend. Everyone here is proud of their brands

516
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,520
and proud of their work. There is only 1% unemployment, almost everyone works in consulting or defense.

517
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,020
Only the true creative minds get to rule as social media managers of brand accounts, acting

518
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,460
as de facto lords of Gun City.

519
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:51,180
Besides that awesome music by Megadrive or whatever, we hear their best posts from these

520
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,180
brands broadcast throughout the city.

521
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,700
I'm depressed lol you hear Cracker Barrel say.

522
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,500
OMG what's wrong replies Raytheon.

523
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,820
And everyone in Gun City loves it.

524
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,820
So that's where you are.

525
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,820
Wow.

526
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,820
Oh my god.

527
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,460
- Okay, now that you've finished your little thing,

528
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,500
I get a bagel.

529
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,020
- Yeah, you can get the fucking bagel.

530
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,860
- Okay.

531
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,780
- It's much better probably.

532
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,820
Yeah, so yeah, you go to the authentic Gun City Bagel store.

533
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,660
- Yeah.

534
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,340
- You see a guy behind the counter.

535
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,180
He's dressed like the--

536
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,460
- Can I do an ethnicity check?

537
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,580
- Yeah, sure.

538
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,780
Yeah, roll for ethnicity.

539
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,620
- Okay, I rolled for--

540
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,500
- That's gonna be actually, roll for,

541
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,060
that's gonna be an insight check.

542
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,780
- Okay, I get a--

543
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,620
- You get pretty good insight.

544
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,420
I get an 18.

545
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,060
Okay, yeah, you can definitely tell

546
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,500
he is a gun city resident.

547
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,300
Okay, that's all I'm allowed to say legally.

548
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,140
Okay.

549
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,180
All right, so what I know,

550
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,540
I know that this is a real true authentic gun city bagel.

551
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,060
Yeah, yeah, he looks up at you and he says,

552
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,580
what can I get you boss?

553
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,660
That's right, that's that gun city accent

554
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,060
I was looking for.

555
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,660
All right, I say, one bagel please.

556
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,060
Actually, make it two.

557
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,700
And can you flatten it out as if it could fit into a ZD drive?

558
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,260
Hey, coming right up.

559
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,760
Not, not, not like me to yuck a yum.

560
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:21,180
And he just, uh, takes out two bagels.

561
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,740
It just takes out a rolling pin and starts rolling them completely

562
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,780
flat and hands them to you.

563
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,220
Uh, and he says, these are free on the house.

564
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,500
Welcome to gun city.

565
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,300
Whoa.

566
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,020
Wow.

567
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,460
Yeah, that's right.

568
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,420
Wow.

569
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,020
(laughing)

570
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,860
That's right.

571
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,900
You got it.

572
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,100
Okay, and then I turn, I don't say thank you,

573
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,180
I turn around and I leave.

574
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,980
(laughing)

575
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,380
Yeah.

576
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,780
Okay, yeah, so you leave the Gun City Bagels.

577
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,660
And actually, actually, I don't eat the bagels,

578
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,500
I keep them.

579
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,620
I'm gonna keep them in my pocket,

580
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,380
I think they might come in handy later.

581
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,280
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,480
You keep them in your pocket, you store them.

583
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,960
And you look in the distance in the city,

584
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,800
You could see the giant social media manager

585
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,600
who looks like he's like 33 maybe,

586
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,280
and his dad is, you know,

587
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,200
maybe runs the firm that manages the account.

588
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,260
You see that guy,

589
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,400
that giant mega, mega zord sort of looking thing,

590
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,100
just a little bit down the block.

591
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,440
Yeah, so you guys can probably make it there pretty easily.

592
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
Whoa.

593
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,040
Right down the block.

594
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,420
Okay, well, wait, hold on.

595
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,600
Wait, okay, we could easily walk there,

596
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,120
but we are in Gun City after all.

597
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,740
How about we take the subway?

598
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,000
(laughing)

599
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,840
Yeah.

600
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,980
That's a good idea.

601
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,820
Yeah, let's do it.

602
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,160
It's a great idea.

603
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,540
I mean, how many times in your life

604
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,280
will you be in Gun City?

605
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,400
Probably a lot.

606
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,480
Probably just now.

607
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,200
You see a guy says, "Not many!"

608
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,040
(laughing)

609
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,440
That's right, guy.

610
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,120
- Yeah, yeah.

611
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,520
And he gives you a thumbs up.

612
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,360
- Mm-hmm.

613
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,160
- Yeah, so you guys go down to the subway.

614
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,600
You see it's being patrolled by a lot of Jollibee cops.

615
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,920
- I hop the turnstile.

616
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,720
- Okay, roll a stealth check.

617
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,920
- All right, 12.

618
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,680
- Yeah, one of the Jollibee cops kind of sees you do that

619
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,160
and he sort of goes up to you.

620
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,240
He goes, "Hey, where are you going?

621
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,280
"Where do you think you're going?

622
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,440
"This is gun city." - I run up and I say,

623
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,480
"Help, help, this monkey is trying to steal my money."

624
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,200
And I point to the monkey on my shoulder

625
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,440
and I make Patrick the monkey run away.

626
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,720
And I say, "Hey, Jolly Bee Cop,

627
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,640
"go chase that monkey for me, please.

628
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
"This is so urgent."

629
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,720
- Roll deception check.

630
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,560
- Okay.

631
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,820
- With advantage.

632
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,840
- With advantage.

633
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,280
Oh, that's a nat 20.

634
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,680
- Oh shit, yeah.

635
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,160
That cop, the monkey runs and that cop says,

636
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,280
"I'm gonna quit my job and become a monkey chaser."

637
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,080
and like takes off his police outfit and starts chasing that

638
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,640
chasing Patrick the monkey around like sort of around in

639
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,960
circles like in a cartoon.

640
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,280
I also hopped the turnstile. Well, the cop is distracted.

641
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,600
You guys are fine now. Yeah, you guys can sort of just get

642
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,920
through now Yoda can just walk underneath it. Yeah. Yeah, you

643
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,560
take the train into the city.

644
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,440
What letter is it?

645
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,740
Beta is the letter.

646
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,960
It's a Greek alphabet.

647
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,520
Perfect.

648
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,320
Gun City.

649
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,800
Yeah.

650
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,520
Uh, yeah.

651
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,400
You take the beta train, uh, you see all the very beautiful, wealthy, subservient

652
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,400
residents of Gun City with their, their, uh, they look, uh, pleasantly happy.

653
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,320
You know, that phrase, pleasantly happy.

654
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,920
Okay.

655
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,320
All right.

656
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,040
I start doing a subway dancing performance

657
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,720
where I use the poles to do a spin trick.

658
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,680
- Yeah, I give him my lead pipes to do it.

659
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,960
- 'Cause I'm trying to make a little money.

660
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,000
I say, "Ladies and gentlemen,

661
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,040
"we are not here to ruin your commute.

662
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,840
"We're here to make it better.

663
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,480
"We are the untold truth."

664
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,520
(laughing)

665
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,040
And then we all start break dancing.

666
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,920
- Okay, all of you roll a performance check.

667
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,760
- Okay. - Okay.

668
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Oh no.

669
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Fuck yeah dude.

670
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
23. Natural 20 plus 3.

671
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
I have a 1.

672
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760

Stegos Federation of Bodies and Spaces HQ.

706
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,280
And you get out

707
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,980
and you hear affirmations "remember to drink water as you leave the subway."

708
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,580
And yeah, you get out, you go to the

709

You guys hear your PSPs and your engages ring.

Yo, what's up guys?

714
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,980
Whoa, looks like you made it pretty far, I can tell.

715
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,860
So, you should have IDs to help you get through the first part of the security.

716
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,180
I don't know much about after that, but you better hurry up, you're making time, but who

717
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,740
knows you might get punked by me.

718
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
I didn't really-

719
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,740
Whoa.

720
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,180
You know, that's just saying, and he turns off.

00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,420
trained him to do that yeah something I didn't mention everything I say or do he

724
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,460
acts out at the same time on my shoulder this that's all yeah he's been doing

00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,020
He got a little nibble in there.

00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,860
Yeah, he got some bites.

729
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,860
Yeah.

730
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,980
Can we walk up to the thwomps and show our IDs?

731
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,820
Yeah, you can do that.

732
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,260
Yeah, describe what you guys do.

733
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,260
Tell me the process.

734
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,900
Tell me what's up.

735
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:07,620
Okay, well, I put the ID on a lanyard around my neck and I go up to the thwomp and I put

736
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,420
my ID in his mouth.

737
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,960
- Okay.

738
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,920
Yeah, he sort of is like,

739
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,120
"Yep, that's the protocol."

740
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,020
And he humbly lets you in.

741
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,920
(laughing)

742
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,760
- Got it in one.

743
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,760
- I walk up to him and I slide my ID through his butt cheeks

744
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,120
like Nelly in the tip drill video.

745
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,040
- Right.

746
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,800
- Like a credit card.

747
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,600
- Yeah, he blushes and lets you in as well.

748
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,160
- Yeah.

749
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,660
Yeah.

750
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,660
What about you, Patrick Yoda?

751
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,060
I just, uh, I show it, uh, kind of fast.

752
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,980
Uh, you know, just kind of like, you know, make it look like I've done this a

753
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,900
million times and they should know me already.

754
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,120
And alarm starts to go off.

755
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,040
Yeah.

756
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:02,960
like sort of shrug like yeah yeah I know this guy yeah Sullivan the frog sort of

757
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,200
hides in hides in in the hard drive of your computer while you guys do this oh

758
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:14,520
yeah I forgot I had Sullivan with me. You downloaded Sullivan into your hard drive? I guess so.

759
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:21,120
He's digital now. Yeah yeah he's digital he's digital he's gone Sullivan the frog

760
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,760
has gone digital. Okay I have a digital Sullivan the frog alright I'll remember this for later I have a

761
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,440
digital Sullivan the frog in me.

762
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,920
Yeah. Yeah. So you're in the lane lobby of the building, the main

763
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,880
lobby, the building. Yeah, you see like, you know, posters in

764
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,500
there that say stuff like, you know, you know, get fucking

765
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,880
pumped, you rock star, and it's a picture of slash and you see,

766
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,600
you can't pour from an empty cup. And it's a picture of a

767
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,840
white woman who's just tired. And then you see another picture

768
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,100
that says, another like motivational things. It's like

769
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,220
self-care is better than feeding poor people. And it's in the

770
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,660
Success Kid meme format. You see this all around the building.

771
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:05,020
You see a bunch of Stakem's logos, and you see Jollibee

772
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:09,920
security guards doing this next part of the scan and a guy walks

773
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,060
by you. And he says, Oh, do you guys hear about the new

774
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,900
protocol?

775
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,040
Um, I, yeah, yeah.

776
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,700
Patrick says, yeah, I was just about to say that.

777
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,580
I was just about to say Patrick says yes.

778
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,060
Yeah.

779
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:26,540
Okay.

780
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,900
Well get ready.

781
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,960
Cause they now scan your face to see if there's any traces of irony in

782
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,800
your body before letting you in.

783
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,300
And, uh, yeah, he walks in, he gets his face scanned.

784
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:43,580
You see a perfectly smooth brain and a picture of, uh, a gif or a jif from

785
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,540
Brooklyn nine, nine up here on the screen.

786
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,900
and then a check mark comes up and he's allowed in.

787
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,500
- Oh no. - Oh fuck, okay.

788
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,260
- So behind that area is a bunch of elevators.

789
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,540
- Okay, wait.

790
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,140
Okay, no, keep going.

791
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,820
- Yeah, behind that area is a bunch of elevators to get in.

792
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,900
There could be another way in,

793
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,540
you'd have to probably look for it though,

794
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,620
but that is sort of like the new protocol security measure

795
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,640
put in since the attack on the Jollibee cop

796
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,140
that got his head cut in half.

797
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,340
- Oh. (laughs)

798
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,820
- Okay, so-- - We did this ourselves.

799
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:22,380
here's what I do right I I put I pull my my my red and green of fatigues my jacket

800
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,340
I pull it up over my head so it looks like I have no head and then I get

801
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:31,940
Patrick the monkey to sit on top of my head so it's a monkey yeah and I go up

802
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,840
and I say but really muffled from inside the jacket I say hey go ahead scan my

803
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:44,540
face to test for irony oh yeah roll roll a let's do roll a performance check with

804
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:52,060
advantage I love that idea I'm just giving them out okay that's 16 yeah it

805
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,100
works they just think it's like a weird fucked up guy with a monkey face so yeah

806
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,540
they scan the monkey face and it's a pic it's it's Patrick the monkey with

807
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:07,740
symbols just on the screen so he's let right in yeah I'd say fuck you guys and

808
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,900
I flip off Ray William Johnson and Patrick I don't think the sensors like

809
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:19,080
that the sensors love it the sensors give say they don't like it and the alarm

810
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:34,020
starts going up Patrick I don't think this game is just make them up say you

811
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,940
could just do that you know you could just record something and just say stuff

812
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,940
I guess you're right.

813
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,940
We could do that.

814
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,940
Yeah, so what do you guys want to do though?

815
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,940
Patrick, what you got?

816
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,940
What I'm going to do?

817
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,940
Yeah.

818
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,940
Hmm.

819
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,940
Alright, so what does the area look like?

820
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:01,940
So yeah, it's like a, basically a lobby with like a main entrance with like the scanners and a few Jollibee cops there.

821
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:08,720
there. Off to the right you see just sort of more of a lobby area. If you want you

822
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,300
could do like an investigation check to see if you could find something.

823
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:19,180
No, my investigation is negative two. Yeah, if you want you can you can there's a few

824
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,420
things you can do right so you can I mean Yoda's mind could be helpful here

825
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:30,220
right potentially. Yeah. But you know it's up to you what you want to do. Just say

826
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:37,220
Say what you would want to do and I'll, we could try to find a way to make it happen.

827
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,220
Hmm.

828
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,220
Insight.

829
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:47,100
Okay, so what you can do is you can go up to the Jollibee cops and try to see what their

830
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,640
motivation is.

831
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,940
Maybe see if you can get something out of them.

832
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,300
Do I have to roll for that?

833
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,900
Yeah, so go up to them, yeah.

834
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
Start a conversation.

835
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,900
Ooh, natural 20.

836
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,900
Plus 5, yeah.

837
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,500
- Plus five. - Okay, yeah.

838
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,880
- Natural 20 plus five.

839
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,200
- Okay, yeah, oh yeah, your insight check

840
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,120
is tied to Yoda's mind, so.

841
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,960
- Ah.

842
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,740
- So yeah, so you do that,

843
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,820
and so you read the Jollibee guard's mind.

844
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,860
And he's thinking,

845
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,140
now man, I can't wait to punch out the clock.

846
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,420
I'm gonna go home and jerk off to black.com.

847
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,740
Love it, love that website.

848
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,880
Nothing wrong with that website.

849
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,300
Man, I hope this guy doesn't figure out

850
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,820
that if you just make us scan the back of your head

851
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:31,660
and say it's because it's actually racist to scan the front of your head.

852
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,920
We'll just let him do that.

853
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,540
He can just get in.

854
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,480
Cause if he asks that I'm going to have to let him do that.

855
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,280
Okay.

856
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,260
I love black.

857
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:46,900
I'm going to do that.

858
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,720
Yeah.

859
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,300
So you, yeah, you, you say that it's racist and it's ableist to have your face scanned.

860
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,900
Um, and you, you threatened to cancel the Jollibee cop.

861
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,920
Um, and which is the biggest, you know, like it's, that's like the most

862
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,560
important currency in the state comes Federation of bodies and spaces.

863
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,340
Um, how you can weaponize being kind rather than the act of being kind.

864
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:14,320
Um, and so he immediately let scans the back of your head and it just shows a

865
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,880
pick a question mark and you're allowed it.

866
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,400
That worked great.

867
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,280
Okay.

868
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,160
Is it my turn?

869
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:32,740
Yeah, if you want to. Okay, um, okay, first, okay, I panicked while he, while Patrick

870
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:38,500
was learning all this stuff about how to scan the back of his head, I panicked and

871
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,700
I downloaded the scene from Now You See Me 2 where they slip the card past the

872
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:52,100
security checkpoint. Okay? So I, out of my pocket, I pull an ace of spades. That's

873
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,980
That's right. Huge AC/DC fan.

874
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
And...

875
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,980
That's Motorhead.

876
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,980
That's an AC/DC song. Thank you very much.

877
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,980
That's Motor...

878
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,980
No. So I...

879
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:02,980
The jury's still out.

880
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:08,700
I throw... Actually, I'll do a check for that. Can I check... Can I do... Can I roll an intelligence

881
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,180
check to see if that's AC/DC or Motorhead?

882
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,540
Yeah. Do a history check.

883
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,540
A history...

884
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,540
History.

885
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,020
Is that a thing? Okay. Plus five history. Yeah, I think I got it in the fucking bag.

886
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,940
Yeah, that's right. 23, you fucking bitch.

887
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,860
Yeah, so you know for sure that it's AC/DC.

888
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:30,740
That is beyond the shadow of a doubt an AC/DC song.

889
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,740
Yeah, and Lemmy had nothing to do with it.

890
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,500
Yeah, as that plays on LimeWire on my brain, because I'm a fucking computer,

891
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,580
I throw the Ace of Spades through the security checkpoint

892
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,620
at one of my compatriots, who slips it in their pocket,

893
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,860
and then they throw it back at me, and then I throw it back at them,

894
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,420
And it slides between one of the security guards legs and it just barely touches

895
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,300
their clit as it passes through.

896
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:55,980
Right.

897
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,700
Just play, just, just the tiniest bit, just enough to get them excited, but not

898
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,700
enough to make them do anything about it.

899
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,980
All Jollibees have clits.

900
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,020
And then, yeah, that's right.

901
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,380
Big, juicy, meaty thumb clits.

902
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:13,100
And then as they're distracted, just having a tiny bit of a cum, just like a

903
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:18,440
one eighth of a cum right there at the security checkpoint, I, I jump over the

904
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,600
turn style again because I'm so good at it. Okay so thinking of the rolls here

905
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:30,640
okay. Is there an awesome skill? Because that's what that was. First you and

906
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:38,440
Blotoss Piss both roll athletic checks. Oh no. Let's go. My athletics is good. 17.

907
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,360
17 as well. Whoa. Okay great yeah you guys slide the card perfectly and you do make

908
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,880
that Jolly Beat nut a little bit. Just a little bit though. So now I'm gonna need

909
00:53:49,880 --> 00:54:02,840
you to roll a stealth check to see if you can hop it. Stealth... 7. Okay you slide the card back and forth.

910
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:09,000
Make that Jolly Beat nut a little bit and then you just sort of like you do the

911
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,240
thing where you like run up to a bar you forget to jump you just hit your

912
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:20,920
yourself look at the guy just tip over top wise and they're immediately on your

913
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:28,480
ass you guys got a book it I run to the elevators and press the up button a lot

914
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,880
yeah you guys are pressing it up up wait wait wait wait I I find who's whatever

915
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:40,600
the head Jollibee is and I started fingering it as as deftly as possible

916
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,140
just fucking rubbing that clip doing it actually I start eating it out I start

917
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:49,540
doing the alphabet spelling with my tongue so the jolly be consents and this

918
00:54:49,540 --> 00:55:04,220
happens thank you so professional DMS do yeah so that jolly B is says I like I

919
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,820
that's a good idea but let's roll now still a performance check to see how

920
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:14,820
well you do. Yeah this is what the libs want dude. They want you to have to roll a performance check for when you wanna have sex.

921
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:26,940
Okay, performance I get a 16. Yeah I mean that Jollibee is like "woah, eugh" you know.

922
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:34,780
It's loving that. Yeah yeah and just sort of like starts to like gently gently

923
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:51,580
squirt Jollibee sauce. She sprung a gentle squirt of Jollibee sauce. I don't think that's

924
00:55:51,580 --> 00:56:02,480
a sauce. I think probably spaghetti sauce. Sweet spaghetti sauce. Yeah, she just squirts

925
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:09,480
out that spaghetti sauce. Yeah and then I say let us go. Let us go. Yeah yeah she's

926
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,400
quivering the other Jollibees are too stunned to do anything and you're able

927
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,400
to get to the elevator. Yes. In time. Yeah so you guys get into the elevator you're

928
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:28,040
taking it up to the to the boardroom where you can find an entryway into the

929
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:35,480
computer. So you get to the top of the boardroom and it's this comically long

930
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:41,100
ping-pong table with beanbag chairs on top of it. It's just a total mess of

931
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:46,400
shitty corporate work culture. It's like a meditation area on top of the ping-pong

932
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:53,960
table. Makes no sense. And it's empty except there's a chair that's turned

933
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,060
around and when you guys get there oh no that chair spins around and looks like

934
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:06,400
somebody who was expecting you maybe and it's none other than the CEO of

935
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:19,240
Steakums Chuck Wendig on a leash when he has with him on a leash mr. bean whoa I

936
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,960
would have never thought they would be working together that is fucked yeah and

937
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,960
And Chuck Wendig... Basically polar opposites.

938
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,960
Yeah. Oh, that's part of the power.

939
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,960
And Chuck Wendig says...

940
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,960
"Now that feel when you flumpty flew all over your pants!"

941
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,960
"Razza frazza was a woo my fellow boopty boos!"

942
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,960
"How's it what's it?"

943
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,960
And Mr. Bean goes "Mmm, yeah, I dunno."

944
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,960
And Chuck Wendig yanks at his collar, stopping from talking.

945
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:56,460
Yeah, so, yeah, you hear Chuck Wendig say that.

946
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:02,460
You turn around and you look behind you, you see actually behind a bulletproof, super solid

947
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,540
glass, the world's giant computer.

948
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,460
The world's most giant, biggest computer.

949
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,460
I start drooling.

950
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:20,960
Yeah, it looks like a TI-83 calculator, but it has GAMs, just like beautiful GAMs.

951
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,640
I look into the camera and I say, "Deadpool style."

952
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,720
I wonder how much porn you could download onto that thing, and then I wink, and then

953
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,800
I do a jack-off motion with my hand.

954
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,140
Wait, I, aping on a Blowtoss Pisses format,

955
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,600
I also look at the camera,

956
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,300
or at least my best approximation where the camera is,

957
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,140
Right.

958
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,940
And I say, I sure would love to TI-69 that thing.

959
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,760
Yeah, you both do that, you sort of, that's pretty good.

960
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,980
I think yours is pretty good.

961
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,300
Both of you guys roll a performance check.

962
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,580
Let's see who gets the biggest laugh.

963
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,900
Okay.

964
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,740
From the audience.

965
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,660
Oh no, I got a five.

966
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,700
Okay, it's not great.

967
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,820
I got a five as well.

968
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,820
Okay.

969
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,180
So you have the audience is like kind of just upset.

970
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,420
Okay.

971
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,380
Yeah.

972
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,700
I liked the TI-69 though, personally.

973
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,540
I looked, I looked at the, I look at the camera and then I, it's just the top of

974
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,540
your head, you're too sure.

975
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:19,340
I noticed that the camera, I noticed that the camera is there for the first time.

976
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,020
And then I don't say anything cause I don't know.

977
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,420
Yeah, you just like, you get like scared.

978
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:23,900
Yeah.

979
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,420
Yeah.

980
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:24,820
Yeah.

981
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,940
I'm too scared to say anything.

982
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,460
Yeah.

983
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,740
The audience loves that.

984
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,940
Um, they're eating that up.

985
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,860
Yes, you see that behind you.

986
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:38,460
Um, you see also a bunch of like, uh, computer nerds updating it with OS, uh,

987
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:43,740
with Microsoft OS Fogel, um, and they all, they all have gotten the very popular

988
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,580
surgery in gun city, which is a permanent soy face.

989
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,580
Um, so they're all doing that while they're updating it.

990
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:54,980
And Chuck Wendig looks at you all and he says, you flumpty wuzzle

991
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,220
wooze thought you could wiggle womb in my was it, was it?

992
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:05,040
And he sort of like starts walking around the boardroom like he's gonna give the speech from Network.

993
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:13,980
He said, "You don't flumpty-floos understand? You don't wuzzy-wuzzits and fuzzy-guzzits?

994
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,380
I'm

995
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,580
everything. I am the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega.

996
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:28,340
If you are going to try to wuzzit-wuzzit my big computer,

997
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:34,100
you're gonna have to guz it was it go through me first and he yanks at mr.

998
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,100
bean collar mr. bean hops up on the board table it starts charging at you

01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,780
You managed to, so Mr.

1008
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,380
Bean runs up to you and he shoots out of his mouth.

1009
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:51,580
It looks like just like a bunch of like terrible English food,

1010
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:56,480
sausage, biscuits, crumpets, all those things in like a

You, though, my fair friend, Ray William Johnson, you take...

01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,080
Oh boy.

01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
Uh-oh.

1018
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,080
You take 15 damage.

1019
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:25,080
Oh, that puts me at -1 HP.

1020
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,080
Yeah, you're knocked out. Cold.

1021
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,080
Damn.

1022
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,080
You can be revived by people. We can go into that.

1023
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,080
It'll basically require one of you guys to try to stabilize him.

1024
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,920
which you can do. Is that a medicine thing?

1025
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,720
Yeah, it's a medicine check. Okay. I think you have pretty good medicine, Patrick.

1026
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,760
I'm gonna do, yeah, I'm gonna do a medicine check. You guys should do that because I have an absolutely fatal blow.

1027
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,560
Oh yeah. I can strike on specifically Chuck Wendig.

1028
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:59,160
First time. Alright, I'm rolling for a medicine check.

1029
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,480
I got 10. Yeah, that's good enough. He stabilizes. That's exactly good enough.

1030
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,440
Oh shit. Yeah, so Caleb, you, Ray William Johnson,

1031
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,440
What happens when like the life,

1032
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,900
what is like you almost dying do?

1033
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,280
And like, what is it like when you come back?

1034
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,980
- So, Mr. Bean deletes system 32.

1035
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,740
(laughing)

1036
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:24,740
And I have to boot in safe mode and recover it, okay?

1037
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,400
And so now I'm recovering and the update,

1038
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,500
it takes a couple minutes, honestly.

1039
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,600
Like they need to maybe stall for a minute

1040
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,880
before I can really get back in action.

1041
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,720
- Right, yeah.

1042
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,300
- 'Cause I'm installing.

1043
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,440
I'm installing Cortana.

1044
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,720
You're installing, yeah, it's OverDrive.

1045
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,920
You're installing Cortana.

1046
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,960
You see in your mind's eye,

1047
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,080
Sullivan the Frog, the computer program,

1048
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,640
slow dancing with Cortana as you're coming back to life.

1049
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,240
I become jealous.

1050
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,080
Yeah.

1051
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,720
Jealousy check.

1052
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,040
Yeah, you wake in a jealous rage with one HP.

1053
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,520
Okay, I have one HP now?

1054
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,840
Yeah.

1055
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,280
Okay, is it my turn or is it somebody else's?

1056
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,960
It is Cameron's turn now.

1057
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,040
All right. Thank you, Pat.

1058
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,960
You're welcome. Mr. Bean's going to taste my rhesus pipe.

1059
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,880
I'm going to, okay, wait, I, I, um, I look, okay,

1060
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,800
first I use the yo mama. I insult. Does this is, I guess this,

1061
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,840
Mike, tell me if this counts as an insult. I look at Mr. Bean.

1062
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,720
I look at the camera and I hold the lead pipe. Like it's my wiener.

1063
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,560
And I say time to lay some pipe.

1064
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,600
Absolutely that's an insult to Mr. Bean. He was sexless.

1065
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,100
Yeah.

1066
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:45,600
So I do that to him for with my to cause psychic damage to attempt to cause psychic damage.

1067
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:52,100
Okay. Yeah, he's gonna have to try to resist that. He's not very wise. So you might be okay.

1068
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:57,600
Yeah, yeah, he's gonna take it on the face. Roll for damage. Fold it maxed out. Fold damage.

1069
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,600
12.

1070
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:22,600
mean? You say that to him." And he just sort of like goes like *growls* and just sort of like trips over himself and just goes like *growls* and just like like flops around and just like feels all kinds of bad. He's still alive, but he like just like is very upset and just sort of says "fuck you" like under his breath.

1071
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:50,260
It is now Chuck Wendig's turn. He's going to- seeing Mr. Bean get injured, he unhinges his jaw in anger and begins to charge up what looks like some sort of beam. His tongue has become a giant sort of like laser cannon. And he's going to- you guys are all going to have to roll Dexterity saving throws again.

1072
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,100
Oh no, is he going to shoot the whoop?

1073
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,860
He's literally gonna shoot the whoop.

1074
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:55,860
Fuck.

1075
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,860
Wow, you fucking read that shit.

1076
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,860
It's a shoot the whoop, but way of Fluxy Floops.

1077
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:02,860
I got a 9.

1078
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,860
Okay.

1079
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,860
Is it- wait, wasn't shoot the whoop racist?

1080
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,860
Was it racist?

1081
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,860
Yeah, dude, wasn't it blackface?

1082
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,860
Yeah, wasn't it like a Sambo?

1083
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:11,860
Wait, so-

1084
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,860
Wait, wasn't it-

1085
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,860
Dude, Chuck Windig is doing blackface, dude.

1086
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,860
I didn't even know that.

1087
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,860
I think all we need to do is take a picture.

1088
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:20,860
I had no idea.

1089
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,860
And then we beat him.

1090
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,860
Oh, I gotta... wait, so it's a dexterity thing?

1091
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:27,860
Yeah.

1092
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,860
Dexterity saving.

1093
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,860
My dexterity is zero, but I got a nineteen.

1094
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,860
Nice, yeah.

1095
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,860
I'm firing my laser!

1096
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:38,860
You avoid it, uh, uh, you avoid it, it goes right over you again.

1097
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,860
They keep just like misjudging your height.

1098
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:46,860
Uh, uh, RayWilliamJohnson, you're lying on the ground, so it's just like, it just goes over you too.

1099
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:52,020
You blow-toss, you try to do some cool flippy Deadpool bullshit, but it gets you.

1100
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:58,820
And you take, you take 15 damage also actually. What comes out is a beam that

1101
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:03,580
it just literally said it's just a beam that is shaped in the face of Lin Manuel

1102
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:10,500
Miranda coming out of his mouth with like hearts in his eyes and you take 15

1103
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,900
damage from that. So now it is your turn Bray William Johnson.

1104
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,180
Um, okay. Do it.

1105
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:19,740
Alright, so I have 1 HP, right? I'm sort of on my last, uh...

1106
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,380
Yeah.

1107
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,740
I'm on my last legs here.

1108
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,900
Yeah, you're not doing too well.

1109
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,620
So I'm gonna pull out the big guns.

1110
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,580
Do it.

1111
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:32,220
I'm gonna use my move on Chuck Wendig, Child Porn Upload.

1112
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,220
[Chuckling]

1113
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,460
Okay. Yeah.

1114
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,020
Uh, yeah, describe Child Porn Upload. What does it do?

1115
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:46,020
So child porn upload is I, well I suppose first I have to download it myself, a cache of child

1116
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,020
porn.

1117
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,340
Right, it's cached, you're not looking at it.

1118
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,340
Yeah, exactly.

1119
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:57,460
I don't look at it, I close my computer eyes and then I directly send it via DDoS attack

1120
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,100
to Chuck Wendig.

1121
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:08,060
And the point is that in this future reality, I suppose that the cops have sort of a, the

1122
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:14,200
security state has increased to the point where they immediately know that

1123
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,480
somebody has child porn. It is the only good thing to come out of this world.

1124
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:27,840
Yeah, sort of, yeah, it's like Ron Paul's worst nightmare. Yeah, okay, so roll a d20.

1125
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:37,560
Okay, yeah, plus the smoke gas modifier. Plus sleight of hand, ten. Okay, let's see

1126
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:45,900
he notices he does not okay yeah he just does it his brain that's here's the

1127
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:53,780
reason here's the reason it's so normal for that's why he doesn't notice it's

1128
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:57,800
absolutely just every day he just had a he had a pedophilic thought and it was

1129
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:07,320
nothing to him it was like imagining lunch okay yeah so you upload child porn

1130
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:21,840
directly into Chuck Wendig in this fantasy realm and of course in a

1131
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:33,200
fantasy realm yeah and he says what the funky what the fuck and the there is you

1132
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:38,160
hear sirens the cops are gonna be there in a minute we have one minute he

1133
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:49,460
freaks out he unhinges his jaw even wider he swallows mr. bean whole to turn

1134
01:09:49,460 --> 01:10:02,280
into his final form holy crap which is none other than choking on mr. bean and

1135
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:14,400
dying on the spot he just lays dead on the ground yeah you guys beat Chuck Wendig

1136
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:21,540
the child porn trump card really really I saved it for right at the end I knew I

1137
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:26,740
had it in my arsenal yeah I made sure to pull it right at the right moment so the

1138
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:33,340
The glass behind you sort of opens up, giving you full access to the TI-83 with GAMS.

1139
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:38,640
That is the world's biggest computer, where all the information in the world is stored.

1140
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,140
Where the Kramer video is stored.

1141
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:46,380
Where you can finally destroy the Kramer video.

1142
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,140
And also do whatever else you want to do.

1143
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,140
It's the world's biggest computer.

1144
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:54,380
You guys have intimidated the nerds, they've run away.

1145
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,060
The cops will still be here in a minute.

1146
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,780
But so you have a minute to delete the video.

1147
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,380
And then you have to find a way out.

1148
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:06,180
I will say that it is in a room that is just like a glass room

1149
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:11,940
overlooking the entire city at the top of the social giant

1150
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,020
social media manager robots head.

1151
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:19,260
So you guys have a minute.

1152
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,220
What do you guys want to do?

1153
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:26,840
Okay, before we go on, I have to point out, somehow, during this whole thing, I don't know when this happened,

1154
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,840
I started bleeding on my hand.

1155
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,840
*laughter*

1156
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,840
I have no idea when this happened.

1157
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
Oh my god, dude, what the fuck?

1158
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,840
Wait.

1159
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,840
I have no clue.

1160
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,840
I don't know what I did.

1161
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:46,840
But somehow, during, while we were, at some point, when my HP went to 1,

1162
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,840
Dude.

1163
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:54,960
in real life. Dude you're in the fucking game dude. Oh my god. The game is real. Okay with that said I

1164
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:01,320
start eating the computer's pussy. Yeah okay. If it has gams it has something in between and I just

1165
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:06,080
start going to town on the bitch. You're right yeah you start eating and the computer can sense and

1166
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:12,200
you start eating the computer's pussy. Computer loves it. Computer's enjoying it very much. While

1167
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,840
- While he's doing that, at the exact same time,

1168
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,580
I open up Internet Explorer 5000,

1169
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:22,200
and I navigate to bloatospiss.com,

1170
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:27,300
and I open up my profile, and I see that it has 99 likes,

1171
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,600
and I click on, from the world's biggest computer,

1172
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,220
I click on the like button,

1173
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:35,500
and it upgrades my website to the next level.

1174
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,120
- Yeah, you get 100 likes in your profile,

1175
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,300
and when everyone sees the world's biggest computer

1176
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:46,660

1177
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:54,480

1178
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:00,220
very popular because of the law it has to be so people are losing their minds

1179
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:05,440
they love your profile this is huge for you it's really hard for me to I miss

1180
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,380
clicking the like button several times because the computer is quaking from Ray

1181
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:14,300
William Johnson down below. Right yeah yeah so you hit comment a few times you

1182
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,940
accidentally hit like you actually like right like like like gibberish but those

1183
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:24,020
likes those comments get like a thousand likes immediately. Right yeah which I mean a

1184
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:31,340
comment like is worth half of a like. Right a thousand words. That's right a

1185
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:37,100
comment's worth a thousand words. While all this is happening I go into the

1186
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:51,280
computer. How so? Describe this. I go inside the computer. Okay. And I have a SD card with me.

1187
01:13:51,280 --> 01:14:01,700
God damn. And I create a backup of the Kramer video. Wow. I delete it from the computer. Okay.

1188
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:06,920
I want you to roll a stealth check to see if these two notice. Okay. That you have a

1189
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:17,060
backup of the Kramer video. Or if it's your little secret. I got a one. You go

1190
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:20,220
into the back of the computer and you accidentally lean on what looks like a

1191
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:25,140
megaphone like speaker and you start muttering a "Gee I hope my friends don't

1192
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:30,820
notice that I downloaded a backup of the Kramer video." So they just hear that. But

1193
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:34,580
But you have a backup, you deleted the main Kramer video.

1194
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,780
Is there anything you wanted to do

1195
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:39,380
with the computer, Ray William Johnson?

1196
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,800
- Yeah, so I go in to the computer

1197
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,540
and I delete the Third Amendment.

1198
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:49,180
- Yeah, you go in, after the computer comes

1199
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,720
and that same pasta sauce comes out,

1200
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,660
you delete the Third Amendment.

1201
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:57,500
- Yeah, which is no, and I know it by heart

1202
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,340
because I'm so anti it.

1203
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:04,820
No soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house

1204
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:07,620
without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war,

1205
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:11,140
but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

1206
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:15,340
- Yeah, you're flashing back to memories of soldiers.

1207
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,180
- Somebody drawing and quartering a soldier in my house

1208
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:23,420
during a time of peace and I'm not having that bullshit.

1209
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:27,820
- Yeah, you were just like a simple alienware laptop

1210
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:28,660
at that time.

1211
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:32,080
I was simply a raspberry pie at the time.

1212
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,800
You see your mom and dad Macintosh

1213
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,660
1984 cowering in fear as the soldier was quartered.

1214
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,220
And then I delete that shit.

1215
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:50,260
I delete that for some reason because I guess I liked when the soldier was quartered in my house.

1216
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,260
Now that I think about it.

1217
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,260
We sort of lost the plot.

1218
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:57,620
Yeah, I guess I thought that was really cool.

1219
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:04,620
And so I delete the amendment so that that can happen more often. Hopefully it happens to me again.

1220
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:11,620
Yeah, that's exactly... and hey, it just might. So, at this point now, you have 20 seconds left.

1221
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,620
I'm gonna charge my phone for 20 seconds.

1222
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:18,620
All the cops in the world are coming to what they think is arrest a now dead Chuck Wendig.

1223
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:25,620
But we'll eventually see you guys in the computer room interrupting OS Fogel update. What do you want to do?

1224
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,620
We gotta stop the update.

1225
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,620
We have to stop the update.

1226
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:33,620
I unplugged the computer while it's updating.

1227
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,620
Holy shit.

1228
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,620
We have to do more than that though.

1229
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,620
We have to do more than that. We have to stop the Fogel OS at the source.

1230
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:45,620
Yeah, but if we unplug it while it's updating...

1231
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,620
Won't it stop?

1232
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,620
Here's what I do.

1233
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:51,620
Oh my god, here's what I do.

1234
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,620
I open the CD drive.

1235
01:16:53,620 --> 01:17:03,620
I put my two pieces of bagel that I got from the authentic Gun City Bagel Depot.

1236
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,620
Yes.

1237
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,620
I throw it in the CD drive.

1238
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,620
I press the eject button that is now the enter button.

1239
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:11,620
Right, right.

1240
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:17,620
I send those bagels into that CD drive and I let that bitch try to read that shit because I got a feeling it's not going to do it.

1241
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:22,800
Yeah, so she tries because it is a girl and she tries to read it

1242
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,420
and

1243
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:32,200
What happens is is that the OS Fogo update you watch a download bar go down and it goes down and it looks like bite marks

1244
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,380
Like she's eating

1245
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:40,060
Like she's eating those bagels and you see the update stops

1246
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:47,220
You stop the update the cops are gonna be there in 10 seconds. Your only option probably is to jump out the window

1247
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:55,360
window okay I shoot myself in the head okay yeah you shoot yourself in the head

1248
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:02,460
and you die wait but but just the demon just the demon party yeah what I'm doing

1249
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:12,300

1254
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:42,960
Patrick Yoda found an elevator. He's just taking the elevator down.

1255
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,120
The freight elevator. Which was there, yeah the freight elevator. It's the only one that can hold him.

1256
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:56,760
As you two are following out the window, you see a familiar blue Grinch fly by.

1257
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:05,420
Oh my god. Where is he? This time he's wearing Master Chief armor. No. Dude, no.

1258
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,420

01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:56,980
death.

1282
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:57,980
