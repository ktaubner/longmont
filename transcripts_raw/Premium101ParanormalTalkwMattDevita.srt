36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,360
yeah yeah yeah I wouldn't want to catch his eye. No he'd chop you up in a bowl of

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,560
chili. Yeah he's a piece of crap. Make your parents eat you. Yeah that's so true.

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,760
Or make you eat your parents I think is what he did. Did he do that? In an episode yeah.

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,260
yeah

40
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,060

41
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,560
yeah, Scott Tenderman, remember?

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,060

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,560
it's gotta be illegal

49
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,060
um

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,560
thank you

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,060
yeah

52
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,060
the reason we wanted to talk to you is 'cause we, we have, we've gotten an itch for the paranormal as of late

53
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,060
no, why? I mean, just

54
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,560
it's, it's October

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,060
it is October, that's true

56
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,560
well, besides that though, was it before that?

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,560
I mean, I've always been super interested in that kind of stuff

58
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm big into, you know, the, the paranormal and conspiracy stuff, all that type of thing

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,060
sure

60
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,940
I'm very fascinated by that.

61
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,260
So I thought it would be very fun to talk to you and like, you know, you have like hands-on

62
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,140
experience with a lot of that stuff.

63
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Per se.

64
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,140
Per se?

65
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,140
So they say.

66
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,820
Do you like conspiracy stuff at all?

67
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,620
Or are you more just like ghosts or?

68
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,220
I dabble in a little bit of everything.

69
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:43,300
And I don't necessarily believe in all of it, but whether I believe it or not, I find

70
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,980
it, most of it, interesting.

71
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,900
Absolutely, right, especially if you are a critical thinker, you know, which which are my paranormal group is yeah, we are

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,740
What do they call it? We're capers soul seekers out of Wilmington, North Carolina. Cool. So what?

73
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:04,380
What what got you into that whole like line of work? I used to own a bar, you know

74
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,260
I've been in the music and film industry for over 35 years here in Wilmington, North Carolina home of Screen Gym Studios

75
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,540
Most people don't know that so that's where that studio is. Anyway, I got a plug them. But anyway, um

76
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:22,940
I used to own a bar, it was a legendary bar here on the East Coast called Bessie's.

77
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,140
It's called Orton's now. Actually I don't think it's open anymore.

78
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,540
Yeah, they closed it. It's very sad.

79
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
Yeah, it sucks. It was a great place.

80
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:39,540
And I kind of didn't really believe... a couple of these shows were coming out about the time I owned it.

81
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,140
this was, I don't know, 2000 early, you know, somewhere around in there. Like, Ghost Hunters

82
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,420
was big. Oh yeah, my mom was real big into that. That's about when they came out. Yeah.

83
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,820
And I was kind of like, whatever, you know, I didn't really, I thought they were kind of,

84
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,780
you know, BS-ish, I guess. Yeah. So, but then I bought Bessies and things happened

85
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:09,300
that I couldn't explain. Yeah. Like, I had, and I knew it's got a huge history of being haunted.

86
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,300
It's got a resident spirit. His name's William. And people have seen...

87
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
It has its own special spirit?

88
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Yeah. So, Bessie's used to be a hotel. It was a five-star hotel in like the early 1900s.

89
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,300
And it burned to the ground. And people died during the fire.

90
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
And one particular person named William.

91
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,300
There was a few others that supposedly and/or possibly died,

92
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,300
but they didn't have any identification.

93
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,580
William's the only one they can account for.

94
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,580
And he's, you know, many people believe he's there

95
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,260
and I've had multiple experiences when I was there that,

96
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,780
you know, and about the same time,

97
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,580
me and a friend of mine were kind of watching the shows

98
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,160
And then I sold Bessie's.

99
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,600
And after that, me and a friend of mine were hanging out.

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,840
And he said, "Didn't you have some experiences

101
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
"when you owned Bessie's?"

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,780
And I said, "Yeah."

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,540
He said, "Well, why don't we go in there

104
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,060
"and see if we can't poke around?"

105
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,900
- After you'd already sold it.

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,500
- After I sold it.

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,780
- So you kind of pawned to the ghost off on the next owner.

108
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,500
- I guess, but they knew going into it

109
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,560
that it had a history.

110
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,660
But so we were able to get in there as we weren't even we didn't even have a name.

111
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,500
We were just a couple dudes, you know, with some recorders and some cameras, you know,

112
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,620
and we had seen a couple of the shows and we didn't think, you know, I knew I had

113
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,140
experiences that I could explain, but I still wasn't completely convinced, you know,

114
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,820
until we did our thing.

115
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,820
Really? And we caught some what they call EVP, which is electronic voice phenomena,

116
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,420
which best way I can explain EVP is,

117
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,860
you know how a dog can hear a dog whistle,

118
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,820
but we can't, same thing, same concept,

119
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,940
just a different frequency.

120
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,780
Everything has a frequency, I'm sure you all,

121
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,780
you know, this mic has a frequency.

122
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,060
- So spirits communicate on a specific frequency?

123
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,020
- That certain electronics can pick up, but we can't hear.

124
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,420
- And it all has, according to paranormal enthusiasts,

125
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:37,660
and scientists, the electromagnetic field has a big to do with the paranormal world.

126
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:44,180
Some say it's a barrier between our world and the next.

127
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:53,660
When you pick up, when either you see a possible spirit or you pick up an EVP, you are, and

128
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,860
the field fluctuates all around the world.

129
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,380
You know, and it moves.

130
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,780
It's not stationary.

131
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,340
Like China, the big huge reactor that they just built.

132
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,740
Have you guys heard about this?

133
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,580
- No, I haven't heard of it.

134
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,400
- You need to look into it.

135
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,660
It's huge.

136
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,180
It's supposed to be hotter than the sun.

137
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,060
- Oh yeah, the artificial sun.

138
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,660
- Yes, the artificial sun.

139
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,500
- Okay, in China.

140
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,020
- So you know how they got that?

141
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,860
They tapped into the electromagnetic field for its power.

142
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,700
Now--

143
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,520
- Trouble.

144
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I mean, you know.

145
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm sorry, go ahead.

146
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Playing with ghost stuff in China?

147
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,520
To start a huge reactor. I mean, I'm telling you.

148
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,520
You think they're funneling souls into the...

149
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Hey, I didn't say that.

150
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Whoa, but you kind of did imply it, I would say.

151
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,520
But, you know, I mean, you know, it's interesting to...

152
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,520
You know, they're China, they're gonna, I guess, do whatever they want.

153
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,400
That's true. Very true. China doesn't give a f--

154
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,240
They don't give a-- they really don't.

155
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,760
Yeah, to back up, you said you had experiences you couldn't explain in Bessie's. What was the

156
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,000
first-- like what happened there? So I'm good. I'm good on time. I don't want to--

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,200
Oh, yeah. We're just chilling. There's no stress on time.

158
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,920
So my first night after I bought Bessie's, me and a friend of mine were checking inventory

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:23,480
or doing an inventory log and just I was counting all the you know liquor and beer and stuff and

160
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:32,760
and he was in the back um just doing inventory of of bar stools and this kind of stuff you know

161
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,840
yada yada yada so i'm sitting there behind the bar and i'm underneath count you know my inventory

162
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,600
sheet just also the jukebox comes on and it starts playing running with the devil

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:52,460
I'm not lying I'm not I'm telling I'm not yeah right it just came on Anna in the

164
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,600
middle or like the start it at the very beginning oh just came on popped on oh

165
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,600
like the oh man familiar with the song how does it go with the devil van Halen

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,760
- Yeah, but you know like the intro,

167
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,360
it has like that, like the, it's like the beats

168
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
and then it like gets into the guitar part.

169
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
- Yeah, so it's a ghostly song.

170
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
- I mean, it's not a song--

171
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,280
- It's called Running With The Devil.

172
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,560
- It's just the title, you know,

173
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,400
running with the devil.

174
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
- So it's like if a ghost was looking through a jukebox,

175
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
it might choose--

176
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,560
- It'd go on, bam, right.

177
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,600
- He'd say, hey, I'm gonna let you know I'm here

178
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,760
by selecting this song.

179
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,160
- It's like, well, I choose Jump Around.

180
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,640
I like jumping around.

181
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,760
- So it gets, jump around, that's good.

182
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,380
So it gets, so Sean comes around running around outside.

183
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,760
Did you turn, scared the shit out of him.

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
Did you turn, did you box off blah, blah, blah.

185
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,760
I'm like, I've been behind the bar.

186
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,200
I don't know how it happened, right?

187
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,880
So he was, I was just like, just let it roll.

188
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
We'll gotta keep working.

189
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
You know, it's probably just a fluke

190
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,760
or a credit that was on there.

191
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,480
And it was just probably a coincidence there.

192
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,200
Of course, I don't believe in coincidences either,

193
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,680
but that's what I told him.

194
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,540
So we kept working. The next song that came on, another song came on and it was

195
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,500
Hell's Bells by AC/DC. I'm not making this up.

196
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Something's fishy.

197
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Something's going on.

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,620
So it's Hell's Bells, Sean comes running back on and he's like, "If it plays one more

199
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,500
fucked-up song, dude, I am out of here."

200
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Right? That's the quote. That's what he said.

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
And then, happy birthday.

202
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,340
you know? So I said, "Man, we got to get this done. Let's just hang tight."

204
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:46,100
Because he knew Bessie's was haunted. He did not want to be in there.

205
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,560
He was a downtowner. He knew all the stories before we had

206
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,860
bought it, or before I bought it. So when they sold you the place, I'm

207
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,180
curious about this, when they sold you the place, did they like tell you anything

208
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,580
thing about that where they like oh yeah oh here's the kitchen here's the bar

209
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,660
there's Williams over there. That's the thing when someone sells you something

210
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,180
that's haunted they love to tell you about it like I don't know if it's the same.

211
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,160
Was it one eyed GMC who sold it to you? No. I bought it from a couple named John and Laurie Butler they

212
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,220
were big into the Wilmington music scene and film scene and and I'd also used to

213
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,260
I used to have you know DaVita Studios that were the band DaVita rehearsal

214
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,240
studios back then where all the bands practice so which is pyramid studios now

215
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,920
but anyway so I got I got a calm down and I got him to go back you know to work

216
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,420
and the last song one more song came on I guess it had three credits on there I'm

217
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,080
guessing but because it didn't play anymore after that but it was a it's the

218
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,180
end of the world as we know it. Oh my god. I will say. If that's not a sign. Hilarious

219
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,220
bookend. Yeah yeah I mean those were the three songs. To go from Running with the Devil to

220
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,940
It's the End of the World. That's right. You know the ghost is like kind of losing

221
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,900
the thread at the end. He's like hell hell end of the I don't know hanging out

222
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,460
at the end of the world. I'm still not getting their attention damn it. Yeah.

223
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,800
Singing so fast they got to pay attention to that. Yeah. So did you let

224
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,800
the songs. Did you let them play or did you turn them off? Well this was the

225
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,080
where the plot thickened. So Sean and I were standing in the middle of the bar,

226
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,600
I mean middle of the bar basically. And Sean looked at me and said,

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:47,200
"I wonder if it's plugged in." Oh man, no way. That's what he said. I was like, "You son of a bitch, you had to go there, didn't you?"

228
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:55,200
And so we walked over, we walked over like, you know, like we were watching a scary movie, you know.

229
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Like Scooby-Doo.

230
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:06,200
And it was kind of comical to see, you know, grown men walking over to this jukebox, you know.

231
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Anyway, so we get there and we kind of argued about who's going to look first.

232
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:20,480
He's like, "You're the owner, you look!" So I got looked around and sure enough it was

233
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,280
plugged in. Oh, okay. It was plugged in. I just want to sweat off my brow. But still, that was like the first

234
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,720
of many weird, you know, I left one night. We always used, there was a

235
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,640
bell that they had mounted, and as tradition you were always supposed to

236
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,720
tell William goodnight and ring the bell. Really? Last one to leave. Wow. And if he

237
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,140
didn't he'd let you know and I forgot to ring the bell one night and I'm locking

238
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,720
the door and as I'm start- it was downstairs it's a downstairs bar. Yeah

239
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,800
it's like a basement. And it's got a lot of- Oh is that the one by the parking garage that we

240
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,120
walked by? No no it's the one that I pointed out and I was like this is a

241
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,120
pool is a great pool hall. William Mosconi set a world record there.

242
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,120
And Tom Berringer used to own Longstreet's which I have Bessie's and Longstreet's. I own both

243
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,520
but but as I'm walking out of the Bessie's side I turn around start going

244
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,560
upstairs all of a sudden jiggle jiggle jiggle somebody was jiggling on the door.

245
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,360
Wow yeah. So would you say that William was or he's

246
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,560
probably still there yeah. You know it's tough to say because in my personal

247
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,740
experience over doing this for over 15 years now and I've been almost everywhere

248
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,120
on the you know from like North Carolina down to Florida you know some spirits

249
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,340
move on yeah you know I don't know that all of them do but at some point. Do you

250
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:56,500
have any any theories as to why? Possibly they have done what they needed to do

251
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,140
yeah you know and William needed to play music and jiggle doors. He finally found the song he wanted.

252
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,660
Well he did a lot more than that. I mean people have seen him, people have spoken to him.

253
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:16,020
Damn. Yeah, like you've been in Bessie's. You know that the back door part of Bessie's

254
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,860
uh-huh back with it turns back into the brick little patio thing yeah yeah

255
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,220
they've seen him there was a girl one night out on a patio part back there by

256
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:32,260
the back door someone saw this girl talking to nothing whoa all right and

257
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,500
we thought she was having an episode or something and she turned around said

258
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,700
what's wrong he's like you tell me and she said who he what were you doing is

259
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,580
like I was talking to this guy and she described he's like no he didn't see

260
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,300
anybody was he what did she describe him as like he's wearing like weird leather

261
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,340
clothes and shit that time that out yeah those time yeah she thought it was a

262
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,900
little odd he was wearing clothes that were from the 19 yeah yeah but Wow yeah

263
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,540
so she saw full apparition right yeah you ever seen a full one a couple of

264
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,380
times really really whoa what's the scariest one I want to yeah my home when

265
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,580
I lived in a Vassa really my house and yeah so years ago we did an

266
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,440
investigation with Port City paranormal which are good friends of ours on the

267
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,060
battleship and the battleship for people don't know is an old it's a battleship

268
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,260
battleship docked in North Carolina and Wilmington and very haunted yeah super

269
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,420
mega that makes sense yeah yeah I feel like that's probably one of the number

270
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,540
one places to be haunted right battleships yeah anything with that kind

271
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:46,620
of talked about terrible tour you know it could could possibly horrible endings

272
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,820
could possibly you know yeah yeah yeah have some sort of energy you know

273
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:59,040
residing in in yeah and or where it used to be so yeah but uh and I that's just a

274
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,740
word to the to the wise to people interested in this stuff careful what

275
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,780
you wish for. You know, the TV, things I don't like about the TV shows, I'll tell

276
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:15,020
the battleship real quick, but I just, I'm leading in, you know, the, what

277
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,220
they don't talk to you about enough in my opinion on these shows is, you know, this

278
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,660
this stuff is real, okay? I mean, it's, careful what you go looking for. You

279
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,780
might not like what you, and you might not be able to get rid of what you find.

280
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:35,260
Yeah. So in other words I'm a big, you know, I preach on spirit attachment all

281
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,540
the time and that's why, you know, people say "I want to go ghost hunt with you"

282
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,140
and I hate the term ghost hunters too by the way. We're not

283
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,660
hunters. I don't have proton packs. Spiritician? We're paranormal

284
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,900
investigators. We're just paranormal investigators. Investigator sounds a lot

285
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,900
less bad than Hunter. Yeah, well you're walking around like Elmer Fudd. Yeah, I mean, you know, we're just...

286
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Looking for a ghost. Yeah, it just... the shows have done some good things for paranormal investigators,

287
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,900
but also have done, you know, it's like a double-edged sword kind of.

288
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Do you, are you... what's your opinion on Zach Bagans?

289
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,660
I better be careful because I have a lot of followers. That's true.

290
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,740
I guess we all know each other. I mean, I've been in this for a long time and I don't want to...

291
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,700
Right. Well, yeah, we don't have to get you in trouble. Yeah, we don't. Yeah, don't worry. Yeah,

292
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:43,300
I appreciate that. Let's hear the battleship story. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Off, off. I'll tell you later.

293
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
Okay, I'm excited to hear that.

294
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Sorry y'all, sorry for the disappointing, but I know too many people in this field and I can't publicly, you know, I just don't feel like going there.

295
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,300
But, and y'all know, I'm not, it's cool, you know.

296
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,300
That's a whole different, that's a whole different segment.

297
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:12,260
But we don't operate that way. How about that? We don't operate anywhere close to

298
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,940
how he does. Our group is. Sure, yeah. And each to their own. Each to their own when it

299
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,300
comes to that. But we're not at all about that type of approach.

300
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:31,100
Yeah. How about that? That sounds right. Yeah, middle of the road. Thank you. Perfect. Well done. Thank you. I had to think about that for a minute.

301
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:39,460
But I had a one of the I personally feel one of the soldiers from the

302
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,780
battleship attached itself to me after our investigation. Really? And followed me

303
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:50,900
home. To Nevada. One morning I'm laying in bed it's about I don't know 630 in the

304
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,820
morning right when the sunrise was coming up and I'm on the side of my bed in my

305
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:03,380
room and I look up and I'm awake you know and there's a figure standing right next

306
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:12,300
to my bed. Oh man. He was dressed in the white tees and blue you know. Yeah.

307
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:20,780
Yeah blonde hair. Blonde? And he was kind of kind of there but kind of not. Mm-hmm.

308
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,820
Yeah. And I just, I had, the only thing I could think about, I wasn't scared really.

309
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,380
It's kind of funny because the only thing I could think about was, I stayed still,

310
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,820
you know, and he was just kind of there over, you know, just kind of like, "Hey."

311
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,700
Yeah. Right? I mean, it wasn't scary. He wasn't like,

312
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,700
you know, any of that, you know, it was just like, it was just kind of

313
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,060
looking out yeah chilling right and I'm sitting there going I wish he would leave

314
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:59,420
cuz I got to be so bad yeah real paranormal so it was clear that it was

315
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,620
not a real man that you were like what the fuck you doing my house bro no no no

316
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,620
it was not like that because it was not a it was not solid yeah yeah it was

317
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:16,580
there and I've seen anything from anomalies to shadow spirits to you know

318
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,740
partial apparitions to full full-blown apparitions. Would you make a distinction

319
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:28,980
between ghosts and demons? It's really difficult because demons from what the

320
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:35,860
knowledge of I have of them can present themselves to you in any form. So yeah

321
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,780
It's very difficult for me to go, "That's a demon and that's not."

322
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,940
Plus, demons are notoriously tricky.

323
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
Absolutely.

324
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Absolutely.

325
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,700
And do I feel I've ever come across one?

326
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Quite possibly.

327
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Yeah, right.

328
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,860
I can answer that as well.

329
00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:02,020
Most of the time, typically, and I don't even know if it's necessarily a demon as we know

330
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,180
what a demon is.

331
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:10,600
usually if you come across what we call a foul spirit you know there's usually a

332
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:17,740
distinct smell. Is it sulfur? Yes absolutely it's it's like raw eggs yeah

333
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,540
it's sulfur mix right and and that's usually when we have bad shit happen

334
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,620
yeah yeah I mean I mean not the fun you know. Have you ever heard of someone

335
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,660
getting like actually hurt? Me. Really? You got hurt? I've got pushed more than once.

336
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,100
Really? Oh yeah. What's the worst you've been hurt? I got pushed pretty good at

337
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,900
the Rusty Nail. Oh yeah? Yeah. You're not going there tonight. There was a great place.

338
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,340
It's my favorite place. It's one of my favorite places. I didn't realize it was haunted. We played there about a month ago.

339
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,660
Wait a minute. No, it's been longer than that now. July. End of July. But it's haunted?

340
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Barry. Really? With an aggressive ghost? Well... Tough to say. Again I'm gonna stay diplomatic on that.

341
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:24,820
my first rodeo there was a murder there in the 70s and in the ironic to the

342
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:33,140
wrong place called the rusty nail by a rusty nail right that would be you know

343
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,460
know. Pretty funny. Yeah, that happened to me and I was the ghost, I just want to tell

344
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,460
people. Yeah. You know, it's named after me. That's right. Isn't that crazy? I died here.

345
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:52,260
It was the nail. It was called the rusty nail and I died from a nail. Got shanked. But he,

346
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:59,700
I got pushed where the guy died. Whoa. Right where in front of the bar. So you've been

347
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,280
Yeah, yeah, of course. You know the little partition is to deal with behind the bar. Yeah.

348
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,080
You know like if you're facing that to the right, a couple of barsicles down.

349
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,440
And I was right there and I got pushed into that pole.

350
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,100
Damn. Yeah, like I'm talking like... Like shoulder check. Yeah, yeah.

351
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,680
Or you know how you're in a club and boom, somebody just... Yeah. It was like that.

352
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,940
But there's, you know...

353
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,340
Why do you think he pushed you did you like see a mugshot I gotta kill them? No just because we were there

354
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,660
He might not have been pissed. He might have just been I might have just been his in his way

355
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:42,260
Yeah, it might not have been out of aggression necessarily was he was that a sulfur smeller? No, no

356
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,660
No, I don't think that's that kind of out of

357
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,740
Experiences we've had there. We've been there up to three times

358
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,980
There's some places. I can't tell what we've gone. Yeah publicly confidentiality

359
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,260
People probably aren't too keen on telling the world that their restaurant is haunted.

360
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,260
We've done fire departments, we've done hospitals, or what used to be hospitals.

361
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,260
Wow, yeah.

362
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,260
So, because of our reputation. And us, and Port City's Paranormal is the same way.

363
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,260
So they hire you and they keep it a secret?

364
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Yeah, we can't, you know, yeah.

365
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,260
Wow.

366
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
They make you sign stuff, or no?

367
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,260
We just, you know, we got a good rep.

368
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Yeah, of course, don't fuck it up.

369
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Yeah, that's where we are, you know.

370
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,260
So we, you know, and that's why people keep calling either us or them, you know.

371
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:33,260
How often does somebody ask you to come out because they think that something's going on and it's just a whole lot of nothing?

372
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Most of the time.

373
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Really?

374
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
It's not like the TV shows.

375
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Yeah.

376
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,260
90% of the time it's nothing.

377
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Yeah.

378
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,260
But I say nothing.

379
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,260
It's all in how you look at it or perspective.

380
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:55,700
I've done this for so long that to me meeting the people I meet, finding out history that's

381
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:02,560
not in the books of hand-me-down stories, you know, where I'm at in my age in life,

382
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,720
to me that's all part of helping people whether we find something or not.

383
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,540
It's all part of it.

384
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,680
my opinion you know if you're if you're in it just to get scared or find a ghost

385
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,700
per se you're you're missing the bigger picture. Your hearts not in the right place. You're missing the bigger

386
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,480
picture. Are there people who are paranormal investigators who they want to get

387
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,820
scared? Of course there are. Really? They think it's like a haunted house? Look at Zach.

388
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Oh he slipped in. I'm gonna cut him off again.

389
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
That's as far as I'm gonna go with that.

390
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,820
He's blown over dude.

391
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,900
People who are just like out there, they prank the ghosts until they scream at them.

392
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Thrill jockeys.

393
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
Or just, yeah, thrill seekers.

394
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,900
That's a good word.

395
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Thrill seekers, thrill jockeys.

396
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:53,140
You know, and they're missing, a lot of them maybe or could possibly miss the whole bigger

397
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,900
picture of history.

398
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,700
The connection you're making with people.

399
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,420
You know, the peace of mind you could possibly be giving someone if it's not haunted, you

400
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,140
know, so they could sleep better at night.

401
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,140
Those kind of things.

402
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:12,540
you say is the most common sign that there's some kind of paranormal activity?

403
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,860
Is it the... talk to me about spirit orbs. Is that a real thing? I'm not a big fan of orbs.

404
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:24,660
Yeah. Now I believe... Can I quote you on that? Yeah. I'm just... I'm not... I personally am not a big

405
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,460
fan of orbs. Right, yeah. No, but there is a difference between an orb and what they

406
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,700
call an anomaly. Yeah. Similar in shape, but nine times out of ten when you see an

407
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:42,980
It's dust. Yeah, it really is. Absolutely, yeah. I agree. But an anomaly, I saw one on the

408
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,340
battleship. Mm-hmm. It was about three inches by three inches in diameter and

409
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,820
it was, I thought it was a reflection because it was in a mirror. I thought it

410
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,860
was a reflection off my IR light from my camera when I walked in. I turned the light on

411
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,300
because I was like, I gotta find out what this is. So I turned the light on and it's

412
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:11,380
still in the mirror just kind of waffle right and I'm like what the fuck is that

413
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:17,480
allows yeah okay yeah yeah you can curse cool I say pretty much anything all

414
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,980
right pretty much anything I just said

415
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,580
And then it was almost like it knew I was in there.

416
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,060
Right?

417
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,540
'Cause about, as I started to kind of,

418
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,260
curiosity kills the cat, you know,

419
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,680
I started walking to it, it jumped out of the mirror,

420
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,000
still on the wall, didn't come out at me,

421
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,980
but just, it was weird.

422
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,180
And then it just, and it shot,

423
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,020
and just kind of, not like, not like Ghostbusters.

424
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,860
- Yeah.

425
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,900
- But it just, like before, it almost looked like

426
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,620
it just, you know, as it was going towards the next wall, it looked like it dissipated

427
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,900
before it got to the wall.

428
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Yeah.

429
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
No sliming, though?

430
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
No, nothing like that.

431
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,220
It was, it was, and it was fast.

432
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,660
It was super fast.

433
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,820
Have you ever seen slime?

434
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Any ectoplasm?

435
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,460
No, but, you know, they say, I've run into spider webs, but never found any spider webs.

436
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Okay.

437
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,900
So, that's what, in the paranormal field, to my knowledge, if you ever have that feeling

438
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Like a sticky slime or something?

439
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Yeah, like there's some spider webs or something.

440
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Spirit slime going all over you.

441
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
But it's not, you don't have anything.

442
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Yeah, but you feel like you're just completely covered in it.

443
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Yeah, but there's nothing really there.

444
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Just getting globbed all over.

445
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,900
But more just, it's more like running into a spider, like a spider web.

446
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,900
Really, that's the feeling.

447
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Yeah, but there's no webbing.

448
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Not like someone pouring like Nickelodeon slime.

449
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,900
No, not, I mean, I'm not saying that there's not.

450
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Just my experience.

451
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,360
And I've been doing this over 15 years now.

452
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,020
So we've been at it a lot.

453
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,420
My team's kind of spread out.

454
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,260
We got about eight or 10 members.

455
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,080
- How big is your team?

456
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,160
- About 10 members strong.

457
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,140
- Okay.

458
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,580
- But only about three active.

459
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,580
COVID, you know, changed a lot of our, you know, approaches.

460
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,100
- Doing less investigations now?

461
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,380
- Yeah, and not necessarily less investigations,

462
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,260
but with less people, including wherever we go, you know.

463
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,340
And we try to, like, you know,

464
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,780
how far you and I are together,

465
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,780
six, eight feet. Like if my team goes somewhere, usually it's just two or three of us now.

466
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,780
And we stay at least eight feet apart.

467
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Do you ever get called out to investigate anything like

468
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,780
physical, like any cryptid stuff, or like aliens?

469
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,780
I'm a UFOlogist. I can't even say it. A UFOlogist as well.

470
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Oh really? You consider yourself one?

471
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,780
Is that a more recent thing? About three or four years. But the group I work with out of Southport

472
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:57,780
that's also on the Cape for Soul Seekers, we do UFO investigations too.

473
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,940
Really? So what do those look like? Somebody tells you that they like see a

474
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,980
UFO in an area and you camp out? Same thing, same kind of thing. They call,

475
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,460
they, this group I work with been doing it for a while and they get a call and

476
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,220
ask me if I want to go. We'll pack up. Usually it's just a, you're looking at

477
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,380
stars all night, hanging out. Yeah. What do you think as a UFOlogist of the,

478
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:24,060
there was all that like declassified info yeah I was highly disappointed yeah I

479
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:29,960
was too I was so late I really thought yeah that this was gonna be you know had

480
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,980
over 200 some odd pages and they only released like what yeah it was nothing

481
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,980
nine yeah and it basically says like we have seen things in the sky that we

482
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:47,100
don't know what they are they they claim to have equipment they mean Pentagon you

483
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:55,040
know that is off world that their quotes not of this world mm-hmm in our

484
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,060
possessions what more do you want yeah you know what I mean I mean what what

485
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:06,700
yeah you know I mean and and and the Navy just released a bunch of stuff yeah you

486
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:13,740
know yeah and and and and has publicly stated that that you know they don't

487
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,540
know what it was they were chasing you know what's your what's your your

488
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,080
version of aliens like what would you anything that Hollywood has ever

489
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,300
produced no yeah I believe in the greys or like green well maybe if anything I

490
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,620
would lean towards great the greys you know the aliens supposedly there's about

491
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,020
six or seven maybe even more different type of species sure typically the

492
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:45,940
According to my intel, the graves are more of the scientific ones.

493
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,140
They're here to just observe.

494
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,380
Those are the kidnappers who fucking put stuff in here?

495
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Lights are flickering.

496
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,380
Yeah.

497
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Oh my God.

498
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,380
Look at the studio.

499
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Oh God.

500
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
Oh wow.

501
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
They are.

502
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,380
Oh man.

503
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,380
That's pretty cool.

504
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
They know we're here.

505
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
They heard you talking.

506
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,340
Have you ever had any spiritual thing here?

507
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,580
Yeah, I stage a studio about

508
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,020
twice a quarter.

509
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,140
Really? About every three months I stage it.

510
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,020
How far out are we from the last stage?

511
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:22,020
Well, let's see how much more the lights flicker, that'll tell us.

512
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:28,180
But you know, we're also in a storage facility, so it's not necessarily the best.

513
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,500
Yeah.

514
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,180
So for what it is I've made it, you know, yeah, have you seen a bunch of UFOs?

515
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,340
Look, let's not forget UFO means unidentified flight logic, right?

516
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,980
Have you seen anything that you think is like alien origin?

517
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,380
Absolutely, but a lot of people forget this. Yeah, they get wrapped up in the moment,

518
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:53,540
right? Yeah. And a UFO doesn't mean it's an alien ship, right? It's just something you don't know

519
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,140
what it is. We don't know what it is. We can't figure out what you know, they get so excited.

520
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,360
the same thing with spirits and you know 90% of the stuff we we do we deep we

521
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,840
debunk you know we're big on on a scientific approach about everything you

522
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,960
know very similar to taps you know ghost hunter folks you know we operate very

523
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,360
similar to them as far as trying to disprove stuff you know and but but I

524
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,840
have seen some things in my last one I did was probably about a year ago but we

525
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:30,120
called sky watches. We were down at the north, south end of Oak Island and just

526
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:36,140
sure enough these weird orb things it was a kind of a cloudy night. It looked

527
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,760
kind of looked like a drone. I thought it was a drone. But drones don't just, same

528
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,040
thing with the, like the anomaly. It just, it just disappeared. It was there and then it wasn't.

529
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,280
It was there and then it wasn't. Yeah. You know and I've seen those a couple of

530
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
times.

531
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Sure.

532
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,000
So you've seen the same type of UFO multiple times would you say?

533
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes.

534
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I have.

535
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Now there's different types.

536
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,040
Now the group I go with, they've seen different types.

537
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,720
The one they see the most is either the spherical one or the triangle one.

538
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,720
There's a triangle shaped that appears down in the...

539
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,760
I don't know if you know this but Southport...

540
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,320
I don't even know if I should say this live.

541
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Or I mean on recording.

542
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,160
We can cut it out if you decide you don't want to.

543
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,000
Southport has a reason, if I'm not going to, we're good, I'm not going to say exactly,

544
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,760
I'll bounce around it, but there's a reason, in my opinion, there's a huge reason for,

545
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:44,680
I'll just say a huge reason military-wise, for that type of activity to be there,

546
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,960
you know i mean the interest

547
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
if i was an alien

548
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,360
uh... right now i want to check it out pretty regularly yeah so that makes and

549
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,680
the zoo to approach that uh... as well as an alien and look up southport

550
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,760
military

551
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,920
you'll sure i'll tell you all later yeah yeah yeah yeah i was listening to military

552
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,320
if you had to break your guess what's in area fifty one

553
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
hunting area fifty one the distraction

554
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,600
really my think everything's in a result of the two or fifty three really moving

555
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,160
they just win one up? Yeah, oh yeah. Not only that, there's miles and miles and

556
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,040
miles of tunnels all around that place and I think if there's anything that

557
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:29,280
is really there, it's gonna be in those tunnels. Yeah. So a friend of mine, I

558
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,480
can't mention his name, but one of my best friends, his grandfather or great

559
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,120
grandfather, grandfather, was at the area, was at the Roswell crash site. Wow.

560
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,820
- Oh wow, that's tight.

561
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,680
- He can't say anything, he's never been able to say

562
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,640
other than, and my friend, he never said anything,

563
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,120
you see my quotations, but he could tell by his mannerisms

564
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,160
when they were talking about it that--

565
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,880
- There's, yeah, something was up.

566
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,360
- Yeah, something was there.

567
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,600
Material that, a material that they--

568
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,720
- He's talking to his grandpa, his grandpa.

569
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,680
I didn't see anything there.

570
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,160
- Except for alien.

571
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,480
(laughing)

572
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,320
Or dry and early.

573
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:15,640
I mean, there's just all kinds of, there's, you know, to say that we're alone in this multiverse

574
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,240
or whatever you want to, you know, with infinite, infinite, infinite systems, you know, an alien

575
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,720
could be, I was just talking about this to somebody a couple days ago, you know, and

576
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,160
when I was doing the Cape for Soul Seekers show, we talked about this a lot, you know,

577
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,160
And we, you know, if it's a microscopic organism.

578
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,820
True, yeah, yeah, yeah.

579
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,360
That's an alien, you know, by default.

580
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
You know.

581
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,760
Yeah, don't really think about that too much.

582
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
You're not alone.

583
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,220
A lot of people don't.

584
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,080
We brought stuff like that up on the show.

585
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Most of our followers, you know, new people would be like, "Holy cow, I never thought

586
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
of that."

587
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Yeah.

588
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,440
Because you're brainwashed by Hollywood to think otherwise, you know.

589
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,240
Yeah, like Mars attacks and all that.

590
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Yeah, which is a hilarious movie.

591
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Oh yeah, it's great.

592
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:10,760
Paul, you seen that one? The alien smokes weed. Yeah, I gotta watch that.

593
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,160
They do that in real life. Where is it at? Where can I watch it?

594
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,840
You know, is it on DVD? I saw it on DVD. Yeah, it's a good place to watch it.

595
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,320
Yeah, strong DVD release. I'll check it out.

596
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,400
Probably on Amazon I guess. Yeah, something like that. I'm curious, you should

597
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,240
- What are you guys discussing about?

598
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,080
- Yeah, I was gonna, yeah.

599
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,900
- Your favorite.

600
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,360
- What do you think, I wanna hear what,

601
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,040
your take on Nibiru, on Planet X.

602
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,640
- Whew, man, y'all are getting in deep, aren't ya?

603
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,500
- Dude, this guy's got the heaters.

604
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,680
This is why I wanted to link you two.

605
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,400
- Do you know the guy about the Venus guy too, by the way?

606
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,240
- The Venus guy?

607
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,080
I don't know.

608
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,880
- I can't remember the guy's name right off the top of my head.

609
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,080
This supposedly happened, the guy came,

610
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,400
said he was from Venus, came down.

611
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,240
- What?

612
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,540
- He was gonna give us all the technology.

613
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,460
- Oh, maybe.

614
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,280
- Look at, look at, look at, I can't,

615
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,700
- Was his name Billy something?

616
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,840
- I'm sure some of your followers will probably know it.

617
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,680
- Sure.

618
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,040
- There was a guy from Venus named Billy?

619
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,920
- There was, no, the Billy guy's different.

620
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,760
That was a different, that guy was--

621
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,560
- I cannot remember the guy's name.

622
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,080
- That was a guy, I forget what the whole thing was,

623
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,880
but that was a guy who, he said he was a space prophet

624
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,920
and he said that a virus was coming called the wolf

625
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,360
that was going to destroy Earth's population.

626
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,680
And a virus did come.

627
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,500
- Well this--

628
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,120
- And he's called the wolf 19.

629
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,280
Yeah, well, and a lot of other kind of variations.

630
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,280
But this guy was supposed to give all of his technology

631
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,640
and our government just turned him away or something.

632
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,440
Or no, I think they were gonna help each other out,

633
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,740
but they got all the information and then made him leave.

634
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,380
Or something, you know, but none of that would surprise me.

635
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,160
But Nubaru or Planet X,

636
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Planet X is one of my favorite bands.

637
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:03,160
But, um, uh, you know, people have claimed to see it.

638
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
You know?

639
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
The planet itself?

640
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Yeah.

641
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Um, I, I, I'm not opposed to the idea of it.

642
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Right.

643
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Because we don't understand dimensions.

644
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,160
Or we, some of us understand them more than others, how dimensions work.

645
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
You know?

646
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Um, it could be any number of things.

647
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,360
things. It could be not a space station but of space station origin, you know, like

648
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:34,080
like and it could be able to jump in and out of dimensions if it exists. But I am

649
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:41,160
open to the possibilities of it. Right. You know. Yeah and like have you you like

650
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:48,160
what about like Nephilim kind of stuff like ancient aliens, angel, angel hybrid.

651
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,860
- Is it the Anunnaki's?

652
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,900
- Yeah, Anunnaki, yeah.

653
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,260
- So, I don't wanna get in trouble.

654
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,380
- Okay, well, yeah, we don't wanna get you in trouble.

655
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,460
- But I'm gonna try to say it.

656
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,180
- Is, in trouble with who, the Anunnaki?

657
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,660
- Well, whoever might be, might hear this broadcast

658
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,180
because of everything else going on.

659
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,340
There are, I'm not gonna say it's me.

660
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,180
How about that?

661
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,000
- Sure.

662
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,420
- There are people that, 'cause this is a touchy subject.

663
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,260
- Okay, yeah.

664
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,940
- It's a touchy subject where I'm gonna,

665
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,920
and all the recent latest events

666
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,460
and you probably are

667
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,340
figure out what i'm talking about

668
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,580
you know

669
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,180
you know i a m

670
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,460
people for home listeners

671
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:38,300
the hell you know i think that a lot of the time you have a very good

672
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,660
uh... sure they're all used to it and maybe you guys could still could put it

673
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,540
in

674
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,420
sure it's later you know different yes but

675
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,700
believe this is all preparation

676
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,940
for the in a keys return

677
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,260
uh...

678
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,740
it has nothing to do with population

679
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,340
no no no no i don't i'm not saying this is my opinion but yes people are saying

680
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,780
i am saying in the paranormal world and in in in the alien world i have seen

681
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,940
this on website chatter

682
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,460
uh... maybe some kind of tool of control

683
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,540
the return of the uh... not right okay which is a very good like it could be

684
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,060
be like a categorization thing. Yes. Yeah like like you like putting a barcode.

685
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:27,700
Or maybe you have to have that whatever is in that to be able to be in the

686
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,820
presence of them. I mean for yeah you know any number of any number of reasons.

687
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,620
It could be a test, could be a categorization. It could give you superpowers on their planet.

688
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:44,620
who knows? Or be able to just carry on, you know, there could be voice translations in

689
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:50,820
that. Yeah. You know, because it's nanotechnology. Right? So, or what I'm told.

690
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,420
Well, does it depend on which one you got? What's that?

691
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,820
Does it depend on which one you got? I hope not.

692
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,900
Well, yeah, one of them, the Anunnaki see you and they're like, "This is my best friend.

693
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,580
If you got the other one, they'd kill you on sight."

694
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,420
- Yeah, right.

695
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,260
- You're screwed.

696
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,120
- One of them gets you pregnant.

697
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,960
- Yeah.

698
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,780
- I'd give you that one.

699
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,620
(laughing)

700
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,000
I mean, I don't know.

701
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I have no--

702
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,840
- Yeah, right.

703
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,660
- Who does, right?

704
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,500
- Nobody does.

705
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,340
- We're just open talking here.

706
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,160
- Exactly.

707
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,940
- And I have sources and some of these people

708
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,420
are firm believers in this.

709
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,260
- Yeah.

710
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,920
- Everything we've just mentioned, but you know,

711
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,540
I do feel that there is, going back to what we were talking

712
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,360
about earlier about Area 51 and stuff,

713
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:41,640
I do feel that there is technology that we have that's not of this world.

714
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
And I'm a firm believer.

715
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,760
Now, 51, again, I think it's just a...

716
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
It's so...

717
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
I think it's just a distraction.

718
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Really?

719
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,040
I mean, we all know where it is now.

720
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Are you serious?

721
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
Exactly.

722
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
It's the pop culture.

723
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Right.

724
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,240
Do I think that they probably do some sort of testing there?

725
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,000
Probably so, but not near as much as.

726
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,840
- Right.

727
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,480
- The only testing that they do there

728
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,400
is the stuff they want us to know about.

729
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,800
- Exactly. - That they think

730
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,720
we don't know about.

731
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,920
- It's like Count Dracula,

732
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,480
how he hides the existence of a real vampire.

733
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,320
- Yeah, yeah.

734
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,760
- It's more like a pop culture.

735
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,680
- Absolutely. - Yeah.

736
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,000
- Absolutely, same concept. - Exactly, yeah.

737
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,840
- Oh, oh, let's talk,

738
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,800
do you believe in any cryptid, anything?

739
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,040
- So the group I work with out of South--

740
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,520
- We love cryptids.

741
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,520
I had no idea.

742
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Yeah, I love cryptos.

743
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
It's awesome.

744
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:37,200
The group I work with is called, I think it's Atlantic Cryptoid Investigations, I think.

745
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
I can't remember.

746
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,960
I can't remember hardly anything these days, but they're big on cryptoid investigations.

747
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,640
I think, you know, some, yes, they're really big on Bigfoot.

748
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
Really?

749
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:58,960
We believe that, or I say we, they, and I somewhat believe that if Bigfoot was real, he would

750
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,720
probably be capable, could be capable of interdimensional travel.

751
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,520
Yeah, well yeah, he's gotta be staying hidden somehow.

752
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,080
Because he is the best hide and seek player.

753
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Absolutely.

754
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,320
So they think that he's more than just an animal?

755
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:22,340
think he's a some sort of alien descent you know I think he's something I think

756
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,040
he's something spiritual yeah I think some kind of like elemental type type

757
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,520
or or possible last of the Giants yeah have you ever heard in a theory that

758
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:42,760
he's Kane whoo yeah you guys all his days throwing it out there pretty sick

759
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,560
fucking theory yeah yeah that would be the coolest shit ever yeah if you

760
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,440
especially we caught him he's like yeah it's just me

761
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,800
we're like he's on TV on the Bible you know hey bull he's got we mean your

762
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,880
brother Abel he was awesome wait wait what the question would be is if that

763
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,560
was true look how able Kane is true yeah what if I just threw this mic through

764
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:22,320
window. I'm sorry. You're turning my mic off now. What do you think about werewolves?

765
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:32,980
You know, we kind of feel that there's a

766
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,440
possible relations between werewolves, Bigfoot, and the Chupacabra.

767
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,220
Right. Yeah, I'll feel that there some way I feel like werewolves in Bigfoot, especially that feels to me like yeah

768
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:51,820
So there's a link there. Yeah, there's some sort of you know, and again could be hand-me-down from Giants. Yeah and or experimentation

769
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:58,180
From the Giants. Well speaking in Nephilim. Do you that that is like, you know, biblical? Yeah

770
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,660
It's a biblical giant ballistic Giants. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's an interesting

771
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,920
I think that you know, it feels like that makes sense over the yeah

772
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,480
Did you hear about the giant they killed in Kandahar the Marines they killed?

773
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,240
Yeah

774
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:18,060
And in China, they're finding they're digging up graves that were they're huge. Yeah, you know, really? Yeah, great

775
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,940
Yeah, like I mean a huge huge bones. Yeah

776
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:30,040
Yeah, yeah, holy god in China, yeah in China this happened a couple years ago or recently

777
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,720
Yeah, but you know as things progress we're getting

778
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,400
less and less information from

779
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Yeah. You know, for all kinds of reasons. Maybe they're building their sun. Yeah, yeah, as they're building their sun, exactly.

780
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:55,400
But, you know, same, we've covered a lot of things, you know, same thing with pyramids, you know, a lot of us feel that pyramids are a distraction for bigger things.

781
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,400
Right. You know. What do you mean by that? The Sphinx.

782
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:05,360
communications. So what would be distracting? It's there to cover up.

783
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,440
There's something under it? Either under it or more about it that we'll

784
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,240
never know until it's too late. Yeah. Until there's the right time and the

785
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,320
right, you know, a lot of people think that there's gonna be, I thought, yeah,

786
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,240
the end of times come, aliens return, a beam of light's gonna come out at the top of

787
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,920
the... That's what I've always heard about pyramids is that they're energy

788
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:33,160
conductors yeah yeah for signaling well yeah so beacons or if I was an if I was

789
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,240
like an alien trying to do some shit like that like I would just make every

790
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,160
all this shit that I put on earth I just make it invisible right who's to say

791
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,520
there's not I mean we could be in an invisible pyramid right now um good

792
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,480
point you know we've talked about so you know just like with with travel you know

793
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,640
everybody's I say everybody so many people are brainwashed to think that it

794
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,960
all has to do with the ship right when it comes to alien technology you know if

795
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,260
they're that advanced why would they need they may not even need a ship they

796
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:07,380
could just have a suit yeah right and and it could be a like a jump drive yeah

797
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,280
suit jump from dimension to dimension well that's interesting so what how so

798
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,100
you you seem to have mentioned a distaste for Hollywood and like

799
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,020
brainwashing Hollywood shit a couple not everything they do yeah but not

800
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,920
everything but like what what do you think in Hollywood right now is a like

801
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,780
almost like a surely an op I like the X-Files yeah but what is what do you see

802
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,980
on TV that is like like TV or movies where you see it and you're like this is

803
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,740
clearly funded by the military this is a cover I got you something oh lord try to

804
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:49,020
me a little bit I'm not falling for that's uh that's a great question um like Glee

805
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:56,900
they're all aliens everybody yeah yeah well and that goes back to I don't know

806
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,900
if any X-Files fans in the house but remember the episode when Babe Ruth

807
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:07,220
they thought anybody that was extra great at something it's like sports yeah

808
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:11,940
Babe Ruth was an alien. Yeah. I totally believe that. Yeah. I mean I

809
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,780
Give me what it was. Yeah, what's the threshold for how great are we talking like who?

810
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,700
Yeah, if they name a disease after them like Lou Gehrig, okay, okay, okay

811
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,140
Tom Brady is an alien sure

812
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,700
He does not understand human custody. You know what father-son relation?

813
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,500
I wouldn't surprise me in the least if he goes hey, by the way, I'm from Nubaru

814
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,760
There was a there was a got milk ad

815
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,480
He did and he said that he puts crushed ice in his milk

816
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,220
In the ad in the milk and they aired that on television. It was on Sports Illustrated

817
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,820
Look, the man is whether you like milk

818
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:52,980
He has done things that no other quarterback has ever done. It's true. It's my mom in the history of sports

819
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,080
I got you know, he's they call him the gopher. I mean, but

820
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,020
That alone cuz you didn't human. That's right. Exactly. I mean, you know, I mean

821
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,240
It's just there's all kinds of or anything

822
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,120
Any anybody I don't want to talk Tony Hawk's either, but you know nobody cares

823
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,380
Here can can come can come arise above

824
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,980
And do a great thing

825
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:22,900
When they were predicted to never be great. Yeah in my opinion could possibly

826
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,620
Yeah, AOC

827
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,940
You went you went there. I was gonna go somewhere else for sure. Why not?

828
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:37,520
I think AOC is shape-shifting. I mean she could be. I think Hillary's for sure. Do you think reptilian? Reptoid.

829
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,760
Absolutely. Reptoid. Yeah, yeah, she could be.

830
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,220
Well, I mean, you know, we're worth going out there. I mean, that's just

831
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:53,060
Again I don't know. I'm just yeah. Yeah, I liked the X-Files episode where they were talking about. Oh, yeah

832
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,420
like anybody in the Olympics really right like

833
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,460
sports a little bit musicians even healing to be an alien for all we know

834
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,260
that is guitar players ever

835
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,900
yeah you know it would be like we're not

836
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,320
it's true it's been a fact that you see

837
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,820
you see on you to now people are just doing extraordinary things yeah

838
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,900
with instruments

839
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,940
you know i think it could be a thing of what i really really any of those

840
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,260
millions

841
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,820
alienated on the uh... it could be the idea of you know and

842
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,360
we could go back to

843
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,620
to see what happens with recent

844
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,420
things right yeah sir things any different yeah

845
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:33,700
you know it could be d_n_a_ in their things certain sharp widely distributed

846
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,100
and i think that i have a lot of shit that's right

847
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,100
that's right

848
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,620
but i mean you know

849
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:44,720
uh... again i don't know if you're here and i have no clue yet but none of it

850
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,180
now i mean as you know we're just your talking to your final surprise me though

851
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,100
like none of my i don't know what you know

852
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,600
you know never never never built that a black

853
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,020
yeah we first find out about and he's like and they're watching the t_v_ and

854
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,600
he sees his old teacher

855
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,720
yeah is that there is he was an alien i don't know if she was an alien that's

856
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,380
so so speaking of like so let's leave the

857
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,760
the uh...

858
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,260
extra normal world for a second i'm curious what

859
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,740
what like kind of plain

860
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,360
uh... uh... terrestrial conspiracies do you

861
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:24,360
kind of hold to be true?

862
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,400
Well, I believe in spirits.

863
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,020
Yeah. You know, and look, whether you're religious or not,

864
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,460
you know, a lot of folks don't talk about this in church, but spirits are mentioned

865
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,760
more than once in the Bible.

866
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,460
Yeah, holy ghosts.

867
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,840
The horse that got stopped by the spirit,

868
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,320
I can't remember what book that's in. I thought it was Job, but I was wrong

869
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,400
because my mom told me it's not Job.

870
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,840
So I don't want to say the wrong Bible, book, or chapter,

871
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,760
but a horse stops, gets stopped, and saves the horse

872
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,640
and the guy riding it from crossing this bridge.

873
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,480
- Right.

874
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,360
- Right, so how can you not, you know,

875
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:10,280
believe that there are spirits in the world,

876
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,720
or not in the world, necessarily the world,

877
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,180
but that come in and out from time to time

878
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,940
when it's in the Bible.

879
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,780
- Yeah.

880
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,700
- So that's, you know,

881
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,320
to me that's affirmation enough.

882
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,480
- Yeah, sure.

883
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,840
Yeah, that makes sense.

884
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,600
- So that, as far as that goes, I feel, you know.

885
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:39,200
- But like, so like JFK, what's your take on JFK?

886
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,320
You think they capped him?

887
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,220
the cap him

888
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,400
absolutely kept the idea

889
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,840
he was getting ready to spill the beans

890
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,880
on everything really a yeah

891
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,280
well yeah he was going to spill though he's going to tell everybody

892
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,060
everything about aliens

893
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,300
in in the capital

894
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,000
and this was back then yeah

895
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,140
yeah you know even trump

896
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,280
was supposedly gonna spill the beans yeah i'm gonna get him with the stupid

897
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,960
ray yes yet but he will he had

898
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,080
he was going to play

899
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,860
like his last beach one of the land he was gonna

900
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,700
- Really? - Yeah.

901
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,520
- Yeah.

902
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,260
- I feel like that's why they declassified

903
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,600
as little as they did. - What they did.

904
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,860
- Yeah. - 'Cause he was getting ready

905
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,860
from what I know from all of my connections and sources,

906
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,260
they've all said the same thing.

907
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,580
He was getting, and he got,

908
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:31,460
he had no idea how deep the deep state is.

909
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,780
- Yeah. - Yeah.

910
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,820
- Nobody does.

911
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,660
- Yeah. - Yeah.

912
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,300
- They, in my opinion, they think they do,

913
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,980
but there's this and the deep state could be alien

914
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,600
yeah in nature

915
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,720
yeah you know

916
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,020
and and do you really want to go there yeah you know what i mean

917
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:54,600
speaking of deep state i'm curious what's your take on uh... like Q

918
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,220
i'm more into anonymous

919
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,820
yeah yeah

920
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,180
you don't think like john podesta was executed by military tribunal and

921
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,620
they have a clone walking around

922
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,660
look anything's possible yeah it is you know it's like 60/40 bro you know what I

923
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:15,780
I used to be a lot I'm in I stay in touch with politics enough to know what's

924
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,900
going on yeah right we all should it was no matter what side you're on you should

925
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:28,140
all at least be aware of you know things definitely right um and and I stopped I

926
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:34,180
am unaffiliated when it comes to politics though 9/11 changed everything

927
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:44,700
from me, right? And for whatever reasons, but if we... I believe our government is

928
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,500
capable of anything we could possibly imagine.

929
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:54,660
Absolutely. Yeah, definitely. Especially now. Yeah, yeah. The technology that we have right now.

930
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,280
Yeah. Do you ever kind of think about what if they got real lazy and just did

931
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,240
9/11 again? You'd be like yeah like of course you guys fucking...

932
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,160
What you could do with the towers or... How do you know that's not in the works right now?

933
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,000
Probably is. Probably is. I mean I'm just saying with all that's going on... But like come up with another

934
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,920
thing Jesus Christ. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Did you think on the 20th

944
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,240

952
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,000
We never were able to get an interpretator to come in,

953
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,080
but we thought it was German.

954
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:23,920
- Okay.

955
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,760
- Ah, cool.

956
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,960
- Do you think there is a portal to hell

957
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,260
in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN?

958
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:34,880
- I think there's a portal to multiple places.

959
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,720
- Okay.

960
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,560
- You just gotta be able to, you know.

961
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,380
- Not just, yeah.

962
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,840
- You gotta, you know, again,

963
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,920
be careful what you look for.

964
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,760
- Yeah, yeah.

965
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,760
- You know, I think vortexes are possible portals.

966
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,080
- Mm-hmm.

967
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,200
Do you think the heart attack gun is real?

968
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,040
- The what?

969
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,440
attack gun the CIA do you think the CIA has a gun that can that can give you a

970
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,680
heart attack going back to an earlier statement yeah yeah yeah I believe yeah

971
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:01,880
I believe you're hurt a Havana syndrome I have not oh it's like all these like

972
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,120
like us like spies and fucking government workers and shit go to Cuba

973
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,560
and they come back they all get a stomachache it's pretty weird right it's

974
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:18,560
the food. Probably. They're big on spices. They're not used to cupanos and plantains over there.

975
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:24,040
Now it could be government related because of the food. You think they make the food

976
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:30,080
spicy to weed out all the whitey spies? I think it's funny imagining a white guy pretending

977
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:35,960
to be a Cuban spy. They're not going to let a softy be a spy. Yeah, definitely not. Do

978
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,160
Do you think Atlantis exists?

979
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:45,800
I believe in, maybe not Atlantis like we know Atlantis, but I believe that there is possibly

980
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,800
something.

981
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,800
Some lost continent.

982
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,800
Yeah.

983
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,800
How about like the Tartarian Empire?

984
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,720
Do you think that we developed technology in the past that was further than what we

985
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,480
have now and then something wiped it out?

986
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,640
I think we had help.

987
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,360
Yeah, okay.

988
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:08,240
I mean, we were, some believe in cavemen and some don't, but if there were cavemen, we

989
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,920
went from cavemen mentality to where we are.

990
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,920
We skipped, yeah.

991
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,920
You know what I'm saying?

992
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Yeah.

993
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,480
Now, help, how did we help?

994
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:27,920
Could have been mind through thought or premonitions, projected, astral projection, all kinds of

995
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,080
different ways, but I think we had help.

996
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:36,280
Oh, I have one. So what do you think of the theory, it's like a common debunking theory,

997
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,160
that most ghost sightings are sleep paralysis?

998
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,360
Absolutely. I wouldn't say most, but a lot.

999
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,720
But a lot of them are.

1000
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:50,440
We've actually had a case and we were able to prove that it was sleep paralysis.

1001
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,720
We put cameras and recorders in this lady's room and watched her for a period of time.

1002
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,400
and she popped up and her eyes were open

1003
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,640
and she popped up out of bed and her eyes were wide open.

1004
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,480
- Yeah.

1005
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,300
- And she kept-- - Oh man.

1006
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,240
- But she was asleep.

1007
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,080
- Okay, yeah.

1008
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:06,920
- Right?

1009
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,280
And she kept having a recurring dream

1010
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,560
that there was a ghost at the foot of her bed.

1011
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,440
- Yeah.

1012
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,400
- She was just--

1013
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,240
- Yeah, yeah.

1014
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,760
Do you think there are artificial structures on the moon?

1015
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,000
Do you think there's aliens or anything up there?

1016
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,080
- Buzz Aldrin does.

1017
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,040
Buzz Aldrin does.

1018
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,880
- Really, he does?

1019
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,200
- Have you seen his,

1020
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,880
you need to look up his video on YouTube

1021
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,040
about the moon, the dark side, you know.

1022
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,520
I think it was Buzz Aldrin.

1023
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,000
Astronaut claims that the aliens told them

1024
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,500
to stay away from the dark side of the moon.

1025
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,340
- Yeah.

1026
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,160
- I don't know if you've, it's on YouTube.

1027
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,200
Or they might have taken it down.

1028
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,240
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1029
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,800
- How about remote viewing?

1030
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,280
You believe in remote, like ESP?

1031
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,120
- Absolutely.

1032
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,160
- Yeah. - Telekinetics, all of that.

1033
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,760
- Have you met anyone who could do remote viewing?

1034
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,840
- I've known a couple of people

1035
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,080
that were really into studying astro,

1036
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,200
was it astro?

1037
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,040
- Astral projection?

1038
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,440
- Yeah, astral projections.

1039
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,480
- I used to try to do that.

1040
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,320
- Did you really?

1041
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,160
- Yeah, in high school I used to try to do it

1042
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,640
you know remember that comedian Sinbad yeah yeah he used to talk about it and I

1043
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,320
was like that's so fucking cool man it is cool I mean I don't have enough time to

1044
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,320
these days to wanna of course I wanted to do it I mean it's hideous man what

1045
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,000
you know oh yeah I wanted to do it and then go to the you know watch movies for

1046
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,760
free my big plan dodging demons to fucking watch the new Fast and Furious

1047
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,280
probably would be a bad thing if I could do it yeah it's true who knows what

1048
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:26,360
Sinister plans I would yeah, I was able to yeah, you guys have any other questions

1049
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,900
Oh, it's okay. So the big one I've been into recently see monsters

1050
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:38,840
Okay

1051
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:48,080
You think you think so Nessie's definitely really uh, it's something similar

1052
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,840
- I mean, look. - Think it's a dinosaur

1053
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,680
or a monster?

1054
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,320
- We don't, I think it's its own species.

1055
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,160
- Really? - Yeah.

1056
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:55,980
- Yeah.

1057
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,140
- I don't think it's necessarily related to,

1058
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,460
if it's, you know, to me,

1059
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,720
and or there might, I feel like there's more than one.

1060
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,560
- Yeah.

1061
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,040
- I don't think they're seeing the same.

1062
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:10,880
- Yeah.

1063
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,360
No, there's gotta be tons of them.

1064
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,200
- Yeah. - That's what I think.

1065
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,520
- Look, we know very little about deep sea anything.

1066
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,360
- So little. - Yeah.

1067
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,200
- Yeah. - Oh yeah, that's the--

1068
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:23,200
We want to go to space and we know hardly jack crap about the ocean.

1069
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,200
Speaking of lizard people, where do you land on Elon?

1070
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,200
That's hilarious.

1071
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
You think he's a lizard?

1072
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,200
You're not the only one that has talked to me about this recently.

1073
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Really?

1074
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,200
I like Elon.

1075
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
Oh you do?

1076
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,200
I mean I like some of the things.

1077
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:46,200
Yeah? You don't think he's a controlled opposition for the people who want to keep us from space?

1078
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Um, I like that he does his own thing, because he can.

1079
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,200
See what he named his damn kid?

1080
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,200
No.

1081
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
You didn't see it?

1082
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
That's messed up.

1083
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
You know in cartoons...

1084
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
Can't be any worse than Blanket.

1085
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,200
No, it's worse.

1086
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,200
Oh, it's really.

1087
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,200
You know in comic books when someone says the F word and they do F and then pound, sign, exclamation point.

1088
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
That's what he named his kid.

1089
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
Pretty much, man.

1090
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:13,200
much man. Well I like him a little less now. But I mean I like I like his vision. Yeah.

1091
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:19,600
You know what I mean? I think his vision is is genuine. You think CIA ever uses

1092
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:25,880
self-driving cars to like assassinate people? Goes back to the whatever the

1093
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:31,040
government. What do you think about zombies? I think I'm prepared. Yeah.

1094
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:36,760
yeah really yeah I'm a gun owner so yeah and a sword owner so nice the sword is

1095
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,400
how you get them yeah broadly what I know they said lightning round but there's

1096
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,560
just so much shit to talk about right and we could do another yeah I would love to

1097
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:53,660
of course but what is when if you if you when do you think the apocalypse is

1098
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:58,200
coming like do you think we're inching towards you think we're getting close I

1099
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,520
I don't think we'll know. I mean a lot of people seem to think it. Here's what I got to say about

1100
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,600
and again I hate sound like I'm picking on China but I feel like they're

1101
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,680
trigger-happy right now. Yeah. They're harvesting souls dude. That's true. I feel like

1102
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,160
they could just snap. China have nothing against the Chinese people. Yeah.

1103
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,480
Beautiful culture. Yeah absolutely. Love them. But I feel like their

1104
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:26,120
government has lost its mind. Yeah. I'm just saying. Yeah. I mean I feel like

1105
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:32,900
they have just and they're gonna if if anybody's gonna swing first think it's

1106
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,440
gonna be China I think it's gonna be China or or North Korea. US I mean always

1107
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:42,080
been cool hand Luke about that kind of stuff right? What you know with how crazy

1108
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,440
look I've even talked we've even talked about this you know on our shows you

1109
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:53,180
know when 2019 some a lot of people feel that this whole universe went into a

1110
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:59,620
different dimension really our whole 2015 2019 2019 okay yeah we're still there

1111
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:04,640
something yeah really like how would that work like the how would we not notice

1112
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:10,420
that we slipped into something different that's you haven't noticed look at how

1113
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:17,260
crazy everything is right now all over across the world right I mean Elon

1114
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:22,180
Musk he named his baby though I mean or McDonald dud yeah yeah yeah true I mean

1115
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:29,700
it's just it's just crazy so but I feel like if I don't feel that we would

1116
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:35,820
strike first I feel like China or Russia but I feel like China's you know lost

1117
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,380
it's just lost you think that's how we go out though nuclear war it's not gonna be

1118
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:44,980
some kind of fucking alien planet devourer yeah yeah just go like this one

1119
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:49,140
day maybe do we just blink out of existence could be it could be in

1120
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,580
relations they could be in relations and they want it you know want an

1121
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:56,700
apocalypse to come in and take over so that goes back to the terraforming

1122
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,180
yeah the soul star that's right building yeah yeah I guess it makes sense yeah

1123
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:03,700
right so this could be all part of somebody else's exactly and it's all

1124
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:07,500
leading it's all leading towards something project blue beam right is that

1125
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,860
what it is project blue beam oh really yep fake the the fake second coming of

1126
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:16,860
of the fake messiah holographic

1127
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,860
mark it a beast

1128
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,860
some believe it's happening right now

1129
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,860
yeah could be

1130
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,860
very scary

1131
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,860
you know if you read the bible

1132
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,860
whatever there's

1133
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,860
you know god

1134
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,860
if you believe in god

1135
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,860
supposedly made our bodies

1136
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,860
perfect the way they are

1137
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,860
and doesn't want anything

1138
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,860
that's in there

1139
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:44,740
in their it doesn't want anything artificial in our you know

1140
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:48,100
you know i mean the any sort of technologies

1141
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,100
but we're putting them in their

1142
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,780
so these damn smart for you know are we are parts of the are we closer to the

1143
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,400
end of times quite possibly

1144
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,180
yeah i guess that makes sense because of

1145
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,020
not just one thing

1146
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:03,380
a lot of double-edged yet on across the globe

1147
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,740
yeah yeah you know

1148
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,940
i mean even so it's not even a letter even stuff like like glasses and stuff

1149
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,880
if that can be like, I feel like,

1150
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,320
that you know, it just--

1151
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,440
- Tattoos. - All incrementally.

1152
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,680
Tattoo, yeah, you know, incrementally.

1153
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,240
- Yeah.

1154
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:21,480
Nothing is out of our government's grasp at this point.

1155
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,320
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1156
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,420
- Nothing. - Yeah.

1157
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,800
- You know, the sky's the limit, you know?

1158
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,720
- Yeah.

1159
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,960
Well, I feel like we should probably wrap this up,

1160
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,420
but I do, I am curious,

1161
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,120
what do you think happens when you die?

1162
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,440
'Cause I know you,

1163
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,120
what do you think the experience of dying is like?

1164
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,520
- Oh, well, if you have to use the bathroom.

1165
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,360
- Yeah. (laughing)

1166
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,200
- I had heard that.

1167
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,200
That's the answer is you shit yourself. You would absolutely shit yourself.

1168
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:46,200
Oh yeah, we watched like the whale explosion videos the other day.

1169
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,200
Strong point. Yeah, I think that happens to us. You think you explode?

1170
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,200
Well, I think that's our version of that.

1171
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,200
This could be a whole other topic on whether you're spiritual or not.

1172
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,200
I believe we ascend to somewhere.

1173
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,200
Now, I don't necessarily, this is my personal

1174
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:13,200
opinion or whatever it's worth, I believe some may ascend directly to somewhere and some

1175
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:20,380
may not so much, just depending on how - not necessarily whether they lived a good life

1176
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:27,480
or a bad life, but whether or not whoever the creator is may have something more for

1177
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:34,440
that particular person to do still even after the ascension or in the process of ascension.

1178
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,900
- Yeah, that makes sense.

1179
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:36,940
- That makes a lot of sense.

1180
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,980
- And that's why we see or have,

1181
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,660
you know, like I think as Catholic,

1182
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,120
they believe in purgatory.

1183
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:43,960
- Yeah.

1184
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,300
- Right, and I don't necessarily believe in,

1185
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,680
they believe in purgatory, I think,

1186
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,360
as a more long-term, I'm not necessarily sold on that.

1187
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,560
- Wait, actually, I have one more question for you.

1188
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,160
Do you think there's,

1189
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,480
would you be surprised if you died and became a ghost?

1190
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,320
- I would love it.

1191
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,240
(laughing)

1192
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,080
- You would love it?

1193
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:03,900
- Oh, yeah.

1194
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:08,220
love I mean the things that I could do you just love it you just people I would

1195
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:13,300
torment your bit of a prankster who's on your list oh gosh I don't want to get in

1196
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,580
trouble

1197
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:25,260
family members possibly you know so yeah a little brother you know there's a few

1198
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:33,300
things that I would you know I'd scare the shit out of uncle chip I would

1199
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,780
probably irritate the shit out of my sister.

1200
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,280
(laughter)

1201
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,320
- Yeah, easy to do.

1202
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,940
- You know, I mean, I'll just prank her constantly.

1203
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,280
- Real petty stuff when you're a ghost.

1204
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,120
- Absolutely.

1205
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,960
- All right, good to know.

1206
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,480
- These keys are gonna go in this room.

1207
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,320
- Yeah, yeah.

1208
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,140
- You know?

1209
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,980
- Yeah, I think that's the right idea.

1210
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,060
- Nothing detrimental, just a little--

1211
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,020
- No, no murder or pushing.

1212
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,020
- No, no, nothing like that.

1213
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:55,860
- Maybe, but no.

1214
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:56,680
- No.

1215
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,020
- Depends on who I'm stuck with.

1216
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:58,860
- Yeah, true.

1217
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,680
- Yeah.

1218
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,520
- Depends on who I'm stuck with.

1219
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,360
- All right.

1220
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,980
- You know, you could possibly be assigned a person

1221
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,980
and not have any, you know, not have a choice.

1222
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,140
- That's true, true, yeah.

1223
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,300
- All right, well thank you so much, man.
