00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Podcast About Me

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Give it up. Thank you live studio audience here. Give it up for the band.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We got the band in the house.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Wow.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Wow.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's amazing.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yep.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wow, you guys hear that?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's sounding like the summer of love.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yep.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And we got guests later on.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Later on we'll have a lot of guests.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, and now I'm outside and I'm...

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's really loud.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A lot of loud stuff happening.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But, uh...

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Say hello to my little friend.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Little Caleb is here.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm actually a little ass fuck.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, Little Caleb.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I mean, no, no, no. I need to be small. I need to be small for that.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can't just be doing my normal voice when he says,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
"Hey, Little Caleb," and I say, "What's up?"

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Put it back to Little Caleb.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I refuse to be Little Caleb until...

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, what's up? It's me.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
[laughter]

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey, Little Caleb.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Stop switching it on.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey, what have you been...

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Have you done any

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
crazy tricks on the tech deck lately?

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,120
lately. I got lost in. You got it. It's ruining the word.

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,280
Establishing that he's small. I had to fight a dust bunny. I

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,920
didn't. I did. I did. I did. I did. I didn't. I did. I didn't

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,680
have to. I didn't have to fight. I didn't have to fight a dust

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,080
bunny. I did have to fight a dust bunny. Guys, we just have

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,600
we upgraded our shit. All of I don't know if you've noticed,

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,340
but we are on a serious serious XM level of technology, professional technology

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,200
right now when it comes to audio equipment. We have finally bridged the

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,080
gap from

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,200
small potatoes to steak and potatoes. We're like... That's right. Exactly like

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,640
a serious XM podcast. We have a full

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,640
thing. We have this. Some kind of thing. We don't know what it is. And Cameron,

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
how about you show us what it can do?

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,560
great ladies and gentlemen, welcome to

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,600
and make my voice do something funny.

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,480
We only know how to do my voice. Okay. Can I, can you move your microphone over

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,380
when I need to say a funny voice? It's too, no, you'll have to come over here.

52
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,120
It's too, you can't move these microphones. There's honestly, it's worse

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,500
in a lot of ways, but oh wait, actually this doesn't do this is amazing. Well, I

54
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,840
can't move mine. I can move mine around. You can't move your, unless you like,

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You need to be on the other side of it. You misunderstand everything.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't understand anything.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But yeah, thank you to...

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Some guy.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Some fucking guy.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who said to not shout him out.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, I hope he gets fired for this.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think maybe it's a firing situation.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Cameron has been too focused on the soundboard.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sitting here.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's because it's so much fun.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What do you want me to say?

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All I'll say is you guys are looking...

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,500
(Bleep)

69
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Where what?

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,500
(Laughter)

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,000
You guys are

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
(Bleep)

73
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
You're lucky I'm (Bleep)

74
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Why do you keep saying that about us?

75
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,000
I keep saying

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,500
(Bleep)

77
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
That was so long!

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jesus Christ!

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why did it not beep out "Motherfucker"?

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Beep yourself out if you're gonna say it.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, I forgot that we need to stop cussing.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, well that's, we're gonna do that next, that's next, next episode.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well no, that's just for the D&D.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,400
be because we did we there's a whole timeline thing. I feel like yeah,

86
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,000
okay, all right, well, then next we look forward to something crazy. Okay, so

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
tell us about Mexico. Then how was Mexico? It was pretty incredible. Yeah,

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,440
I

89
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,720
almost instantly assimilated completely. That I became fully. I mean, look at

90
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,600
your new hat. My hat can't punch in because dubio isn't here. Yeah, my hat

91
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,920
says Mexico, which is what I call it now. May Wow

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,960
And I actually, I was able to fully become a member

93
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,240
of the culture and of the history and lineage, ancestry.

94
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,400
- Can I ask you one thing? - And everything.

95
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,680
Yeah, go ahead.

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,440
- Anything happen with the cartel?

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
'Cause you did send them a message.

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,320
- Yeah, so I did, you know, I ended up meeting with them.

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,240
- You broke bread.

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,120
- Yep, at a WeWork.

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,760
And I had a meeting with the--

102
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,080
- Is that where they work?

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
- We actually, yeah.

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,120
So that's where they do a lot of their meetings.

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,160
Over an iced cafecito.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,460
- Is that milk?

107
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,220
- I don't even know what it is, to be honest.

108
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,700
I think it might have been a drug.

109
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,020
- Oh, okay.

110
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,080
- We were able to reach an agreement.

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,420
I met with the Salamancas.

112
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,460
- Really?

113
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,280
- Uh-huh.

114
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,120
- You meet with Hector.

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,960
- And Tuco.

116
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,780
- And Tuco.

117
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,620
- And the brothers.

118
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,200
- As well as the Frings, the Fring.

119
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,840
- Those pindajos are loco.

120
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920
- I met the Fring.

121
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,000
- Fring is not based in Mexico.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,040
- The Pollo Hermano?

123
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
- Wow.

124
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
- And we reached an agreement,

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,360
and I think their activities will be severely limited

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,520
from the time going forward.

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,620
So what tell me what applause going? Yeah, that's

128
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,920
all the way.

129
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,220
Everyone is taking the cartel down.

130
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,720
Fuck you cartel.

131
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,120
We got to get bro on that.

132
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,520
So bad. Yeah, bro. We'll be on it. These are these are not I know it

133
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,320
sounds because they're so perfectly tailored to what we do. These just

134
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,920
came with this.

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,520
This is all just stock voices and so it also it has the the voice

136
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,220
effects to what's on the other page. Let's see. I'm not done talking about

137
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,680
Mexico.

138
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,480
I forgot we're doing Cameron's vacate. We play the music again and then we'll

139
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,220
report. Yeah, play the music again and then we'll say we'll have a proper

140
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,640
intro.

141
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,800
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for Cameron's vacation corner. Yeah.

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,620
All right, so Cameron went to Mexico.

143
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:15,720
Yeah, I actually I was able to assimilate so fully I and I was

144
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,020
telling Caleb this okay.

145
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:27,620
I was telling him this just yesterday.

146
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,220
I actually had the whole time.

147
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,220
I did not have a single bout of Montezuma's revenge.

148
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,420
My stomach was pristine from the Mexican food.

149
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
that I was devouring.

150
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,180
- Gringo's, that means diarrhea.

151
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,020
- Yeah.

152
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,320
- It means diarrhea brought on by a foreign culture.

153
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,160
- Yeah.

154
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,340
(laughing)

155
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,840
- Just the music, it makes you so sick to your stomach

156
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
to be in a new place.

157
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,500
(laughing)

158
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,940
You have diarrhea.

159
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,780
(laughing)

160
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,060
You're so disgusted by how different everything is.

161
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,860
- Yeah, but I actually, this is completely true,

162
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,020
I did not have Montezuma's Revenge at all

163
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,300
until the moment I got back in the United States.

164
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,140
- Wow.

165
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,220
What did you eat when you got back?

166
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,060
- Bread.

167
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,380
- Oh my God, that's what I'll do.

168
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,320
- I don't remember.

169
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Wait, okay, so what are we calling that then?

170
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
What are we going to call that?

171
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,280
That is basically what they call it in Mexico when you come to the U.S.

172
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,840
and they call it Michael's Revenge.

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,600
Well, he landed in New York City.

174
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,080
That's a big puns revenge.

175
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,720
So you have Michael's Revenge.

176
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,160
I've been having Michael's Revenge from Mac and Cheese, PB&J, Hamburger,

177
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,680
Cheeseburger.

178
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,640
You got so used to being in Mexico.

179
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,880
I assimilated fully.

180
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,320
Yeah.

181
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,040
I actually got enough tap water in Mexico.

182
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,560
You're more Mexican than Julio.

183
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm more Mexican than American.

184
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,180
Yeah.

185
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,680
Yeah.

186
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
You know that Cheech and Chong song? Can you sing that?

187
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,180
Which one?

188
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,680
Mexican Americans.

189
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,680
No, I don't. I think that that song is almost disrespectful.

190
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
That's disrespectful?

191
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
Which I get to make the rules about it.

192
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Yeah, that is true.

193
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
You're going to be laying down a lot of law with us.

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Wait, what kind of Native American are you?

195
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Mexican. Mezzo.

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Yeah, yeah. I was wondering about you.

197
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Genuinely, that's what I would have been told.

198
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,180
Yeah.

199
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,680
Wow, really?

200
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Yeah, Mezzo American.

201
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Wait, so that means that you actually did go to the motherland.

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,640
man. Maybe that's why you have such a terrible stomach situation in the United

203
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,640
States. Exactly. You need to go home. My stomach felt better than it ever felt in

204
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,800
Mexico. Now I get back and I'm basically spraying pale poo. Yeah, you were in

205
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,280
Mexico, you're eating parrots and iguanas and stuff. You're feeling amazing.

206
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,960
Did you guys see the video of the guy, the dude in Florida who catches an

207
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,280
iguana and makes tacos out of it? No. I saw a bunch of iguanas. My uncle used to

208
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,780
have an iguana named Dino. That's cool. They used to have pet iguanas back in the day.

209
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,780
It died and then we had a funeral for it and we all had to go to my grandpa's house and

210
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,400
watch him bury it. Wow, was it named after the Flintstones? It was. Something about the

211
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,540
Flintstones in Mexico, they barely have any electricity. So it was basically Flintstones.

212
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,460
They only get electricity from generators. Weren't you in like a hut though? I don't

213
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,180
think that's true. Well, who knows more about it? Have you guys been to Mexico? I've never

214
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,620
there's someone who is supposed to be here who knows a lot more about it.

215
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,880
Who would be able to challenge me on that. They have no electricity,

216
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,080
no cars. They ride horses. Really? They dress like cowboys. They dress like

217
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,500
shit.

218
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,840
They have barely any food, almost no beaches. They have a lot of restaurants.

219
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,300
No trees either. A lot of restaurants with a picture of Goku out front.

220
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,600
Oh yeah, yeah. They did... Okay, every place... Goku burger. They had a

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,160
bunch of pharmacies that are like the tourist pharmacies. Pharmacandia. Yeah.

222
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Yeah, very good. I love next to one day, but they're like the tourist ones that

223
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,560
you're supposed to go in and get like Pepto or whatever. What are you there

224
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,160
every single one of them on the on the window have on the wall is just pep.

225
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,060
No, they have every single one of them and I sent you a picture of this. They

226
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,760
all have the exact same printout like sign decal thing on the window of two

227
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,360
like monstrously buff black guys like gigantic black guys and it says we sell

228
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,060
anabolic steroids come in and ask every single place the same picture of the

229
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,900
I'll pull up the picture.

230
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
Yeah.

231
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,180
I mean, we can, we'll pull it up.

232
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
I saw this picture probably 20 times.

233
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,660
I'll put the picture in, in post.

234
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,820
There's some incredible things going on in the culture over there.

235
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,060
Do you know what the most popular song in Mexico is that I heard every single day that

236
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
I was there?

237
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,580
You'd think that, but do you know what song it actually is?

238
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,700
It's the song that goes...

239
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
That's your right.

240
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Look, here are the...

241
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,420
They have this sign at every single pharmacy.

242
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,020
I can't get it close enough to the camera, so you guys are just going to have to imagine

243
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
it.

244
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,260
don't worry. But that's that song that goes dance for me, dance for me, dance

245
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,560
for me.

246
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,100
Really? They play that song on the radio a hundred times a day. Is it Joe Jonas?

247
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,980
Is it? I have no idea. I heard it one time in my life before I went to

248
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,740
Mexico, and I heard it a hundred times more. I think that's Baby Rexa. Yeah?

249
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,300
Yeah. Are you a Rexar? I'm a huge Rexar. I like that one one. I like the

250
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,020
one with... I'm good, yeah. I'm feeling good. I'm pretty sure this one's Baby

251
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,460
Rexa.

252
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,940
Yeah. This is my favorite Baby Rexa song. I think you're right. I do wonder

253
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,860
made this song because it is really good and it has just a perfect like right here you say

254
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:05,140
the baby rex hour dance with me dance with me dance with me the baby rex hour is that Dua Lipa?

255
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,060
Dua Lipa made this one oh don't say that she flopped no she made that song she recorded that

256
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,100
she flopped onto me and tried to have sex with me at a party because i was really really drunk

257
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:21,940
and i had to push her away it's a true story yeah i told my girlfriend that Dua Lipa was my ex and

258
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,000
And she didn't think it was funny.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
I don't think anyone thinks it's

260
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
funny, really.

261
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,900
I think no one thinks it's funny,

262
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,060
but me.

263
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:36,500
Pretty good.

264
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,980
Pretty good.

265
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,780
It's a complete.

266
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,700
Lately and now that we have this.

267
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Soundboard is good.

268
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Yeah.

269
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,740
Go Patrick.

270
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,100
And it's going to you're going to

271
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,620
tell me every time I flop with a

272
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,220
the sound, I think I might kill myself.

273
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:02,100
Yeah, I'm really excited for this new era. Yeah, I think that probably there

274
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,060
will be two episodes where we use the sound board and then we're gonna have

275
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,380
to outlaw annoyed by it really, really bad. So we need to stop with it pretty

276
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,060
soon. Yeah, luckily that's that true. That is why I didn't load any new

277
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,260
sounds onto this. So we have one episode right now with all of these sounds like

278
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,740
this. Yeah. And then we do another. So we have all the bruh and the vine boom and

279
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,660
all that stuff. And then we are done. We did it all. I didn't want to. Yeah, we

280
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,320
don't. Well, let's not do it on the episode immediately after. Let's wait

281
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,660
like three weeks and then just bring it back. There's just out of nowhere. I'm

282
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,860
going to I'm going to be using the soundboard maybe once a month going

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,740
forward. It's going to make it very impactful. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to be

284
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,020
really surprised. I will say of the three of us, you're the only person I

285
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,540
distress with that. Oh, absolutely. If I was behind that thing, dude, I'd be oh

286
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,420
my God, you wouldn't. I would be doing Funkmaster Flex. I'd be dropping bombs

287
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,260
every fucking twenty seconds. Well, that's you guys. I am gonna bring my

288
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,660
drum machine in. Okay, we're gonna have a musical episode. Can we do five

289
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,020
fingers of death? We're literally gonna do five fingers of death next. Dude,

290
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,860
we're gonna do that on Monday. That's such a good idea. Five fingers of death

291
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,900
with no swearing. Yes, a no swearing, five fingers of death where you're just

292
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,340
putting up like... That is the best idea. Oh my God. You're a genius. Yeah, I mean it

293
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,940
looks like five fingers of death because now we have these mic arms. Yeah, I know.

294
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,700
Look at... I actually, I was able, I also wanted to tell you guys, I sampled, I

295
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,340
didn't just sample food and music and steroids in Mexico. I actually was able to

296
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,620
sample a little of the local film as well. Oh yeah. I was able to, and the hotel they

297
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,820
had they were playing a bunch of Espanol movieos.

298
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,100
What is it in Spanish?

299
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
El Fumo.

300
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,660
You watched El Fumo in Spanish?

301
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,380
No, so what I watched actually was this movie.

302
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,580
I don't know the name of it, but I did.

303
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,020
It was all in Spanish, but I think it was maybe, I think they maybe localized it over

304
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,220
here at some point.

305
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,220
but it was starring Ben Diesel and Elijah Wood.

306
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,660
And it was kind of a fantasy movie.

307
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
I haven't seen it.

308
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
I don't know if they have that genre in Fantastico.

309
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
It was a Fantastico movie with Ben Diesel?

310
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,940
What's the name of that genre in English?

311
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Science fiction.

312
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
Science fiction?

313
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
Or, sorry, fantasy.

314
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
It's fantasy.

315
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Yeah, Fantastico.

316
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940
Fantastico.

317
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,820
And I think they were haunting witches.

318
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,700
But I don't know what the movie was called.

319
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,740
I only caught a little bit of it, but Elija Wood was really, really bueno.

320
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
Bueno?

321
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,740
Bueno.

322
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Did he look guapo?

323
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740
Yeah.

324
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
See?

325
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,740
Is it scene city?

326
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,180
No, it wasn't scene city.

327
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Scene city?

328
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,800
When you were in Mexico, did you try at all to speak the native tongue?

329
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Not at all.

330
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I forced everyone.

331
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
What languages do you know?

332
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,620
I said hola one time and I didn't do it again.

333
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,100
What languages do you know?

334
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
I don't know any languages.

335
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
He barely knows English.

336
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
I know English, profanity, sarcasm, and real shit.

337
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,220
Wow, okay, wait. Can you get that with some kind of sound effect?

338
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wait, wait, wait. Okay, say it again.

339
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,100
I know, English profanity, sarcasm and real shit.

Okay, no sound but can I can we just have five minutes where I'm little yeah, it's

351
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,500
just weird because there's overlap. It sounds strange. Will you shrink me real

352
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
quick? Yeah, I'll shrink you.

353
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:39,600
Okay, let's just continue doing this. Okay, so I don't know if you know I got

354
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,000
a new vacuum lately, lately, late late recently. I mean I got a new vacuum

355
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,900
recently and Kayla was over my house

356
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,000
and let's just say

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,240
(slow motion speaking)

358
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,440
- Yeah, that is too.

359
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,200
- Wow.

360
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,020
- Yeah, we can't figure out how to work this.

361
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,860
I'm sorry. - Don't worry about that.

362
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,360
- We'll figure it out later.

363
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
- We'll figure it out eventually.

364
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,280
- I really wish that,

365
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,000
I really wanna leave the country this year, I think.

366
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
- Yeah. - Yeah.

367
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,660
- Yeah, or leave.

368
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,560
- It was pretty incredible to leave the country

369
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,220
and go and find a new country for myself.

370
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,060
- I need to get a passport.

371
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,840
- It's really easy to get a passport.

372
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,720
- Really? - Do you have to have,

373
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:37,800
to go to Mexico, do you need the passport? Or can you just get one of those new driver's

374
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I think you need a passport.

375
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
You can't do a real ID.

376
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Well not a real ID but like they.

377
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
That's what it's called.

378
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
You need a passport.

379
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
That's what it's called.

380
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
That is what it's called.

381
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
No it's like an ID plus or something.

382
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
No it's called a real ID.

383
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
No real ID is for flying.

384
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Okay it's two different things.

385
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Well how are you going to get to another country?

386
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Well you can cross on the Canada border or the Mexico border.

387
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Do I sound like a hot girl when I talk like this?

388
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
No.

389
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Okay.

390
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm not a hot girl.

391
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm a hot girl.

392
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm a hot girl.

393
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm a hot girl.

394
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I'm a hot girl.

395
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm a hot girl.

396
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm a hot girl.

397
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm a hot girl.

398
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm a girl when I talk like this?

399
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Uh, no.

400
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
No.

401
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
You sound like a borrower.

402
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I will say this is what I sound like.

403
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
No, no, no.

404
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Okay. This is what I sound like in my head.

405
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Yeah?

406
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
When I'm sitting alone at night and I smoke too much weed

407
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
and I'm thinking about the Matrix.

408
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
This is how all my thoughts go through.

409
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
The Matrix?

410
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
And I'm thinking about the Matrix?

411
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:37,740
Oh my God, five fingers of death, be like freestyle. Oh my God, I just do it as in

412
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,100
the okay. Wow. All right, this is too distracting and it's honestly hurting my

413
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,800
head. Yeah, this is what you asked for. Yeah, I know. And now I'm saying, well,

414
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,460
we don't want the echo. We wanted the tiny. The echo's bad. Yeah, I'm turning

415
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,080
it off. You don't even know how to use this thing. I don't because we didn't

416
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,600
have time. Yeah, you're trapped in there. I'm trapped now. I'm in a big case.

417
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,500
Okay, there we go. Thank God. All right, we're done. We're done. Now we're done

418
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,760
with this, that we're going to have a normal episode. Yeah, yeah, we're just

419
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,580

Give myself applause. Is that okay?

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Applause is fine. No, that's real shit.

434
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
A lot of these milfs lack manners.

435
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Yeah. And a lot of them

436
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
are look, and a lot of their arms

437
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
are manly.

438
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Charlene. Yeah.

439
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
She used both. But seriously, they're all down.

440
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
And one of them looks like some kind of

441
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
alligator. One of them,

442
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
one of the guys on the show,

443
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
independently, I

444
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
guess, I came home, I sat down

445
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
on the couch, my roommate

446
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,600
mate Noah was watching it with my girlfriend and his girlfriend.

447
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,480
And I sat down, watched the episode, immediately pointed this one guy.

448
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,780
And I say, holy shit, that guy reminds me of Rex.

449
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,160
And they all start laughing because they said Noah already said that before.

450
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,880
Wow.

451
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,440
OK, that's exciting. I need to watch more.

452
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,920
I'm sorry. I'm surprised you didn't point at a MILF and say that.

453
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,760
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you might have been actually pointing at a MILF.

454
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,680
There is one guy who acts exactly like Rex on that show.

455
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,580
and his mom is the main character of Friday. She's the actress who plays the

456
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,880
woman in Nightmare on Elm Street 5. Five. What's that? The dream master, the dream

457
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,420
child or whatever, where she has the baby on the inside of her and then

458
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,960
Freddie. It's into Freddie with a big like spike of spit. I watched a bit

459
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,840
spike. I watched like one episode of Milf Manor. It wasn't the first one. It

460
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,940
it was like the second or third one, and they do this thing where they like

461
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,060
they're like everybody, all the moms write down the dirtiest thing that

462
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,340
you've ever done and some and they're like, I had sex in a jacuzzi, I gave

463
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:34,140
a double blow job, but then one of them, like the sweetest of all of the

464
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,540
moms, who is like the one that is the least

465
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,980
trying to... Sexual. Yeah, the least sexual one, hers is that she fucked

466
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,640
her son's best friend. Oh, yeah. And the kid immediately goes to the pool

467
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,040
when like starts like drinking a handle of vodka, like just like seeing how

468
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,480
what like literally like I'm going to hold my breath under the water forever.

469
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,440
God damn, it's so cool, but it's like

470
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,440
you think going on a show like that, that you're so young was her name. Yeah,

471
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,320
she's a milf, but she wasn't even the youngest one there. Yeah, her name is so

472
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,760
young. She was fifty. I know they're all their ages. If I was a milf, I'd be

473
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,160
doing dirty shit. One of them looks like I would be, I would literally be sucking

474
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,200
mud monster. I don't remember which one it is. If I was on MILF Manor, those MILFs would be learning a lot about the Yuuzhan Vong.

475
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't remember which mom it is, but one of them looks exactly like a Teddy Graham.

476
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Oh yeah, I know who you're talking about. She looks exactly like a Teddy Graham.

477
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I would look exactly like a vampire. No, not April J.

478
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,200
April J. looks like a cat. I like her. She got so much surgery. I would do her.

479
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,200
She was fine as hell before. Hey, everybody, some people maybe listening right now don't know the character names and haven't seen the show before.

480
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,040
before. Well, that's our homework assignment for this week.

481
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,080
So maybe we describe...

482
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,320
Look, I'd be on MILF Manor,

483
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,640
I'd be on MILF Manor talking up and down to these MILFs

484
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,600
about Tom Bombadil and stuff.

485
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,040
I'd have them, I'd be holding court.

486
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Oh my God, wait, you would be so good.

487
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
I'd be holding court.

488
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,320
They'd all be in a jacuzzi, right?

489
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,560
They'd all be sitting there.

490
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,880
I'm standing outside of the jacuzzi.

491
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
I'm wearing a linen shirt with linen pants.

492
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
See, I think I've said this before.

493
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,120
if I if I was on the bachelor, if I was a bachelor, which I would pray to be the

494
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,400
bachelor, I would be telling them only about Godzilla stuff and I would I would

495
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,920
tell all of them. I don't remember which one they are. I don't remember. What's

496
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,220
your name again? Did I already tell you about that? You're standing there

497
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,320
holding a martini glass shaking, shaking it like this and just saying like I

498
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,760
can't remember if you're did I already tell you about you just get kind of co or

499
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:31,960
now?

500
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Was that you or the other one? I think.

501
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
How many people do they usually have on the bachelor, bachelorette?

502
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,640
Like 20, right? A bunch, yeah. That is crazy. I cannot remember 15 women.

503
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
No, literally, I wouldn't be able to remember. In like two days. I can't

504
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,120
remember you guys' names. The main difference between me and y'all is I'd

505
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,800
remember every single... Dr. Dre vibes. I'd be remembering every single

506
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,920
Milt's name and I would tell them each individually

507
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,800
what my Star Wars OC does.

508
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,780
You'd be up late doing flashcards.

509
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,280
Uh-huh.

510
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I remember those names.

511
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,080
Cade Darkblade is his name.

512
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,680
That's cool.

513
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,080
And he still has the Jedi Padawan ponytail,

514
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,880
even though he's running away after Order 66.

515
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,480
Wow.

516
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,880
He is living on Dathomir.

517
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,320
One of you is shaking this to this table so much.

518
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
You are with your leg.

519
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,440

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
It lives-- it doesn't matter.

521
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,280
He's living on Dathomir because it's like, damn,

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
that is an evil planet.

523
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,080
It doesn't matter.

524
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
He's living on Dathomir.

525
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
[LAUGHTER]

526
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,960
That's an evil planet.

From the nation's capital yeah, yeah, Earth exist in Star Wars. No, I thought

541
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,880
that they were going to make Earth exist. They should yeah. Well, they got

542
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,320
Lizzo on it now yeah. I thought she's gonna eat. That's what you're saying.

543
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,900
now you're saying Liz. Oh, you know, I've got they have they got you there's

544
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,200
something wrong with that's not right. That is too far, but we're just going to

545
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,140
move past that because I know that's not where your heart is. No, I was going to

546
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,080
say that I thought she was going to eat grogu. Don't you think that instead of

547
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,880
having Liz? Oh,

548
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,320
tear his legs off. Instead of having Liz, I want to spit and just cooking him

549
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,480
shaving parts of him off like he's

550
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,240
that green, that green shit from... I know she'd have him on a stick.

551
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,780
That green shit from Forrest Awakens that she puts in the thing and it

552
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,900
expands. Yeah. She's cutting that up. I would be breading him 'cause I

553
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,780
wouldn't wanna see the green. Yeah. But don't you think that Lizzo, they

554
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,300
shouldn't have had her in the show? They should have just... They should have

555
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,260
just used her name. They should have just... Instead of having her be a

556
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,360
Lizzo the Hut, you just have... Bro. Dude, what you... First you say she's

557
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,420
a... Okay, this is our reaction to that. Yeah. There ain't no way I'm

558
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,660
laughing. Jokes like that ain't funny. We don't like that fat phobia,

559
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,880
man. We don't like don't you think Liz would be a great name for a

560
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,420
slobbering alien lizard

561
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,240
yeah

562
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:37,640
interrupt. I got a text just now from Jubio why he's not here. What what is he

563
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,040
was asleep? Yeah, big surprise. Well, that's okay. He was taking a siesta

564
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,280
yeah siesta. They like siestas over there.

565
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,320
Yep. He knows something a little something. I learn that he knows other

566
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,560
side of the pond across the pond across the cross El Pondo now and Pondy toe

567
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,860
to an eater. That means a little right. There's also dogs everywhere with no

568
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,100
owners. Yeah, they're scary. They are actually not scary. Well, depends on

569
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,860
what part of the country you're in. There's a there's a town that they just

570
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,460
run. Yeah, they run and where I was to well, they don't run. You're scared of

571
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,460
the dogs. You didn't even be there for you were scared of the pictures of dogs.

572
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,900
you think I'm scared, buddy? You said they're scary yeah to fucking Mexicans

573
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,340
to me. They love the look at his shirt. He's in the dog pound. It says to me I'm

574
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,860
I'm I would go nice

575
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,380
says

576
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,580
to me. I would go and I would be can we get like a trumpet on the nails in the

577
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,260
back of a trumpet, you know, air horn. I would love to be one of the people

578
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,380
play the trumpet.

579
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,880
it

580
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,180
that's a louis armstrong sample

581
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,080
wonderful world. I would love to get you know how

582
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:03,880
you know how people get hired or not hired, but they do like incentives to in

583
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,380
certain states or they're like overrun by deer. Yeah, yeah, hunting. I'm sure

584
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,480
that they have something like that for dogs in Mexico. So many wild. The thing

585
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,720
- As the dogs, they do that for themselves, I think.

586
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,880
- They kill each themselves?

587
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,960
- They run into the street

588
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,520
and they sleep under cars and stuff.

589
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,640
- In Brooklyn, it's cats. - That's just what dogs do.

590
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,920
- They all look like zombies anyway.

591
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,520
- In Brooklyn, it's cats, and that's the difference

592
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,720
between the states and Mexico.

593
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,640
- There's no cats in Brooklyn. - Did any of them ever

594
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,720
come up to you and say hello? - What the hell

595
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,560
are you talking about?

596
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,520
- Yeah, well, I didn't wanna touch any of them.

597
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,700
That's the, it was so, I feel like there were so many people

598
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,840
who were there, like we weren't there during spring break,

599
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
but I feel like we were there with enough of margin

600
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,280
that we still saw some spring break type people

601
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,120
who were there.

602
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,420
dude, did you go to MTV's part? We went to MTV's party

603
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,120
and

604
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,920
he's against a I'm calm. Those a compliment to you and your and they

605
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,360
would always whenever the dogs are walking around, they'd be like, Oh my

606
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,000
God, and they'd like walk over is literally a dog that looks like a dark

607
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,920
souls enemy like it's like got like mange and like you can see its ribs. I

608
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,600
was just like eating, eating out of the trash. Yeah, it's like disgusting one

609
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,280
eyes different like it's maybe a brand or something else on of the dead shit

610
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,620
and they'd run up and be like scratched, like rubbing.

611
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,280
They'd rub all over its body and be like, "Oh my God, hi!"

612
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,160
And then turn around and keep eating tacos.

613
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
- Yeah.

614
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,160
- What do you think, a Zolo or a Chihuahua?

615
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,000
- Probably the best.

616
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,280
- Two types of Mexican dogs.

617
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,360
- There were many types.

618
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,800
- Yeah, well there's two specific types.

619
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
- I think some of these dogs maybe came over the border.

620
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
- Yeah.

621
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,520
(laughing)

622
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,360
- Going into Mexico.

623
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,180
- From America.

624
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,020
- Have you ever seen a Zolo?

625
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,860
- They weren't Chihuahuas.

626
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,680
- A Zolo dog?

627
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,520
- Probably.

628
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,360
- It's one of those hairless dogs.

629
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
- Is that the Mexican pet urban legend one?

630
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
- Yeah, I think so.

631
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,940
them. They look cool as fuck.

632
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,320
Yeah.

633
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,160
There's not wild chihuahuas running.

634
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,200
There is wild chihuahuas running around.

635
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,800
No, I think I think that my

636
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
theory, because most of the dogs we saw

637
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,360
were like big to medium size.

638
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,680
I think the small ones, the big ones

639
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,320
just eat them.

640
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,600
Yeah, that's what I do.

641
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,640
Yeah, I would do that.

642
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,000
If I was a dog, I would eat a

643
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,640
Pomeranian immediately.

644
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,160
And I wouldn't be a pit bull or

645
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,420
anything. Knowing just knowing what

646
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,620
you know about me, I'd be like a

647
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,440
Basset hound.

648
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
No, no.

649
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,480
What kind of dog would I be?

650
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,800
I would not be a chihuahua.

651
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,800
You got the yip. You literally are a yipping...

652
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't think I'm a chihuahua.

653
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You're a yipping yapper.

654
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,100
Yeah. You like need to be put in your crate,

655
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,300
like covered with a blanket.

656
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,300
I would not be a basset. He would be a basset hound.

657
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,100
Yeah.

658
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
Because of his depression and anxiety.

659
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,300
I can see you have droopy...

660
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,300
I can see you as a dog having big droopy jowls.

661
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,900
Really?

662
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,600
Yeah. And like look almost uninterested in like...

663
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,000
Like you...

664
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,700
Lifting?

665
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Yeah.

666
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,600
What are those dogs that should have been put down years ago? Yeah,

667
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,400
they should, but they should put dogs down based on their facial expressions.

668
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,260
If you, I think there's a moment you can look, oh my God, that just

669
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,060
reminded me this. I saw something that I was like, if this happened to

670
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,820
me, I would literally kill myself. Okay, somebody tourist with their...

671
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,700
Me? Yeah, me. You. Somebody had their dog on a leash, like their pet

672
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,940
dog that they brought to Mexico. There were like three stray dogs that

673
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,340
that were like hanging out and the person was walking by with their pet dog.

674
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,540
The pet dog stopped and just like stared at the stray dogs and like just was

675
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,440
standing there staring at the person like come on come on and the dog wouldn't

676
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,640
move. It was just looking at the free the free non pet dogs and it just like

677
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,740
literally was there for probably 15 straight minutes. The owner couldn't get

678
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,440
it to move and it was just staring at the dogs that weren't well. Okay, but

679
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,740
isn't that great? I would think it was it was struck with fear. Do you think

680
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,540
it realized I think I don't have to be on a leash that it thought for the

681
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,460
the first time you can be free. You can be a dog that's not a pet,

682
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,380
but isn't that crazy? I think that maybe the other dogs were looking at him and

683
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,500
saying, Oh my God, you don't have to eat your brother, but yeah, you're

684
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,140
literally eat your well, they still do eat poop. Well, that's true, but I

685
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,400
don't really care about that side of it. I was just thinking as a dog owner,

686
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,760
can you imagine the feeling of you? You suddenly your dog is I think about it

687
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,360
all the time. So the strings I the other day I was walking Phil and I was like

688
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:06,880
is the middle of the street, and I was like, "That's where I walk him." I looked

689
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,940
around there and I was like, "He is like an animal, and there's not a single

690
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:17,080
pixel of green anything in my view. He's literally just touching only

691
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,520
concrete, only seeing concrete everywhere he goes. He's only ever seeing other dogs

692
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,560
that have only ever seen concrete. This will kill this dog."

693
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,080
But yeah, can you imagine the moment, though, when he is

694
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,400
suddenly sees the truth that you can be a wild dog.

695
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah.

696
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,520
That's what's been happening with Mo.

697
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:45,220
There's a bunch of stray cats that stay underneath my fire escape and Mo will just watch them

698
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,720
from the window because he's still got his nuts right now.

699
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
So he's in heat.

700
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,040
He's running around my house.

701
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,360
He's running around my house just meowing.

702
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,640
Fucking put a rubber band on him and let him fall off.

703
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
That's a good idea.

704
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Honestly, that would take a lot.

705
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,820
take a lot. That would take a good chunk of money. Let me save a good chunk of

706
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,180
money. Dude, he's a cat. Even if he dies, it's a fucking cat, you're free. But he,

707
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:09,480
like, there's this one cat who's just getting her back blown out, dude. I heard

708
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,040
it last night. I heard just a cat going, like, 'Meow!' And he's, he ran to the

709
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,980
window and just was, like, sitting there listening. If you heard a human woman

710
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,840
make that noise on the street, would you say, 'Pfft, she's getting her back blown

711
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,240
out'? No. No, she's getting attacked. She's not getting attacked. That cat is

712
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,500
getting attacked. That was the sound of a cat in heat. Yeah, someone's fucking hitting it from the back.

713
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,820
You are sick. And why was he sitting there all perked up like he's ready to

714
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,220
jump out the window and go... Because he's evil. He's evil. He's an evil animal.

715
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,220
He's turned on by perversity. Yeah. Look at my arm, dude. He scratched the shit

716
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,540
out of me this morning. That's not a good creature. No, he's not good. That's a

717
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,260
creature prone to assault. Every day I regret picking him up off the street. I

718
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,860
feel the same way about how those dogs feel whenever anybody shows me any video

719
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,220
from National Geographic or something of a cannibal, like some country, and I go,

720
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,520
so I should be doing yeah. I could be living like this. Yeah, if I was like

721
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,160
people always, always all the time, I'm like, oh, I'm so glad I wasn't I'm like

722
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,640
born in America. I wasn't born in the Middle East or like Africa or something.

723
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,440
Dude, I wish so badly that I was born into a cannibal in the woods in the

724
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,380
middle of nowhere, where any time I saw a white person, I ate them like that's

725
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,920
like like they take a photo of me and that was was that JFK's grandson or some

726
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,740
Russia went to or now is some some rich to be if you're on the computer right

727
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,040
now, don't touch anything. Some rich kid went to

728
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,540
some country and to like took photos of cannibals for like a couple of years and

729
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,700
was like they're my best friends and they eat and they

730
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,140
like that. I would love to be on the other end and be people I

731
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:45,180
speaking of ancient cultures. We went to some Mayan ruins. Oh yeah, and we got a

732
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,200
good tour guide. Did you try to read to see when the end of the world is actually going

733
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,360
to happen? Yeah, I figured it out. What is it? It was actually supposed to be in 2012.

734
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,040
Really? Yeah. So what happened? We stopped it? I think that maybe they counted years

735
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:03,040
differently or something. Yeah. Shit, that's sad. Do you know the theory is, right? That

736
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,600
the world's already ended and we're in fucking purgatory right now. Shit. Every single one

737
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:13,600
of us represents a different stage of grief. I have to say, these mics... Yeah, what would

738
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,080
be the fan theory about about us three who would represent what what I would

739
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,600
represent I would be a little over two deadly sin I'll be less than pride

740
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
probably probably be

741
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,200
what are the seven deadly sins avarice and lust and really what is that rise

742
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,920
wrath I don't think avarice is greed yeah ever since great okay I really be

743
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,120
don't say I'm a little everest I guess maybe I probably be greeting gluttony

744
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,020
because I'm going around the country like Bourdain eating all the money and

745
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,120
sloth food you'd be cool sloth. I do see a mixture of sloth and gluttony. Yeah.

746
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:54,160
And then you would be, uh, you'd be wrath. Yeah, you'd be wrath. I'm sweet

747
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,280
and greed and wrath, greed, lust, envy, pride, every dollar I make. And what

748
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,080
world am I greedy? I would have away any money. I give away all my money.

749
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,360
You're sitting there on a, you're, I, we've been to a, and listen, you've seen

750
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,400
his wicker grown. I'm going to be completely, I'm going to be completely

751
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,680
real. I feel like you guys are making jokes out of it, but I'm going to be

752
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,520
100% genuine. Mine would be spilling my seed.

753
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,280
Wow. That's your own and ism masturbation.

754
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,720
Yeah. Yeah. Masturbation is honest, because I feel like with these mics, we

755
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,920
are kind of going into a little Joe Rogan territory.

756
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,480
We're just going. Oh, yeah. Let's do that. Yeah. Going a little deep.

757
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,440
I have been retaining my semen.

758
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,960
Really? I see it. I've I've been sowing it.

759
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,880
Yeah. And you've been sowing it. I've been doing the opposite.

760
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,520
How long? So I've probably like two months.

761
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,720
That's a long time. Two months I've been just holding it in.

762
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Every time my girlfriend, she tries to, like, she's like,

763
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,440
"Come here." And I say, "Get the f***."

764
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,080
Get the, wait, say it again. Say, "Get the," again.

765
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,120
And I do a tornado spin. Say, "Get the." Say, "Get the."

766
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,280
Get the f*** here. Yeah.

767
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,440
I do a tornado spin.

768
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,960
She's not getting any of this.

769
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,240
Here, come.

770
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,360
Dude, I, don't you guys, don't you think that... She is not touching this thing.

771
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,000
I think that those, that the thing of people who, like, like cum,

772
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,600
I think that's like honestly they should be like locked up. Who likes come the

773
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,400
zombie girls and guys? Oh, you're talking about sluts. Yeah, I think so.

774
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,560
Let's be locked up in a

775
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:28,440
oh yeah, yeah, sluts like how much how many mental gymnastics do you have to do

776
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,600
to get to the way you're like? Yeah, I think actually that's cool. Why not just

777
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,320
like it's just a just booger instead, just like like like people like oysters

778
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,400
like icing or frosting or something instead, because that's the yeah

779
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,820
cinnamon roll. I know pineapples. You can make your jizz taste

780
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,960
in a book. That's not true. No, you can make it taste like a B vitamin.

781
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,160
That's what I'm saying. Just spray your face with this.

782
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,280
Trust me. You make it taste like a B vitamin shot that you buy for

783
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,040
seven dollars. That's what it tastes like.

784
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,760
You know what it tastes like. Just guessing. I don't think you mean

785
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,220
All right, that's a hard reset on that conversation. So we'll move on.

786
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:12,220
But my tour guide, he kept, he was pretty knowledgeable.

787
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,920
It seemed like about the Mayan stuff. Not that I know that much about it.

788
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,420
So he could have been completely lying, I guess.

789
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,520
But one thing he kept doing is every like 10 minutes,

790
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,920
he'd find some way to like tangent what he was saying into being like,

791
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,420
yeah, and you know all across the world, every culture has

792
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,940
legends of giants and believe that there were giants that walked the earth. So I'm not going

793
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,120
to say too much about that. That's a different story for a different time. But everybody

794
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,480
around the world believed in giants at one point. And he said that like maybe five or

795
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,520
six times. And then at the end when we were leaving...

796
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,680
The Kandahar giant?

797
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
That's a giant. Very good.

798
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,180
No, but do you think that like... because remember that story blew up about like a couple

799
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
months ago.

800
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
You're blowing up his story right now.

801
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
Yeah.

802
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,200
I'm sorry. I just I got excited. Keep going.

803
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,600
he well this isn't even that worthy of a final thing, but we were leaving he was

804
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,880
talking about like coral reefs and sea level and stuff and he kept every time

805
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,840
he mentioned global warming. He said supposedly

806
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,680
pretty good, but he kept he kept doing the thing where he was like he said

807
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,520
something about giants or he said like in every culture. There's a there's a

808
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,320
symbol of someone with seven heads, but that's a story for a different. He said

809
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,840
every time he said that's a story for a different time. He must have a separate

810
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,440
core that you're supposed to ask him about. Yeah, definitely. I think he was

811
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,360
giving you like dialogue tree options where you're supposed to say, "Can I, can

812
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,040
you take me on your special tour?" And you kept saying, "Where's the bathroom?"

813
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:40,000
Puedo ir al baño. Puedo ir al baño. Baños, baños. There were, I also learned, I

814
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,160
now, I really don't like people from Italy and people from France,

815
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,320
which I already didn't like, but I had some face-to-face interactions that made

816
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,360
me like them even less. What, tell me what the face-to-face interactions were.

817
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,860
so it's and French French French person. I like to call them the galls by the

818
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,080
way.

819
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,120
They disgust me so great. Can you believe what they did to Rome? The

820
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,040
galls are awful. Rome was so great. Yeah, they were fucking with Rome. Galls

821
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,740
are stinky galls. Bro, if Rome is your up, you are my up. Absolutely, I'll

822
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,560
ride for Rome. I'll ride for Rome. Which is not in Italy, because it was old

823
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,240
enough that it doesn't count. It's Rome, it's a different thing. I'm more

824
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,260
thinking Vatican City. The French people, they're riding a bike and they're

825
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,220
know when you ride a bike and you ring your you ring a bell and you say on

826
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,380
your left. Do you know what French people do instead of that? They just run people

827
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,920
over? They whistle. Oh, but wait. They come up on you and they go I'm not gonna I

828
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,180
can't really whistle. They do that right right behind you in your ear and I say

829
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,680
"Merci." "Merci?" Isn't that horrible? Dude. I wanted to fucking clothesline this guy on his bike.

830
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,500
They're riding around Mexico with on their bikes that have like a bag of

831
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,860
groceries with a big baguette sticking out of them. Yeah. Yeah. And they're

832
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,620
telling you mercy. What's quesadillas in Mexico? Yeah. True. Well, yeah. Over

833
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,500
they have one big tortilla.

834
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,780
Yeah. So tell me. Okay. So I get that about the Gauls because they are

835
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,780
disgusting people. Yeah. They've always been the worst of Euro. But pray tell,

836
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:14,260
what did Italiano do to you? He this guy was on my tour. So this is one guy. I

837
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,900
just like to say is it could be having nothing to do with him being an Italian

838
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,900
It has a lot to do with him being Italian.

839
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Was he a male?

840
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
Euro-Italian or Jersey?

841
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,900
Yeah, Euro-Italian.

842
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,900
I said people from Italy.

843
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,900
At the beginning.

844
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,900
His name was Valentino.

845
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,900
Oh God. Alright, I'm with you.

846
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Yeah, and you know what, he was just

847
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,900
annoying the whole time. He kept asking

848
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
the most annoying questions. He did the

849
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,900
thing where... When do we get the pizza?

850
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Italian Elon Musk.

851
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
but the play the trumpet again,

852
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:56,500
but the thing the thing that he did was so that was so crazy. Yeah, is he

853
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,100
started and like what after we were at which we're touring teaching it's up and

854
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,620
we're talking and the guy that he thought it was chicken eatery. Yeah, he

855
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:10,420
did think that yeah, the guide the trumpet, the guide was telling us about

856
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,620
like oh yeah, the and the Europeans, you know, they stole all the car when they

857
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,340
like the conquistadors came in, they took all our carvings in our gold and

858
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,320
they put them all in museums over there and we're working on getting them

859
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,320
back. So we could they can be in teaching it, so we can like give tours

860
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,780
of them and stuff and the guy like the guy came like clearly stored this

861
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,400
information. His head came up to the guide like ten minutes later when we

862
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,000
were like at the bathrooms and he started a huge argument with the guide

863
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,280
where he's like just so you know, museums shouldn't bring back any stuff.

864
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,720
He was like he literally was like it wasn't even like like he straight up

865
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,420
was like yeah, that stuff isn't stolen because it didn't belong to anybody and

866
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,700
he started like a fifteen minute argument where he was like and it should

867
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,420
stay in the museums because it's in the museum and it's cool over there. I

868
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,820
will say I will say yeah, I agree. It was so crazy. He's to do it to but to

869
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,020
specifically the tour guide who is like a like clearly very passionate about it

870
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,540
too and the tour guy was just like it was to the point. It was the type of

871
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,540
argument where the tour guide was not even like arguing back. He was just kind

872
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,260
he's standing there with his arms crossed and the guy was just talking at him

873
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,920
and being like and that stuff it doesn't belong to anybody and it's really

874
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,320
nobody's goal. Here's what I would say. I think if you took that tour guide and

875
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,460
you brought him to the Metropolitan Museum of Art here in New York City,

876
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,720
and you showed him how many eighty year old women take photos of every single

877
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,720
thing with their iPad, it's true. He changes mind. Oh yeah, he would of the

878
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,160
most sacred religious thing that his country's ever had. They're doing this

879
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,000
and I have it yeah and they're doing that. They get this part of the tour. We

880
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
swimming on part of the tour.

881
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,020
They look at Venus de Milo and they're just like, "I'm going to eat that pussy."

882
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,780
We went swimming on part of the tour. Valentino, I think you can guess how long his swim trunks

883
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
were.

884
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,260
Oh my God, he had his cum gutters poking out.

885
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,260
Tell me, was he packing?

886
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,460
It didn't look like it to me.

887
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,420
He's wearing a spongy, amazing shape.

888
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,580
Honestly, he was not in amazing shape.

889
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Too many carbs.

890
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,220
Pastas de Hilo he's eating every day.

891
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,520
there was also a guy who was trying to was trying to who was doing the

892
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,200
basically is Peggy Hill Spanish on the tour and this the Italian guy got in

893
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,880
the like the tour van and the guy was and was like oh like where are you from

894
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,960
there was like introducing each other and he was like it's auto unis and the

895
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,240
and the Italian guy like clearly thinking the Italian guy was Mexican

896
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,120
like oh like and the Mexican Italian guy was like oh United States. Oh, what

897
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,920
state and the guy could get the American guy again went it's auto unis

898
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,660
(laughter)

899
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,500
- That's amazing.

900
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,320
- It was really great.

901
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,600
- I really want to be a tourist so bad.

902
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,600
- It's so great to just let go and just be free.

903
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,360
Be a parasite in a country.

904
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,160
- I do that shit when I go to like Louisiana,

905
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,500
when I go to like anywhere, like in New Jersey.

906
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,080
- That's 'cause you've never been to another country.

907
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,400
- I've never been to another,

908
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,240
I do this shit in states I haven't been to.

909
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
- You do it in towns you haven't been to.

910
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,720
- We go around, when we went on tour,

911
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,320
I'm like going around like Atlanta. Yeah, okay, we're driving through.

912
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,040
You're we're we're we're driving through like Lubbock and you have the window

913
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,120
down. You're like, what do you guys do here? Yeah, talk slowly. Hello.

914
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,960
Do you raise cattle in

915
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,360
and doing some reason doing sign language stuff?

916
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,880
Just doing this for this.

917
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,960
just wiggling your hands around. Yeah, I really what is your biggest export in

918
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,640
Shreveport? I need to get I need to learn Spanish very bad. Yeah, yeah, but I

919
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,280
think the only way to learn Spanish, I learned to move to Spain,

920
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,240
you have to move. I learned well. I learned a good amount by going to

921
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,480
Mexico. I think Mexican, I think you could probably learn some Spanish in

922
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,440
Mexico as well. I learned this phrase,

923
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Centurion de Segura's dad.

924
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Well, that is the century of Tom Segura's dad.

925
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That's what I thought at first.

926
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
No, centurion is basically a protector.

927
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It's clear actually.

928
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah, protector of...

929
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm thinking of the Latin root, my friend.

930
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's actually, if you want to know what it means, it means seat belt, and centurion means belt.

931
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Okay.

932
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So I learned that, which I never knew before. And get this too, the symbol for parking is an E.

933
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah, for E-parking.

934
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,600
parking. I asked I asked really what it was and it's a really long word that I

935
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,960
don't remember. Okay, it's way longer than parking. It was a long enough word

936
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,400
that I thought that can't really mean parking. Estabon does yeah, it's Estabon

937
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,260
yeah, but seeing an is seeing an e seeing a black e in a red circle can be

938
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,240
kind of man can make the sensor button. If you're going to say that word can be

939
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,060
kind of jarring because it is because of the right angles

940
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,500
black e

941
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,460
Come on, you can't be saying that.

942
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,740
Yeah, that's an air horn.

943
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,780
Hit the air horn for that.

944
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,100
That's an easy, yeah.

945
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,940
(laughing)

946
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,740
Yeah, Patrick got you, I gotta say it.

947
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,140
But if you see it out of the corner of your eye on a sign,

948
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,060
'cause a symbol with black right angles and a red circle

949
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,780
is not something you're expecting to see on the streets.

950
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,220
And it really, if you're not looking closely,

951
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,300
it can really get you.

952
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,220
You can really be able to turn your head and be like,

953
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,620
what the fuck is going on over there?

954
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,380
I would say in America and most

955
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,780
countries, I feel like they purposely avoid yeah, black,

956
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:33,440
kind of harsh angles. It's literally a red circle, like a

957
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,800
red circle and then white inside and then black. Sure,

958
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,820
if the stop sign was all at the stop sign had the black letters

959
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,780
yeah and let's say just two s's at the beginning, it would definitely be a

960
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,180
pretty bad sign,

961
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,900
but I did see some swastikas in graffiti really. Yeah, I saw two of them.

962
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:55,220
That was so... Sid Vicious would wear shirts with swastikas on them.

963
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,220
There's that South Korean pop star who's walking around with swastikas on.

964
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,420
Oh, the Q, yeah. Swatting the QAnon stuff.

965
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,060
Yeah, because he does it with...

966
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,620
Didn't somebody a while ago take a picture with Taylor Swift with a swastika shirt or something too?

967
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,180
Taylor had one?

968
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,980
I think they might have.

969
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,620
I think that that happened.

970
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,860
That might have been a shop though.

971
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,700
I think that happened a long-ass time ago.

972
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,780
I think she's a clone.

973
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,020
Yeah, personally.

974
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,140
I think she's a clown.

975
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,860
I think her music is actually fucking bubblegum ballad.

976
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,240
- Bullshit. - It's ass, bro.

977
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,080
- Yeah, yeah.

978
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,840
- It's basically-- - Fucking ass music.

979
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,880
- It's like ass. - It's almost like

980
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,720
she doesn't even-- - Wait, censor all that.

981
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,280
You can't be saying it. - She doesn't even write it.

982
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
- She writes music like fu--

983
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,120
Are you-- - You guys have to keep

984
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,800
talking, I'll do it. - She writes like

985
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,720
(beep)

986
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,640
music.

987
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,040
- You've been, whenever he censors you,

988
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,560
you actually don't say the words.

989
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,600
You go like-- - 'Cause I don't know--

990
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,440
- (beep)

991
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,280
- Shit. - (beep)

992
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,040
(laughing)

993
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,200
- It's so funny when the censor happens

994
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,120
in the middle of the word.

995
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,840
- I just took a fucking shit.

996
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,680
Or wait.

997
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,920
(laughter)

998
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,320
- No, wait, we have to delete that.

999
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,160
My mom will hear that.

1000
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,120
Let me try again.

1001
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,520
- My motherfucking (beep)

1002
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,560
(laughter)

1003
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,480
- I'm gonna go take a (beep) shit.

1004
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,800
(laughter)

1005
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,960
Okay, this is too much fun.

1006
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,240
It's too fun.

1007
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,480
- Hey man, do you wanna go take a shit later?

1008
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,120
(laughter)

1009
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,640
- Notice how he never censors himself.

1010
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,480
- My, what?

1011
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,300
- Himself.

1012
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,000
- You don't censor yourself because you're a

1013
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
mother fucking.

1014
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,680
Now you suck.

1015
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,840
You suck.

1016
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,160
You got owned.

1017
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,500
It's weird to censor myself.

1018
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,520
It feels it feels like giving

1019
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
myself an air horn or something.

1020
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,660
I wish that we all had a button

1021
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,660
that would like we.

1022
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,680
I bet it's possible.

1023
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,960
I bet they have an app or something.

1024
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,960
One of those Lego things.

1025
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,760
You know, like the Lego

1026
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,880
robotics.

1027
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,880
The Lego robots.

1028
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,280
Did you guys have.

1029
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,680
Did you in your high school.

1030
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,900
Did you have a Lego robotics

1031
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:46,680
team?

1032
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,600
No, what kind of fucking Disney Channel High School you go to? We

1033
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,480
went to a high school that had a film program. We didn't have a film program.

1034
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,960
We had a TV production program.

1035
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,720
Because the public access center was on the school campus. That's cap.

1036
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,360
That's not cap. That's cap. Yeah, you're capping. Bro, I told you guys about

1037
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:05,720
the time

1038
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,560
that I was at the center and that kid hit his... He was

1039
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,200
dab pens and he hit his dab pen in the green room where the...

1040
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
You had a green room?

1041
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,420
The talent, which is just the vice principal.

1042
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,420
Whoa, what the fuck?

1043
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,420
That's what I'm saying, dude!

1044
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,420
What kind of high school did you go to, bro?

1045
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,540
We always let him talk about the TV production class.

1046
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,640
It's crazy.

1047
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,640
It's crazy.

1048
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
He went to the school from iCarly or something.

1049
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,640
Yeah, that's insane.

1050
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,240
What other cool stuff did you have?

1051
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,660
So this kid hit the dab pen in the room.

1052
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,160
It was one of the earlier dab pens, so the ones that still smelled like weed.

1053
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,160
The big ones, yeah.

1054
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
Where you had to blow it in to turn the shower on and smoke it.

1055
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,800
smoke a spoof or whatever that was called.

1056
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.

1057
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,800
Sploosh or spoof, it's a sock.

1058
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,800
Sploosh is the thing from holes from holes.

1059
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,800
It's a cardboard tube with a sock.

1060
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
It's apples from holes.

1061
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Yeah, it is.

1062
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:02,600
It's a cardboard tube with a fucking dryer sheet and a sock and you have to blow into

1063
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,600
that so it doesn't smell.

1064
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,600
Oh yeah, I know that.

1065
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:10,800
And he just hid his dab pen in the room and our teacher and the vice principal walked in

1066
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,560
and was like, what is that smell? And he found out that they like could smell it.

1067
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:20,360
So he just ran away. Well, ran away forever. He ran away into the woods.

1068
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:25,280
That's crazy. Not to make this the vacation episode. Yeah, I mean it already

1069
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,600
is. Yeah, but when I was on the plane to Mexico, the guy next to me, he was

1070
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,080
vaping in his seat. But what impressed me, I have no idea what he was doing

1071
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,320
with the cloud. You can ghost it. Yeah, you can ghost that sheesh. How? You

1072
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,480
just swallow it. I censored myself so he wouldn't do it. He was swallowing it.

1073
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,640
That's what I thought, but I was like, I've never tried that because I've never had to.

1074
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,280
I don't know if it worked or not.

1075
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,200
It's pretty hard.

1076
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,420
I was doing it, but he was doing it with like it was like it might as well have

1077
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,560
been. I was watching him very closely because I was like, what's he going to do?

1078
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,640
The sleeve is going to put it in his like water bottle or something.

1079
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,880
I was I would always do it into my sleeve, like which is the most conspicuous way.

1080
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,000
Yeah, yeah. Because there's no natural movement.

1081
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,560
Are you going to do that? I'd see you do that.

1082
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,360
and then like through your sweatshirt sleeve, there would be a cloud of smoke

1083
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:10,860
going through.

1084
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,640
Well, that's what I would. Yeah, I guess the only times I did it was in a movie

1085
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,240
theater and I would just do, I would just, cause that doesn't matter that much

1086
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,860
on movie theater. No one's going to see it. So I would just do it into my, into

1087
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,520
my collar.

1088
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,600
I, uh, man, I forgot that I jeweled for so long. I have no, like that's just an

1089
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,360
afterthought. Nobody has jeweled. You know what I'd have though, if anyone,

1090
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:34,920
20, 20 bucks a pop, I would sell you. Oh, they sell every vape flavor in Mexico.

1091
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,440
they have vending machines. Whoa, do they have everywhere? I didn't look too

1092
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,000
closely. If I had... I guess I say they have every flavor, but what I saw was

1093
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,480
if you have vending machines everywhere that had, they were only vapes and

1094
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,560
like a range of every color. No chips or anything? If I had... No, literally

1095
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,680
just vapes. I didn't see a single snack vending machine, I only saw vape

1096
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,920
vending machines. If I had Mango Jewel again, I would start vaping. Go to

1097
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,680
Mexico. I would start vaping. I'm not doing those Elf bars though, those

1098
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,480
those things are scary as fuck. I think some of the vapes in there were those.

1099
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,320
There is a world, guys. The Mango Jewel was the greatest flavor in the world.

1100
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,000
I want you guys to be... Flavor. Flavor. Now that you've been. Yeah. Are you

1101
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,840
open to the idea that one day we move this whole operation? 100%. It would be

1102
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,040
incredible. I would move there in an NC of one-half. The amount of space that

1103
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,920
they have for rent there in Tulum, in the tourist area, where we could get

1104
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,640
beach front. It would be cheaper than this basement office. Yeah. It would be...

1105
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,360
that is currently leaking, it's raining inside right now. You can't hear it

1106
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,760
because we have professional microphones. It would be beautiful, right? Yeah.

1107
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,400
These would get stolen every single day.

1108
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,840
It'd be amazing. I would have the... Oh my God, I would start doing like

1109
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,760
cross white strips and I'd be tan like Wayne Diamond. Not a single thing of

1110
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,080
mine got stolen besides my heart by the beautiful landscape. Wow. Yeah, no,

1111
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,040
I think a lot of that's overblown. I'd be completely... I would look exactly

1112
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,280
like Wayne Diamond if I lived in Mexico. I'd be linen shirt, linen pants,

1113
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,940
dark tan skin, white ass teeth. No, no, no, no. We would be fully assimilated.

1114
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,520
We'd be wearing... Yeah, I would have... No, I'd have like... They sell...

1115
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,260
Everyone wears Patriots and Red Sox merch, too. Really? How much tanning I

1116
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,000
do, how much tanning I would be doing, my eyes would be so white 'cause

1117
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,540
of my sunglasses. I'd take 'em off and it'd be jarring. And you would be

1118
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,140
more jarring for you. You'd be blonde. Kind of like a reverse Uncle Fester.

1119
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,460
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Or I have a lot of hair. Yeah. Speaking of the

1120
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,500
Red Sox thing, I guess that's a big... In Mexico, I know this because...

1121
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
I should be Cameron Fester.

1122
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
There's a guy.

1123
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
You should.

1124
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
Cameron Fester would be good.

1125
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:40,300
The guy who works at Gordo's said that his uncle, the Mexican guy there, Fabricio, said

1126
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,060
that his uncle was a Red Sox fan.

1127
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,960
And then he took a selfie with my mom and dad.

1128
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,700
It seems like there was a lot of Boston sports fans.

1129
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,700
I thought you were going to explain why.

1130
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,700
He explained all that and I did not say anything.

1131
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,500
You literally said I know another guy who is a Red Sox fan.

1132
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,580
You know, wait, you knew a guy who was a fan of the Red Sox?

1133
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,180
He said that it's big down there, the Red Sox are a big team.

1134
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,180
They are.

1135
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,180
But why, I guess is my question.

1136
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,180
I don't know.

1137
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:04,900
Also, I saw in a souvenir shop, they had a poncho, a Patriots poncho with the Pats

1138
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,780
logo that said Patriots. And I was talking to the guy because I was like, I was

1139
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,780
thinking about like, I'm probably not going to buy this, but I was like just

1140
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,860
looking at it and the guy came over and was like, oh, you want to buy it? And I

1141
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,620
was like, no, I'm just I'm from Boston, like where the Patriots are from. And he

1142
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,780
was like, oh, Boston. Yeah, I think we might have some Boston merch, like

1143
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,860
Boston sports stuff somewhere. So we didn't know that the Patriots even were.

1144
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,060
Well, because it's not actually from Boston.

1145
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,460
No, they're from Foxborough.

1146
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,460
- No, yeah. - Foxborough.

1147
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,060
- New England. - But, I know it's

1148
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,860
the New England Patriots, but he doesn't even know

1149
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,220
what Boston is, is what I'm saying.

1150
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,060
But he basically was going to go look for Boston stuff.

1151
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,660
- Famous Mexican Red Sox player,

1152
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,460
Speedy Gonzalez.

1153
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,740
- He didn't play.

1154
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,820
- You can hit the cricket on him.

1155
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,180
- Yeah, we're gonna give a cricket,

1156
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,500
and actually we're gonna do a cricket

1157
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,900
and a trombone for that one.

1158
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,740
- Yeah.

1159
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,220
(trombone playing)

1160
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,740
- But, because that feels a little too mean,

1161
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,340
we'll give you one applause.

1162
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,660
- There we go.

1163
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,740
(cheering)

1164
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,440
I like the I like the wand. I like the record scratch, but maybe that's just my

1165
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,480
I'm coming to record scratch is I think my favorite. I'm into trying to not log

1166
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,640
stuff. I like the trumpet still the trumpet.

1167
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:13,040
Yeah, we are in a new era.

1168
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,440
We are in an incredible new era.

1169
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,040
This show. It's kind of scary not having to hold my mic though. I'll say that.

1170
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,440
Yeah, I don't know what to do with my hands. So funny. I have been going like

1171
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,440
I've been crossing my arms and shit. I'm not even playing with the screw anymore.

1172
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
With your nail.

1173
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,440
Yeah. Well, you weren't here when we talked about the nail.

1174
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,440
He has a nail. I found out that he has a nail that pokes through his side of the table.

1175
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,440
I knew about that nail.

1176
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
There's a nail that goes nowhere.

1177
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
He plays with it all the time.

1178
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,440
Yeah, I know he plays with it. He hurts himself on it.

1179
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Wait, you know everything. You actually are lying.

1180
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
I sit next to him.

1181
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
He pays attention.

1182
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
I sit next to him.

1183
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,440
You both sit next to me.

1184
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
I sit next to him maybe more than mine.

1185
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
He is not listening.

1186
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Yeah. I guess you're more aware.

1187
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,440
He's aloof.

1188
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,440
Yeah, you're more aware of the shit that I do probably. I mean,

1189
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,360
having to sit next to me on like a plane and stuff,

1190
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,200
that is pretty rough. It's really rough for you. I know he doesn't give a shit,

1191
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,000
but you, I know I'm sitting there going like...

1192
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,080
He's posing for the stewardesses. Wait, what did you say? I'm trying to get

1193
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,480
the stewardess's attention. I've never noticed you on a plane. What do you do

1194
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,440
on a plane? Well, think about how he acts in the passenger seat of your

1195
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,320
car. Where he touches things? Yeah. Yeah. Does that bother you? And then

1196
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,120
- I was thinking about that in the emergency exit row.

1197
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,960
(laughing)

1198
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,800
- Oh yeah.

1199
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,640
(laughing)

1200
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,040
- He's tracing, E, X, E on the fucking red sign.

1201
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,880
- I'm turning--

1202
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,700
- He's touching the handle.

1203
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,920
- He's like, he's not good on planes,

1204
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,120
we're taking like a two hour flight.

1205
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,360
- I was beautiful on the planes.

1206
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,180
- Really?

1207
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,020
- You guys would have been so proud of me.

1208
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:37,860
- I would have been proud.

1209
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:42,860
- I read 100 pages of some 19th century literature,

1210
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,680
I watched Eight Mile, I watched Men in Black,

1211
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,800
and I chewed my gum.

1212
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,280
- How long was the flight?

1213
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,120
- Four hours.

1214
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:53,120
times have we sat next to each other on a plane in the emergency exit?

1215
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,320
Because there's maybe twice. Yeah, there's more than what like it's two

1216
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,120
hour flights. And I know I'm trying to in my head, I'm like, oh, this will

1217
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,980
make him laugh and it'll make it easier for him to fly. Yeah. And I'm

1218
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:07,120
pretending to pull the door open. I'm sitting there doing a I'm getting

1219
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,480
like I'm trying to pull the emergency rafts and stuff

1220
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,440
from under the seat. Put the oxygen on your balls.

1221
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,460
Well, I want, okay, I've finally, I've grown and matured enough from

1222
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,040
being, having a primal fear of airplanes that I think I'm finally ready. I

1223
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,660
want the oxygen mask to come down on one of my flights. I did see a

1224
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,640
video the other day. I wanted to happen. I've... That was like a, it

1225
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,600
was like the aftermath of a really bad turbulence and the plane was completely

1226
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,240
silent and there was just like shit everywhere. Yeah. And I was like,

1227
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,040
"Oh, I've never actually had a scary experience on a flight." Yeah, for sure.

1228
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,200
like that is and the flight is the plane is still flying. Yeah, like I've I

1229
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,200
thought that I've had bad. Well, so the what the the the oxygen mask, because I

1230
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,200
don't want even little turbulence. I'm still I can't deal with the turbulence.

1231
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,440
I like turbulence. The oxygen mask, I think, would be would be awesome. Yeah,

1232
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,960
feels good,

1233
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,160
because when you have the oxygen mask, I mean, if you don't, if there's the

1234
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,880
oxygen mask doesn't come down, yeah, there's a chance we all pass out due to

1235
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,920
depressurization and we just don't know what's happening, right? Yeah, that's a

1236
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,880
and the oxygen mass comes down, that's the only time you're a hundred percent

1237
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,960
sure you're getting enough oxygen. Yep, yeah, well, but don't you kind of isn't

1238
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,120
that kind of the ideal way to go on a plane is that you you the ideal way to

1239
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,480
go on a plane is to your destination. That's true. That is

1240
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:33,120
land safely. Yeah, that was a good point. That was fire. Yeah, I guess you're

1241
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:38,280
right. I'm just thinking about I go into every I do feel so it's the only time I

1242
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,920
feel so comfortable with the thought of my own death is when I'm on a plane

1243
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,720
because I'm like literally there's nothing I can do. Plus a lot of people

1244
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,360
are going to die with me. It feels exactly

1245
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,280
it feels the exact same way as how I imagine. Imagine how embarrassing it would

1246
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,460
be to be the one guy who died in a plane crash. You know the kind of calm

1247
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,580
serenity. Imagine just sitting next to the guy who died. That happens. You know

1248
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:04,020
how calm you feel when you see a plane that you weren't expecting flying over

1249
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,940
you, like not a commercial plane, like some kind of weird plane that you've

1250
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,700
never seen before flying over you. You're like, oh, okay, so that might just

1251
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,500
drop a bomb on me and I'll just die right. I always feel like any way you

1252
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,960
mean. Oh, I thought you meant in a plane. No, I'm worried about I guess. I

1253
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,740
think that like helicopters to be a helicopter is going to hit a building

1254
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,840
or oh yeah, I guess I see think about that fly off and cut your head off.

1255
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,940
Yeah, helicopters are not good. I agree. No, I don't think I ever had to get

1256
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:33,220
med flighted somewhere. I say no, no, no, I'd say you take me. I bring the

1257
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,400
car. Yeah, bring

1258
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,240
ambulance. I am. I know we're on the side of a mountain. I know what happened

1259
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:44,460
Randy Rhoads, okay? This shit is not gonna happen. I'm just as good at guitar. You are

1260
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,700
not taking me out. I don't want to be the video of the lady spinning a thousand times.

1261
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:54,860
That was too funny. I don't want to be that. If I crash in this helicopter, I will be so

1262
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:00,580
fucking mad at you in the afterlife. I'm gonna haunt you like those kids haunt John Landis.

1263
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:05,380
They haunt the fuck out of him. That's why his son is all fucked up. That's why his son

1264
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,880
has a rainbow SJW hair because he had but does the opposite of that kind of stuff.

1265
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,180
He has a because he tries to bring more kids to life. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and

1266
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:18,620
of the way that's very bad. Yeah, that's a scary fellow, but God is movies are

1267
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:24,380
good. Oh, God, bright, bright. Holy shit. Yeah, craziest movie. I've ever

1268
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,620
guy needs to be. We needed like this guy needs to be basically Woody Allen or

1269
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,020
Polanski. He needs to be. He needs to be able to run away to another country and

1270
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:36,360
make whatever he wants forever. Everyone needs to sign a petition for him. I need

1271
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,200
Chronicle 2! His cream was all over a bunch of people's tops.

1272
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,420
He was creaming. That boy was creaming his crops. He's wearing

1273
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:50,260
SJW pants. He literally dresses like an SJW.

1274
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:54,900
Alright, give us one more soundboard thing to place out because I gotta leave.

1275
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:16,880
guys that's been podcast about Liz the battery is running low that was the

1276
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,580
perfect ending

1277
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,740
