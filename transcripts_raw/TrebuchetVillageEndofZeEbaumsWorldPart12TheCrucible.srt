1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
(Dramatic music)

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So like, it's crazy that Cartoon Network Studios is shutting down completely.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They've been completely vertically integrated with Warner Studios.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,400
- Before we start recording, I had to do a one after two.

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,240
- Wow.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,600
- Last time on Trebuchet Village.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,360
(laughing)

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
SpongeBob encounter.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,240
(laughing)

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,080
- Oh yeah.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,900
- I forgot.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,720
- The three heroes had a fight to the death

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,880
with a bunch of apes on top of a freaking SpongeBob.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
The yet pound who had been chasing them

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,840
since leaving Hot Babe Island appeared again

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,160
and was handedly defeated by Dogen's critical attack.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,840
This beast was then swept up by a Kaiju Manji,

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,060
features Longfutt Dead, whose awesome ghostly presence freaked everyone out but ultimately

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,600
he was pretty chill about the whole thing.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:16,520
Spongebob the Speeding Island then dropped you off directly onto Port Los Berry Berry,

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,720
the port city south of the academy town of Berry Berry.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,240
You hope to find a necromancer who can bide Quadro Mudmarks, your beloved mud companion

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,880
who has followed you for some time now.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,760
You will, however, need some help getting into the academy.

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,840
You can certainly ride the Popo River up to the town, which is more like a half-sunken

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,440
metropolis, but you'll run into some difficulty getting there without proper letters of introduction.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,040
The magic that is performed at the academy is under strict control since the Terrifier

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,040
and Exit Territory 100 years ago.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Albert the Witch had offered to make those introductions,

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,240
but literally right before she was going to give you

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,440
the letter of introduction, you said, and I quote,

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,240
"We completely exit out of this conversation.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
"It escaped 100 times, whatever it takes.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,040
"The Witch does not exist to me anymore.

35
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
"We've already started.

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
"Even though you're not describing it,

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,840
"the clock is ticking, we're already gone."

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,080
(laughing)

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,940
- What do you say with that?

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,940
I don't think we meant it like that at all.

41
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
I double checked.

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,940
I went back.

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,940
I was like, "Maybe -- did I get her to give them the letter?"

44
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,940
And right when she said, "I could make a letter -- I can make an introduction for you," Cam

45
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,940
says, "Completely exit -- I won't say it again."

46
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
And then you follow up.

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,940
Anyway, that does not mean all hope is lost.

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,940
Okay.

49
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,940
There are several ways you can get into the Academy that you'll have to do some digging

50
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,940
around Port Loseberryberry to figure out how.

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,940
And I'll show you -- I'll show you the way to get into the Academy.

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,540
And I'll show you the map.

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:04,340
And I sent this to you in our chat, but this is, you guys are basically like here.

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,040
You're just right off of the town.

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,140
This is where the town is.

56
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,840
This is where you will end up.

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,440
Okay.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,840
And then the goal would be to get into Popo Lake, which is over here,

59
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,560
and then ride up the Popo River

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,080
all the way up to the Academy Town over here.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,160
- I'm gonna be dead ass with you.

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,280
I don't want anything to do with the Popo.

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,480
- So the other way you could go is--

64
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,600
- Do we have to go through that dark forest

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,440
or should we just not even try it?

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
- I think we should go through the dark forest.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,520
That seems like it could be fun.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
- You could go through the dark forest too.

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,720
That would be the other option.

70
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,240
But yeah.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
- Could we not sail along the coast?

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
- The only thing, here's the thing.

73
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,000
The reason why, yeah, you don't have to go

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
through the river necessarily,

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,160
but the only way into the place is through the river.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
- Oh, well let's just go up the river.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,400
- But if you don't wanna find passage to the river,

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,240
you wanna go up here.

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,840
The thing is, it's just getting the access to the town.

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,660
That's really what it is.

81
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,600
So however you wanna get there, you just get access first.

82
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
- I've always been of the mind

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,320
that if I can get the interview, I can get the job.

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,760
- Right, yeah. - So as long as we can get

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,600
to the entrance of that river,

86
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,160
and you can get me, sit my ass in front of

87
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,400
some kind of superior officer.

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,760
So who's guarding us there?

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,120
- So it's a barrier that only allows

90
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
certain things to pass through.

91
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,160
I can explain how that works.

92
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,000
- So it's like a--

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
- It's like a bear, but even more.

94
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,000
So it's--

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,280
- Where, the woods or--

96
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
- So--

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,440
- I was drawing this creature.

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
- Take a look, Pat.

99
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
- You're gonna have to explain everything else to me.

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,760
I drew this kinda Grinch-like looking--

101
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,920
- That's still gotta be the worst drawing I've ever seen.

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
- It's not a Grinch.

103
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,920
- That's Five Nights at Freddy's.

104
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,120
You're over here drawing,

105
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,480
describing an amazing magical third world and I made a character for it

106
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,400
because I thought he would appreciate it I love what the character that I have to

107
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,040
keep around okay he doesn't look like a clown he has a jello he looks like a

108
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,720
bunch of hot dog buns put together he looks good he doesn't look bad okay so

109
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,640
who's here yeah Cameron so there's a barrier and he's ever seen I didn't say

110
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,600
that I said that Caleb said who's guarding I mean look at mine though

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,760
Who's guarding the barrier, so there's no one person guarding it. It's it's like a magical barrier here

112
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,800
I have a description of this I can tell you

113
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,080
And find my discredit got us all colored pencils

114
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,800
I'll never give you colored pencil. Why you don't trust us

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,160
No, we're gonna draw nipples

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,800
We're all drawing us when we grow up

117
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,360
So the way that you look like the way that like

118
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,000
And I'll explain this more when you go to the

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,600
When you can when you go to the town, I'll explain this more but port

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,280
Lowe's Berry Berry is kind of the economic arm of the Academy Town and the University which is pretty much

121
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,660
Isolated from most of the rest of the kingdom. So we have to go to a school

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,320
That's where you'll find somebody who can vive mud marks

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,920
Okay

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,520
So if you go up this river and go to this town, what happens is at a certain point

125
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,880
There is like an exchange of goods

126
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,680
So there's like these vessels that are these crystal vessels that are taken from the mines that are by

127
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,800
the Academy

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,560
Ships reach a drop-off point they account for the goods. They finalize negotiations, you know, check the ledgers

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
yada yada yada, trade representatives from the town

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,900
and from here meet.

131
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,160
They transfer the goods onto these crystal vessels.

132
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,600
- Has my character been here before?

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
I don't remember.

134
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,640
- You probably would have been.

135
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,680
One of your, your character's been around a while

136
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,080
and he's been kidnapped a lot.

137
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,040
And--

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,480
- So I might have, can I do an investigation

139
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,160
to see if I know the area?

140
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,640
- I mean, you, I can tell, what I can tell you

141
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,920
is that you know, you know what Port Lowe's Berry Berry is.

142
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,800
You've probably been here before.

143
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,120
I think, let me think if you would have.

144
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,420
You probably have been here before as one of your characters

145
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,700
on, if it was either in an escape attempt or on business,

146
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,580
because a lot of unscrupulous like magic shit,

147
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,180
that a lot of that goes on in the academy for sure.

148
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,060
- Unscrupulous?

149
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,560
- Yeah, it's a good word.

150
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,480
But a lot of those who leave the academy

151
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,960
and then don't like, for good reasons and bad reasons,

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,360
end up in Port Loseberryberry

153
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,660
because they're kind of more free to practice

154
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,000
what they want to practice.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,840
- Okay.

156
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,300
- So I could see you having been kidnapped

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,140
by somebody here at some point.

158
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,820
- Or doing business.

159
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,140
- Or doing business here, yes.

160
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,660
There's a, and I'll talk more about the,

161
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,180
there's a black market in Port Loseberry Berry

162
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,780
that's a pretty decent part of it.

163
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,260
But anyway, yeah, so basically you get to that barrier.

164
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,340
If you can either, if you can get onto those

165
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,740
like crystal vessels, then you could potentially

166
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,260
slip through the barrier.

167
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,820
- All right, well let's just run up this,

168
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,100
not run, don't quote me on that.

169
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,140
- I won't. - Let's run.

170
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,580
let's swin don't let's ride him all the way up the river. Uh-huh let's

171
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:13,580
commandeer a crystal ship and then let's go into the the building. Okay cool. All

172
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,940
in all in favor say aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Perfect. Do we say it in the voice? I guess yeah.

173
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,020
What just happened right now is is Chuggie said aye first and then we both

174
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,380
just that all of the I I didn't I wasn't paying attention what we voting on we

175
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,620
were voting on

176
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,860
so I I take my I'm bad

177
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,880
so so yeah I vote I on you swimming

178
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,140
me swimming up the river up the river

179
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,640
I go proto okay I will say you'll

180
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,900
you'll just wanna be if you do that you'll just I think

181
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,780
being in a submarine kinda mood will be ideal because

182
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,420
again, a lot of the trade is monitored.

183
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,260
- So you need the right choice.

184
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,100
- People know what the best is.

185
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,300
- And we stay under the surface.

186
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,980
- Yes, so if you're gonna do that,

187
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,140
I would do it that way.

188
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,180
- Yeah, what are you doing then?

189
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,940
- And also, as far as the entrance to like docks to board,

190
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,060
I mean, there's a number of different ways you can,

191
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
obviously you can go to Port Lowe's,

192
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,540
very, very to stay there,

193
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,160
and then there's docks from there that you can,

194
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
you'd have to, you couldn't really just like board a guy,

195
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,400
I guess. - Yeah.

196
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,700
- So you could either, you could do that,

197
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,900
or you can just stay there and then go down,

198
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,220
maybe find a little clearing where you can go

199
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,620
and then board him and then ride the river right up.

200
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,860
I think that makes sense to me.

201
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,680
- Okay.

202
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,220
- Or you can just go right now.

203
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
The only thing would be that like--

204
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,700
- Oh yeah, he's in guy mode, right?

205
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,580
- He is in guy mode.

206
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
- Which guy are you?

207
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,100
- You can still sound like you if you want.

208
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,480
- I could be in guy mode.

209
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,980
- You could be guy mode.

210
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,100
- I'm trying to remember, I could be guy mode.

211
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,160
could be a new whole guy could be someone you saw my god wait guy mode Kruger

212
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,500
what I don't I don't want anything to do with Fred I'm not even gonna entertain

213
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:05,660
that thought that's terrifying yeah try again fuck yes dude Freddy Krueger

214
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,620
the fucking shows up and I could scare them you're already a submarine with a

215
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,060
face that's fucking scary as shit scary I have to pause really quick to on to

216
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:23,340
okay we're back it's very Jewish just do it all right okay so I'm in guy mode

217
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,180
your last character Freddy Krueger we're different you would have had to have

218
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,340
seen Freddy Krueger and it's been established that my character is the

219
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,020
only one who's seen Freddy and I will walk out if you become Freddy Krueger my

220
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,540
character will quit the fucking I'm not kidding you will quit the adventure

221
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,020
because of how terrified I can get at movies.

222
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,860
- Please don't do it.

223
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,980
Please don't do it.

224
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
Please do it.

225
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,060
- All right, then I'm in guy mode

226
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,740
and I'm gonna be my fourth and final version,

227
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,580
which is Daniel Rabineau.

228
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,340
- Okay, Daniel Rabineau.

229
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,740
- Okay.

230
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,380
- So what does Daniel Rabineau look like?

231
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,620
- Daniel Rabineau, he walks like this.

232
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,580
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,420
- That's good.

234
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,460
- He sounds exactly like the guy at the hardware store

235
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,180
that nobody except me has met.

236
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,860
(laughing)

237
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,700
That's pretty crazy.

238
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,180
- And Chuggy has met him.

239
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,020
- Yeah. - Oh yeah.

240
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
- Yeah, right.

241
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,180
- It's a great hardware store.

242
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,300
There's two brothers.

243
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,900
One of them is like a old,

244
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,400
like they look exactly the same.

245
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,860
One of them's like, "Hey, how you doing?"

246
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,740
And the other one's like, "Hello, how are you?"

247
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
They're great.

248
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,260
- I think this is based on,

249
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,180
it's a voice based on Harvey Fierstein

250
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,100
and also my driver's ed instructor.

251
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,340
- Nice, same guy?

252
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,060
- No, but they could have been.

253
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,980
(laughing)

254
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,620
- Oh yeah, I don't know.

255
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,180
I think I remember this place.

256
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,020
I don't really know.

257
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,220
- What does he look like?

258
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,980
- He's four foot one.

259
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,820
- Dwarf.

260
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
- That's what I was saying,

261
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,540
was describe yourself in the third person.

262
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,700
- We're both dwarves too, by the way.

263
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,980
- I'm four foot one.

264
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,820
- That me up.

265
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,640
- I have tons of fun.

266
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,480
- That me up.

267
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,220
- Yeah, that's how all dwarves are.

268
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,540
- And I have just normal clothes on.

269
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,380
- Okay.

270
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,740
- I don't feel like describing what this character looks like.

271
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,900
- I'm having a strong urge to mate with you

272
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,140
because you are of my same species.

273
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,900
- I don't have any parts.

274
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,500
(laughing)

275
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,340
I come plummeting.

276
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,500
- Is that why you sound like that?

277
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,660
- No, I sound like this 'cause of I've been smart.

278
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
You're making it yourself.

279
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Let me see.

280
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
I rip off his clothes.

281
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,660
Oh my god.

282
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,020
You can wear a strength jacket.

283
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,460
It looks like you're pulling this.

284
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,300
It looks completely like porridge.

285
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
There's nothing.

286
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
It looks like porridge.

287
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,500
I look like you put porridge in a bag.

288
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,300
I have not been taking care of myself in my old age.

289
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
You look really bad.

290
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,740
I haven't been taking care of myself in my old age.

291
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,340
Can I start using him like a duff where I go up to people and I'm like, "You think I'm

292
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,940
ugly and fucking fucked up and short.

293
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Look at him."

294
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,180
I mean, people know what dwarves are.

295
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,820
- Something like the--

296
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,420
- I thought, this seems like a particularly bad specimen

297
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,860
of dwarf maybe.

298
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,620
- It's my memory of a dwarf.

299
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,340
- And you said he looks like porridge.

300
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,100
- Yeah, I look like a bag of porridge.

301
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,060
- Did you, wait, the guy who this is based on,

302
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,700
did you see his genitals and it looked like that?

303
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,660
- Oh, absolutely.

304
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,780
- Okay.

305
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
- Okay, cool.

306
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,780
So yeah, you guys are in this little cove

307
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,160
where the SpongeBob Island dropped you off.

308
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,900
And you hear some faint sounds of struggle going on from the far

309
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,200
back of the cove.

310
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,900
And you hear it kind of increasing in sound.

311
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,000
And then all of you roll a dexterity saving throw right now.

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you for adding right now.

313
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,460
Right now.

314
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,200
This instant.

315
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Can you tell me what I got, Caleb?

316
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,300
Yeah.

317
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,260
You got a 5.

318
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,700
OK, plus 1.

319
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,460
And I got a 7.

320
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,820
I got a 6.

321
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
What did you get, Pat?

322
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Fifteen.

323
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Okay.

324
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Pretty cool.

325
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Where's my notes for this guy?

326
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Do we still have the same HP?

327
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Yeah, you do.

328
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Oh, okay.

329
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
Oh, yeah.

330
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
Oh, yeah.

331
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Wait, is it full?

332
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Do we do, like, a long rest?

333
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
No.

334
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
No, you guys just showed up here.

335
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
It's the same.

336
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,820
Brah.

337
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Brah.

338
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Brah.

339
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Brah.

340
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Brah.

341
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
He rolled a one.

342
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,820
He rolled a two.

343
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
Okay.

344
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Will he get three?

345
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
That is...

346
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
All right, so you two are going to be the first to get three.

347
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Okay.

348
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,220
That is -- all right.

349
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,560
So you two take seven damage as these feathers come flying at

350
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,460
you like arrows, but it's just feathers and they're just

351
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,900
sticking inside of you.

352
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,500
And you see pouring out of the darkness this like one wing just

353
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,840
flopping around, shooting feathers out of itself.

354
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,180
And you see this young elvish woman jump on this thing and try

355
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,880
to stab it.

356
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
We need you all to roll for initiative.

357
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Oh God.

358
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Wow.

359
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Wow, just wow.

360
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
13.

361
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Welcome to our strange adventure.

362
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,880
And it will be strange all day.

363
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,880
I got a 12.

364
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Oh my God, 11, 12, 13?

365
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Holy shit.

366
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Whoa, 13 means she's evil?

367
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
My name is Evil Star.

368
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
What did you get?

369
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Five.

370
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
You got five?

371
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Stop cheating on the homework.

372
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Who?

373
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,380
You!

374
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,880
Oh.

375
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,540
Well he's putting it right in front of us.

376
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,040
That's initiative order, guys.

377
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
It's not secret.

378
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,540
Mm-hmm.

379
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,580
It is secret.

380
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,740
It's not secret.

381
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,380
And if you paid attention to any of our D&D sessions,

382
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,040
you know that's actually some of the most sought-after information

383
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,380
for any combat situation.

384
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,880
And it should be fucking secret if it's so fucking important.

385
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,780
It's for the people.

386
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm gonna press this button.

387
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
There's no buttons in here.

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,180
See, something happened exactly...

389
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,240
There might...

390
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,880
There's no button...

391
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,540
There might be buttons in here by now.

392
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,740
There are buttons around.

393
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,380
Shuggy...

394
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
There might be buttons in here by now.

395
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,900
By the time this is, there might be buttons.

396
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,420
There's a switch.

397
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,940
There's switches that I'm pressing.

398
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,300
Yeah, those are buttons.

399
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,580
No, those are lights.

400
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,700
There may or may not be buttons.

401
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,180
So this stout, elvish woman, she's trying to wrestle this thing to the ground,

402
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,460
and she takes out her dagger and she just fucking whiffs it.

403
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,620
She tries to stab this thing and she misses.

404
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,100
She goes to stab it again and she misses again.

405
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,260
That time she doesn't even hit where you're supposed to roll the dice.

406
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,760
Yeah, she just does horribly.

407
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,460
I mean, this is also meant to be a map.

408
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,460
So if you guys want to see the layout of this.

409
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,360
So here's the cove kind of right and here is where the feathers are.

410
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,760
This is that Frankenstein?

411
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,160
No, it's more now.

412
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,560
It's more.

413
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,360
This is the elven woman.

414
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
This is the feather.

415
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,960
So we are literary expert.

416
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,560
So you guys we didn't actually know.

417
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,160
I just really didn't pick your pick your figurines for this big.

418
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I'm getting the big fatty.

419
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
You're going to get the big fatty?

420
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Yeah.

421
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
This will be just for this combat.

422
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Where are we going?

423
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Where do you want to go?

424
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
I'll be the little.

425
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
As long as you're kind of like around here.

426
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Oh, as long as you're -- okay.

427
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Go anywhere as long as you're right here.

428
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm the little.

429
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
In this space.

430
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

431
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
So now I put my piece down.

432
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
You picked it up and ran it around.

433
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Sorry.

434
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
I'm right there.

435
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Where are you?

436
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Right there.

437
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
You're not there.

438
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
You can be anywhere in these like squares over here.

439
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Just put them down.

440
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I guess you decided for me.

441
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
All right.

442
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Cool.

443
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
So, yeah.

444
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
She misses and I'm going to be the little.

445
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,640
Alright, cool. So, yeah, she misses and she's not even really regarding you guys.

446
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Evil, you're up.

447
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,160
Alright, I'm going to kill her with my crossbow.

448
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Okay, she's attacking the feather thing that attacked you, just to remind you.

449
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,640
Yeah, but I don't, I mean, okay.

450
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
You can attack her too, I just want to make sure you knew that.

451
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,160
I knew that. I knew that.

452
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
I knew that.

453
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Okay, alright.

454
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,160
But because you spoiled my original plan, I will now be attacking the feathered man.

455
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,160
And I will attack him with long range on my crossbow.

456
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,160
It's sort of like a wing that's just flopping around. Go for it.

457
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,160
That is a 16.

458
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Okay, that hits for sure.

459
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
And I roll 1d8.

460
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Now my armor is low.

461
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm going to take you on 1d8.

462
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
That's not a d8, is it?

463
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
No. I forget which one's which.

464
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm going to take you on a 1d8.

465
00:17:50,160 --> 00:18:07,280
to

466
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
- Is this the strongest character we've ever faced?

467
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
- It's one of the strongest characters.

468
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
- Oh my god.

469
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
- And yeah, she sort of regards you for the first time.

470
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
And she's like, "Oh, good shot!"

471
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
She's excited to see.

472
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
- Thank you.

473
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
- Yeah, it's pretty much almost dead,

474
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
but you can probably finish him off.

475
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
- Oh, oh, oh, okay.

476
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
She's still struggling around.

477
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Dogen, you're up.

478
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,280
- Okay, I'll run up to the wing.

479
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
- I'm gonna hit it with my attack,

481
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Which is a -- that's a 17.

482
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,780
Does that hit?

483
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Also, here's what I'll say.

484
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,780
Now that we're doing the grid and stuff,

485
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,780
you can move here and we're playing flanking rules

486
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,280
where you're going to get plus two to any roll if you're flanking.

487
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Okay.

488
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
So that does a 19.

489
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
That still hits.

490
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
That is 11 damage.

491
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
And then I get another attack?

492
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Yeah.

493
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Because that doesn't kill it,

494
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,320
wing thing and it's not looking too good.

495
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,120
Okay my second attack is a, I guess a 16 with flanking.

496
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Mm-hmm, that hits.

497
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,640
Okay, that is three damage.

498
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Okay, cool.

499
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Yeah, three.

500
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Nice, yeah.

501
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,960
Okay, so yeah, this thing is like flopping around, it's not looking so good.

502
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,160
It is now gonna go though, and after getting like started jabbed, it's shovel, you're jabbing

503
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,400
your shovel into this thing.

504
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
It's an oar now.

505
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Yeah, the oar, sorry.

506
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm sorry.

507
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Wow.

508
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Yeah.

509
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
So just try and keep track of stuff like that.

510
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Yeah, I should.

511
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,080
It's going to like sort of retch and like split.

512
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,760
You're going to see it kind of like almost like build with meat inside of it and then

513
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,440
split into two wings and then flap.

514
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,400
And it's going to launch three magic missiles at you.

515
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Which automatically.

516
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,320
That's not a real thing.

517
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Three magic missiles?

518
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,040
So magic missiles are like the most classic spell ever.

519
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,680
And what do these missiles look like?

520
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Magical.

521
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Purple.

522
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,600
What are they, just a floating green missile, basically?

523
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,080
Greenish-bluish missile with white sparkles coming off the back of it?

524
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Maybe they're made out of wood?

525
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Yeah, and they look cool.

526
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
I don't know why they're wood.

527
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
It's a pretty good description.

528
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Because wood is basically what it is now instead of in the future when it's metal.

529
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,680
Are you sticking this bullshit from him?

530
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,680
So that is 15 damage.

531
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
15 damage to me?

532
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
Yeah.

533
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Oh man, I'm at 2.

534
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Yeah.

535
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Whoa!

536
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Don't sell yourself short.

537
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
You're not at 2.

538
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
You're at 10.

539
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Chuggie, you're up.

540
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
That's not 10.

541
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
That's not getting exciting.

542
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,520
So when it does that, it's kind of like almost like it's flying, like it's batting its wings

543
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,680
at you, but except these missiles of light are just shooting out of its wings.

544
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,320
i've seen this woman

545
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,400
in a tree

546
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,360
consistent to meetings

547
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,920
these two floppy quicks

548
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,520
so

549
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,840
so what i've been doing a bit inside talking about the way yeah

550
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,720
good i'm not talking about the woman who just saved us i'm talking about the

551
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,020
way so i was honestly doing a bad job so

552
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,440
europe though uh... chuggies slash

553
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,760
i need some water

554
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
I need some water before I do anything.

555
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,360
So you did wash up on a shore, so if you want, you'd probably have to use both your full

556
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,280
movement but you could probably get to the shore and have some salt water.

557
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm like, I'm not doing anything until I get some water.

558
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:45,080
And then I do enthralling performance so that everybody has to listen to me complain.

559
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,680
Okay, cool.

560
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Describe Enthralling Performance for me.

561
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
I believe it should be --

562
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,180
Enthralling Performance is creatures that watch and listen to you perform for one minute.

563
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
Each makes a wisdom saving throw.

564
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,180
Unfortunately, you have to do it for a minute.

565
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,680
Yeah. Daniel Rabineau is going to do it for a minute.

566
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,180
So you can start doing it now, but every round of combat is only six seconds.

567
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,680
So you can just like start --

568
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,180
Why did you make it like a minute and not like 30 seconds?

569
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,180
I didn't make that. That's an ability you would use in like -- not in combat.

570
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Can we edit it?

571
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:23,180
is

572
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
What do I have for actions again?

573
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
For attacks, I mean you got...

574
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Oh right, I got the spell cards.

575
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
You got tons of spells. Yeah, use those spell cards.

576
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Oh, okay.

577
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Do the same thing.

578
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,180
I'm gonna do the same thing and I'm gonna use Dissonant Whispers.

579
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Hell yeah.

580
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Which is, you whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear,

581
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,180
wracking it with terrible pain.

582
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,180
The target must make a wisdom saving throw.

583
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:56,100
on a failed save it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction if available

584
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:03,100
to move as far as its speed allows away from you the creature doesn't move into obviously

585
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,660
dangerous grounds such as fire or hit.

586
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,800
What if they succeed?

587
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,540
On a successful save the target takes half as much damage and doesn't need to move away.

588
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
So it did succeed.

589
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Ah fucker.

590
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,180
But it takes half as much damage so still roll those 3d6.

591
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:23,300
4, 5, 5.

592
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,980
That's pretty good. So that's 14. So that still takes a 7 damage.

593
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,020
That still kills it.

594
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,060
Describe your... what do you say to it then?

595
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,660
You killed the wing?

596
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,300
I'm completely parched. I'm completely parched right now.

597
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,140
I don't know why nobody is getting me any water.

598
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,460
It like starts retching. It's like horror. This is like the worst thing it's ever heard.

599
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,700
And you see this thing, and as it's retching, it starts to sprout legs.

600
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,580
You see the beginnings of a head start to sprout out.

601
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,540
And then it just...

602
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,620
And what are you doing? You look disgusting.

603
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,340
You look completely disgusting right now.

604
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,580
It folds into itself into this ball of meat.

605
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,940
And just lies dead.

606
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,500
Ball of meat and feathers. You immediately go to eat it?

607
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,460
Boneless wing.

608
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,700
Oh great, the food came out before the drinks.

609
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,340
Okay, yeah.

610
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,900
Amazing.

611
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,900
You go to run over to eat it, and the elven woman says,

612
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,980
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, please, please, please."

613
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,260
Blah blah blah, please please please, that's all y'all ever say to me!

614
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,380
Put it in my mouth.

615
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Okay, yeah.

616
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,380
She's like...

617
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,380
What?

618
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
I suppose...

619
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
I burp out a feather into her mouth.

620
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,880
Thank you for...

621
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,380
I do it again.

622
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,380
Thank you for your...

623
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,880
Thank you for your help.

624
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
You're welcome.

625
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,380
I just...

626
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,380
Well, alright.

627
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Who are you three? Thank you.

628
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,380
I'm Daniel Rabinow, and I am parched.

629
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,020
Do you have any kind of water?

630
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,620
Yes, back at the Nimrods I can get you some water.

631
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,980
Oh, how about you just go get that right now?

632
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,580
Because I've been waiting.

633
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,020
Do you want me to go get the water

634
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,500
and bring it back to this cave?

635
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,660
What are you talking about?

636
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,100
There's water all over the place.

637
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,860
That's salt water.

638
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,660
I can't drink that.

639
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,980
I run to the cove, and I start drinking the ocean water.

640
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
You're just eating everything.

641
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,100
I just start slurping up the ocean water.

642
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,060
I need you to roll a Constitution saving throw

643
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,620

644
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,400

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,260
of young girls if I'm fucking pulling

652
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,300
the trigger in an episode of D&D says

653
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
- Nerds can be sexy too.

654
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,540
(laughing)

655
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,880
- Alright, first I gotta get,

656
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,020
Dogen because I forget his name.

657
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
- Daniel Rabineau.

658
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,280
- Okay, well still, now I don't like you.

659
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,660
Do I, how do I, do I look thin to you?

660
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,860
- You look disgusting.

661
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,120
(laughing)

662
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,460
You look completely, look.

663
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
- You could stand to lose a few pounds of water

664
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,300
and win me.

665
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,500
(laughing)

666
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,000
- I can see your stomach skin poking through your chain mail.

667
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,300
- You throw up the salt water and the wet meat,

668
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,360
and she runs over and she's like,

669
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,200
"Oh, thank you, can I take this now?"

670
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,040
I'm gonna take it, she takes the meat.

671
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,680
- Oh my god, you're touching his throw up.

672
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,400
That's turning me on for some reason.

673
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,920
- I've been trying to tell the Nimrods

674
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,120
that there have been these winged creatures

675
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,440
lying around all across the coast.

676
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,160
- That ain't gonna prove it, that's a meatball.

677
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,640
- I know, but it's a star.

678
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,480
- The ball of meat doesn't look like a wing at all

679
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,800
It looks now just like this with this like like is it wing shaped at all could you unfold it?

680
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,840
It's kind of like a reveal a wing now. It's like almost like a congealed as I was

681
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:58,780
Angel mud oh my god, that would be amazing. That's a really good idea, but I don't think we have I think maybe

682
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,200
You know what to capture one of those things alive. You know we or we could just kill a bird

683
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,080
No, or just kill it rip its wings isn't it made out of mud couldn't we make mud wings with feathers?

684
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,480
But that basically, but it's a Mud Marks,

685
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,720
but we want it to be winged.

686
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,560
If it's all just mud.

687
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,160
- It's got human heads.

688
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,080
- Yeah.

689
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,360
- It's gotta be multiple, I mean, come on.

690
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
- What's Mud Marks?

691
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,080
(screaming)

692
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,960
- Shut up and don't ever talk to us again.

693
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,720
- You don't get to know about Mud Marks.

694
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,560
- Okay, well.

695
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,880
- I just learned about it, and I honestly, I don't like it.

696
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,000
But I have to see what happens.

697
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,680
- Well, okay, I'm gonna head back to--

698
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,160
- Oh wait, I got a question.

699
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
- Sure.

700
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
- So, there's a whole school at the top of the river.

701
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,520
- The university?

702
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,360
- Yes, sir.

703
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,180
- Yes, of course.

704
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,320
- Okay, so you didn't know that, you looked it up.

705
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,800
But listen, what?

706
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
- Wait, did she look it up?

707
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,840
- She looked it up, she looked, I don't know,

708
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,000
she's a witch, we gotta burn her.

709
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,240
- I'm not, I'm a--

710
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,080
- Okay, you're not a witch.

711
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,920
- I'm a rodman.

712
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,740
- Fine, you're just a--

713
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,580
- No, wait, you're a what?

714
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,400
- A rodman.

715
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,240
- Straight Dennis.

716
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,080
- A rodman.

717
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,920
- A rodman.

718
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,740
- And then there's nimrod.

719
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,760
- I'm a part of the nimrods.

720
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,720
- Okay, wait.

721
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,680
and then i thought you just a nimrod okay do that do it

722
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,300
rodman and then we're out of steel

723
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,920
this thing is a way to do it

724
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,400
we just say we're gonna do it to see the things do it

725
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,800

726
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,920

727
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,080

733
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840

why is it called the nimrods that if if it's not you're not in a rock this

737
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,640
opposes made somebody laugh along the way

738
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,200
so do you or any of your nimrod brothers and sisters ronan broadman uh... yeah

739
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,340
do you know how to get

740
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,040
into that

741
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,300
uh... academy

742
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,220
- Oh, well, you would need a letter of introduction.

743
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,700
- So do you have one?

744
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,500
- Well, all, all Rodman do, you have to pass the crucible.

745
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,060
And once you do, you can get in.

746
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,140
- So is the crucible easy?

747
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,980
- No.

748
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,060
- How, okay, all right.

749
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,060
- Let's go on a scale of easy to hard.

750
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,300
- On a scale of 20 minutes to two hours.

751
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,380
- On the two hour side.

752
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,100
- On the two hour side, how are we feeling?

753
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,180
- But then after, but then after you finish it

754
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,300
and you get the, and you get the letter of introduction,

755
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:36,740
And once you have that, then that's one minute to just vibe something from the letter.

756
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,420
Oh, you want to vibe?

757
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,500
And she finally sees the mud marks.

758
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,740
Just like, just kind of drooping over in the background, just comes into perfect focus.

759
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,380
It's just like, yeah, the frame is just totally-- All the tongues and all the heads are just

760
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
out.

761
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,380
Oh, he's thirsty!

762
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
We start throwing water on his pockets!

763
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,380
The heads are like, decomposing.

764
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,860
Yeah, I'm stuffing meat into the mess.

765
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
There's a crow eating one of the ears.

766
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Get off of them!

767
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
Get off of them, Unbox!

768
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Shoo!

769
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,860
Shoo!

770
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,860
Do you have crow problems?

771
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,380
Um, well, I mean I suppose, yes, if you...

772
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,700
Are a crow, is a crow an animal you would hunt?

773
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,620
Because we need to get crows away from this thing.

774
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:21,180
Because they keep, I have not seen, look, sometimes I'm a submarine, okay?

775
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,180
And...

776
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
I was just gonna say it.

777
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,180
And, I'll just tell you right now, sometimes I'm a submarine.

778
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,420
And the amount of crows that I have tried,

779
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,580
I have seen tried to pick through my skin.

780
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,100
- What? Listen to me.

781
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,940
- What?

782
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,760
- Not him.

783
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
- Okay.

784
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,440
- This one's weird.

785
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,260
- I was done talking.

786
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,100
- Yeah.

787
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,940
(laughing)

788
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,760
- There was like no real,

789
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,980
the question was.

790
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,820
- There was not, he just.

791
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,660
- He was a crow.

792
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,480
- Yeah, right.

793
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,580
- That's the question.

794
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
- Listen.

795
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,980
So the crucible, tell me what that entails exactly.

796
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,340
Well, it's a trial of both combat and survival.

797
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,140
It takes place underneath the Nimrod's Hall

798
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,660
in Port Los Berry Berry.

799
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,740
There are other ways to get to the academy.

800
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,300
I mean, I wouldn't recommend,

801
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,220
it's not for everyone to make it through that.

802
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,740
But could it be for us, just by looking at us?

803
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,260
And maybe we all go back to back to back like this.

804
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,180
I mean, you handled that creature better than I,

805
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,780
so I suppose so.

806
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,260
You're damn right we did.

807
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,220
You sat there on your hand and excuse my language.

808
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,100
You sat there on your fat ass the whole time.

809
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,620
No, it's understandable.

810
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,300
I don't even believe you're a Rodman.

811
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,860
I think you fucked your way to the top.

812
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,100
Yeah, where's your-- can I--

813
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,260
If you're really-- if you're--

814
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,500
Slut.

815
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,380
I can tell.

816
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,180
If you're really a Rodman, then take out

817
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,140
your letter of introduction right now and show us.

818
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,580
Otherwise, we're going to capture you,

819
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,540
bring you to the Nimrods, and show that you're

820
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,660
an imposter to everyone.

821
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,660
I don't know why I do this.

822
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,660
Well, it's a snap situation.

823
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
She's not going to think.

824
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,660
I'm already walking towards her with a big butterfly net.

825
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
I'm not going to show you my letter of introduction.

826
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
So we have to search you.

827
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
No, it's not.

828
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
They're specific.

829
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
They're not just for --

830
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
I tend to be you.

831
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,660
Oh, look at me.

832
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
I'm a hoe.

833
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
I'm a stupid hoe.

834
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Oh, my God.

835
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,660
I'm seeing double.

836
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Wow.

837
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
You really are an imposter.

838
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,300
are an imposter. I think we're gonna have to kidnap you and kill you and torture you and

839
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,780
roast you and eat you.

840
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,780
She's going to...

841
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,780
He's just kidding.

842
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
You wanna try that?

843
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
Listen to me.

844
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,780
He has behavior problems.

845
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
He's hyper. That's what we call him.

846
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Listen.

847
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
They're gonna diagnose what this is called.

848
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Pretty soon. It's coming up.

849
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,780
My nephew's just gonna offer it.

850
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
In 2000 years.

851
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
The diagnosis is coming for the alchemy and shit. In a couple years.

852
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
2000 years they're gonna make a little bit of money.

853
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

854
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
I'm not gonna lie.

855
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm not gonna lie.

856
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
I'm not gonna lie.

857
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
I'm not gonna lie.

858
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
I'm not gonna lie.

859
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
I'm not gonna lie.

860
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
I'm not gonna lie.

861
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,500
in a couple years they're gonna be 2000 years they're gonna make a little orange pill that

862
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,960
this guy can take.

863
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,860
Now listen up.

864
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,380
Can you introduce us to maybe is there maybe like a way to we don't have to study for the

865
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,380
crucible?

866
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,660
No, no, this it's it's so how do we get in?

867
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,980
Do we have to pay a fee?

868
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,820
Is it like is there no doctor?

869
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,540
Let me let me ask you this.

870
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,300
Is the crucible a play by Arthur Miller?

871
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Yes.

872
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
But I don't know what you're talking about.

873
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
She said yes.

874
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,300
No, someone else said yes, but I wasn't sure you were asking.

875
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,300
So she's going to say, he is going to lose his mind.

876
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:30,300
She's going to say, she's going to say,

877
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,300
the Crucible is just a trial that you can get to it pretty easily.

878
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
You have to prove yourself first.

879
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
My cousin's on trial.

880
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
On a hunt, which you've already done.

881
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,540
If you get done, I would vouch for you provided you don't rob me.

882
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,200
I would vouch for you.

883
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,600
And then once you do that, you just have to go do the --

884
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,040
I can introduce you to the folks at Nimrod Hall.

885
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,380
ZAC: All right. Let's do it.

886
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,340
Okay.

887
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,180
TIM: Okay. I say okay really loudly,

888
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,680
and I'm behind her.

889
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,580
I'm wearing a stocking over my head.

890
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,680
She didn't notice me.

891
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,920
[LAUGHTER]

892
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,320
ZAC: Okay. Let's go.

893
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,720
So today you guys walk up the coast to Port Los Beriberi.

894
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,420
And this is some -- I'm going to give you guys some context for

895
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,760
the place and also describe it as you're approaching it.

896
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,560
So where the academy is able to fund its operations through a

897
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,860
combination of money its students bring in,

898
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,800
its mining operation in the southern Dirtland Mountains,

899
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,700
and its exclusive trade deals with and lordship over Port Los

900
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:39,900
Berry Berry and and and it's exclusive trade deals with Lord and Lordship over

901
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,460
Port Lowe's Berry Berry which the Academy treats as its main economic and

902
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,740
political ambassador to the outside world and like I said the only people

903
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,980
who can enter the Academy are those who demonstrate extreme magical promise and

904
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:55,180
then also have the money and the tuition generally to to get in and then also

905
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,940
getting that letter of introduction the Academy town itself rarely accepts

906
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,180
outsiders.

907
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
But anyway, I'll keep going.

908
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Port Lowe's, very, very meanwhile,

909
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,580
is not so occult about everything.

910
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,460
It's a sizable port town.

911
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,740
It's governed by a council comprised mostly

912
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,820
of academy mages, former academy mages usually,

913
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,860
members of the Nimrods, as she's saying,

914
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,900
and a few merchants or influential members

915
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,820
of the town appointed by the Merchants Guild.

916
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,700
Despite being a port town, it's not so raucous

917
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,820
like Port Virtuegood, which is where

918
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,940
you guys had come from at the very, very beginning

919
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,680
campaign, or other areas in the archipelago.

920
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,380
It's an economic entity that runs like a well-oiled machine, albeit a machine with a few dangerous

921
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,380
quirks.

922
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,660
To keep up with the demands of being beholden to the Academy Town is well known that there's

923
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,660
a seedy underbelly in Los Beriberi that hums along with little conflict.

924
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,620
Whatever desire there was to stamp it out in the past has been supplanted by a need

925
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,500
to negotiate with the inevitable criminality of a place whose industriousness is due to

926
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,380
its subservience to a big, fancy Academy Town.

927
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,000
The port is beautiful. It's a town of full color, varied architecture,

928
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,600
courtesy of a rotating members of its guilds and open-mindedness of its people.

929
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,800
So it's got these, all the buildings, the streets and carriages are infused with sorceries and spellworkings.

930
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Again, it's like former mages kind of retired, so they've infused it with all this stuff.

931
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,920
And it's a classy place, correct? No twerking allowed?

932
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
No twerking at all.

933
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:27,000
Shipping supplies ferry off of boats by translucent purple conveyor belts fluttering along the docks.

934
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,600
So these boats get kind of brought in by these sort of like sparkles that float in the air

935
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,400
and they're, then they like port in and almost like a magnet, like they fix into the dock.

936
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:45,560
It's like a really weird combination of mechanical stuff and arcane stuff.

937
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,960
And then there's shops in the marketplace that advertise their goods, so you'll see

938
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,320
the marketplace as she's going to lead you there.

939
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,440
The Nimrods, you'll see them as you're walking into the town or parading around their latest

940
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,140
I'll explain more of this stuff as you guys get into the town.

941
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
But you're in the town.

942
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,080
It's this really pretty magical place.

943
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,440
But kind of like everyone there is kind of working.

944
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,780
Everyone there is kind of doing something.

945
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,380
And you enter first into the marketplace.

946
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,920
And she will lead you.

947
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,020
Whoa.

948
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,760
Oh my god.

949
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,460
Wow.

950
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,560
Oh my gosh.

951
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,000
You knew we couldn't resist a crucible.

952
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,920
you can resist a bunch of things. So here's where you guys are. And there's

953
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:41,160
Gough. So the marketplace... Wait, we brought the feathered guy with us? Oh whoops, sorry.

954
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,840
Wait, no, that's Mud Marks. Yeah, can that be Mud Marks? I didn't know if you wanted to have a cursor.

955
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:54,320
Yeah, let's have Mud Marks. Yeah, we have Mud Marks. He's in a radio flyer.

956
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,340
The market, so the market has a few different places. There's a few

957
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,180
tents that catch your eye. There's the one that's made of bones and meats and

958
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,580
pelts and fangs. It's a nimrod tent that's right over here. She'll lead you

959
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:14,020
there. Then there's the hanging garden stand with these vines spilling atop. It

960
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,540
has those plants that are gently swaying and sort of like moving about similar to

961
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,700
what you saw in Albert's Cove and that's over here. There's a little kobold woman and

962
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,700
and her elven assistants that are running this little tent over here.

963
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,700
And then further down, you see this sort of like,

964
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,700
strange sort of orange-ish, reddish tent,

965
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,200
with these little children running around it,

966
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,200
and sort of an unscrupulous looking dwarven man with a hood on,

967
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,200
sort of sending these like little imps about.

968
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,700
And yeah, she leads you to this tent.

969
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,200
And maybe there's another tent with like a guy selling like iPhone chargers.

970
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Yeah, there's another tent with a Lebanese guy

971
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,660
who's selling iPhone chargers and other things of that nature,

972
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,160
like power bars.

973
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,160
And then, yeah, so you guys get to this, the tent and...

974
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,240
- I go to the guy selling belts.

975
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,600
- Yeah, you can go to the belt guy.

976
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,440
Yeah, sure.

977
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,040
Belt guy, if you wanna like,

978
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,360
she was gonna introduce you to Nemrod's guys,

979
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,600
you wanna go to the belt guy, the belt guys are here.

980
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,280
- I wanna go to the orange red.

981
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,120
- The orange red tent?

982
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,440
Okay.

983
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,220
- I'm the big fat one.

984
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,220
I wanna go where mommy told me.

985
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,220
Mommy's going here.

986
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,720
Yeah.

987
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,920
I'm still with you, mommy.

988
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,220
So, everyone else left, but me and Mud Marks here are still with you.

989
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,720
Yeah.

990
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Mud Marks is with you?

991
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Mud Marks is with me.

992
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,220
Oh my god, Mud Marks is with me?

993
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,220
[laughter]

994
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,720
Wait, then I go over with Cameron.

995
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
It's like me and mommy's date.

996
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,220
I go over with Cameron and I'm like, "Oh my god, everything over there, but like..."

997
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,220
[laughter]

998
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
"Completely."

999
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,720
Okay.

1000
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,040
- And not even the good kind that you can't even tell from,

1001
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,280
you can't even tell from far away.

1002
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,480
You can tell from far away.

1003
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,320
- Bud Marks has a bootleg,

1004
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,280
and a leg out of a boot.

1005
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,040
So we'll resolve her and we'll resolve this first,

1006
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,360
and then we'll go over where you guys are.

1007
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,560
So...

1008
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,680
- Can I hold her hand?

1009
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm like really short.

1010
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,480
- Make a slight of hand check.

1011
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,560
- Slight of hand?

1012
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,480
- All right, you know what?

1013
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,800
You said it, not me.

1014
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,640
- Oh my God.

1015
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,880
(laughing)

1016
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,140
(laughing)

1017
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,080
- You just, yeah, you, you're,

1018
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,920
- Fell right down.

1019
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,000
- She's just like walking and then like suddenly

1020
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,320
she's holding your hand and she doesn't even know why

1021
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,240
and you just, yeah.

1022
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,920
- So what are we doing here, mommy?

1023
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,720
What's going on here?

1024
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,240
- Oh sweetie, she's like,

1025
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,160
here, this is, this is a commander Owen

1026
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,040
and you see this like imposing human man in front of you

1027
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,880
and he's got these two.

1028
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,340
- She's a lot taller than me, right?

1029
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,180
- He's huge.

1030
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,000
- No, she is.

1031
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,840
- She is, yeah.

1032
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh no, she's, she's an elf.

1033
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,600
She's like, she's like, I mean, yeah,

1034
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,360
She's she's taller than okay. Yeah by good amount. So yeah, I'm like at like chest height basically like holding her

1035
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Yeah, holding up to hold yeah

1036
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,600
And this guy you see that the beast that was brought in by the

1037
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,880
by the members of the

1038
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,520
Team the excuse me the Nimrod hunting group. It's a big beast behind them. It's a basilisk

1039
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,380
Really a cockatrice. It's just like a massive one. You see he has like these earrings

1040
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,220
he just made out of their eyes.

1041
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,180
And you see as his comrades sort of look over at him,

1042
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,140
whenever they do, the eyes have this residual magic.

1043
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,420
And so they start to turn to stone for a second

1044
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,780
and then stop, and then he like laughs at them.

1045
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,340
And he looks to you two, and he says,

1046
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,340
oh, hey, hey, Gough.

1047
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,140
What, you brought your son today?

1048
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,620
- Hello, I am me, and this is my mommy.

1049
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,780
And basically we are wanting to do the crucible,

1050
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,180
me and my two brothers.

1051
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,180
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1052
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,420
They're, they helped me today with the, well I was, I was uh.

1053

Oh you were, you were, you were not doing too well in the fight again.

1054
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Alright.

1055
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Oh so you guys.

1056
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,000
What the fuck, did you just say something rude to my mommy?

1057
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh no, no.

1058
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Your mom.

1059
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I start puffing up my chest.

1060
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Like stomping on the ground.

1061
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,260
Is this, this guy is not your kid right?

1062
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,260
No he's, he's not, he just, I don't know how he.

1063
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,060
I was just gonna do a confusion.

1064
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,060
A check?

1065
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,060
You confused me.

1066
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
And I got an E.

1067
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,060
It worked, it worked.

1068
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,060
Do I have a Ray of Confusion?

1069
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,060
You may have Ray of Enfeeblement.

1070
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,060

1071
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,060

00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,060
That's a really brutal spell.

1076
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,060
You go look through that.

1077
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,060
We'll go to where you guys are.

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,060
So you guys are by this tent.

- Wait, hold on.

1100
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,020
He said I might be looking to buy something.

1101
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,860
What is that?

1102
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,200
- Chill.

1103
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,040
- What is that?

1104
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,860

00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,600
- Here.

1108
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
You guys want to take a look at what he has.

1109
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Holy shit!

1110
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Oh my god.

1111
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
We planned Skyrim also.

1112
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Wait, wait, go up, go up.

1113
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
What was that acid?

1114
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
So many poisons.

1115
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Oh my god.

1116
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
A whole section for poison.

1117
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
I would like to sell him my hands.

1118
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Dog pepper?

1119
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
What the?

1120
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
What's dog pepper?

1121
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Let's find out.

1122
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,600
Similar to aniseed, but less potent.

1123
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
You so went to go make that a fantasy thing.

1124
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Similar to aniseed.

1125
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Aniseed.

1126
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
It can be used in a pursuit to throw dogs off the road.

1127
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
It's a very powerful poison.

1128
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
It's a very powerful poison.

1129
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
It's a very powerful poison.

1130
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
It's a very powerful poison.

1131
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
It's a very powerful poison.

1132
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
It's a very powerful poison.

1133
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,960
I'm not see on it can be used in a pursuit to throw dogs off the scent

1134
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,820
When a dog comes within 10 feet of your you can't hold it by the cord the cable

1135
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:17,280
It hurts dogs, it's dog pepper mm-hmm that scares dogs could be youth you youth could be useful

1136
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,440
glass cutter listening cone

Pinring

1138
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Oh, dog pepper.

1139
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
No, dog pepper.

1140
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,440
You guys aren't looking for work, too, are you?

1141
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Cane sword.

1142
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Yeah, I'm looking for work.

1143
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Poison, basic, assassin's blood.

1144
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Look, I'll do whatever.

1145
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I'll do whatever it takes to get more money.

1146
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
I don't care.

1147
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
We're not looking, we're trying to get.

1148
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,440
We're trying to do a...

1149
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Whoa, want to read this item out for us, Patches?

1150
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Sure.

1151
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,440
The name of this item really quick?

1152
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
Oil of Tagit.

1153
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,440
Hmm.

1154
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
That's not how I'm reading that word.

1155
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Well, that might be on you.

1156
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
That's supposed to be on your problem, right?

1157
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,440
Yeah.

1158
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
The oil of Tagit.

1159
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
I'm not sure what that is.

1160
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
I'm not sure what that is.

1161
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,440
That's not how I'm reading that word.

1162
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,440
Well that might be on you.

1163
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
That might be on your problem, right?

1164
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,440
The oil of Tigid.

1165
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Okay, wait, go up.

1166
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
What does Assassin's blood do?

1167
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Yeah, read that one. What's that say? Ass, ass, use blood?

1168
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
What the hell?

1169
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Creatures subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 con saving throw on a failed save.

1170
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Alright, I don't care about it.

1171
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Okay, cool.

1172
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,440
Now read the bible.

1173
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
I would like to buy some poison.

1174
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
I'm just gonna ask. Oh, a truth theorem.

1175
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:32,400
the

1176
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,400
here

1177
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:54,400
the

1178
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,400
If you let me buy one really deadly poison, we can call it even and say I have zero left.

1179
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
[Laughter]

1180
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
I think that actually might be fine.

1181
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,400
I'm willing to make that equalizing move.

1182
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
I do want to see if it exists here.

1183
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Where's your fucking...

1184
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Oh, it's Chuggy.

1185
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
I feel like I have at least a thousand.

1186
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,400
I know. I feel like you have a shit ton in your coffers back in Trebuchet Village.

1187
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Yeah, I don't think I have a thousand.

1188
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,400
But, yeah. Because you guys have a business.

1189
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
It's like...

1190
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,720
Okay, I'm just gonna...

1191
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,200
Here, how much is your...

1192
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
What's the deadliest poison you have?

1193
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Deadliest poison I have...

1194
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
Maybe one, man.

1196
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
Purple Worm Poison.

1197
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
What does that do to somebody?

1198
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
Well...

1199
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
Does it turn them into a purple worm?

1200
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Or does it only poison purple worms?

1201
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
Well, basically...

1202
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
What he'll say is...

1203
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Or is it the poison of a purple worm?

1204
00:46:51,200 --> 00:47:09,800

No.

He looks really upset and he starts looking down and he starts thinking a lot.

I guess I didn't really have...

1224
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,960
That name sounds familiar to me is what I'm trying to say.

1225
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Well, I didn't really have traditional parents.

My dad was a farmer.

1230
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,960
My dad was a farmer.

1231
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,960
My dad was a farmer.

1232
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,960
My dad was a farmer.

1233
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,960
My dad was a farmer.

1234
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,960
My dad was a farmer.

1235
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,960
My dad was a farmer.

1236
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,960
That name sounds familiar to me, is what I'm trying to say.

1237
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,760
Well, I don't really have traditional parents.

1238
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,600
My dad works in an art house.

1239
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
He's not my real dad though.

1240
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,560
Okay, I don't think you're who I'm thinking of.

1241
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,960
I don't think so either.

1242
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
So um, cool.

1243
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,960
Yeah, so you guys wanna...

1244
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,680
Yeah, I'm gonna rejoin the group.

1245
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,680
Come back to me?

1246
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
Yeah.

1247
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,680
The group.

1248
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,560
Wait, I'm asking you about some work.

1249
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Don't leave fucking...

1250
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,560
You guys almost left.

1251
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,560
No, he almost did.

1252
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,560
You guys wanna ask about what I am?

1253
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,560
You said I rejoin the group, you didn't say Ann I bring the squadron.

1254
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
So who's left there?

1255
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,560
It's his responsibility.

1256
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,560
Sherman, if you ever need a boat.

1257
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,560
Or a submarine.

1258
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,560
Well actually the work that my master has in mind

1259
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,560
My master/father has in mind

1260
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,560
Woah, this guy's his own dad's slave.

1261
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,560
Oh my god.

1262
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Would involve some sort of sea travel.

1263
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
You can go up to the lighthouse and meet with him if you want to.

1264
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,560
I'm sure he can make it worth your while, he's a powerful guy.

1265
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,680
This guy's a good choice.

1266
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
He's on a sea travel diet.

1267
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,280
You're gonna go up to the lighthouse?

1268
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,120
Yeah.

1269
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:02,960
Okay, so that's gonna be like--

1270
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,880
That's what you were saying, lighthouse?

1271
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,720
Lighthouse.

1272
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,440
I thought you were saying nut house.

1273
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,400
I said white ass.

1274
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,240
White ass.

1275
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,080
White ass.

1276
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,400
White ass.

1277
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,600
So that's gonna be a little trip.

1278
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,120
He'll take you up on that,

1279
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,280
but that's gonna be a little journey if you wanna do that.

1280
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,540
So I think you, it's up to you.

1281
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,120
You can just go, I guess, too.

1282
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,480
But I'm letting you know that like--

1283
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,880
Okay, I'll do that later.

1284
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,800
Like you can either, yeah,

1285
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,440
that would make more sense for the party,

1286
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,320
but you can also just go.

1287
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,560
But I wanted to make sure you knew that.

1288
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,880
Okay, cool.

1289
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,000
So you guys are back here and Owen then says,

1290
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,720
all right, so, if you guys really did take down that,

1291
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,120
there's your brothers, I guess, okay.

1292
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,720
He just regards that you're here in the mud.

1293
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,880
So if you guys really did take down that thing,

1294
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,680
I guess I can let you in, have you guys do the crucible.

1295
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,960
It could be a--

1296
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,800
- Great, so--

1297
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,000
- You guys like to hunt beasts?

1298
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,840
You guys killing the other beasts?

1299
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,960
- Oh yeah, yes, hound.

1300
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,960
We've we wrote on a sponge Bob

1301
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,040
bubbler

1302
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,280
Yeah a spongebob a squidward er

1303
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,480
What water a water a water walker?

1304
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:14,700
Wait I have a drive to ring a drooping dragon. I have the king monkey staff

1305
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,640
We killed a monkey kill a bunch of monkeys once yeah

1306
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,840
laughing loudly all right

1307
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,760
We embarrass people. What are your names? I'm

1308
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,640
I panic and I go, "Blurb."

1309
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,240
- That's blurb. - And I'm blurb.

1310
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,120
(laughing)

1311
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,440
- That's also blurb.

1312
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,760
- And this is-- - I will say.

1313
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,280
- Blurb. - I don't know how much,

1314
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,040
news doesn't travel like that much,

1315
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,360
but you guys did like, do a lot of stuff

1316
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,600
in the Terrifier Kingdom.

1317
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,160
- Good stuff or bad stuff?

1318
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,680
- Uh, you know. - No, the riotals.

1319
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,680
- You're Renown. - Would we think

1320
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,480
that these people would think it was bad stuff?

1321
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,880
- They wouldn't think it was, no,

1322
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,840
I don't think they would think it was bad stuff.

1323
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,640
Alright, you caught us, we're Evil Stevel and the boys.

1324
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,440
(laughter)

1325
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,340
- Oh, okay, Evil Stevel.

1326
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,560
Oh, you guys are the ones who, uh,

1327
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,840
you guys saved the prince, right?

1328
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,040
What are you guys doing here?

1329
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,880
- I don't know anything about the prince.

1330
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,840
- We're trying to go to the, alright, listen to me.

1331
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,560
- One of us died or something.

1332
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,520
- Do you see, don't look now,

1333
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,720
but do you see behind me the mud marks?

1334
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,400
The quadro mud, sorry, quadro mud marks,

1335
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,840
just in case there's another mud marks in your purview.

1336
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,160
(laughter)

1337
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,160
He's really, he's-

1338
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
There's a trio.

1339
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,880
You see him like really trying not to look.

1340
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,880
You see him?

1341
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,200
So basically, well I guess you can look at him because he hasn't been vibed yet, but

1342
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,360
one day we want to vibe him, so we want to take him to the university so that we can

1343
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,560
get him vibed.

1344
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,640
And when we say one day, we mean one day from now.

1345
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
Alright.

1346
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,760
So if we can go ahead and get on the fast, quick crucible.

1347
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,440
So basically we want the introductory letter via the crucible so that we can vibe this

1348
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,440
Quadro Mud Marks.

1349
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,440
Alright.

1350
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,440
Capiche?

1351
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,840
That's a new thing I'm trying in the world.

1352
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,440
Yeah, in the world.

1353
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,640
I think in many years.

1354
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Yeah, I know Italian.

1355
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,140
Yeah, okay.

1356
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,640
I think many years that will catch on.

1357
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,440
I think so too.

1358
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,240
Evil Stevel, first Italian ever.

1359
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,740
Yeah.

1360
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,640
[Laughter]

1361
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,440
Alright, yeah, I mean, hey, that's good enough.

1362
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,840
I'm not, look, I'll tell you what.

1363
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:15,240
My vote, if you're strong enough, you should get a, you should get a, you should be a part of the Nimrods.

1364
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,240
That's how I always feel.

1365
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,240
So, sorry.

1366
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:17,740
So what, good?

1367
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,240
Well, I'm not the final say, but come on, let's get back to the Nimrods Hall.

1368
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,240
Christ.

1369
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,520
Yeah, let's get back to the Nimrod song. My feet are killing me right now.

1370
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:33,400
Okay, so do you want to inquire further about this guy or do you want to head to the Nimrod song?

1371
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,800
I'm asking you just because you were talking to Shurn. If I go that way will I be able to go back?

1372
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,240
Uh, I mean yeah, but you'll just be going towards the lighthouse. You guys can follow him in that direction too.

1373
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,440
If I'm going to, wait we're going towards the lighthouse to go.

1374
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,720
I actually even forgot to say this, any kind of crucible stuff wouldn't happen until night anyway.

1375
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,640
You do have time now where you can go.

1376
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,800
This is why I was saying you could probably,

1377
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,800
you should probably long rest anyway.

1378
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,840
- Yes. - You're probably pretty beat up.

1379
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,680
And then you can either do the crucible

1380
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,280
or you can just go to the lighthouse beforehand

1381
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,720
and then long rest after.

1382
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,880
Like, you go to the lighthouse,

1383
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,160
you're not gonna get like attacked.

1384
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,040
- Let's go to the lighthouse and then go long rest.

1385
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,960
- Sounds good to me. - Just so we have the--

1386
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,800
- That sounds just about decent to me.

1387
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,880
- Cool.

1388
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,120
So yeah, you guys are gonna head towards the lighthouse now, so Sherman's gonna help lead the way.

1389
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:31,120
You go on this like, sort of, this dirt road, and you see as you're walking down that because Sherman is with you,

1390
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,280
you see these like, little like, bandit looking guys popping their heads out.

1391
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,160
You see Sherman like, kinda like, like shush them and tell them aside, like they're good.

1392
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,360
So if you guys had gone up here without Sherman, you would've just like been...

1393
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,840
- Gotten owned. - Yeah, you would've gotten jumped.

1394
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,600
And he takes you to the lighthouse.

1395
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,840
You see this lighthouse, it's not like what a light,

1396
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,680
it's not really like a lighthouse.

1397
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,440
I mean, it's like a refashioned sort of wizard's tower

1398
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,820
into a lighthouse.

1399
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,660
And Sherman leads you there and he says,

1400
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,640
he says, "We just gotta, one second."

1401
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,360
And he presses a little, a glyph on the side of the tower

1402
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,500
and you hear echoing in all of your minds,

1403
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,920
"Yeah, come in."

1404
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,960
And he's like, "All right, we can go."

1405
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,560
I just had the weirdest daydream guys.

1406
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,280
- What was it? - It was so short.

1407
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,960
And there's no pictures.

1408
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,900
- Oh my God.

1409
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,640
- I think something evil is happening.

1410
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,360
- And the door to the lighthouse,

1411
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,680
to the stairway slides up, stone against stone.

1412
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,680
You guys climb up the tower into this warlock's lair.

1413
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:52,160
And you see this tall human man, blond hair, blue eyes, very handsome looking guy.

1414
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,160
I don't like him already.

1415
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,160
And he's using his hand to shine a beam over.

1416
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,160
He says, "Hey Sherman, Sherman, come here, take a look at this."

1417
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,160
And he calls Sherman over, and you guys can kind of see this too.

1418
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,160
You see he's like, he starts saying, "Now look, see, so if I move the light here."

1419
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:30,160
I

1420
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,160
You just see these two silently.

1421
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
Giant oil drum explosion.

1422
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Yes, like just these ships collide and you see them.

1423
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Holy fuck.

1424
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,160
And he says, "Sherman, go get the guys to --"

1425
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,160
That was awesome.

1426
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,160
"Let's get some of that."

1427
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,160
And Sherman, like sort of a --

1428
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,160
He goes, "Yes, father, master."

1429
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,160
And he goes down the stairs and you see out the window,

1430
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,160
on the other side of the other window,

1431
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,160
there's like two windows, one out to the sea,

1432
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,160
one out to where he probably saw you guys coming in.

1433
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
You see all those little bandits kind of come out of the woods

1434
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,060
and go towards where that ship crash happened.

1435
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,740
And he says to you, he turns around

1436
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,180
and you can sort of appreciate like how like,

1437
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,340
like, like handsome this guy is.

1438
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,980
He's like, it's like weird.

1439
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,020
And he says, "Oh, what can I do for you fellas?"

1440
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,860
- I don't know.

1441
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,580
Sherman told me you had a job for us.

1442
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,820
I honestly, I think. - Oh, okay.

1443
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,580
- All I care about is money. - We want to do the crucible.

1444
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,400
My name is Condoleezza Carlo.

1445
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,420
What's so funny?

1446
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:32,420

Okay.

1468
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,880
HP is not the best.

1469
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,360
I'm going to throw that into the ether and then we're just going to forget about it for

1470
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,360
a little bit.

1471
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,360
Uh huh.

1472
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,360
Nice.

1473
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,360
Cool.

1474
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,360
I love when you throw shit into the ether.

1475
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,360
Yeah.

1476
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,880
Um, yeah sure you can rest here it's no problem.

1477
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,200
That was my cap.

1478
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:57,160
But what, listen, I want a letter of introduction, an introductory letter to the Academy of Arts

1479
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
and Sciences.

1480
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,160
Do you have a viver or a necromancer?

1481
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,160
Oh, I have a necromancer.

1482
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,160
Whoa!

1483
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,160
Then we don't even have to do the damn crucible!

1484
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,160
No, I mean, I don't know why you would join them with those fucking morons over there.

1485
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
They're nimrods, they're not morons.

1486
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,160
Okay, so...

1487
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
They're actually rodmans.

1488
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
Yeah, they're rodmans.

1489
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,160
I'm standing in the corner and I hold my finger up in the air.

1490
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,160
Yeah, they're both. Somebody thought it was funny.

1491
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,160
So we don't need the introduction...

1492
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,160
You asking me to skip school? I'm fucking meet- I'm meeting you right there.

1493
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,160
I don't want to- I want to skip school.

1494
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Evil Stievel, it's a pleasure to meet you.

1495
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
Shake my hand, look me in the eyes.

1496
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,160
I will, yeah, he does shake your hand. We can shake hands.

1497
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,160
You want to shake hands, Caleb?

1498
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,160
Oh my god. Why is your hand so blue?

1499
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,160
Why is your hand so cold?

1500
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,160
Mine's wet.

1501
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
Can a necromancer vibe things?

1502
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Yes, the ones I know can.

1503
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,160
Mud even?

1504
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,160
Mud? Yeah, that's not an issue.

1505
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,680
You'll probably need some-

1506
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,680
Probably need four heads or something on it.

1507
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:03,320
Well, you got that, but you'll probably need some more organic material to make, you know, lungs, heart, a little bit more, uh...

1508
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,820
Okay.

1509
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,220
It's just gonna take a little- but, but, but, but, but-

1510
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,160
But we can get those.

1511
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,980
We can get that for you at the academy. Now, now, here's the thing.

1512
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:15,860
It's gonna have to be a familiar tit for tat, right? So you'll have to do a little bit of something for me.

1513
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,100
Let's do this.

1514
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,260
But it's not a crucible, and it's not anything fucking stupid like that.

1515
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,980
What you'll do for me will involve...

1516
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,140
Are you a changeling?

1517
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:31,500
- Yeah, so usually I'm a giant submarine, okay?

1518
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,420
And I have three other, this is one of them.

1519
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,300
This is Daniel Crabbeano.

1520
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:41,140
And then I'm also Mr. Cutie Pop Superstar.

1521
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:41,980
- Okay.

1522
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,340
- And then G'day Cunt Hole.

1523
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,420
- And then you're a submarine.

1524
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,260
Okay, this is--

1525
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,500
- He's the guy who replaced, you remember Patrick Yodar

1526
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,700
from all the stories about us?

1527
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
Yeah, of course, I know that there's a...

1528
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,700
He basically died.

1529
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,700
You're kidding.

1530
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,700
Trunchbull's nephew's dead?

1531
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,700
Trunchbull, oh my, wait, so you all know Trunchbull.

1532
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,700
Everyone knows Trunchbull.

1533
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,700
He's one of the greatest adventurers in Terran Fire history.

1534
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,700
He's one of your friends?

1535
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,700
Well, look at, look closely, look closely at this mud box.

1536
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,700
There's gonna be a familiar face.

1537
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,700
It's Patrick Chiodar's head.

1538
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,700
It just melted.

1539
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,700
Also, you fed, you ate his head.

1540
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,700
Did I?

1541
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,440
Yeah, you guys threw his head into your mouth.

1542
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,700
Wait, can we get a head count real quick?

1543
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,540
Who's on the mud mark?

1544
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,540
It's three, it's three, and three five out of ten women.

1545
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,380
Yeah.

1546
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,200
Oh yeah, yeah.

1547
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,040
Yeah.

1548
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,180
(dramatic music)

1549
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,020
Okay, wait.

1550
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,280
(laughing)

1551
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,700
Oh, whoa!

1552
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,500
Yeah.

1553
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,340
That does look like him.

1554
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,700
Hold on, did you see how big my mouth just got?

1555
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,740
Yeah, it was cool.

1556
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,580
That was cool.

1557
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,400
Look.

1558
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,100
I've been holding onto this for such an occasion.

1559
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,100
So maybe we can vibe him while we're at it.

1560
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,100
We're gonna vibe.

1561
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,100
Oh yeah.

1562
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,100
Since we still got the head.

1563
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,100
I never thought about that. I do actually really miss him.

1564
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,100
Yeah, this new guy. I fucking hate this new guy.

1565
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,100
Well you could vibe him, but yeah sure, why not.

1566
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,100
I mean look, once you get in touch with my people.

1567
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,100
We could put him in a jar like that show, Pastorama.

1568
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,100
Pretty good.

1569
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,100
Damn.

1570
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,100
Well now we have to do it.

1571
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,100
Now it has to happen.

1572
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,100
So what I'll need you to do

1573
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,220
Damn it

1574
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,660
So

1575
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:36,700
In the other direction from the Academy there's another tower now

1576
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:42,940
You guys familiar with the fog yeah like it like a

1577
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,740
So here's what you guys would be you guys would be familiar with the fact that you guys have seen the world map

1578
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:59,180
There's all this like white fog around where the terrified kingdom is right? I remember this he says um

1579
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,060
now

1580
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,460
There is more beyond that fog people go into the fog

1581
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,740
They never come back or they're too afraid to go into the fog

1582
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,420
But I know for a fact that there's more to this world

1583
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,580
Now, I'm not going to send you just there.

1584
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:23,500
Since your deeds, which helped destabilize the Terrifier Kingdom, so I do appreciate that,

1585
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:28,700
we've been able to make some interesting developments in Bering Beria.

1586
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:34,300
Among those has been able to get kind of increased support within the court to make these kinds

1587
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,300
of explorations.

1588
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:41,500
The only thing is that there's another faction inside the court that wants to get there first.

1589
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,180
So I need you to all go there.

1590
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,540
Go down to this tower.

1591
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:50,540
I thought this was just going to be like us picking up a package or something.

1592
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,540
Oh no.

1593
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,540
No.

1594
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,540
Fuck.

1595
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:56,100
I mean look, I can find other people to do it.

1596
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,100
No.

1597
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,620
Because I don't want to go to school today.

1598
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,860
Yeah, we're going to do it for you.

1599
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,500
Alright, that's what I like to hear.

1600
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,980
And here's the thing, unlike the crucible which will get you a letter of introduction,

1601
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:15,620
I will get you passes that allow you to be considered visiting professors at the academy.

1602
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,460
Oh my god, we get to cut to the front of the line with the people in wheelchairs.

1603
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,460
Yes.

1604
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,460
Oh my god.

1605
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,940
Just a little bit more elbow grease, okay?

1606
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:27,980
And then you get, you will get full access to the academy in your next campaign.

1607
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,980
And with tenure.

1608
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,940
Well, I can't guarantee tenure.

1609
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,220
You'll have to show some sort of, you'll have to teach a class every once in a while to

1610
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,060
maintain the illusion, but I have enough people in there.

1611
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,620
- Trust me, I have a lot of classes I could teach.

1612
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,020
- I believe that. - I have.

1613
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:42,860
- Just looking at you.

1614
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,220
- He taught a class on student-teacher relationships.

1615
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,860
- Are your genitals just a smudge?

1616
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:52,860
- My genitals look like when you spill an ink quill.

1617
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:57,700
- I saw it earlier, it's like cracking an egg

1618
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,100
into a deep fryer.

1619
01:03:59,100 --> 01:03:59,940
Yeah, it's really bad.

1620
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,380
- It's foamy, it looks like crap.

1621
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,780
And also, it smells.

1622
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,620
- I can also confirm that it smells.

1623
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,300
- It smells terrible.

1624
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,500
- Well, I will demonstrate how much it smells once again.

1625
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,340
- Ready?

1626
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,020
I'm gonna pull the zipper down.

1627
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:16,860
- No, no, no, no, no.

1628
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,380
- I'm gonna pull the zipper down on my pants.

1629
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,900
We're just gonna sit here and just smell it for a second.

1630
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,500
- All right, so we can just continue talking.

1631
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,940
Just if your eyes are start watering, you know why.

1632
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,660
- You'll know why, so go on.

1633
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,460
- I think you're probably the perfect guys

1634
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,580
for this job, Alex.

1635
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,860
(laughing)

1636
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,740
So the thing is what you need to know about the group,

1637
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,180
all I know about the group is that you'll be

1638
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:42,140
trying to interfere or hunt,

1639
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,340
depends on your sort of,

1640
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:47,200
how you define interfering and hunting,

1641
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,060
is that they used to be a member of a thieves guild

1642
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,700
and have since been appointed to the court

1643
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,780
as a kind of espionage arm.

1644
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,620
So you guys would know that this one is taking the lead.

1645
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,460
- Yep.

1646
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:06,760
Whose group was basically made that was trunchbulls group organization. Yeah. Yeah the

1647
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:18,180
We have a head up actually trunchbulls little boys head we do have trench balls only

1648
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,180
Boys head premium meats

1649
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,100
Hold on I'm trying to find what we called it

1650
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,860
No, I put in my other notes

1651
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:39,180
Check out this check out the just look at this quote

1652
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,820
Feel good ink

1653
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:49,020
Etnies yeah, and then mirrors reflect the body music reflects a soul CP CP

1654
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,220
I

1655
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,180
Wrote some stuff on my folder to my wallet when I grow up

1656
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,580
Just some stuff about when I grow up

1657
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,340
I also drew a picture of my mansion when I'll grow up where I'll let your wallet

1658
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,620
I'll look like my no my wallet when I grew up in 2014. Oh

1659
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:13,420
Okay, and I did a whole Sudoku on my 60 tricksters eating chicky tinders, and they're mixing genders with their

1660
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:21,400
120 fingers okay, I remember that I remember that now that was trunchbulls group which became sticky to cry which became

1661
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,040
- It's a bad pentagram.

1662
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:25,880
- No, it's good.

1663
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,680
- And it became Sticky Fingers Group,

1664
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,920
Sticky Fingers Thieves Guild.

1665
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,760
And then that--

1666
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,840
- They became what?

1667
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,680
- Sticky Fingers Group.

1668
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,920
- That's what I first said.

1669
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,760
- Sticky Fingers--

1670
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,580
- But then what did they become?

1671
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,420
- Sticky--

1672
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,920
(laughing)

1673
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,160
- Go ahead, go ahead.

1674
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,600
I forgot the first time, you need to say it again.

1675
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,240
- Sticky Fingers Thieves Guild.

1676
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,400
And then that, which you were a part of,

1677
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,040
Well not you, Patrick was, RIP.

1678
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,240
And then, because at that point,

1679
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,200
Trunchbull was kind of just a figurehead.

1680
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,440
And then they became part of the espionage arm

1681
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,760
of the Terrafire Kingdom with a disempowered king,

1682
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,080
Nardwar, who now is just like, kind of struggling

1683
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,320
with the power.

1684
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,680
And so this guy wants you basically to go out

1685
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,600
and interfere with Stinkyfinger's operation

1686
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,320
to get to the New World before the people in Beriberi do.

1687
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,640
So Beriberi is technically a part of the Terrafire Kingdom.

1688
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,040
were annexed. But there's sort of a mutual understanding that they are scared of

1689
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,000
Beriberi because they do magic and Beriberi does not want to deal with these

1690
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,540
fucking stupid like oafs in the Terrafire Kingdom. However, Ola, who you guys know,

1691
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:38,720
your business partner, who developed magic among orcs for the first time, has

1692
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,840
sort of changed the power balance in the Terrafire Kingdom's

1693
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,320
favor because now they could do magic too. I get you. But then things got

1694
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,720
destabilized after you guys kind of like came in there, saved the prince, but also

1695
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,440
revealed King Nardwuar's, you know, he was mad. And so now there's kind of this

1696
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,200
opportunity. Okay. Is what's happening. You guys would have some contextual

1697
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,400
understanding. Well then let's fucking do it. All right, well. Yeah, let's go. You're

1698
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,740
welcome to stay here for the night and then I'll give you guys, I guess, proper

1699
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:13,800
permits to use the docks and then, yeah, be on your way. And just let me know what

1700
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,280
you find. And you don't have to, look, if it's too hefty of an operation, there's

1701
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:23,280
too much stuff going on, don't worry, just tell me what you find, you can come right back.

1702
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,280
Alright, how does that sound?

1703
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,280
Sounds great!

1704
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,280
Alright, so we leave tomorrow?

1705
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Uh, yeah, leave tomorrow.

1706
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,280
Stay here for the night, or you can go to the tavern and stay there.

1707
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,280
That sounds good.

1708
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,280
And you know what?

1709
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,280
I'm gonna turn back into a submarine right now.

1710
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,280
Oh, well let's, let's, um, are you gonna do that?

1711
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,280
Right in your office.

1712
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,280
A 30 foot long submarine.

1713
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,040
- He doesn't do that, he just expands the office

1714
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,640
extra dimensionally, and he says,

1715
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,880
"I can only do this for an hour,

1716
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,080
"so I need you to turn back, please."

1717
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,240
- Okay, then I'm not gonna do it then.

1718
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,640
I wanted to be, I wanted to create a--

1719
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,480
- That is a spell I gave him.

1720
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,920
- Two holes in the wall.

1721
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,620
- I wasn't thinking you would do that,

1722
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,920
but I did give him that spell,

1723
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,920
and I'm thinking I must have been thinking

1724
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,280
that you were gonna do some fucking shit.

1725
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,280
- How do you think about this,

1726
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,880
How do you think that far ahead when you're doing all this?

1727
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,380
Just with every single person you think,

1728
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,000
"How, they're gonna ruin this so badly."

1729
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,280
- I can't predict all of it.

1730
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,360
That's why this happens.

1731
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,680
Sometimes it doesn't work out that way.

1732
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,280
I just did a lot of prep for this

1733
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,080
'cause I knew it was gonna be a big, like,

1734
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,160
this was like a big, like,

1735
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,040
there's multiple ways you can get to where you need to go.

1736
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,120
And so I just did a lot of prep.

1737
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,000
And so in doing that,

1738
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,560
I just was like thinking of everything.

1739
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,400
- Okay.

1740
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,480
- But a lot of times I'm just like,

1741
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,840
I don't know what this session's gonna be,

1742
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,080
so I can't prep for everything.

1743
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,520
And then that's when you guys completely run ragged.

1744
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,600
We do our best work.

1745
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
Yes.

1746
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
Yes.

1747
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
Sometimes, yeah.

1748
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
I would say so.

1749
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,600
I fart.

1750
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,600
Okay.

1751
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,600
Sorry.

1752
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
Time.

1753
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,160
Julio, keep this in.

1754
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,640
It's an hour and nine minutes.

1755
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,640
Okay, cool.

1756
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,320
I probably need to wrap up in the next ten.

1757
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,320
Okay, cool.

1758
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,320
Me too.

1759
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,320
I have to go to the pet store.

1760
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,320
I forgot to buy a bunch of cat food.

1761
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,320
Okay.

1762
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:10,480
So, I was looking online while we were here just in case I didn't get to the pet store

1763
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,260
run time and it said that scrambled eggs are perfect to feed a cat.

1764
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,260
Yeah I agree.

1765
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,260
We're a guy.

1766
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:19,700
So are you guys going to do the crucible or are you going to do this?

1767
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,700
I think we do this.

1768
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,220
This sounds way more fun than the gay ass crucible.

1769
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,500
This is obviously the cooler mission and also it seems like...

1770
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,660
I want to see past the fog bro.

1771
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:35,300
And this seems like you are basically rerouting our course to go back to the story you had

1772
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,300
planned.

1773
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,300
No no no no not at all.

1774
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:42,300
Which, if that was the case, I respect that a lot.

1775
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,300
The end of Zoo World.

1776
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:50,300
No, no, no. So this is very much like you could, but I very much want you guys to be able to

1777
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:55,300
Vive Mud Marks. That is 100%. If that is what you want to do, I have created...

1778
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,300
There's a scenario where we can have our cake and eat it.

1779
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:01,300
There are other options besides these two that you could stumble upon if you stay in Port Lowe's

1780
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:06,300
Berry Berry that will all lead to ultimately Viving Mud Marks, but you get a little bit more

1781
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,860
context for what's going on in the world so that if say next campaign you just

1782
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:14,940
want to do a freaking Harry Potter in the Academy you can do that or you can keep doing the world.

1783
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:18,860
Which I really really want to do. That would be really funny. So you could do that I mean that's how I see

1784
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:24,060
this ending if if if you instead go that way. And it would have to be a school for adult magicians.

1785
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:28,860
But it could end it you know we'll see like you can you can end up dying or you

1786
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:32,340
can end up getting thrown off course. Yeah. Alright okay cool so you guys go to

1787
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:37,400
sleep you guys wake up the next day he had you he bless you he had you in just

1788
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,760
sort of like little like bunks that exist you see that there's a little

1789
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,960
there's a little cubby where Sherman was staying and Sherman lives in I'm in a

1790
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,640
bucket like Odo from deep space okay gross you can turn into that too that's

1791
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:56,520
awesome yeah um it's gross that he does that but um yeah you guys wake up next

1792
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,440
day and Sherman says all right I'll lead you guys to the docks and you'll be on

1793
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,880
your way I'm glad my father master likes you guys he said you know he's he comes

1794
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,120
off as kind of tough but he's a he's a really nice guy from the bucket I'm just

1795
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:19,720
like see do I have to carry him in the bucket okay yeah I would have been if

1796
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:25,920
you need me to carry you now I don't want you to carry me mate oh you like me

1797
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,280
now I'm like you now and guess what I'm

1798
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,560
your dad no you know my fucking god wow I

1799
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,080
made that up but what if I was and you

1800
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,960
hear you here in all of your minds what

1801
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,320
did I tell you guys about confusing

1802
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,680
Sherman about his father let's go let's

1803
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,720
cut that out right all right all right

1804
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:50,680
big voices you did you guys walk out of

1805
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,080
the tower so it takes about it takes like

1806
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,400
probably like a couple hours to walk

1807
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,440
through all of Port Lowe's Berry Berry and go through the market and go past all

1808
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,920
the other shit and you get to the port area now this actually I have to look at

1809
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:16,520
my notes for one second nerd alert I must look at my notes quick haste quick

1810
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:23,280
haste quick haste what a nerd say quick haste yeah they like saying quick haste

1811
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,620
It was actually convenient I drew the cove kind of to look like this because I knew

1812
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,320
You have docks you have sort of a boathouse here

1813
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:38,960
And another sort of supplementary boathouse here, mm-hmm cool

1814
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,140
And where's your pay pay paces?

1815
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:51,940
Where's our damn pieces this is what this is the cove this is the dock so let's just I mean let's fucking

1816
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,660
Mm-hmm listen

1817
01:13:54,660 --> 01:14:02,880
Chuggy I need you to turn back into Chuggy and park your sweet little ass in that dock right there

1818
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,580
Okay between those two dogs. Oh, yeah, wait hold on before before you do that. How am I already the boat then?

1819
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:15,420
You see okay you do that you see one a guard come over and just go oh well what the uh

1820
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:22,500
What the fuck is this? It's just oh, so I'm very thick. He's really sick. We got to take him to the hospital

1821
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,960
So excuse me, excuse me, move out of my way, thank you.

1822
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,700
Oh, yeah.

1823
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,940
Mack, it's all good.

1824
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,660
They're with me and Carlo.

1825
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,540
All right, OK, with Carlo.

1826
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:37,260
OK, just-- yeah, I guess get better, buddy.

1827
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,460
I'm actually not sick.

1828
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,300
I thought you were on the south side.

1829
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,020
Let's keep going.

1830
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,140
Let's keep going.

1831
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,940
And he gets you guys in the boat.

1832
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,700
And he says, OK, so you're going to want to go through the lake.

1833
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,900
And make sure you stay on the south side, which

1834
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,100
is where you're going anyway.

1835
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,620
If you go on the north side--

1836
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,540
Sorry, where's the map? There it is.

1837
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,460
- Sorry.

1838
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,660
- Sorry. I'm looking, I'm pulling up the map.

1839
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:57,660
Pulling out my map.

1840
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,660
Make sure you stay on the north side.

1841
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:03,540
And if you go, sorry, make sure you stay on the south side.

1842
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,500
If you go to the north, if you go, sorry about that.

1843
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,740
(laughing)

1844
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,900
- He's just pointing at random places,

1845
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,940
going, sorry, no way.

1846
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:11,860
(laughing)

1847
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,260
Okay, you want to go here? No, sorry.

1848
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,100
No, okay, go here, sorry.

1849
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,940
- You have zero confidence in where you're going.

1850
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:22,940
- Okay, I'm not sure about this plan now.

1851
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,040
Are you sure?

1852
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,880
Show me exactly where we're supposed to go.

1853
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,080
- Where is the crucible again?

1854
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,160
- What'd I do in the crucible?

1855
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,560
- So you guys, he's saying like,

1856
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,400
make sure you hug the southern coast,

1857
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,640
but do not get near this rock.

1858
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,720
This is one of the drop-off points

1859
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,520
for the Academy's shipping goods.

1860
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,520
They don't need to see.

1861
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,320
So if you're gonna need to go underwater,

1862
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,800
is this submarine thing,

1863
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,960
do it in the beginning of your journey

1864
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:53,160
you can pop out. That's my specialty. Alright. And be on the lookout because. We're going

1865
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:59,000
south? We're going south. So that we can get into the ocean? Well, I would not recommend

1866
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,840
going all the way to the ocean. You're going to reach the fog. We don't actually. Oh yeah.

1867
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,640
We know there's more out there. We don't actually know what's out there. At least that's what

1868
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:12,240
the master father tells me. But what you're going to be on the lookout for. You gotta

1869
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,580
- I'm sorry. - You gotta get it together, man.

1870
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:14,420
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1871
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,240
- You guys need to come to talk to me.

1872
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,080
- This is my first time.

1873
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:16,920
This is my first time.

1874
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:17,740
- First time talking.

1875
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,580
- Talking.

1876
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:20,820
(laughing)

1877
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:21,660
- That's okay.

1878
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:25,120
Hey, believe in yourself.

1879
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,600
- I've instantly loved this character so much more.

1880
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,440
(laughing)

1881
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,280
- It's very endearing.

1882
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,040
- That he just messes up and says sorry over and over.

1883
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,160
That's such a good character.

1884
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,420
(laughing)

1885
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,560
- He's so nerdy.

1886
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,400
- I'm sorry.

1887
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,600
(laughing)

1888
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,120
Stop apologizing!

1889
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,120
- You're with friends! - No, but, buddy, it's okay.

1890
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,120
- Yeah, it's gonna be fine. - I just want this to go well.

1891
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,120
It's gonna be okay.

1892
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,560
It's already going swimmingly!

1893
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,880
You don't...

1894
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,520
It's gonna go bell-- oh, sorry, I mean well.

1895
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,520
- See, we all do it. - Yeah!

1896
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,520
Thanks, guys. My dad gets really mad.

1897
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,520
You're welcome! Welcome! Fuck!

1898
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,640
I know he seemed really nice, but he's actually...

1899
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,640
[farting]

1900
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,640
Okay, yeah.

1901
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,640
So, when you get to the river, you're just gonna want
