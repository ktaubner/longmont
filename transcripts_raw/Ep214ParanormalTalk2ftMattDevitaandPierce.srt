00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check,

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't know what what Pierce is doing.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well I realize that we can't close this.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, Pierce, careful. Come on.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am being careful, Cameron. Shut up.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He's not gonna break those doors. I'm worried about the doors breaking him.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's what I thought happened earlier.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Check, check, check, check, check, check.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Checking.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Checking it out.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Checking it out.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Alright.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, I think we're all good. We're all ready.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Alright, let's do it.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Everyone's ready? Yeah.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Are they recording?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Come here, come here, come here!

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me see your butt!

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Crap monster.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There it is.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's up Matt?

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What's up fellas?

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How you doing?

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm doing well.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah?

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
New studio is looking good.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, this is great.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, it's incredible.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Tell me, why do you need three keyboards?

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't need...

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, you just...

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't need three keyboards.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't need three keyboards.

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't need three keyboards.

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't need three keyboards.

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't need three keyboards.

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't need three keyboards.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't need three keyboards.

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't need three keyboards.

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't need three keyboards.

46
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't need three keyboards.

47
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't need three keyboards.

48
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because they look cool.

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They do look cool, yeah.

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You were playing at the same time one song?

51
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I heard that.

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Please tell me you heard that.

53
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, we're hearing popping.

54
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I did not hear the popping because I have headphones on,

55
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but what I will tell you is that there was some interference just there in the audio

56
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that everybody will be able to hear.

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It went "did it" right when you guys pointed.

58
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm completely serious.

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll let you say this is y'all's show.

60
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm just a kid.

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No, no, no.

62
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're the expert.

63
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I was just gonna say, as to what this show is about to begin with, right?

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, I mean, we're here in North Carolina with Matthew DeVita,

65
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
paranormal investigator, he also is all things audiovisual.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A master.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
A master of all things audiovisual.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I would say master.

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Expert.

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
IT, information technology degree holder.

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Support specialist.

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Support specialist.

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,300
But anyway, we're at his studio and stuff's been getting weird.

74
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
We had a door fall on, Pierce's head.

75
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,500
Yeah, Pierce is here too.

76
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm here in spirit.

77
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm here in spirit.

78
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Well, you're here in real it.

79
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
You were almost only here in spirit.

80
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
You were almost just in spirit.

81
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Yeah, because you almost murdered me.

82
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
That's one big door.

83
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
See, and that's what a ghost does, it tears people apart.

84
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He was, I watched it, he was far away from the door.

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,500
And the door came right back.

86
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,940
door so precariously like a time bomb like a like a like a Bugs Bunny villain I

87
00:02:49,940 --> 00:03:00,500
would have felt horribly forever I mean not only would I've gone to jail but I

88
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,740
would have literally felt I'm not sure you would have gone to jail we would

89
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,540
have covered it I would have not told them that it was your fault I would have

90
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,780
said it was a good we would have dealt with it in one way or another yeah I

91
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,260
guess most murders that have happened while people were in the middle of

92
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,940
talking about ghosts go completely unsolved.

93
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,460
Yeah, because it's like, well, also like you deserved it.

94
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,940
Like, yeah, you were inviting something.

95
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
Yeah.

96
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
What?

97
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Kind of like, did you hear another crazy thing?

98
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,020
No, I was just laying down the law.

99
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,700
He's just making a face at people, I guess.

100
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,820
I don't know what's going on.

101
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,380
We're recording it on video now, so I figure.

102
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
That's true.

103
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,380
Yeah.

104
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
That is true.

105
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,260
This is the first time, my instinct when Patrick does something like this is to be like, what

106
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,260
are you doing?

107
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
Nobody can see you.

108
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,140
there's a possibility that people can see him. Can I add to the listeners? Yeah. Feel free to

109
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,300
review this video or audio podcast and see if they hear anything that's not

110
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,340
part of this podcast. Yeah you guys should find a way to to dump all of the

111
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:06,420
metadata into the podcast. Have you ever opened up some audio and put it in

112
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,540
one of those spectrogram or whatever things and you see a big six-pointed

113
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,580
star devil horn. Yeah or a 666 embedded into the waveform. Or an open mouth with a tongue.

114
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,860
No but we've got some pretty horrible audio from investigations. Really? Just like horrible.

115
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,020
Audio that plays without even being pressed. I mean like voice, you know, voices caught

116
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,500
on audio that says like "get out" and things like that. Yeah. And what's more horrible

117
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,980
than that? Not a whole lot. Not much. What's the longest sentence that you've ever caught?

118
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,660
So when we did an investigation in downtown Wilmington, I caught an EVP.

119
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,380
So EVP, for those of you who don't know, electronic voice phenomenon, it's when we get audio but

120
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,420
we can't hear it with our own ears.

121
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,700
If we hear it with our own ears, it's known as a disembodied spirit.

122
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,940
So just clarify that before we go any further.

123
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,260
But the sentence was, "Hey man, how about stepping away from me?"

124
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
Whoa.

125
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Wow.

126
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,980
That guy's kind of got a cool thing.

127
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,980
Yeah.

128
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,980
- This is some straight, legit, that was--

129
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,820
- Some kind of punk.

130
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,900
- I'm quoting, "Hey man, how about stepping away from me?"

131
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,740
- Wow.

132
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,060
- That was the E.P. we call it.

133
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,260
- Could not have been a Civil War guy.

134
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,100
- No, definitely not.

135
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
- That was the '70s.

136
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,940
- Yeah.

137
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,500
- It could have been, yes, I would say more modern.

138
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,340
- Little more modern.

139
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,500
- But don't you think that maybe a ghost would,

140
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,140
I mean, a ghost would be walking around, floating around,

141
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,200
seeing, you know, they're watching Girls and shit.

142
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,520
They know. On HBO? Yeah, they're like, yeah, that's what I mean. They're watching

143
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,400
shows. Yeah. Yeah, you caught on. And so they're hip to the new lingo and

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,160
stuff, right? I believe it depends on the entity. We talked about this early. So

145
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,520
there could be like a dorky entity. If it's an intelligent entity, then who

146
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,440
knows what's possible. But if it's more like a residual entity that's caught in

147
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,200
a loop per se. I could also see like, for example, maybe the ghost of a 50s

148
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,240
businessman. It might be likely for this businessman to pick up on the lingo and

149
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,240
perhaps say that a person's brain or blood was bussin bussin when he's

150
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,160
haunting them, but maybe a ghost of a caveman or a homo neanderthalus or

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,980
something with kind of a lessened brain capacity would not be able to say

152
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,040
anything besides "ooka booka." Because they never learned to talk in the first place.

153
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,960
Exactly. So you're not gonna be able to say a single vowel.

154
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,960
But now, there's debatables on that as well over, you know, can entities learn?

155
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
That's something else to consider.

156
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:47,960
You know, depending on how long the entity lingers after life, can it become more intelligent or is it going to stay the same intelligent as it was when it was born?

157
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Sure.

158
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
I kind of like your idea.

159
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,960
So do you think a caveman could be Einstein level if it was around long enough?

160
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I do like your idea of a caveman spirit. I've never even heard of that.

161
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
I think about it a lot.

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,200
about it a lot. I think you just want to hear a Oonga Boonga EVP. That would be pretty incredible.

163
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,760
I mean who wouldn't want to hear a Oonga Boonga EVP? I would love to. I'm, you know, I'm...

164
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,720
Because there's odds are... Me catch mammoth. How about you step away from me? Hey bud,

165
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,560
how about you step away? My wife, stop looking. You know? Any of those would be great. I guess

166
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,540
you're I mean uh so often it's people are afraid of Native American burial grounds

167
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,000
but almost everywhere is probably a caveman's yeah grave well do you think

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,840
the Ice Age kind of depleted all that well they could be called different

169
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,120
things in different parts of the world not necessarily just cavemen so true

170
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,040
they could be any they could be called anything yeah was it Neanderthal one two

171
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,760
and then yeah yeah yeah Neanderthal I don't think it turns out that there's

172
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,120
really not that many caves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People can't always find a cave.

173
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,520
Yeah, sometimes a caveman is born outside of a cave. I'm here because I have not

174
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,600
found a good cave. Exactly. You're a houseman. Well, yeah, but because I haven't found a

175
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,440
good cave. Yeah. I stand by that. You would, this would, this, you could do a cave

176
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,440
thing. I think a cave setup would be pretty strong. I think a stalagmite or stalactite there.

177
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:27,960
yeah maybe a stalagmite there. If a stalagmite or a stalactite was up there I don't care which one.

178
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,560
I forget which one is the one. It's a mite comes up and a tite comes down.

179
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,600
Did I tell you guys my uncle like deceived me so like he gave a very cogent

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,240
explanation of what they were and he was like yeah stalagmite because tigers

181
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,400
roam on the jungle floor in stalagmite because mountains grow and I was like

182
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,920
well I can't monkeys it was monkeys he said monkeys swing from the trees above

183
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,920
and Tigers roam on the floor below the complete opposite monkeys don't roam on

184
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,080
the floor and Tigers don't swing from trees but the right and the tight are

185
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,560
opposite. That's pretty obvious what I meant there. The best one of those is

186
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,800
is dessert and desert you know because a desert is super... a desert is not. It's very sparse.

187
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,120
There's not enough. Yeah go for it. But a dessert is super sweet. So what do you

188
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,720
get? Super sweet. A desert is one... For me... A snake. A desert has a snake. What I've

189
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,560
always thought, what I've always thought is a desert... But sparsely and snakes. A desert there's not as

190
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,240
much stuff there so there's only one S and a dessert it's like there's like

191
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,400
so much there's so much it's bountiful a desert is not sparse which has two s's

192
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:51,120
when it comes to sand which has one s. I'm so lost. We're kind of like...

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,460
So what do you get if you were to cross an elephant with a rhinoceros?

194
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,640
Since we're talking animals. Elefano. That's good. That only kind of works if you have a British

195
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,720
accent I guess. It would work better for sure. Here bump the mic after that joke.

196
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Elif I know. Elif I know. Elif I know. Elif I know. That would be a Elif I know. Elif I

197
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:29,720
know. I think it would be a Elif I know. Excuse me, could I mustache you a question? Oh that's

198
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Yeah, I must ask you a question.

199
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Could I'm...

200
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
I think you'd have to drop the "could I".

201
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Excuse me sir, would it be so wrong if I must ask you a...

202
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Oh no, that does work.

203
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Would it be so wrong if I must ask you a question?

204
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Yeah, that one works fine.

205
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
That one works too well.

206
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
So what's new with you? Anything going on?

207
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
It's been probably close to a year, right?

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I think it's probably last year.

209
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Almost exactly a year.

210
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,820
I'm in so Cape Fear Soul Seekers has been disbanded. I'm sorry to hear that. No, no, it's we're all good. We I

211
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,640
Have rejoined another group called Erie Expeditions Paranormal

212
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
and

213
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,480
It's all good. And we're all still friends. We just don't do I'll still do some investigations, but it's just not gonna be under

214
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Cape Fear Soul Seekers. Yeah, I'm involved in

215
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,040
Three productions

216
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,160
currently underway which none of them like to talk about. So are you bringing them up?

217
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,800
I will, you just want to know what's going on. Alright I'll guess. Kind of give you an

218
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,800
idea what's going on. We should guess. The Queen. No. Iron Man 5. They're all, one of

219
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,960
them is paranormal, two of them are paranormal related, one of them is gaming related. Oh

220
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Right, you were telling us about this yesterday.

221
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Halo. The Halo TV show. Peter Jackson.

222
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,960
What? Halo?

223
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Peter Jackson didn't direct that, he was just gonna.

224
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
No, it's gonna be Magic the Gathering related.

225
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Oh, okay.

226
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
It doesn't take anything to get you to talk about the things that you say you can't talk about.

227
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Well, I can't give like specific names of the shows.

228
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Oh, okay.

229
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Based on...

230
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
That's what your NDA says?

231
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Yes. Stranger Things.

232
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
No. What do you think of Stranger Things?

233
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,320
right how much are they getting wrong?

234
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,960
So much I could talk about. Yeah, let's talk about it. That's why you're here.

235
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,280
Well, but they're not doing a... well, they're doing more like dimensional

236
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,120
mm-hmm rather than paranormal. Do you have any interest in dimensional

237
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,280
television? No, no, I saw like the first couple of seasons of Stranger Things.

238
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:55,420
I thought it got, this is just my humble opinion, so I just thought it got too

239
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,000
chick-flicky. I agree, too much kissing. There's a girly stuff in the recent

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,840
seasons. The first two seasons, great. Yeah, they really jumped the shark in the third.

241
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,680
The most recent season, I heard that, well I saw some of it because my girlfriend was

242
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,440
watching it, girl show, but I mean a lot of these episodes are an

243
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
hour and a half long and more than half of the episode is like romantic.

244
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,840
And look, people are gonna hate on me for those, for my opinion, but I'm just, that's

245
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
just the way I feel.

246
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Yeah, I mean I think-

247
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
You better buckle up, because people are gonna be fucking mad about that.

248
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,200
Yeah, they are. Look, they are on Facebook, good lord. People are like, "You can't say

249
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,200
that about, that's great, it's the best show ever." I'm like, "I mean, it's great, I'm

250
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,920
glad you like it, I just didn't like it after the second season."

251
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,040
Yeah, I didn't, I think it's, I think what they're doing now is wrong. I think it's a

252
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
bad show.

253
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,200
I mean, who sings, who sings-

254
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,620
exactly because i don't know about the dying

255
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,140
it was a never-ending ending story last episode i saw a a that was not good

256
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,020
it just was not it that was not for me so i'm what's like that what's the piece of

257
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,040
media that you've watched where when you like it has to do the paranormal and

258
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,840
you've watched it you're like wow that's exactly my experience what's the closest

259
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,440
to like all that is my experience with the time of mom

260
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,960
uh... fictional fictional like a ghost of the not a good production that you've

261
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,620
made a tax folks

262
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,620
or close to the real deal. I respect the Ghost Hunter people.

263
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Not in a documentary, but in like...

264
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Like something like The Conjuring or The Exorcist.

265
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,620
Um...

266
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Closest to your experience.

267
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Shining was...

268
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,620
You know, that hotel is really, legitimately haunted.

269
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Right, but it does not necessarily actually flood blood.

270
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,620
You know, but he had experiences there when the writer...

271
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Who wrote that?

272
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Stephen King.

273
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,680
had and other people tons of people have had experiences there I would love to

274
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,380
investigate that place. God that would be awesome. That would be incredible. It would be insane. Maybe next time.

275
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,620
Yeah. Is that the Overlook Hotel is it? That's the fictional. It's Stanley's. The old Stanley Hotel.

276
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,180
Oh okay. And that place it's beautiful but it's it's it's what's the Overlook Hotel?

277
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,820
Overlook Hotel is the name of the hotel in the story but there's a real hotel.

278
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:10,260
But something like the Shining to some extent I've had you know maybe something

279
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
I don't like the show.

280
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:17,700
I assume you're talking about the ghost stuff in there, but is the psychic stuff too?

281
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Maybe a little bit of both, yeah.

282
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,040
But more of the ghost.

283
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,060
Do you think that there's anything specifically paranormal, psychic about people being twins?

284
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,720
Never really thought of it.

285
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,260
But here's something else to think about, though.

286
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,300
We hadn't even talked about, and I'm sorry for changing.

287
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Oh, no, it's fine.

288
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,860
We'll come back to twins.

289
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:45,980
So there are conductors that enhance possible paranormal activity.

290
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,420
Water, limestone is a big conductor.

291
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Limestone?

292
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,420
Limestone.

293
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,340
So I should have mentioned this earlier when we were talking about things just when we

294
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,340
were hanging out.

295
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:04,380
But those can actually also be debunkers as well.

296
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,460
If that is in the area.

297
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:17,460
When you're seeing these shows and you know, if you see people are having, you know, sightings

298
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,220
and this that and the other, but they don't know for sure, you know, then you do your

299
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,960
research on what's around it.

300
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,780
So with the Stanley Hotel, you know, how much research have they done to see if it's definitely

301
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,620
haunted or if there's other factors that might be causing particular sightings.

302
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,120
So I don't know, I'm just saying.

303
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
- Sure.

304
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,160
- I just wanted to, I know that's got a little sidetracked

305
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,080
a little bit, but I just wanted to throw that out there

306
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,720
'cause I think it's worth, you know.

307
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,400
- Limestone's interesting because is it just,

308
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,720
does that lead to more, there are more kind of haunted

309
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,880
places that have large limestone deposits nearby?

310
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,240
- From my knowledge, possibly, yes.

311
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,080
- Okay.

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,280
- Like a haunted bathroom?

313
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,000
- Well that's, I mean, bathrooms at Bloody Mary.

314
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,240
Yeah, Bloody Mary, there's a lot of limestone buildup.

315
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Moaning Myrtle.

316
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Yeah, stuff like that.

317
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,000
Moaning Myrtle, where was that from?

318
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Harry Potter.

319
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

320
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah.

321
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Hogwarts.

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I heard Hogwarts is actually built on a limestone deposit.

323
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You should investigate Hogwarts.

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That'd be great.

325
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,640
I am a huge fan of that movie.

326
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,000
It's one of my, or the whole series.

327
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Harry Potter.

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Harry Potter, yeah.

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,640
I thought the third one was the best.

330
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
The movie at least.

331
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,760
I don't know.

332
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,160
That's a toss up.

333
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,360
I mean, they're all good, in my opinion.

334
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
The first one's good.

335
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Christmas.

336
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,960
was great. Christmas happens in pretty much every single one. Yeah, but it's more of a

337
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,920
Christmas movie. It's one of the big wizarding things. I like Goblet of Fire, I thought that

338
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,120
was good. Yeah, the Triwizard Tournament. That is a really good one. Speaking of Christmas,

339
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,120
we learned about something recently, the Anti-Christmas. Never heard of it. I mean go ahead. Anti-Claus.

340
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,120
You want to bring it up and then look at me and Caleb? I forgot a lot of it. Why did you

341
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,440
it up then. I thought we were going to talk about this. Why did we talk about it? When

342
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,080
did we talk about talking about this? I don't know. Is this a ghost thing? You said it.

343
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,480
You did say it. I didn't say let's bring it up on the podcast. I said well we'll show

344
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,760
him that. He doesn't even know what we're talking about. I have no clue. We discovered

345
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,960
the short story which we'll send this over to you I'm sure. We can maybe talk about it

346
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,520
at length at some point but we found a website of this person who purports to be a paranormal

347
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,760
investigator who has traveled to the North Pole many times and met Santa Claus and also

348
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I think I have heard of that.

349
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
I didn't know it was called "Anti-Claus" though, but I think I've heard...

350
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,760
His organization is Mystic Investigations and his name is Xavier Remington.

351
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
I've heard... that's what I've heard of.

352
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Really? You've heard of Xavier Remington?

353
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I think so.

354
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Wow. Because we stumbled across it and we were like so intrigued.

355
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
We were trying to figure out Santa Claus' birthday.

356
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Can you pull that up?

357
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
I don't have Wi-Fi right now.

358
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,440
Also, just based on something we were talking about earlier, did you say that you have a

359
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,480
SoundCloud of you being possessed by a spirit?

360
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,800
No, I have a SoundCloud clip.

361
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,360
So my SoundCloud is Davida Studios, I think.

362
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Or Matt Davida.

363
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,520
Either one.

364
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,720
It is a, we have caught a disembodied spirit at a cement plant that we investigated years

365
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
ago.

366
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I thought you had maybe audio of you in the throes of inviting...

367
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,720
No, I got taken over at that plant.

368
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
But you don't have a recording of that?

369
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
No, but we have a recording...

370
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I'll send you this, Matt. This is mysticinvestigations.com

371
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,720
We have a recording of who we believe took me over, which was a female spirit.

372
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,720
And you can hear it on my SoundCloud page of her.

373
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,400
We asked, "Am I the only person talking to you?"

374
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,360
And there was five of us in this particular section, and she said yes.

375
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,960
So you got a disembodied voice.

376
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,840
Women be saying that though, "Am I the only one you're talking to?"

377
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,800
They say yes.

378
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,120
Yeah, I do.

379
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,840
You never know.

380
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,880
Yeah, that is true.

381
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,380
Yeah.

382
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,840
Well, she answered appropriately then.

383
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,600
You didn't see her though?

384
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,920
No, no. We just, but we definitely heard her. Like, we heard her.

385
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,240
Did she have a hot voice? Kind of breathy? Like,

386
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
yes

387
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
very close to that

388
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
close to that

389
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
maybe it was him playing a trick on you

390
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
it was more of like a

391
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
yes

392
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
wow

393
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
oh crap

394
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
it doesn't matter

395
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
that could be a mystic

396
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
wait this wasn't a mystic

397
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
that took over you was it

398
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
no what's the difference between a mystic

399
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I saw a mystic

400
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,960
when we investigated Lake Shawnee with EEP about a month and a half ago. Now I love

401
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,160
you've been a part of how many different organizations have you been a part of

402
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,320
through the year? A few. A few. I remember you had you had ASS which was still one of the

403
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,440
best names ever. Assessing Supernatural Spirits. Acknowledging Supernatural Spirits.

404
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,560
Assessing could have been even another organization too. It could have been. And now you have EEP

405
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:20,600
which is like that's not me okay oh yeah which is kind of like maybe yeah

406
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,800
yeah maybe so it's a genius Robby Spencer is the founder of that group is good guy

407
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,600
he's aware of the fact that it's it is a oh yeah oh absolutely I think so yeah I

408
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,040
tried to come up with one paranormal encounter nocturnal investigation squad

409
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
And what would that be?

410
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Penis.

411
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Oh, Lord.

412
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I love it.

413
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Isn't that a little...

414
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
You love that?

415
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,600
Isn't that maybe a little too crass?

416
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,720
Maybe people stop taking you so professionally?

417
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,060
Maybe even ghosts might not...

418
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Maybe ghosts would be homophobic.

419
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Oh, okay.

420
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Yeah, exactly.

421
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Here's the thing.

422
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
'Cause if you hate a penis, if you...

423
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,400
You're gay if you're gay and you think penis.

424
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,080
I had the group called Ass, and people still invited me into their homes.

425
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,880
So, you know, it just depends on the person.

426
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,620
Of course some people are not going to want us to come in there with that name.

427
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,320
Everyone has an ass, a penis.

428
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,120
Your reputation is what's most important.

429
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
That's true.

430
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,560
If people are like, "Okay, there's this group called Ass.

431
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,160
They're very respectful.

432
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,760
They've done tons of successful investigations.

433
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
We should probably invite them over."

434
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,560
Versus somebody who's like, "I've heard of this group Ass.

435
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
They're nasty."

436
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Exactly.

437
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,880
They run around and they grab the ghosts and they do nasty things.

438
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Maybe we don't want to.

439
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,520
This was 10 or 15 years ago.

440
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,920
We didn't really have Google reviews and all this stuff, you know, when I had ass.

441
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah, exactly.

442
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,640
So acknowledging supernatural spirits, that sort of implies the existence of a natural

443
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
spirit, right?

444
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Yes.

445
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,100
So what is the difference between a supernatural spirit and a regular spirit?

446
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,000
Or are all spirits supernatural?

447
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,360
No, I think it all has to do with the level of intelligence.

448
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,000
That's just my personal opinion, you know.

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Okay, so like a dog spirit.

450
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,080
- It's gonna be other peoples with other opinions, you know?

451
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
- Oh, but is it, yeah, I guess every,

452
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,320
I mean, you could just say every spirit is supernatural.

453
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,540
- I mean, I feel like maybe if this is my thinking,

454
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,280
maybe right now we have natural spirits inside us,

455
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
and once they're out earthbound walking around,

456
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,480
that's kind of a supernatural phenomenon.

457
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,660
- Right, so all spirits, a natural spirit usually needs,

458
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,040
or I guess 100% of the time needs a body to inhabit,

459
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
but a supernatural spirit can live outside of a body.

460
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,600
- It's not natural for a spirit to live outside of a body.

461
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,500
- Maybe a supernatural spirit might have more abilities

462
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,260
to travel in and out of realms.

463
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
- Spider-rooms.

464
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,700
- Yeah, realms.

465
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,940
Okay, so I have a question.

466
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,540
Is there any kind of wall that a spirit cannot pass through?

467
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,660
- Well, I think there are,

468
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,380
again, this goes into supernatural versus not.

469
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,220
So we've talked about this before,

470
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,220
whether how strong your will was when you were alive

471
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,500
might have factor into how strong your capabilities are

472
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,900
when you're in your next life.

473
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,220
- When you say how strong your will is,

474
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,740
do you mean like your--

475
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,700
- Your will to live.

476
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,580
- Okay, so you're-- - Your will to drive.

477
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,860
- People who have high vital energy.

478
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,420
- That are driven and-- - Yeah.

479
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,340
Versus someone who like say--

480
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,300
- Likes to sleep on the couch all day and not do anything.

481
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,860
- Yeah, or maybe someone who-- - Lazy people,

482
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,780
when they die they just, they're gone.

483
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,620
I'm just, this is a possibility.

484
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,580
Or like someone who just gave up on life and slipped away.

485
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,180
And just gave up, they said,

486
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,020
I don't want to live anymore, and they just slipped away.

487
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,620
So people without the will to live.

488
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,460
And they, yeah.

489
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,420
It could possibly not have quite the capabilities

490
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,180
that someone who's driven and strong will.

491
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,220
I guess if somebody--

492
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,420
Possibly, this is just a theory.

493
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,300
Yeah, with that theory, so people who commit suicide,

494
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,860
that represents to me very little will to live.

495
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,100
So are these people, they're just basically nothing.

496
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,780
Now, you say that, they may have different capabilities

497
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,320
because of their anger.

498
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,060
- True.

499
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,340
- So, if someone gets really angry enough to kill themselves,

500
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,180
they might be-- - They might have

501
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,380
different types of capabilities in their afterlife.

502
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,540
- It could, it takes a pretty strong will

503
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,580
to kill yourself too, maybe it's a different kind of will,

504
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,420
the will to die.

505
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,660
- But it's an angry will.

506
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,500
So you might only have one set of capabilities

507
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,900
in your afterlife, which would be anger related.

508
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,740
- Yeah, Hulk style.

509
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,940
I guess I'm trying to arrive at, we know what kind of people do become spirits and

510
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,460
little girls who have big wills to live often become spirits

511
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,420
but if you, I guess I'm curious what kind of person is just, they die and there's

512
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,820
just, they're just... Yeah let's talk about the kind of person who there's just

513
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,420
nothing. They're just dust, they don't exist anymore. No spirit, no ghost. Their spirit if it does exist is

514
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,140
basically stuck in time like a like a particle from a sneeze and you just walk right through it.

515
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,580
You're probably walking through billions of them every day.

516
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Just losers.

517
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,780
So those could be possibly your residual type haunts.

518
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
Hobo.

519
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Instead of an intelligent haunt.

520
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,340
A hobo is good.

521
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,260
The difference between a residual haunt and an intelligent haunt is an intelligent haunt

522
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,100
will have the capabilities to respond to you if you call out to them.

523
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:24,220
A residual haunt might be, say you had a routine and every morning you went downstairs, you

524
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,860
made a cup of coffee and you got your paper and you read your paper. That

525
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,260
might be your loop for the rest of the life. A paranormal team might

526
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,420
see this or witness this but that's all that they're gonna get. Right, so what

527
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:45,140
about, yeah I guess what about like a homeless, a hobo, punk rocker, a junkie, a pothead.

528
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,300
These people are just gonna kind of just a doper dissipate into just...

529
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,180
They, well I feel like some of them have pretty strong wills.

530
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,780
Again it depends on the will.

531
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
Yeah.

532
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Yeah.

533
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,020
Like a punk rocker would have the will to dismantle the system.

534
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,740
So like break glass and, well glass, like break glass of establishments, like windows

535
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
and targets.

536
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,420
To somebody that had those lives, you can think of it this way, they might have a whole

537
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,140
different perspective in the afterlife and they might want to try to communicate with

538
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,180
you in any way, shape or form.

539
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Yeah.

540
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,180
pops. We've talked about the pops. Although it's been probably 20 minutes since we heard

541
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:30,900
one. Also did the air conditioning turn on? It did. That's okay. It's fine. It doesn't

542
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,300
pick up too much. Not too worried about it. I was just worried. I heard the AC starting

543
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,660
up. I thought maybe it was the spirit. Those ways to communicate could vary depending on

544
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:47,980
how you were or in this light. Like the ghost of a hipster might be like "Latte please!"

545
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,940
I would be because I'm more Don Pardo. Well that could be if Don Pardo was a hipster.

546
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,380
Well if Don Pardo died. Well he did. If you said a lot, if you said latte, since I'm kind

547
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:05,380
of like you know a dad joke guy, I'd be like a little a. Yeah. A little a. I'm glad you

548
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:12,380
saved that. I know I found it in there. Bump that mic. That's right. Yeah. Okay so that's

549
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
That's interesting.

550
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
Or the ghost of a woman might be like, "Ooooh!"

551
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
A hot woman.

552
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
"Ooooh!"

553
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
A ghost of a lunch lady might be like, "Ooooh!"

554
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
This sounds more like their ghost of the studio audience.

555
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
"Here's your lunch!

556
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Here's your lunch!

557
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
I'm hungry!

558
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
Lunch!

559
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Ugly lunch!"

560
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:32,500
You know what would be interesting to me would be to collectively save, you know, all of these,

561
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:39,340
if we could get everybody to communicate and work together, save and share their findings

562
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,900
to see if those match up what we're talking about.

563
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,220
Why are people so resistant to doing that?

564
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,180
Oh, who knows.

565
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,460
Why is there not an open database

566
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,660
where we can post detail--

567
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,500
I believe there is.

568
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,460
--and find the overlap?

569
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,060
You could probably go to certain sites

570
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,460
to be able to find certain EVPs that you might want to hear.

571
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,140
But some groups are super secretive about what they do.

572
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,940
I still get the point in that.

573
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,500
You're keeping all this great information for yourself.

574
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,940
Declassify it.

575
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,860
There's some, there's some, it was a ghost.

576
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:23,700
There's some things I've done, we also operate on a confidentiality, like a doctor, you know,

577
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
we operate.

578
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,580
Oh, so it's kind of like a medical record.

579
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,940
Yeah, for some.

580
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,060
You ask permission.

581
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,060
If they say we don't care what you do with it, then we'll put it out there for anybody

582
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,880
who wants to hear it.

583
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,360
We used to have it on our websites and stuff, which are no longer up, but because I'm not

584
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,520
really, I'm with a different group now.

585
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,920
So if we were allowed to post, we would share away, but not all groups think the same.

586
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,640
Well, what about like a resource kind of for other investigators, like a database?

587
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,880
I would love to see that.

588
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,640
I don't know that there is one, but I think that's a great idea.

589
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,840
I think that's something we could move toward in the future.

590
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Yeah, that'd be great.

591
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,000
I had a question, just this popped into my head.

592
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,540
When, do you think that,

593
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,840
can different spirits, do they interact with each other?

594
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,120
Or do they really just see us?

595
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,280
I think, if it was me, based on my experience,

596
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,760
and now granted, you guys know,

597
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,640
now the audience doesn't necessarily know,

598
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,440
I've been doing this for over 17 years now.

599
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,960
So I've experienced a lot, you know?

600
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,960
And a lot of my opinions I'm giving on this podcast

601
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,540
are based on my experiences, right?

602
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,980
So with that being said, yes,

603
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,980
I believe in both of what you said.

604
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,820
- Gotcha.

605
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,280
So they can interact with each other, they can.

606
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,640
- I don't believe all, but I believe some.

607
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,680
- They can get in fights and stuff.

608
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,160
- I don't know about fights.

609
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
But I mean, who knows?

610
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,280
- Yeah, they're on the same team.

611
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,960
- Look, maybe it's like prison.

612
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,800
Maybe you get there and they're like,

613
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,480
did you yeah who's the toughest guy maybe you gotta go hang out with these but our

614
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,800
angels and demons fighting so I mean if they are then I like the prophecy yeah

615
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,120
so then why can't any other spirits fight amongst themselves yeah yeah that's I

616
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,840
guess what I'm saying yeah you know maybe you do if you do something if you

617
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,280
have such a shit life or you have so little will maybe yeah if you're just

618
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,520
like I'd be you beat up or human human dirt or shut down maybe they show you

619
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,520
- Yeah, where you can't communicate if you wanted to.

620
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,360
- Yeah. - Yes, that's true.

621
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,280
- Someone they keep talking over you, trying to go,

622
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,000
hello, I'm here, I wanna communicate with you,

623
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,040
and another ghost is going,

624
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,280
(imitates ghost)

625
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,680
over you. - That'd be the Karen ghost.

626
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,520
- Yeah, exactly.

627
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,440
(laughing)

628
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,660
- Do you, so when you talk about strong-willed people,

629
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,160
I'm thinking about, just personally,

630
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,320
like, The Rock is gonna have a serious,

631
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,440
we should be afraid when he dies, probably.

632
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,280
- We absolutely should.

633
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,840
- He's like, that guy's got so much will.

634
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,480
- Yeah, 'cause we're at the place he's gonna hunt.

635
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,320
- Oh my God. - Hey, you know what,

636
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,120
I really hope he doesn't die in his Scorpion King costume.

637
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,920
You know what happens when you grab the rock's ass, right?

638
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,420
What?

639
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
You hit rock bottom.

640
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Oh man, that is true.

641
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,420
What happens when you grab his cock?

642
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
You...

643
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Oh no.

644
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
Come.

645
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
You come.

646
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Oh god.

647
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Cock bottom?

648
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
Is that cock bottom?

649
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Cock rock 'em.

650
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
I think it's rock cock.

651
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,420
I think it's rock cock.

652
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,420
I want to change the subject here.

653
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Please.

654
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Okay, and a few more.

655
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
Actually, you know what, now that I think...

656
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,420
We were kind of doing something awesome there for a little bit.

657
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I was going to give you a clip on YouTube, but okay.

658
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:40,420
But I do like the idea of, you know, being scared of the rock spirits.

659
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Yeah, because he's somebody who, he wakes up, he sleeps two hours a night.

660
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
And his side partner, Kevin.

661
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Kevin Hart.

662
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Absolutely. Can you imagine him as a spirit?

663
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
Yeah.

664
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:57,700
well but he would small in spirit but not small in

665
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,820
stature maybe he would

666
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,140
he would get bigger and persona and everything else you know but that'd be

667
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,260
i mean as far as ghosts that haunt your house and your life kevin hart's gotta be up

668
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,980
there because of the comedy yeah i think and i will say that he's large in spirit

669
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,940
i would not mind he's a big little man

670
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,340
i would not mind him at all he's hilarious i would not mind him at all he doesn't like kevin hart

671
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,820
i would be really scared of the rock as a ghost especially if i had grabbed his

672
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:28,940
cock before he died. I think he might have a bone to pick with me. Well before you died

673
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,020
if you grabbed his butt you really have hit rock bottom. That spear's gonna latch onto

674
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,900
you. That's right. I'm gonna latch onto him. Watch out The Rock I'm coming for you. Oh

675
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,620
God. Why'd you demonstrate on Patrick? You said I look like The Rock. You look exactly

676
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:51,780
like The Rock to me. Wow. But I am really curious if what you think. Oh it's Dwayne's Johnson.

677
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,060
it's dwines johnson it's dwines rock hard on that because he did it we have to go

678
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,660
we're gonna have a lot of that i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't

679
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,980
know we do we need is rock hard johnson we do we need is johnson

680
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,140
that you are going to be the rock of all of the time

681
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,300
that's good

682
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,980
uh... really good

683
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,380
uh... what do you think do you think uh... what's going on with witchcraft

684
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,780
uh...

685
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,180
Is that real and if it is?

686
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,560
Are you a good witch?

687
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,640
I'm not a... I don't claim to do any...

688
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
What's wrong with you?

689
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Well he is sort of...

690
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,260
Oh no, I believe in it. I don't want anything to do with it.

691
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,760
Sure.

692
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,620
It's just out of my...

693
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,020
Do you believe that there's such thing as a...

694
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,980
as he said so rudely like a good witch?

695
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,860
Do you think that's even real?

696
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,700
I believe there's a good witch and a bad witch.

697
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,200
Uh-huh.

698
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,440
Just one of each?

699
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,520
No, I mean I believe in good and bad witches.

700
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,340
Oh, gotcha.

701
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,420
I believe they exist.

702
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
And it's still going on?

703
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Witches are still doing their thing?

704
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,420
The practice of that, absolutely. I have friends that are claimed to be...

705
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Oh, okay.

706
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,420
I guess what we've always learned from media is you can tell the difference physically.

707
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,420
Right? So a good witch is blonde, and a bad witch is usually...

708
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,420
No, I haven't heard that. I know you can tell them in their demeanor.

709
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Yeah, but they obviously...

710
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
Right, an evil witch is usually like...

711
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,420
Well, you say that, but not necessarily.

712
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
nice to you.

713
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,140
True, like Hansel and Gretel.

714
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Yeah.

715
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,620
And then build a voodoo doll of you.

716
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Oh man.

717
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,620
Oh yeah, just a ploy to get your hair.

718
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
That's something we haven't talked about.

719
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,980
We talked a lot last time.

720
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Yeah.

721
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,300
We had a lot of things, but voodoo was not ever...

722
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,100
We talked about cryptids last time.

723
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,620
Yeah, we did a lot of cryptid stuff.

724
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,900
I want to cover new ground too.

725
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,100
What is your feeling on voodoo?

726
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,980
So we were talking about the Ouija board too.

727
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
Yeah, that's true.

728
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,460
I don't think we talked about Ouija boards last time.

729
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,460
Let's talk Ouija first.

730
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,060
So here's my take on the Ouija.

731
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:51,020
This is my opinion, this is for anybody listening, and I stand by this opinion.

732
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,700
The Ouija board, I don't practice, I've used it once on an investigation and I'll never

733
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,020
use it again.

734
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,100
What you're doing is real.

735
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,240
I don't care what people say in the comments.

736
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:13,380
This is my opinion on this and I stand by it.

737
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:20,380
If you use this thing as a tool, you better know how to use it, and you better know, I

738
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:28,220
would strongly advise to use it for a specific, if you're trying to reach someone's name,

739
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:37,400
reach that, try to, because if you're just calling out to anything and anybody, you're

740
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,060
opening Pandora's box. You really are. Especially if you're in a home where you think it's

741
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,620
haunted and you've already had experiences of it being haunted. That's

742
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,940
just a that's the same thing as us paranormal investigators doing an EVP

743
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,740
session. Same thing. Mm-hmm. Okay so yes it's a game by the sense of it being a

744
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,620
game. It comes in a box. Yeah but what you're doing... Hasbro does make it. Yeah.

745
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,780
Yeah but what you're doing is real. Yeah. So that's that's my take on the Ouija.

746
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,780
So if you if you do use a Ouija board in a place where you think it's haunted you

747
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,220
should know the spirits name first? I would know everything about anything

748
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,500
you're doing, every bit of research. That's an experts only. Yeah, research

749
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,580
everything first before you use it, and know how to close it. Yeah, you know. I used a Ouija

750
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,060
board in high school at my girlfriend's house.

751
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:39,620
It was me, her, and her friend, and we were

752
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,540
doing it and we got we only got to the name of the spirit and it was gub g-u-b

753
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,820
now does that now gub is that that strike you as cuz that we would that's one why

754
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,300
we stopped so that's not even almost a human what you do is Google it and see

755
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,200
what all comes up yeah I haven't done that

756
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,540
gub paranormal okay ghost were you using it in the mirror and it was you're

757
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,460
talking to a bug yeah maybe so here's why when I used when we used it so I've

758
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,620
just googled "gub ghost" and what comes up is "privately made firearm" and it's a

759
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,040
bunch of pictures of 3d printed guns. So here's what I...

760
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,420
Well I asked for the name and it said "gub ghost". I'm sorry I cut you go ahead.

761
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,940
I cut you off. Well I'm just saying that you know it could be a clue it's

762
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,020
intentionally leading you down a rabbit hole. It could be. So here's why I

763
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,900
say that so when we used it and I used it with someone who knew how to open it

764
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,020
and close it. A lot of these people using these things don't close it. When you say

765
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,280
open it and close it it folds like a like a settler's of the tan board huh doesn't

766
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,780
it just fold? You have to like close out the game I don't know how to do that but

767
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,980
I don't know I don't remember this was 15 years ago I don't remember last week so

768
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,060
that's hilarious I saw that. That's what came up when I googled "gub paranormal"

769
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,880
So when we used it all mine did was come up with we did the thing and I was

770
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,620
like nothing's going on it's just a bunch of numbers right I wrote those

771
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,020
numbers down in sequence right and I googled them when I got home and there

772
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:15,540
are all kinds of religious and satanic meanings to those numbers I never used

773
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,740
the Ouija board. While we're on the on the subject of the Ouija boards we

774
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,700
went a couple weeks ago we were in Portland Oregon we went to a goth night

775
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:31,460
club called the coffin club. I want to go. It was good it was fun.

776
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,700
The dance floor was a Ouija board.

777
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,180
As long as you don't have the planchette, is that fine?

778
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,180
I think that's fine.

779
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,820
But that's just my, again, I would love to have a Ouija board, like those carpets you

780
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
can get.

781
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Those are kind of just, that's not a real...

782
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,820
They're really cool.

783
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,220
As long as you don't have multiple people's hands.

784
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
It can't contact...

785
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,340
It's the planchette is where the magic is, right?

786
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,140
Right, just, well I won't say that.

787
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:01,260
But yes, yes, you have to, to my knowledge of it, you have to initiate it.

788
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,500
Or someone's wearing like clear shoes.

789
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,900
Like planchette type shoes.

790
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Yeah.

791
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,940
I mean as long as they're not, if they're sitting there walking on it and talking, you know,

792
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,980
trying to call something out, they just walk across it, you know.

793
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,980
And again, it could be in a totally different context because it's just been painted on

794
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
there.

795
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,980
It may not be the true...

796
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,300
Yeah, I guess that's right.

797
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,580
It's like a replica of it.

798
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,220
You say that everybody has some element of spirit in them.

799
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,220
That's what you believe, right?

800
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
I believe.

801
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,220
And I think that's a pretty common belief.

803
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,220
So...

804
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,120
not necessarily religions, just spirits. Yeah, of course. People oftentimes have a hard time

805
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,240
getting in touch with themselves. Do you think it is a worthwhile exercise to sit

806
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,960
there, just one man, sitting at a Ouija board asking yourself some

807
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,880
questions? I don't even think you need the Ouija board to do that. Really? You know, you can

808
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,920
meditate. That's what meditation is. Absolutely, meditation. So you would consider that a form of, it could be a

809
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,200
a meditation. You could be a meditator. Now, now we can take this on a different, you

810
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,220
know, if you're trying to get in touch with your your inner self, meditation, but

811
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:13,320
if you think something is attached to you or something of that nature, you still

812
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,080
don't need the Ouija board. Put up some audio devices, you know, I don't

813
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,260
recommend doing any of that stuff alone, you know. If you do, if one of our

814
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:32,440
listeners does find themselves the vehicle on which a spirit decides to

815
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,840
attach themselves what is the best way to get that spirit off of your person?

816
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,360
First and foremost sage is good. Sage. And what are they not like about sage

817
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,300
specifically? The smell. Just you know. Just stinks to them. It's just kind of the

818
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:53,300
opposite of sulfur. So spirits hate Thanksgiving. That's probably one of the

819
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,380
most interesting statements I've heard so far this year. I think most spirits

820
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,580
are probably Halloween lovers. Yeah. Oh is that why Thanksgiving... Who doesn't want to hear an oonga boonga from an EVP?

821
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,740
Thank you. Is that why Thanksgiving is after Halloween? Because you're cleansing.

822
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:16,740
You're cleansing. What is Thanksgiving but a giant Native American burial ground?

823
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,100
Oh my god. So some cultures may love, some cultural spirits may love

824
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,380
Thanksgiving. Some might not. Some might hate it. Maybe a pilgrim. I feel like a pilgrim

825
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,980
spirit will like Thanksgiving a lot more than a Native American. Yeah. Or a

826
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,260
hungry spirit. Yeah. But going back to get rid of things,

827
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,860
There's, you can, depending on your religion,

828
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,400
there's demonologists in every,

829
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,200
they're called different things in every religion.

830
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,560
You know, you can have people come bless your home.

831
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,320
You can have people, you can,

832
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,240
there's things you could do

833
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,880
that I don't necessarily recommend.

834
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Like, I know, I've heard of, you know,

835
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,400
beating pots and pans, you know,

836
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,120
randomly at different hours of the night.

837
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,360
But I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing,

838
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,880
because depending on the spirit,

839
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
it might just make 'em more mad.

840
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,920
- And you might get a neighbor attached to you.

841
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Or the cops.

842
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
You might get handcuffs attached to you.

843
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
If you're in an apartment building, I wouldn't know if I would recommend that.

844
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,920
But sage for sure, crystals, there's different types of crystals.

845
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,920
Which crystals are the best?

846
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
I can't not remember.

847
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
You'd have to go to a crystalologist?

848
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Well you could just Google crystal protection.

849
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
Okay.

850
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,920
If a spirit is attached to you, is there somewhere that you can go that the spirit could not follow you?

851
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Like a spirit car wash?

852
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,320
Well if you were like, if you were, yeah, well so better ideas than what you guys both said

853
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,120
is maybe like the bottom of the ocean or outer space. Do you think a spirit could follow

854
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,540
you to either of those places?

855
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
I would say yes.

856
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,540
Mm-hmm.

857
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:55,820
I don't think there's any, any, again, if the spirit can attach, if the spirit can attach

858
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,300
itself to you, it's gotta be an intelligent enough spirit. See I also feel that, again,

859
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,860
This is based on my experience, okay?

860
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,540
So I also feel that some spirits are locked and can't go anywhere.

861
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,220
They are like in a house and that's where they're going to be.

862
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,220
I don't know why.

863
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,600
I have no idea why.

864
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,620
But I feel and I know that other spirits have freedom to go wherever just because of all

865
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,620
the EVP we've gotten all over the place in my time.

866
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,780
So with that, yes, I feel like they could, you know, now they may be stronger in to be

867
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,900
able to communicate in different places. Uh-huh. Just because of the elements

868
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,260
around them. Yeah. You know, the conduits around them. Uh-huh. I, because I have maybe

869
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,260
an idea that if we can, if we, if people are being attached on by demonic or

870
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,380
scary spirits, I mean, maybe we can send these people to the moon, de-attach, use

871
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,400
sage up there, bring the people back down, and maybe we can just send all the evil

872
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,460
spirits out to another planet or the moon. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.

873
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:05,140
Yeah, do you just get a Ghostbuster trap that might be easier?

874
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:15,460
You do you know what that is though it goes no idea if I was to guess

875
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,900
It's I'm sure some it would be some sort of energy based

876
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:25,500
Yeah, you need DARPA for all that matter. It's like energy, you know

877
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,580
vacuum into a hard drive essentially but with it on a ghost level right using

878
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,380
using dark matter yeah yeah technology this is a question I've always had

879
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:41,300
which I don't know if that even exists dark matter technology do you I called

880
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,780
voodoo oh wait let's say we didn't we left food I want to talk about voodoo

881
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,820
again do you have you ever had a voodoo so if somebody look if somebody

882
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,060
offense but I'd be a pretty easy voodoo well sure you know but if somebody was

883
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,060
to make a voodoo doll of me, I would love for them to fix my back.

884
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,060
I have the same problem, yeah.

885
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:08,060
If you're gonna stab me in the back, could you do it with acupuncture ways and actually

886
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,060
hit the right spot?

887
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:15,060
Both of you, I guess because of your family, might be good candidates for a head shrinker.

888
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,060
What if there's a look-alike of some-- right?

889
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,060
[laughter]

890
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,060
He thinks I have a big head.

891
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,060
Caleb's face right then was priceless.

892
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,580
You guys are like Crash Test Dunks, all of you guys maybe.

893
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,580
I think I'm a normal person.

894
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,580
You are, no.

895
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,340
You look like a bug.

896
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
You are an ant.

897
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
You look exactly like a bug.

898
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,420
Yeah, that's why a voodoo person would not want to shrink my head because-

899
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,900
Because there's nothing, you already have the worst physical situation.

900
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
They would use your head to shrink-

901
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,660
Are we talking Beetlejuice head shrinkers?

902
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,660
Yeah, yeah.

903
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:50,620
They would use your head to teach people how to shrink heads.

904
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,220
your head is the anamorphic it's the the second to last stage in the anamorphic

905
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:59,660
book about shrinking heads yeah and bug okay yeah both so anamorphic but not

906
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,820
about it's an animal of a shrunken head turning into a bug. Are head shrinkers real?

907
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,620
I've never heard of them. I think I've seen there's photos of shrunken heads.

908
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,780
I mean I've never heard of them other than they would take they would take

909
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:17,260
heads and they'll... so that was a real reference then in Beetlejuice.

910
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,260
Oh yeah.

911
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,540
Can I pose a scenario here, a voodoo scenario?

912
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,140
So somebody really hates, let's say Pitbull, okay?

913
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,820
Somebody really hates the singer/rapper Mr. Worldwide Pitbull.

914
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,100
They make a voodoo doll of Pitbull, they're sticking pins in his chest and his heart, okay?

915
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,100
And somewhere...

916
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,300
Someone is going to hear this and do this.

917
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,540
I hope nobody does this.

918
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,540
Don't try this at home.

919
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,540
Don't do that to Pitbull.

920
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,920
And then somewhere in New York City, a Pipple impersonator dies.

921
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Do you think this is possible?

922
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,840
Do you think maybe that someone who looks a lot like the Voodoo Doll...

923
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,880
You know, especially if they didn't really know what they were doing.

924
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,960
I would think that you would need to know a social security number.

925
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Yeah, or an email address.

926
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,960
Or for Voodoo Dolls, don't you need like a strand of hair?

927
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,120
Well, Pipple has no hair.

928
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,600
Right, that's why Cameron expertly picked him as an example.

929
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,600
Maybe up there.

930
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,560
You don't know what he's got down there.

931
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,560
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

932
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,560
That's true, he could have had it all laser removed.

933
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Here's my theory, is the more...

934
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
No, he's got a little beard, he's got a little chin thing.

935
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,560
Yeah, that's a tattoo.

936
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,560
My thought is the more...

937
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,560
They call me Mr. Cleaner at work.

938
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
[laughter]

939
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,560
Because you're a janitor?

940
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,560
No, because I clean cars all day.

941
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
Oh, okay, I was close. I didn't know what you did for a living.

942
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,560
That's alright, but they call me Mr. Cleaner because Mr. Clean is already taken.

943
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,560
Right.

944
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,860
- That makes sense.

945
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,020
Oh, cleaner than clean.

946
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,080
- Yes, yes.

947
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,820
- Right, okay, so check this out.

948
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,840
The more DNA that you can get from a person,

949
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,560
the more accurate the voodoo doll is.

950
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,960
So basically, if you take their eyes, their nose,

951
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,340
their mouth, their legs, their arms,

952
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,320
eventually you will have-- - They might die.

953
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,600
- Perfectly, well then you,

954
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,800
but you replace all their organs perfectly.

955
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,720
- And then that voodoo doll will be able, yeah, exactly.

956
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,780
- And they immediately, they feel it.

957
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,980
yeah yeah that's a good point. But their original form is so like

958
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,460
is so injured that it might as well not even exist.

959
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,180
Or it just becomes a clone then at that point.

960
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,220
A clone where the original is intact. Oh my god, let's talk about clones.

961
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,620
Well what about a clone voodoo?

962
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,740
Yeah. Like you're doing voodoo on one.

963
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,740
If you did voodoo on a clone, would the clone and the original person get hurt?

964
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:43,380
just blew my mind. Also, has anyone ever done something really nice to a voodoo doll?

965
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,940
Like I said, like fix my back. Yeah, that's what he's begging for. Yeah, please.

966
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:54,660
Do you know any info on clones? Are they doing human cloning? I believe

967
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:00,180
they... because they clone to sheep. So without getting too much into politics,

968
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,060
there are people that think that Biden is not Biden. Oh, I'm one of those people.

969
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,060
I think he's branded.

970
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:13,060
But they believe that the Biden versus the Biden that was before the presidency

971
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,060
It's obvious.

972
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,060
Biden is not an imposter.

973
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,060
Especially recently. He was 600 years old six months ago and now he's doing backflips.

974
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,060
Yeah.

975
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,060
Makes no sense.

976
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,060
I'm just saying. I don't know.

977
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,060
What do you think of the theory that...

978
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,060
But I believe cloning is possible in humans. I absolutely believe that.

979
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:34,060
It's definitely possible. I just think that some people think that no one would ever cross that ethical line.

980
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,060
I think we've already crossed it.

981
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,700
What do you think of the theory that, speaking of people in power, that some

982
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:46,380
photos came out some weeks ago that were photorealistic, hyper-realistic masks of

983
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,660
world leaders Trump, Biden, Jill Stein, and they were basically saying these people

984
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,740
are not actually even real people. Different actors are playing these people.

985
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,060
That's why they act different. I don't think they're actors. I think they're alien

986
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,940
shapeshifters. Yeah, so that's more... you're more in that school of

987
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:11,460
thought than a lot of things. Look, you know, people couldn't... I don't... and some things I

988
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:17,620
joke around a lot about, some things I'm not, you know. I mean, it would not...

989
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:22,700
let's put it this way, if it comes out and that the truth and that's happened, I

990
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:29,260
would not be shocked. The truth was really revealed. I wouldn't be shocked. Not one bit. You'd probably be

991
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:33,700
shocked if it turned out that there were no alien shapeshifters. Oh absolutely.

992
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,980
Which how do you even prove that? Exactly. I guess you would have to have like a very trustworthy person say it.

993
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,260
Jollibee is an alien shapeshifter. Oh yeah, let's hear this theory.

994
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:46,020
So we talked, are you sure we got a minute? Yeah tell us. So I saw that video and

995
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:52,340
and my theory on Jollibee is that Jollibee is an alien shapeshifter. The

996
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:58,100
reason that all their food tastes so good at that restaurant versus anywhere else

997
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:04,960
that food at that restaurant was banned from his home planet. Why was it

998
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,780
banned from his home planet? I don't know. Because it's human food.

999
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,660
They banned it but all the UFO sightings we're seeing, you know,

1000
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,860
they're transports. They have been opening up a lot of new locations,

1001
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,140
they've been franchising out a lot more. There you go.

1002
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:29,700
spreading like a virus and hey you know what good I'm not complaining yeah it's

1003
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,580
just you know one next to my house the first thing that popped in my head when I

1004
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:42,380
saw y'all's videos like that guy's an alien I mean you know come on now who

1005
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:51,060
else is gonna come up with that but an alien I mean yeah Filipino where are

1006
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:56,140
based out of? The Philippines. I was like, well that makes sense now. Why would you randomly

1007
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:03,140
say that? He has some ideas about race. I'm a big respecter of the Philippines. There

1008
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:13,100
you go. They're going to say I'm a big respecter of race. That too. What else? Here's one.

1009
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,220
Do you think robots could be real?

1010
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,220
They are.

1011
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,180
They are real.

1012
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,580
Like I mean like.

1013
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
But now.

1014
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,580
Oh my.

1015
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,580
You're so pitbull.

1016
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,580
You're so pitbull.

1017
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,580
Oh my.

1018
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,580
Like that kind of robot.

1019
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,580
But our, what do they call them?

1020
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,580
Cyborgs.

1021
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,580
No, Robotronics.

1022
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,580
Robotronics.

1023
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,580
Are Robotronics real?

1024
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,580
That's an alien race.

1025
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,580
Really?

1026
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,580
Okay.

1027
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,580
Oh yeah, we were talking about that earlier.

1028
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,580
What makes them Robotronics?

1029
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,580
I don't know that much about Robotronics.

1030
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,580
You just know their name.

1031
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,900
And I'm not even sure I'm saying that right.

1032
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:47,740
a name for AI race of alien species you could probably google that. What do you say to the

1033
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:55,740
person who thinks... supposedly out there anyway... who like that ghosts and spirits and demons and

1034
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:03,660
aliens and AI is all within the purview of of human consciousness and that and that there's

1035
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,460
nothing outside of this presence which is the human spirit. I'm talking to a friend of mine

1036
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,460
who's in the film industry and we're talking about doing a show...

1037
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,460
To your point.

1038
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:22,460
...would be a fifth production about how all of this is interconnected.

1039
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:31,460
Mm-hmm. But what do you say to the person who says, "Easy answer for why all that's interconnected is because it's all within our minds."

1040
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:37,780
well as in there's no actual phenomena happening outside of our perception.

1041
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:47,500
Outside of the inexplicable nature of human consciousness. That's

1042
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,780
something I'd have to give a little more thought on. Yeah I think you could also

1043
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,100
ask that question it doesn't have to be about aliens and werewolves or whatever

1044
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,100
you could probably say the same thing about hamburgers and hot dogs. Or just

1045
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,100
life in general. I think yeah I think that's kind of a... No one is wondering where those things come from.

1046
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,620
i am

1047
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:08,240
so wait where do i think i'll have to wait he he really wants to know where's

1048
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,180
the beef

1049
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,140
that's right

1050
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:16,180
you never know what you sell hamburgers yeah you look like a burger king guy

1051
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,060
do you think that if he died he would make a ghost or is he like too weak

1052
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:22,180
willed and kind of just like a dust speck in the universe?

1053
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,780
let me tell you something, i work close to nothing. I work close to nothing.

1054
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,940
let me tell you i've seen little guys

1055
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,140
beat the crap out of big huge bouncers in my days so...

1056
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,140
Not this little guy.

1057
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,780
Are you talking about in another realm?

1058
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,780
No, I'm talking about right here.

1059
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:40,060
Like when I used to own bet by my bar I have seen...

1060
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:45,420
I have seen people that you would not think were able to do things.

1061
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,300
Have you ever seen those videos where people like lift up a car?

1062
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,300
Yeah.

1063
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,740
Have you ever seen a guy like me have sex with a woman like Doja Cat?

1064
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,740
Pornhub.

1065
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,740
(laughter)

1066
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,740
(laughter)

1067
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,740
There's everything on porno, man.

1068
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,740
(laughter)

1069
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,740
You saw him fucking Doja Cat on porno?

1070
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,740
I mean, it might as well have been him, you know.

1071
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,740
(laughter)

1072
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,740
Fucking Doja Cat, that's...

1073
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,740
Oh my god.

1074
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,740
(laughter)

1075
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,740
Matt, have you ever seen...

1076
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,740
Is that kind of thing possible in another realm?

1077
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,740
Hey, look, they say that we all have an identical twin in this world.

1078
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,740
I have many doppelgangers.

1079
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,740
All of my doppelgangers are on Pornhub.

1080
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,740
Yeah.

1081
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,740
(laughter)

1082
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:35,740
That's probably the worst place to find your doppelganger.

1083
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,740
I mean, look, I'm just your average bald guy.

1084
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,740
So there's a million of those on Pornhub.

1085
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,740
I'm always searching just your average bald guy.

1086
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,740
Me too.

1087
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,740
You know, I'm not. I just happen to kind of scroll.

1088
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,740
They should make a program where you, like NBA2K,

1089
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,740
you just scan your face in and it finds the closest porn star. I'm trying to scroll through all of them.

1090
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,740
But you're not allowed to scan your crush's face in. Or your crotch.

1091
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:02,740
I have to scroll through all of them to find what I want to watch, you know, so they just happen to be, you know.

1092
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:07,740
Is it mostly you're searching for stuff about ghosts and aliens or is it mostly normal stuff?

1093
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:13,740
There's nothing normal on Pornhub. Sex is not normal. No, absolutely not.

1094
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,740
Have you ever seen somebody die?

1095
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:20,740
Um, yes. I've had, you know, I was a firefighter for 15 years.

1096
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,740
Yeah. So, yeah.

1097
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:29,740
Did you ever, do you feel like when you saw that happen, that maybe you felt like, when you've been around death-

1098
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,740
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get all serious all of a sudden.

1099
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,740
No, you just answered Caleb's serious question.

1100
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,740
Yeah, Caleb was the serious one.

1101
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,740
I would have been offended if you had seen someone die and you said yes, but-

1102
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,740
No, no, no, just straight up.

1103
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,740
Is it?

1104
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,740
Yes, on Pornhub.

1105
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,900
(laughing)

1106
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,180
- Touche, I see what you did there.

1107
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,500
The circle is now complete.

1108
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,900
- Bringing it back to seeing someone die.

1109
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,740
- Yeah, so when you saw somebody die,

1110
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:53,700
did you feel the sense that a spirit

1111
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,060
was leaving or created or something?

1112
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,260
Do you feel that when you're around death?

1113
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:02,260
- No, at the time I'm just more concerned with--

1114
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,260
- I wasn't able to save them.

1115
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,100
- Gotcha.

1116
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,660
- Than, you know, 'cause I didn't do my job.

1117
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,500
- Yeah.

1118
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,320
- You know, so.

1119
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,160
- 'Cause you wonder about,

1120
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,740
earlier that that one ounce or whatever that is in everybody that when you die

1121
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:20,880
at thing I can't really exactly whatever the measure yeah that kind of that weight

1122
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,080
I was wondering if if you're when you're around somebody who dies I guess we just

1123
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:30,040
we can only speculate is it do you do you feel that weight leave the room or stay

1124
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:37,520
in the room you know what I mean is that like the the pressure almost changes the

1125
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:49,480
The times that it's happened to me, I've had, I think, one, two, two die in my arms.

1126
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,720
I didn't think about that.

1127
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,480
I'm thinking about a million other things.

1128
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:00,700
Obviously, because a million other things were happening around us when we were on those.

1129
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,120
So one of them died in my arm.

1130
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:08,000
a few feet we were trying to save a lady that this is a period at my old studios

1131
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,520
oh really somebody ran a stop sign killed this lady in her car. Oh that's awful.

1132
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,940
I was the only firefighter and this guy that worked at the Good

1133
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,600
Shepherd house that was behind the place he was a medic too we heard the noise

1134
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:27,560
ran out tried to save her brought her back did CPR she came back for a few

1135
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,240
seconds and then she just went. Wow. And we were still waiting on EMS at the

1136
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,680
time. I had my, I had pulled my truck up to block the road because I had lights on my

1137
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:42,800
truck and everything and and to keep it from anybody else you know coming to

1138
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,720
interrupt the scene. So that was the second time. The first time it was that I

1139
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:55,360
was actually on a call and we responded to a to a car accident at the Bradley

1140
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,400
Creek Bridge. Wow. And it was she was she was basically DOA and we're pulling her

1141
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,160
out of the car. There was nothing we could do. So you were a fire you were a

1142
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,600
firefighter for many years right? About 14 or 15 years. 15 years and did you ever

1143
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,440
have any paranormal experiences? Were you investigating when you were also a

1144
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,760
firefighter? No, it all happened after. Okay yeah. And do you have but do you have it

1145
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,760
did you have any experiences I mean I feel like firehouses are usually there's

1146
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,080
some spirits around there. So we've investigated a firehouse. Really? Yeah.

1147
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,600
Was it ever one that you we did not find anything in this particular fire?

1148
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,020
Oh, no, did you ask them like has it they asked us to come passed away or anything?

1149
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:42,020
They asked us to come investigate because really I was actually fired hearing an alarm or something

1150
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,920
Well, they they thought they just didn't want to stay there overnight

1151
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:52,100
There's people there so they asked the chief knew me through the fire department and asked and knew I was an investigator and

1152
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,520
asked us to come in and investigate the place and

1153
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,820
We didn't find anything. Nothing. Nothing. So what is that like that feeling of we just spent all this time money

1154
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:09,960
Resources on an investigation. It's partly find anything. Is that is that ever disappointing or just we'll know again next time. No, so

1155
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,040
This is what I don't like about the shows, you know

1156
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:20,080
These shows have to deal with ratings and this that and the other so everything has to be exciting all the time

1157
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,080
And it's just not the case

1158
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,400
Folks it's not this is not how it

1159
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:30,100
Yes, we have come across places that were haunted as shit, right?

1160
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:36,680
But it's not like it's it doesn't happen every single it just doesn't happen. Yeah, you know, I'm sorry, but I'm I don't mean to spoil

1161
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,500
You know

1162
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:43,460
Most of the times we disprove and debunk things. Yeah, you know, we really do and

1163
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:48,320
But you know, you know why and then people go why do you do it? Well

1164
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:54,080
Because you know, it's a passion. We help the community. We give people peace of mind

1165
01:01:54,540 --> 01:02:00,300
We get to meet really interesting people we get to do things that a lot of people don't get to do

1166
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,740
we get to go places a lot of people don't get to go and

1167
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:11,420
All of that in my opinion is a part of it, you know, and we were talking about this earlier and

1168
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:16,660
And I feel strongly about this as well. You know if you're wanting to be

1169
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:23,300
Involved in the paranormal and to just go out and get scared and watch the little meters light up

1170
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,300
You're missing the big picture.

1171
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,300
Yeah.

1172
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,300
And what I just said is all part of the big picture in my opinion.

1173
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,300
It's better to come at it with like almost the scientific research minded.

1174
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,300
Yeah.

1175
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,300
Just everything.

1176
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,300
You get to hear stories that aren't on the history books.

1177
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,300
You know, you get to hear all kinds of cool hand-me-down stories.

1178
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,300
And it's just, you know, it's just a great field to be in.

1179
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:52,300
If you do it in a respectful manner, you will continue to get work

1180
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,700
and you will eventually have an experience.

1181
01:02:54,700 --> 01:03:01,020
I think that that's a beautiful sentiment to maybe to wind down here.

1182
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,860
I have a few final questions.

1183
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:09,540
Have you ever investigated a place and been like, "Oh, thank God that place was not haunted."

1184
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,540
Absolutely.

1185
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,900
Yeah, it seemed like it was going to be very scary.

1186
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:18,940
Let me tell you, just because a house is old doesn't mean it's going to be haunted.

1187
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:22,940
That's a movie thing.

1188
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,940
Nine times out of ten, usually it's land-related more than it is home-related.

1189
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,940
There's a history with something that was there

1190
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,940
before the house was even built.

1191
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:38,940
Speaking of land, sea, kind of the opposite,

1192
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,940
pirates seem to have a lot of stories about...

1193
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,940
So you know what I'm talking about.

1194
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,540
- Pirates are ghosts.

1195
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,260
- They have a lot of stories about ghosts and stuff.

1196
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,900
- I see what you did there.

1197
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,140
- Do you, are pirates, is there certain professions,

1198
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:58,940
I guess, that are just a little more prone to ghost,

1199
01:03:58,940 --> 01:03:59,780
becoming a ghost?

1200
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:00,600
- To be a coroner.

1201
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,460
- Probably a paranormal investigator.

1202
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,060
- Do you, yeah, do you think you'll be a ghost

1203
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:04,900
when you die?

1204
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,720
- I hope so.

1205
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,740
- Yeah, you seem to have a strong will.

1206
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,580
- I mean, I'm--

1207
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,620
- Do you think that maybe that's what all this is about,

1208
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,020
is you're trying to accumulate data for when--

1209
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,940
- The will to be a ghost later?

1210
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,300
I mean, it very well could be,

1211
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,500
because man, I'm gonna prank like all kinds of people

1212
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,340
when I'm--

1213
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,180
- If you prank me, and no offense,

1214
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,100
I really hope you die before I do.

1215
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,940
- No offense taken.

1216
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,140
- And if you prank me, I would feel kind of flattered.

1217
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,740
I guess if I ever get pranked by a ghost,

1218
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,260
I'll probably assume it's you if you're--

1219
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,340
- Honestly, there's all kinds of spirits out there.

1220
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,980
They're not all angry or all sad,

1221
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,620
like some people think there are.

1222
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:39,780
There are playful spirits.

1223
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,320
We've had people go to people's houses

1224
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,800
where they just like to move objects, you know,

1225
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,500
like pick up your car keys and set them somewhere else.

1226
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,840
To me, that's a playful spirit.

1227
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,240
That's not somebody out to try to get you, you know,

1228
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,080
or whatever.

1229
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:53,900
- Sure.

1230
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,260
- How much dexterity does that take though

1231
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,360
for a spirit to move a pair of keys?

1232
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,400
- A lot.

1233
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,240
- Yeah, I mean, it must take like centuries of discipline.

1234
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,080
- A lot.

1235
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:02,900
- Yeah, that's caveman Joseph being that.

1236
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,740
- Did you ever see the movie "Ghost"

1237
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,360
when it's with Patrick Swayze?

1238
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,200
- Yes.

1239
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,240
- Like magnify that times like a thousand, you know,

1240
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,160
when he was learning how to ride on the,

1241
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,000
you know, to move and pick up an object and move, yeah.

1242
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,080
- Yeah, that's crazy. - Yeah, absolutely.

1243
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,640
- I guess I, I mean, unless anyone, I have one--

1244
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,080
- I have one more, you can end, I have one more.

1245
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,760
Do you think there's any truth to the myths

1246
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,760
of the Greek and Roman gods, Mount Olympus?

1247
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,600
- I mean, there's, what was the volcano that,

1248
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,680
you know, Pompeii, was that?

1249
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,520
- Pompeii.

1250
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,120
- I mean, that's, I think there's all,

1251
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,280
I think there's connections there.

1252
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,280
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess it's a, there's so many stories, you know, Cyclopses.

1253
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:49,280
I think there's some truth. You know, stories get twisted over time.

1254
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,280
You know, you've seen, you know, you've heard jokes about the grapevine where it says

1255
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:59,280
something at the beginning of the grapevine, by the time it gets to the end, it's, you know,

1256
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,280
it's completely, you know, skewed, you know, so, but there's still some truth to it.

1257
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,280
So I think there's some truth to it.

1258
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,280
Yeah, to any of those myths.

1259
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,280
I agree, I think there's some kind of...

1260
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,680
Yeah, I guess every myth has its similar kind of grooves to it.

1261
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,680
Definitely.

1262
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:21,200
But yeah, I guess my last question that I have is, what do you think would happen if

1263
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,640
an Autobot vs. a Decepticon?

1264
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,920
I mean, Octopus Prime would just kill everybody.

1265
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,440
Octopus Prime?

1266
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
Optimus.

1267
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,440
Yeah.

1268
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,440
Well, I guess...

1269
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,440
I think that wraps it up.

1270
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,440
Yeah, I mean, Matt, you go ahead and plug your shit.

1271
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:40,280
So, oh gosh, I don't even know where to start.

1272
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,680
Go check out EEP.

1273
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,600
Robbie Spencer is the founder of that group.

1274
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,600
Where can you find EEP?

1275
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,600
Facebook.

1276
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,840
I think they have a website, but definitely on...

1277
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
Remind us what that stands for.

1278
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,840
Erie Expeditions Paranormal.

1279
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,840
Okay, cool.

1280
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,560
They're based out of Fuquay, but we go pretty much any...

1281
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,560
We're going a lot of places.

1282
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,200
We were at Lake Shawnee Abandoned Music Park about a month and a half ago.

1283
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,200
And is that...

1284
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,240
You have public footage of that yet, or is that coming out somewhere?

1285
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,240
We're working on it.

1286
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,240
Cool.

1287
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,560
I am not in a, I don't run a group.

1288
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,600
I am, that is his group.

1289
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,360
He's the founder.

1290
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,240
I am an investigator in that group.

1291
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,920
A good group, good people, a diverse group.

1292
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,680
Just it's, it's just a great bunch.

1293
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:24,680
Um, if we do another one, I might have more info on the four

1294
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,280
productions that I'm working on.

1295
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:31,920
I'll say three of them are paranormal related and one of them is gaming related.

1296
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:36,520
And as soon as I have information on those to where you can go check out trailers.

1297
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,320
Then we'll do another episode.

1298
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,320
Yeah, absolutely.

1299
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,960
Keep an eye out.

1300
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,960
Keep an eye to the sky.

1301
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,960
Right, right.

1302
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,480
And I guess I'm doing some music for y'all.

1303
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,480
Yeah, yeah.

1304
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,480
We'll figure something out.

1305
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,480
So look out for that.

1306
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,480
DaVita Studios.

1307
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,480
Do you have a hub?

1308
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,480
Do you have a website?

1309
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,480
I'm working on it.

1310
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,480
I'm working on it.

1311
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,200
But I do have a Facebook page, DaVita Studios on Facebook.

1312
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,680
And I have a YouTube page, DaVita Studios.

1313
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,360
I've only got one song on it.

1314
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,360
But I do have a page.

1315
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,360
It's alright.

1316
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,860
Yeah, we'll put it in the description.

1317
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,860
Definitely. A little plug for us.

1318
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:10,360
And as we get more, there's getting ready to be a, I'm working on all of those pages now.

1319
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,360
I'm working on an IMDB page for myself as well.

We should be concerned.

There's been 12 confirmed deaths.

1341
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,000
I wouldn't go in there if you paid me.

1342
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,520
What happened to your old team?

Guys, I'm really scared.

They weren't brave like you.

01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,660
Are you real?

01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,660
Oh my god.

Oh my god.

1349
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,660
The first time we heard it, I was like, okay, roof creaking maybe.

1350
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,160
I felt that was following us.

1351
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,660
Why were you murdered?

1352
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,660
Why did you die?

01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,160

01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,160
