1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Ho ho ho!

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,680
A merry Gun City Christmas to one and all!

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,880
It's me, Santa Patches!

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm here to bring you some holiday cheer.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,920
I hope you have your favorite Christmas cybernetic enhancement and hot cocoa at the ready, because

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,080
today is a very special episode of gun city

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,360
because not only is it christmas

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,080
but we're on tv

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,860
hi mom

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,800
hi mrs. claus i'll see you later tonight

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
but first it's christmas eve

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
wait did you say you're gonna fuck your mom?

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,240
your mom is also technically mrs. claus

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,080
your mom's name

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Mrs. Claus?

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
I guess that's right.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
You're Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus is also your mom's name.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Oh my god, is Mrs. Claus Santa's mom the whole time?

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
But first, it's Christmas Eve!

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Shhh!

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,080
All the good little boys and girls, and worse, are asleep.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Except for three very, very special ones.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Patrick Yoda,

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Floatas Piss,

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,080
and Ray William Johnson.

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Wide-eyed and breathless with excitement,

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,080
their...

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,440
Their friendship has taken them across the planet E-Bomb,

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,240
all the way to jungle-infested Earth,

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,080
into the virtual world, and even into each other's penises.

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Oh yeah.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,680
And now, they're in space!

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,480
That's right, on Leo the Collector's, I mean King Leo of New England's space station.

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,680
King Leo's Pleasure Palace, the finest space station of its kind,

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,080
a city in and of itself, and a perfect holiday getaway.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,100
we'll get more on that though later. But now it's time for something a little

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,640
less interesting. It's time to read some Christmas story classics. Gun City

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,240
Christmas story classics. "Plotas, Ray, and Patrick each have come prepared with

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,120
their own Gun City Christmas tale to read and there are so many great ones to

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:15,560
choose from. Another list joke here. Okay. Risky the Ho-Man, A Christmas Carol

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,720
Baskins, that's right because Santa never forgets, and Rodolfo, the red-nosed

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
Latin King. And to whom will they be reading these stories? Well, they're

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,760
reading them to the greatest gift of all, a son created in a lab who is a penguin

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,680
with a water bottle jutting out of his head that holds his brain. And he's

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,000
wearing a leather jacket, I think. That's right. We should get figurines. It's New

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
New Sullivan!

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Aw yeah!

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah! New Sullivan!

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Woo!

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Aw yeah!

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Aw yeah!

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Aw yeah!

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In the remote village of Hoo Town by our humble three

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
while on an adventure searching for the fabled N-Word Pass

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
just so you know

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
he quickly became beloved by all

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
(laughter)

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I guess I almost wrote that, right?

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
A college student who is also eternally four

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
who is also eternally four and forever silly.

61
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
There's no one more fun and more awesome than New Sullivan.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Forever silly.

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Oh, would you look at the time.

64
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
I better get going.

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,160
I have to fly all over earth except for Syria to hand out toys to good little boys and girls.

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,080
Why don't you spend some time with our heroes on a relaxing low-key holiday adventure in

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,280
in a cozy Christmas hotel room,

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,000
probably just what you need during your stressful,

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,760
anxious, and very lonely holiday.

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,920
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,860
Yeah, so you guys are in a hotel room,

72
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,560
you're chillin' with New Sullivan.

73
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,200
New Sullivan is going like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,640
I'm going like, he's really happy.

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,040
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,400
Go, Sullivan, go, Sullivan, go, Sullivan.

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
Doing a head spin in the water bottle.

78
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,160
Sullivan, come hit this, it's crack.

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,560
And he starts waddling over.

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,960
It's a crack pipe.

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,720
I'm crying.

83
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,000
From Earth.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,760
Yeah, I'm crying.

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,000
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,760
I love him so--

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I wish he was real so bad.

88
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah, I guess he takes a hit of the crack pipe.

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,720
It doesn't really affect it.

90
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
It makes you better at doing head spins.

91
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,200
At dancing.

92
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Go Sullivan.

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,080
Go, go Sullivan.

94
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,400
Go, go Sullivan.

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Go, go Sullivan.

96
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,000
He's doing like a little side to side.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,700
He's trying to work it into a head spin.

98
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,740
And then that crack hits.

99
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,360
And what does he do?

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
He head spins even better.

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,280
Holy crap.

102
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,120
- Oh, it's true.

103
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
- So yeah, you guys--

104
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,780
- It makes you better at head spinning.

105
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,520
- You guys have just started cheering on New Sullivan

106
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,320
while he's doing his little dances.

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,160
You guys--

108
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,440
- That's all, let's do the wave right now.

109
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
- What presents, what, but do you guys

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
get presents for New Sullivan?

111
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,880
He doesn't have to know yet.

112
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,720
You shouldn't tell him, obviously.

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,960
It's Christmas Eve.

114
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
- Yeah, I got a present for him.

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,900
- Yeah, what'd you get him?

116
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,240
- I got him a gift card.

117
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
- Oh, okay.

118
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
- He's kinda lost. - He's kinda lost to where?

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,240
- I got him a gift card to Target.

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,480
- Okay, yeah, he'll love that, actually.

121
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
- That sounds fine.

122
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't go wrong with a gift card to Target.

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,500
No.

124
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,000
No.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
I got him a sous vide.

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
A sous vide?

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,840
Yeah.

128
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
It's $350.

129
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,680
Above and beyond this fucking--

130
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,440
Yep, I got you a sous vide.

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,480
I don't know if you know how to cook or anything,

132
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,760
but I fucking hope you know.

133
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,520
I really, I really fucking hope you know how to cook.

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,400
I get a little--

135
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,960
I spent-- I went a little bit out of my budget this Christmas.

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,760
And I'm really fucking hurting right now.

137
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,120
He's picking up on none of it.

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
He's like, "Yeah, yeah."

139
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,440
- I get a little bit self-conscious

140
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,960
about my gift card gifts.

141
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,760
- So the gift card, that's part of your gift,

142
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,200
but the rest of it's actually in the mail right now,

143
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,120
and it'll be here soon.

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,480
- I got him a sweater that you guys have seen me wear

145
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,200
like a hundred times before,

146
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,040
and you're thinking like,

147
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,080
"Oh my, he's giving him a sweater that he already owns.

148
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
"That's a lame gift."

149
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,920
And then I'm like, "Look, Sullivan,

150
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,560
"I got us matching sweaters."

151
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
And I actually got him a brand new one

152
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
of the one that I always wear.

153
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,960
- Oh my God, that's so fucking awesome.

154
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,280
I take out the one I always wear and I put it on I was really fucking hoping one of you

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,560
I was really fucking hoping one of you got a I don't know like a vacuum sealer. Oh, I got that too

156
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:11,540
Yeah, I also got him a vacuum sealer thank Christ because you can't really use it without that vacuum sealer so yeah

157
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,720
He's fuck. He's uh he goes over to his little play area

158
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,580
He has his three favorite toys with him which are all action figures of you guys

159
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,420
- Aw.

160
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,080
- And he's going like, "A la la, a la la."

161
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,420
He doesn't know what you guys sound like.

162
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,260
- Guys, he's singing our song!

163
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,260
- He's singing our song!

164
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,380
- Yeah, and he's having a good time.

165
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,380
- A la la la, a la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

166
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,460
- He turns around, he starts smiling,

167
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,660
he's like so happy to see you guys doing it back.

168
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,260
What are you guys, do you guys have any food around?

169
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,580
- I just cherish him.

170
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,780
- What are you guys eating?

171
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,080
- I'm eating his little button nose.

172
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,260
- Mum mum mum mum mum.

173
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,660
- I'm snacking on some doubled eggs.

174
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
- What the hell's a doubled egg?

175
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
- It's from the future.

176
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
- Oh fuck.

177
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
- It's a deviled egg that has a--

178
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,660
- No, I don't break my brain if I hear what it is.

179
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
- Alright, it has a deviled egg filling.

180
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
- It's an egg from the future.

181
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,660
- What about you, do you have a deviled egg?

182
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
- No, I'm just smoking crack.

183
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
- Okay, so yeah, this is all it goes,

184
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
he kinda like tugs at your, like,

185
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,660
asking for the deviled egg or one deviled egg.

186
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
- He's saying up.

187
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
- Okay, I throw him up in the air.

188
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
- Ah!

189
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
- And I catch him, and then I throw an egg up in the air

190
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,260
And then I throw an egg up in the air and I hold him out.

191
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,460
Does he catch the egg?

192
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,160
We roll actually to see if I'm staring at Sullivan like the

193
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
straight drop video.

194
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,560
Something about doubled eggs is they have a special type of

195
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
gravity where they can be caught by anybody.

196
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,160
Yeah, he rolls.

197
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,760
We rolled well.

198
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,260
He rolled fight.

199
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,360
And then we should be clear when we should be saying new

200
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Sullivan.

201
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,360
Yeah.

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,160
Yeah, because the other we don't want to talk about.

203
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,960
Yeah, we don't want to confuse.

204
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,260
Yeah, I gave old Sullivan a hit of the crack pipe and he is

205
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,860
terrified.

206
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,560
He's not here.

207
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,460
Yeah, he's not here.

208
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
No, no, you guys.

209
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,740
You guys parted ways.

210
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,500
- Yeah, we haven't seen him in fucking forever.

211
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,980
- I should have read up on the lore.

212
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,820
- I should honestly make the lore available,

213
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,780
I feel like, to you guys.

214
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,620
But anyway, so yeah.

215
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,340
- Somebody should make a wiki.

216
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,780
- It was made, it was made,

217
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,020
and then it was updated a little bit,

218
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,260
then I think it got deleted.

219
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,580
- Somebody should not have deleted it

220
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,980
so that I would have a resource.

221
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,220
- Yeah, 'cause I'm not good at providing information.

222
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,660
- I ate one double dig.

223
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,740
- Okay, well, New Solvent ate 15.

224
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,820
So New Solving goes over and he starts like,

225
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,140
(chewing)

226
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,420
he starts eating them, he takes another hit

227
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,700
of the crack pipe, he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa!

228
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,980
- Makes him able to eat more food.

229
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,380
- Yeah, oh yeah, and he has more of it.

230
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,740
And then he sort of like lays back, he's like,

231
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,500
(groaning)

232
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,340
- I look at him, I just go--

233
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,780
- What's wrong, little buddy?

234
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,860
- I look at him and I'm paranoid as shit.

235
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,300
- He's got a-- - Got my hand on the wall.

236
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,740
I'm like, stop it.

237
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,620
- Tommy.

238
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,620
And he goes, he takes his three favorite toys,

239
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,220
He puts them away in his little basket and he says, "Goodnight."

240
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,820
And he goes over to the bathroom.

241
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,620
He knows how to say goodnight.

242
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,420
That's cute.

243
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,620
That made me not scared of crap anymore.

244
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,920
I'm gonna smoke some more.

245
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,320
And when he goes, he goes over to the bathroom and, um...

246
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
What he does, you just, uh...

247
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,520
You feel a chill in the air.

248
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,320
And the lights flicker, just slightly at first, and then...

249
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Total darkness.

250
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:30,760
So it goes, it's Kurt Vonnegut.

251
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,560
The arity bomb, drained of all its color and verve,

252
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,040
save the apolescent eyesore that is a one-gun city.

253
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,040
From up here on King Leo Space Station,

254
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,720
it's a smoky mess of nauseous light,

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
artificial to its silicone bones and ugliness

256
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,320
in its hot plastic guts.

257
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,480
But up here, things are new, too.

258
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,880
Shiny, still derelict, still made from the recycled parts

259
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,880
of ancient attempts at similar space stations, but new.

260
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,520
You'd think the trouble wouldn't follow any of us up here,

261
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,120
but I'm telling you this tale from beyond the grave.

262
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,440
There's a killer on this space station,

263
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,600
and they go by playtime.

264
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,640
They usually look for childless couples.

265
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
They usually wait for one of the freak outages that occur

266
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
on the space station.

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,360
They usually slit their throats,

268
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,960
and when the lights come back,

269
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,200
They've usually left atop each victim's corpse their favorite toy.

270
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,760
Could be a new video game, an action figure, a sex toy, hell it could be a book.

271
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,480
They somehow know, Playtime always knows what your favorite toy is.

272
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,360
What was my favorite toy?

273
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,240
Well I wasn't killed by Playtime, there was a bit of popcorn kernel stuck between my teeth

274
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,040
and I was really digging in there trying to get it out and so my elbow hit the airlock

275
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
and I took about a hundred people with me

276
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
into the cold, inky blackness of space.

277
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
[laughing]

278
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I really liked Crazybones, though, if you want to know.

279
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
[laughing]

280
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Now, playtime, he always kills his victims,

281
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
but he didn't this time.

282
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Well, we don't think he did.

283
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
But New Sullivan is gone.

284
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
No!

285
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Goddamn.

286
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Snatched from his hotel room

287
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
during an idyllic Christmas Eve

288
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
with his adoptive parents and uncle.

289
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,040
They thought they were out of the game, Blotas, Ray, and Patrick.

290
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,540
They haven't solved a case in years.

291
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,520
Actually, they've done several B&Es since then.

292
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,900
But up here, things are new, shiny, still degenerate, still made from the recycled parts of ancient

293
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,640
attempts at being funny, but still new.

294
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,320
And the trouble followed them up here, too.

295
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,200
So maybe it's time to don the hats and silly voices.

296
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,680
In the D20s.

297
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:08,880
time for gun city a broad city playtime continue fun that's good that is really

298
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,280

299
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,040

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:30,820

301
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:40,140
where'd you get that yeah so you guys have been in your hotel room on Leo's

302
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:49,660
pleasure palace for days months actually completely despondent okay yeah sorry

303
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,100
Sorry. So you guys have been in your hotel room for months, completely despondent after

304
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,220
New Sullivan's disappearance. Oh, we did a flash forward. Oh yeah, we're flash forward.

305
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:08,020
Oh my god. Okay. Did I miss my birthday? When is Ray William Johnson's birthday? It's my

306
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,060
birthday. Okay, you didn't miss your birthday. When is my birthday? Your birthday is in April

307
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,140
sometime but I don't remember what day. What's the date though? I just told, I don't remember

308
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,700
the date I'm sorry. Alright. So I know the date.

309
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,140
12th? 10th?

310
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,100
You're gonna do every single number?

311
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,180
17th right?

312
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,700
Real friend. I knew that too.

313
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,420
I knew that because I used to have a Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 poster.

314
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,620
You should know that because I didn't memorize.

315
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,220
I'm a very close friend of yours.

316
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,620
No that's why. Because in my head when I think of you I think of Paul Blart.

317
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
April 17th 2007.

318
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:47,620
2007. I wish. I wish I was 15. Well anyway so uh... Christmas went by without a thought

319
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:59,380
in your head, New Years, even Martin Luther King Day didn't register. Probably because

320
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,380
he's been dead for many years. Probably thousands of years. 300 roughly. 300, okay. But awaking,

321
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:14,460
Awaking from your comatose state in this decidedly not holiday themed campaign, you have found

322
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,780
a resolve to find playtime, stop his grisly murders, and most importantly, recover your

323
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,580
beloved son, New Sullivan, and nephew.

324
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Heard that.

325
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
Mm-hmm.

326
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Okay.

327
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
My nephew?

328
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Your nephew, yeah.

329
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
They're the parents.

330
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
You're the uncle.

331
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Yes.

332
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Okay.

333
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
Oh, I remember this now.

334
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
I paid off all my debts.

335
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
Mom, dad.

336
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Yeah.

337
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
Or does this take place before?

338
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:42,060
So okay this falls canonically after this is after the heist so you paid off your debts

339
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,060
Yeah, you guys were just here to celebrate Christmas. You were you did your one last job

340
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,000
You solved your one last case did your one last so we're technically you thought you were done with all hiding

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,420
No, no, no. No. I thought we were in hiding away. I'll explain at the end of the campaign, okay

342
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,600
Yeah, tell me more of the lore

343
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,300
I need to know the space station of pleasure palace was erected a few months after you'd helped Leo the collector locate the temple of

344
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:28,860
to Penguin of Doom and complete his epic toy collection with the N-Gage.

345
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,800
He first invaded Sky Ireland and turned the leprechauns into his slaves, then used them

346
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,160
along with his royal guard to continue invading the numerous sky islands that exist above

347
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,260
Gunn City and Planet E-Bomb. He had declared himself King of the Skies and struck a treaty

348
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,320
with Gunn City, including both the government and the oligarchical board controlled primarily

349
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,240
by Papi Chuko's Technoslime Corporation.

350
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,400
The relationship between King Leo and the city is contentious, but if they were ever

351
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,960
or go to war, there'd be destruction, you know, all this,

352
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,040
you know, they don't wanna do it.

353
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,160
So they have proxy battles,

354
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,560
and they have a sort of healthy, unhealthy relationship

355
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,600
kind of. - Okay.

356
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,440
- Yeah.

357
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,760
Cheers.

358
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,600
- Cheers.

359
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,960
- I don't have a drink. - Do you want one?

360
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
- Yeah, I'll have a drink.

361
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,880
Yeah, thank you, man.

362
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,720
- All right.

363
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,760
Continue, proxy battles? - Oh yeah, yes, absolutely.

364
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,160
- Wait, now we gotta-- - We gotta do the cheers again.

365
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,040
- Okay, cheers. - Oh yeah, hold on, cheers.

366
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,480
- Wait, can we get the toy cam?

367
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
- Can you get the toy cam?

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,840
- Cheers. - Lower.

369
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Where do I should go?

370
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,060
the Dungeons and Dragons

371
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:42,920
That's not right it's not be fitting and it's not right. I'm sorry all right anyway um oh

372
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,720
Yeah, so all this is say that after Leo had carved a significant enough portion of the land above for himself

373
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,080
if he took to space, where he could finally create his pleasure palace and include all

374
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,000
the toys Leo the Collector, before he was King Leo, has ever collected and wishes to be enjoyed

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,500
by all for an astronomical fee, political favor, or blackmail.

376
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,240
Or in the rare case of you three, a combination of a sizable chunk of change you got from

377
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,880
your heist, but overall at a discount because Leo actually kinda likes you guys.

378
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,760
Though since he's become king, you can't really get in touch with him.

379
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,280
He's sort of doing his own thing.

380
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Ghoster.

381
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
A little bit.

382
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,920
around in the future. Ghosting. Thought they'd have abolished it by then.

383
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,680
Me too. I thought it would have been criminally punished by death. Or worse.

384
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,160
We'll talk through what's in the Pleasure Palace as we explore it. Right now you guys

385
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,880
are in your hotel room in the resort, the Ten Seasons. There's ten seasons on Planet

386
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,120
Yvonne. Okay, list them. Winter, spring, summer, fall, salt, pepper, paprika. He knows. And

387
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,080
And then cumin and monsoon season. Those are the 10. I thought about this.

388
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
God, he's good.

389
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,000

I never thought that this would happen.

412
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
What else do you guys want?

413
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520

Okay, so this is my corner.

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Yeah, you're in the barracks.

416
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
That's yours, and then that's Cameron's.

417
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Whatever we're doing now, this is gonna...

418
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:53,400

419
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
I don't want anything though. I don't want anything.

420
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Yeah, you guys have like a suite.

421
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Yeah, that's what your computer. You're like Odo from Deep Space Nine.

422
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
You're like a demon with a computer in your back.

423
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
This is my stuff.

424
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Do you have to do stuff for your demon though?

425
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I don't know. Let me see him.

426
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I haven't even seen my character.

427
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Where is your character?

428
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I mean, I thought we were going in order.

429
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Alright, so let's go to Blotoss.

430
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Okay, Blotoss.

So this is, I actually, well I went to the store today to get my guy.

433
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,600
and I actually was able to find, I didn't know, think that I would be able to find this, but I actually found an officially licensed US Army Grinch Hunter figurine.

434
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,400
Whoa!

435
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:36,700
You can see he has the little, he has a who knows and who whiskers and his gun says Grinch Gun on it, which I thought was crazy because that's the name of my character's gun.

436
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,400
It's kind of amazing.

437
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,900
It's really cool too, I mean, I just, I'm really happy.

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
I could have just super glued all of our guns into the hands, but...

487
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
No, you wouldn't be able to do that.

488
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Yeah, we'll do that later.

489
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
You don't have to be too close with it, Kim.

494
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,660
conversation. Let me hear that.

495
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:10,780
Fuck. I'm so fucking depressed. I hate my life. And then your voice sounds like...

496
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
Uh, my face is in the ground.

497
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,780
*Mimics the sound of a dog barking*

498
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,780
*Mimics the sound of a dog barking*

499
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,780
I'm- I'm going-

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,780
*Mimics the sound of a dog barking*

502
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
Knock, knock, knock at the front door.

506
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Hello sirs.

just a person who works at the hotel

511
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,500
uh... that's not what i want to know

512
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,300
it's called

513
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,780

514
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,780
canada

515
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,460
all right

516
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,500
we won't

517
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,380
you're going to do it though you know you should look at the issue it play with

518
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:16,380
the

519
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:23,380
help the way God made me sir. God didn't make that. He's got, he's got scoliosis. True. You

520
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,500
don't remember that about him? No. I don't either. I don't even remember who that is.

521
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,940
I don't remember the last couple of fucking months. I'm just one of the attendants at

522
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,460
the hotel, not an important character. That's Mr. Attendant. Mr. Attendant is my name, how

523
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,420
did you know? Because I have a good relationship with you. That's right, we do have a good

524
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,220
relationship. Rub my back. How far back do, okay just rubbing your back. I paid you to

525
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,900
rub my back and my thighs. You know I do that for free, you don't have to pay him. I pay

526
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,400
him because he's good at it. Here are your towels you requested along with the various

527
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,840
candy treats you wanted inside of them. I also have a message from a one Belinda Crokes.

528
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:09,840
She works for the king so I'd take a look if I were you. He presents a small UMD cartridge

529
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,320
which projects the image of a

530
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:20,320
a royal guard member of Leo's Royal Guard

531
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,440
(laughter)

532
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,240
okay what does he look like?

533
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,240
he looks sorta like this.

534
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,360
but he's also decked out. He looks like a pop star. He's got a space marine armor. Is this our Roblox guy?

535
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,160

these should allow you to

just come straight away and all that

554
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,280
I didn't decide if he was British or not.

555
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,060
This will now self-destruct and it explodes.

556
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
The guy explodes?

557
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,620
Well, the UMD cartridge he was coming out of.

558
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
Oh!

559
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,460
Oops, I shot it!

560
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
That's why it exploded.

561
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,580
So you guys have been summoned by Belinda Crokes, who's the head attendant to the king,

562
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,340
about an urgent matter.

563
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,740
So if you guys want to start going there, because that's kind of a wrap.

564
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,900
Even if Belinda Crokes tells me to do it.

565
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,400
Oh!

566
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,740
I don't fucking care.

567
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,540
I should put this gun to my head

568
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,240
and pull the trigger and kill me.

569
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
[Laughter]

570
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,740
You should line it up so it shoots me in the fucking head too.

571
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,240
Okay, let's line it up and kill all three of us with a single bullet, guys.

572
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,740
So who... so you have the Grinch gun, so if you want to roll an attack roll...

573
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Oh, and I fell down.

574
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
Oh.

575
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,740
Stand up straight, you fucking hammerhead.

576
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,240
I'm so drunk because of my painful depression.

577
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,640
I hear another knock at the door.

578
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Oh, I'm saved!

579
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Hello?

580
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,240
Hi, I'm the guard from before.

581
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,800
Oh, okay.

582
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Could you please-

583
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,160
Wait, if you were here, why did you use the UMD thing?

584
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,600
I thought it would look cool.

585
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
I really did.

586
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,720
I thought it would be sort of like, "Who's that?"

587
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
What do you want?

588
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,120
I really do need you to come-

589
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Well-

590
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Okay, we'll go.

591
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
I'll explain.

592
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,960
Hold on.

593
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,480
It's concerning playtime, the killer who stole away your boy.

594
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,920
Why are you saying that?

595
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,040
So at least have a little bit of- How do you already know that he did that?

596
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,080
The king knows many things.

597
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,800
So he knows who playtime is.

598
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
No, no.

599
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I feel like there's supposed to be a hole in the story already.

600
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
No, no, this is a whole issue.

601
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
This is a larger- Yeah, there's a whole issue.

602
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
There's a hole in the plot.

603
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,360
No, no, well, there might be.

604
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,720
I haven't finished it yet, so we'll find out together.

605
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Guys, I can't stop falling over.

606
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,400
Okay, here's what we'll do.

607
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,360
Oh my god, Bluetoss has the Grinch gun to his fucking head.

608
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,120
No, Bluetoss, don't do it.

609
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
What?

610
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Don't shoot yourself, please.

611
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,400
Oh my god, this space station must be zero gravity, we're all so clumsy.

612
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,520
Oh my god, we're so clumsy.

613
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
Okay let's go.

614
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Alright, let's go.

615
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Let's keep going.

616
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,800
Alright, can we clear this out?

617
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,820
Yeah, we do that. Yeah, strike it wait. Okay, so I didn't mean my fucking cool shit. I was bringing with me to wherever we're going

618
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:06,360
This is the stage. Yeah, that's how you get around. Oh, do you have nothing I have lots of things don't

619
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,840
so King Leo's Pleasure Palace Space Station

620
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,040
Is the single largest man-made entity ever launched into space roughly the size of gun cities Lockheed District

621
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,160
It has a slick, U-shaped design that billows at the ends and constricts in the center.

622
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:31,160
The dark, glossy outer layer in the blackness of space, those yellows and reds are the docking bay lights,

623
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
remind the station of its shape.

624
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,160
The many massive windows that line the thing help give residents the greatest view known to any living creature

625
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
of Ferry E-Bomb and of the universe itself.

626
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,520
There has never been a project like this since the earliest expeditions from Earth to E-bombs

627
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,920
from 300 years prior.

628
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,500
There's many areas.

629
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,840
You guys are in the resort area right now, as I said, the Ten Seasons, which is in the

630
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
middle.

631
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,440
On either side of you now is New Gun City, to the north, and to your south of the resort

632
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,760
is Newer Gun City.

633
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,680
You'll be going towards New Gun City to get to the Royal District, which is at the very

634
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,800
top of the space station.

635
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,560
Further in from the space station is Leo's Thunderland, which is his massive arcade mall

636
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:21,720
amusement park connected by a series of jungle gym-like obstacles, which acts as both a museum

637
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,960
dedicated to Leo's finest toys and an amusement center for all visitors.

638
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,720
Then there's the station's operations, the crew quarters, the leprechaun slave quarters,

639
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,240
a number of other locations which we will all uncover together throughout this adventure.

640
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,400
uh...

641
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,880

interesting.

659
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I

660
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
think

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000

interesting

665
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
story.

666
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I

667
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
think

668
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
it's

669
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
a

670
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
very

672
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
story.

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
think

675
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
it's

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I

681
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
think

682
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
it's

683
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
a

684
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000

interesting

686
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,460
face right now. It's pretty Dwight of you. God, my hand looks old. So yeah, John Carlo

687
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,120
the Bullfrog comes up to you and he says, "How are you?" With that face he's John Krasinski

688
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:28,120
the Bullfrog. "Oh my goodness, Patrick, Blotas, Ray, it's been so long. How you guys doing?"

689
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,880
I don't remember if that was your voice. It was basically my voice. Okay. "We're doing

690
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,120
pretty good. We all tried to kill ourselves with one bullet about 90 seconds ago." I'm

691
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,380
so sorry the last the last thing we're doing that but we stopped so that means

692
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,120
we're doing but we stopped because we thought that we went to a different room

693
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:56,960
yeah distracted over fell over again a lot of a lot of the people on this ship

694
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,320
what's all it over what's the deal with this shit man I think they're still

695
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,240
working out the king put up a wet floor sign in the very least Jesus Christ is

696
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,600
Is it that the floor is wet?

697
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I don't know.

698
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Probably.

699
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,360
I've been meaning to talk to you guys.

700
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,960
I came up here about a week ago.

701
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,400
I figured something out.

702
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
What's up?

703
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
What's going on Patrick?

704
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
This better be worth it.

705
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,800
Okay, that was not worth it at all.

706
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,840
Now you won't tip over.

707
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,480
You can move that thing.

708
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,120
As you guys may know, I am now CEO of Papi Chuko's Techno Slime.

709
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,520
So thanks for killing the other guy.

710
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Oh yeah, we did it for you.

711
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Really?

712
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Pay up.

713
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,360
Let's have the first roll of the campaign with the deception check.

714
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,520
I forgot this isn't an action figure.

715
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Not yet.

716
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Playtime.

717
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
It really feels so crazy to me.

718
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,520
We're gonna give it like three sessions until it just becomes an action figure.

719
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,520
The second we started doing the character voices and also doing this, I was like, oh

720
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
no.

721
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,520
I don't know if dice are gonna make it that much longer.

722
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Okay, that's a 16, deception.

723
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,020
Okay, he's like, wow, I can't believe you did that for me.

724
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:17,980
and

725
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,180
Hold on, wait, I can pick it up.

726
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,780
Did you drop your new phone?

727
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Hold on.

728
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,780
[LAUGHTER]

729
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
OK, wait, hold up.

730
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,580
Here, make sure you hold on to that.

731
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,940
So anyway, while you're putting your feet in my zone--

732
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,820
[LAUGHTER]

733
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,940
I'm sorry, I just slipped.

734
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940
I'll get up in a second.

735
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,140
This guy's comfortable.

736
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,540
That's no problem.

737
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,140
We slip all the time on this ship.

738
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,140
So anyway, I have to thank you for that.

739
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,780
But the other thing is, if you're ever

740
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:51,500

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980

while you're on board here. You let me know. I wasn't invited to the uh...

771
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,580
Oh shit. Sorry.

772
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,580
Oh my god, you just chopped that guy in half.

773
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,580
Oh my god, another one of his victims!

774
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,580
What the fuck is going on?

775
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,580
Another one of Playdate's victims!

776
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,580
Wait, I'll stand up and sort this out.

777
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,580
Really? Yeah.

778
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Oh no!

779
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,580
Whoa, what's going on over there?

780
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Y'all are acting crazy. Turn out a little bit though.

781
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,780
Anyway, if you ever need- I guess I don't know how this happened, but

782
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,060
if you ever need any extra money, you know I'll be here at the resort.

783
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,580
I wasn't invited to the Royal District, despite my status as a-

784
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,220
Can you please- What are you doing to my leg?

785
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,180
Leave me alone!

786
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,460
Please no longer mount me.

787
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,140
But yeah, that's all I kind of wanted to say.

788
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,180
Also, my cousin is here, by the way.

789
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,660
He's definitely been looking for you guys.

790
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,300
Oh yeah, weren't you cousins with like a puddle of piss from a puppy?

791
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
Wait, is he dead in this world or no?

792
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,300
That's the other one.

793
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,100
Oh, fuck.

794
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,900
I don't think so, yeah.

795
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,700
And you guys see--

796
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,340
Wait, that means we could kill him.

797
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,380
On the Schlitterbahn water slide repurposed

798
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,460
by Leo the Collector, part of his collection of toys,

799
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,180
which he has sort of like a high concept understanding of that,

800
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,340
you hear a familiar--

801
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,140
[GROANING]

802
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,540
Oh, no.

803
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,780
I'm stuck.

804
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,900
I'm stuck on the slide.

805
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,580
Show us the vitrine.

806
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:59,580
And then a really fat guy slides down the slide and just knocks him out into the pool.

807
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,580
And he goes, "I'm splashed!"

808
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
"I'm splashed!"

809
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Oh my god, dude.

810
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,580
He's so small!

811
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,580
That's Solomon.

812
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
That's Ludiculo.

813
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,580
Hi! Hello!

814
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,900
Look how small he is even compared to Patrick Yoda.

815
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:28,420
Well thank god, because I was about to have a complex if Sullivan was bigger than my character.

816
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,420
Hey you guys!

817
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Hey!

818
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
It's been a while.

819
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,420
We did the heist, remember?

820
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,420
Okay.

821
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,980
Sort of like old times.

822
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Only worse.

823
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
Okay.

824
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,340
I'm just not, I'm gonna, this is not canon.

825
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,660
I'm gonna put you in a canon.

826
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
How'd you get on this ship?

827
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
Well, John Carlo invited me.

828
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
That's your cousin?

829
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Yeah, wait, how are you two related?

830
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
He's suave.

831
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Yeah, I mean, uh...

832
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
Well, you know, uh...

833
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Cousins come in all different shapes and...

834
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Yeah, I can't deny that.

835
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,660
[laughter]

836
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Cousins do come in all different shapes.

837
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
I got some nicely cousins.

838
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Well, anyway, I know Sol is...

839
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,660
I'm gonna leave you guys...

840
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:44,180
of

841
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:50,200
Like good Sullivan, yeah, is it your name is yours turd or something? Yeah, it's dirt right? It was crud

842
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,620
You got it on crud. I think it was crud and then dirt and then nothing

843
00:40:54,620 --> 00:41:02,600
Yeah, it was nothing when I was relistening to the older episodes to make sure there was a lot of fun sort of oh yeah

844
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,260
Did you guys hear something? No, I heard nothing. It was good

845
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,540
Okay. Well, you're back to being nothing. That's just reminded us how funny it was. No, it was

846
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:18,740
It hurt a lot, but it was pretty funny. Okay, now I missed you guys get on this block. Okay, guess what?

847
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,740
That's the gay block

848
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,180
You just stood on the gay block

849
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:33,900
You just got back on it why'd you get back on it? I don't seem like the right thing to do. Oh

850
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:39,260
You are so stupid. I missed you. Okay, Stan now stand on this block

851
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,460
Okay, well, can I just know what kind of- can I know what kind of block this is?

852
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
It's not the gay block.

853
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
No, it's not- well, obviously you can only-

854
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,460
In the camera?

855
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,460
You can only have one gay block, obviously.

856
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,460
It's not, though, it's not that gay block.

857
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,460
Are you familiar with Lucy and the Football?

858
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,460
What?

859
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Shut up.

860
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,460
Why'd you get on the other gay block?

861
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,460
Bro just stood on the lesbian block.

862
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,460
Oh my god.

863
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
He's a lesbian.

864
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,860
It's particularly it stings you are so so stupid

865
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:16,860
Okay, so why are you here? No? I was just here cuz John Carlo invited me. It's like a fun vacation

866
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,160
It sounds fun our son died

867
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:28,020
New find that was dead. I'm sorry. We're gone at the very lane. Oh, no was it by or he's still alive

868
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,340
I can't really tell play time

869
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,780
Yes, it was my plate knows the other serial killer. Yes, it's play time. Oh, yeah

870
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,860
There's other okay. Well killers. Well. There are other things going on

871
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,620
I mean there's been monsters escaping from the guts of the ship, and it's been all kinds of stuff going on

872
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,740
Oh, yeah, you guys will learn that as we travel. I guess it makes it together

873
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,560
We were as we are three months right yeah, you were we are gonna travel together, right?

874
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,140
I mean we will travel and I guess you'll know

875
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,940
Help I can still see him through your legs

876
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,220
gang is back together. It's a lot more. Yeah. Do you remember these characters?

877
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,060
Isn't this exactly how you always imagined them?

878
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,140
This one probably.

879
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,580
And our new friend, Bikie.

880
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:25,820
Oh yeah, by the way, Sullivan, or nothing. This is our new friend, Bikie.

881
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:31,260
He's so cool. He's so cool. He's cool as fuck.

882
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:49,260
I'm

883
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,260
Bikey is tired and doesn't want to be played with right now guys.

884
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,760
Yeah.

885
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Bikey needs to take a break so that we don't hurt Bikey.

886
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,260
Okay, so what should we do?

887
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,260
I think you guys should head towards the Royal District.

888
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,260
That's a good idea.

889
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,760
And see what Belinda Crokes has to say.

890
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,260
Okay.

891
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,260
Yep, I'm down.

892
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,260
I'm hella down.

893
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,760
There's a universe A and a universe B, so they don't know each other.

894
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,260
Hey, I'm gonna be real with you, no one's ever listened to that.

895
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,260
A lot of people have.

896
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,260
No, I don't think so.

897
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,380
I think nobody even knows that shit exists.

898
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,380
Universe A, universe B.

899
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,380
I'm looking at you.

900
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,380
A, be normal.

901
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,380
Nerd.

902
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,380
Yep.

903
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,380
A, B.

904
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,980
A, be normal and let's see what D Belinda Crokes has to C.

905
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,660
Let's see Belinda Crokes double D's.

906
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,660
Okay.

907
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,660
F yeah.

908
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,660
E.

909
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:46,140
So you guys leave the resort and go on your way.

910
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,140
I'm glad we left the resort.

911
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,140
I, for one,

912
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,140
think we should

913
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,140
keep leaving the resort.

914
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,140
Leaving the resort, you follow a path that circles

915
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,140
around a semi-holographic

916
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,140
statue of Leo the Collector,

917
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
dressed in his new metal finest,

918
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,140
kneeling before another statue of King Leo.

919
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Standing tall and proud, dressed in a sleek

920
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,140
form-fitting suit, black and metallic,

921
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,140
rather than his usual dirty, high-luxury

922
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,140
brand trench coat. His head now

923
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,140
adorned with a thin gold crown, his hair

924
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:18,780
now cropped neatly in the fashion of the time, rather than a dangling collection of dreads.

925
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,800
It is Leo passing the torch of his former... What are you doing?

926
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,700
Just keep talking.

927
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,540
Just keep talking. Life is an eccentric collector into that of a king.

928
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,060
Along the path of the familiar...

929
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,620
Along the... Okay, alright.

930
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:42,140
Okay, this is a little... You know, I don't really want people to know how clean or not clean my teeth are.

931
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:42,640
Oh!

932
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,640
As you get nearer...

933
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,640
Nope, I'm skipping parts because I'm getting distracted by the camera.

934
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,640
Along the path of familiar dingy glow...

935
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,640
Dingy glow... Dingy.

936
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Dingy.

937
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
Dingy dingy.

938
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,640
Dingy glow of Gun City's staple techno-slime neon

939
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,640
grows sharper and more dominant as you approach new Gun City.

940
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,640
Now you're leaving the resort, you're walking towards new Gun City.

941
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,640
The stars you'd normally see out of the massive windows atop the ship

942
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,640
that line the Pleasure Palace grow dimmer,

943
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,640
as Technoslime's unique qualities suck the character out of nearly everything.

944
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,640
As you get nearer, the similarities stop.

945
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,640
While Technoslime powers a city, it doesn't have the haphazard architecture

946
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,640
and urban planning of a city at the whim of the market.

947
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,640
Rather, it looks like the Gun City by way of Gadsville,

948
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,640
a centrally planned autocratic vision for what Gun City could be.

949
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,640
White buildings made of a super-hard plastic and unusual metal,

950
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,160
sections of which seem fitted together by dark grey interlocking edges which meet to

951
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,880
form from any regular distance cool black lines that run along the structures like traces

952
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,440
on a circuit board.

953
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,800
A faint prismatic rotation of technoslime glow emanates from these interlocking edges suggesting

954
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,920
some kind of chemically powered architecture.

955
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,200
The path beneath you, or sorry before you, is made of some kind of asphalt, but as an

956
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,580
adbot flies by it tells you that it is not asphalt but a synthetic material meant specifically

957
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,580
to prevent cronation and make walking in New Gun City like a dream.

958
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:18,180
So it says. So on top of a few of these buildings is the flag of New England,

959
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:24,700
which is King Leo's New England, which is what looks like the United Kingdom flag,

960
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,340
but they swapped the blue for the green and the red for the black. United Kingdom flag.

961
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:37,580
Is there a name for it? What is it? Does it have a name? Why do you know that, huh? Union Jack. It's called Union Jack. Shut the fuck up.

962
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,620
Bro's a punk. You should probably not know that. Fake punk. The Union Jack! The Union Jack!

963
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:48,100
Yeah, exactly I was trying to make sure that this storyline is punk rock mostly humanoids walk the streets here

964
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,120
We're gonna have to figure this out one day here. They are walking the street

965
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:59,500
Cultural differences how people walk up here. I mean they can't beat him join them

966
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:05,240
Oh, yeah, and the and Leo's Royal Guard and the occasional Mecca Brit

967
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,100
Which is these guys?

968
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,100
Who are piloted by Leo's guards?

969
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,380
There's storefronts, residential buildings, yadda yadda yadda.

970
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,380
If you guys want to shop, you can. There's food here, you can buy more techno-slime refills if you want to.

971
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,380
But anything that's really that relevant to your adventuring needs,

972
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:28,380
where you'd want to spend money on, say, upgrades to your weaponry or new...

973
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,380
What are you eating?

974
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,380
That's going to be here at night, or it's going to be in New Orgun City.

975
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,380
No, that's fine, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

976
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,380
Oh, just...

977
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,380
Please ignore him.

978
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,380
The camera didn't cut to me. You don't have to know.

979
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,380
I'm not used to this. This is my first video.

980
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,380
That's true.

981
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,380
It's Patrick's first time playing with toys.

982
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,380
And I'm having the best time of my life.

983
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,380
I really, I did

984
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,380
have a serious moment of panic

985
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,380
about two minutes in when I realized that we

986
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,380
will now be doing D&D

987
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,380
with toys in front of Patrick

988
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,380
the entire time.

989
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,380
It really,

990
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
it really is scary. Check out what I did for Cam.

991
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,380
You gave him, you see

992
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,380
like right there, you pointed it at me.

993
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,060
I can see already.

994
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,540
He has cake in his hand.

995
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,500
So I'm just sorry if you're listening to this at work.

996
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,940
I just realized how much crap you're probably missing.

997
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,580
Yeah, you gotta watch it on your iPod.

998
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,340
It sounds like a wagy to me.

999
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,300
I think, you know what, Patches, I believe in you and I think we can strike a perfect

1000
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,300
balance.

1001
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,300
I think you're right.

1002
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,300
I think I can do that.

1003
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,300
So if you guys want to...

1004
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,100
So yeah, you guys are in the new gun city.

1005
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,540
You guys are probably going to be looking for the Zippy Loop Station.

1006
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,140
Yeah, I mean that's basically it.

1007
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,340
You guys can head right there, you can go to some shops, you can talk to some of the people

1008
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,340
in the crowd here.

1009
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,340
This is really meant to be a space for entertainment.

1010
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,620
What is that lady doing in the crowd?

1011
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,220
You can't do that in public.

1012
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,820
That's not your...

1013
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,500
Hey, that's not a sharpener.

1014
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,020
Is this a character?

1015
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,020
It's me, Pencely!

1016
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,020
Oh, well bye.

1017
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,020
Get him out of here.

1018
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,020
Oh my god, he's infinite.

1019
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,020
Jesus Christ.

1020
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,020
Wait, that was mine.

1021
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,020
Good.

1022
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,020
I'm glad I threw it away.

1023
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,020
I'm sorry I'm full of these.

1024
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,020
Let's go to the Zippy Loop.

1025
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,020
Yeah, let's go to the Zippy Loop.

1026
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,020
So you guys go to the Zippy Loop train.

1027
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,020
It's a system that will easily and quickly transport you to each part of the space station

1028
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,020
as we play through the campaign.

1029
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,020
You guys will get familiar with the Zippy Loop as long as you have the proper credentials.

1030
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,020
As it stands, you can use the Zippy Loop to get to the station.

1031
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,020
It's a system that will easily and quickly transport you to each part of the space station

1032
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,020
as we play through the campaign.

1033
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,020
You guys will get familiar with the Zippy Loop as long as you have the proper credentials.

1034
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,660
Zippy Loop Train is a system that will easily and quickly transport you to each part of the

1035
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,460
space station as we play through the campaign.

1036
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,640
You guys will get familiar with the Zippy Loop as long as you have the proper credentials.

1037
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,100
As it stands, you were just granted access to the Royal District, which very few of the

1038
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:45,320
tourists who are here on the Pleasure Palace are able to do.

1039
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,020
You can still go to New Gun City, Newer Gun City, the Resort, and Thunderland right now.

1040
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,260
You might get access to the Command Center later if you want to go talk to the Captain

1041
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,880
the ship. The train itself resembles a small chain of capsules you would use to

1042
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,060
take for depression or anxiety. Each capsule is meant to hold 15 people at its

1043
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,820
maximum. There are comfy seats that line each car to assure maximum comfort for

1044
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,660
those who ride in it and most importantly no leprechauns allowed. You can flash

1045
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,660
your Royal District Pass and ride in the appropriate capsule which you know you

1046
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,900
guys can do that. You do that. You're on the capsule now let's move this. Oh my

1047
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,900
Let's get you guys seated.

1048
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
I want to get some rolls in.

1049
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,900
Yeah, we're going to do that. Oh, it's coming up now.

1050
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,900
I already did a roll, so I'm pretty much set for the rest of it.

1051
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,900
So you guys can take the rest of the rolls.

1052
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Thank you! That's very actually fun.

1053
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,900
Arrange the guys where they're sitting.

1054
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,900
Where are you guys sitting inside this capsule?

1055
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,900
Here are some of the passengers who are sitting here.

1056
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,900
I'm sitting on this guy's lap.

1057
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,900
I am a serious fucking hoe for attention,

1058
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,900
so I'm going to stand opposite,

1059
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,900
looking at everybody.

1060
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:54,740
everybody basically on a stage and I will you know what I'm doing ballet up there

1061
00:51:54,740 --> 00:52:02,460
as well but not because I have a ballet character it's because my character Ray

1062
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,780
William Johnson is re has it's how he's coping with this death of his son

1063
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,780

1065
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:21,100

1066
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,100
My performance is...

1067
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,100
I forgot how to do D.

1068
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,100
So look at...

1069
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,100
The skills, there should be a number next to the word "performance".

1070
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,100
I add that?

1071
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,100
Yep.

1072
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,100
But these look way too high.

1073
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,100
Oh, you guys are a much higher level than all your other characters in this.

1074
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,100
What number are you adding?

1075
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,100
Three.

1076
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,100
That's too high?

1077
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,100
That's not that high.

1078
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
For me.

1079
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,100
One of them is nine.

1080
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,100
That's so high.

1081
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,100
Investigation.

1083
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,100
And tech savvy!

1084
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,100

00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Yeah, and that's because he, uh...

1202
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,200
has a small penis.

1203
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Well, if you ever...

1204
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
I don't know.

1205
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
If he believes anything that I say...

1206
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Well, if you ever wish to stand up to these royal guards once and for all,

1207
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,200
you can meet me at the guts of the ship one day, and we can take care of these guys.

1208
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
So, uh, I'll see you on the next stop.

1209
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
And he walks off the train.

1210
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
So he got, he tells you about the guts of the ship.

1211
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Go there, ask for a Seamus.

1212
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Guys, we gotta go warn the ship

1213
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
that some little guy with HIV's

1214
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
trying to get up in its guts.

1215
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
With no protection.

1216
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
And you guys land

1217
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
at the Royal District.

1218
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
Uh, after your train ride.

1219
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
I'm over here and I'm like,

1220
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,200
"Guys, my reflection looks crazy, there's something wrong

1221
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,200
with this mirror!"

1222
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Oh my god!

1223
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200
What happened to me?

1224
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
Nope, that's what you look like.

1225
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,200
Oh my god! Hold on, let me look at this real quick.

1226
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Does that look...

1227
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,200
Can you see that? I'm too small

1228
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,200
to see it!

1229
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Can somebody point the mirror down?

1230
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Oh my god, I'm beautiful!

1231
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
I'm so

1232
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,200
beautiful!

1233
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Okay, then we're at the rural district. Yup, and

1234
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
it looks nothing like the sterile plastic

1235
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,040
golden yellow stately baroque buildings that house guards and important

1236
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,520
residents but its biggest

1237
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,520
*laughter*

1238
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,520
Fucking yellow.

1239
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,520
Could be Spongebob.

1240
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
Spongebob!

1241
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,520
Hey, don't look now,

1242
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,520
but they got Spongebob in the royal castle.

1243
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Marge!

1244
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,520
Marge!

1245
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,520
Marge!

1246
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,520
It's Marge!

1247
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,520
It's Marge!

1248
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,520
Holy fucking shit!

1249
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,520
*laughter*

1250
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
This is the greatest place

1251
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:28,560
The fucking over that is Homer's the greatest place in the whole fucking world kodo and Kang

1252
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:34,600
Yeah wider blue man

1253
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:43,760
What's that

1254
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,580
But it's biggest differentiator

1255
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:55,820
I think he thinks I'm gonna like this fucking castle

1256
01:00:55,820 --> 01:01:03,100
No, okay, is that it's filled with real plants vibrant and green

1257
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:09,740
That's it a top terraformed plots of land so the rest of the green was supposed to be

1258
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,580
yeah, the rest of the

1259
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,820
Space station has kind of artificial

1260
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:18,820
most things artificial air artificial water

1261
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,820
These are sort of generated through honing techno-slime.

1262
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:28,820
And you guys happen to have pretty good doses of it, because of where you are in the ship.

1263
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:35,820
But folks who are in the crew, like the Leprechaun and even some of the ship's crew, have to have sort of the runoff of that.

1264
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:41,820
But here in the Royal District, it's all actually terraformed real fake trees.

1265
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:50,820
So you guys can walk towards the Ambassador to the Kingdoms building, which is where Belinda resides.

1266
01:01:50,820 --> 01:02:00,820
You see there's a separate ship that follows alongside, behind rather, the Pleasure Palace,

1267
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:06,820
and that is Leo's actual sort of floating space castle.

1268
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:13,720
This is just sort of like the ambassadors area where he can come here where they'll have warships come in and things like that

1269
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,860
So are all the terraformed

1270
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,060
Trees are they the

1271
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:24,740
From that the trees that smell like nut from that Mitchell and Webb sketch

1272
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:38,140
I've seen I've seen Mitchell and Webb I have not seen that trees that smell like as soon as you said are so all the

1273
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:43,320
Terraformed trees I knew because the sketch is about that park in England where the trees do smell like jizz right yeah

1274
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,240
Yeah, they smell like jizz okay, okay?

1275
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,580
Why don't you roll for jizz?

1276
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,620
He's gonna do

1277
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,980
I got a

1278
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:20,980
You got that jizz

1279
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,980
Guys, it smells like cum here.

1280
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,980
Cool.

1281
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,980
The head's not always great.

1282
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:35,980
You keep walking and you go to the Ambassador's Palace, um, where...

1283
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,980
Ah!

1284
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,980
You swept away Patrick. Patrick, come back.

1285
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,980
Holy fuck, my fucking leg!

1286
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,980
My fucking leg is broken!

1287
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,980
I'll heal it, don't worry.

1288
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,980
Okay, it's healed now!

1289
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,980
But where's this queen?

1290
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,980
Completely forgot Sullivan in that last scene.

1291
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,980
Um, so...

1292
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,980
He does, yeah.

1293
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,980
Okay, so...

1294
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,980
Whoa, look at that. That's crazy.

1295
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,980
How'd you guys walk in here?

1296
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,980
This is the entrance over here.

1297
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,980
You guys are walking in to Pleasure Palace.

1298
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,980
Ah, shit.

1299
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,980
Oh...

1300
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,980
My...

1301
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,060
I can't see anything. I'm face down on the floor

1302
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,000
You see a hey

1303
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah guys. Let's crawl on her. She'll think we're bugs

1304
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:38,100
I am a bug

1305
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:44,380
So you see a Gumby superior the captain

1306
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,820
Yeah, yeah, if you want to control, thank you.

1307
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,820
I want to control.

1308
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,820
Captain of the space station.

1309
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,820
A handsome man in his late 30s

1310
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,820
who is completely green

1311
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,820
with a blonde crew cut.

1312
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,820
This is the best I could do right now.

1313
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:03,820
He's wearing a white

1314
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,820
space marine outfit, which is more important I guess to me.

1315
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,820
Intricate and decorated,

1316
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,820
which it isn't. He's a war hero

1317
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,820
from the Transylvanian wars, retired

1318
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,820
now and commanding Leo's Pleasure Palace.

1319
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,820
He's a gun city native.

1320
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:21,820
And Leo securing him as a captain was like a local legend leaving their home team for a rival team.

1321
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,820
That's my simile there.

1322
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:27,820
Gumby is saying too.

1323
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,820
Belinda Crokes, who you see here, who looks...

1324
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:34,820
She looks like a frog girl, but...

1325
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,820
Yeah, that looks like a frog.

1326
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,820
Yeah, she looks like frog-like to me.

1327
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:44,820
"I'm just saying my crew would feel a lot more secure, especially if playtime can't be dealt with,

1328
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,020
that we shut down Huge-Ass Facts once and for all."

1329
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:57,540
And Belinda says, "Captain Gumby, I understand very much what you're saying, but you know just

1330
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:02,900
as well as I that things like that take time, and know that our Royal Guard are working on

1331
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:07,620
building a case, and that all of this we should discuss next time when there aren't visitors in

1332
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:22,980
Fine, fine, I'd like to see your frog legs walk on over to the command center every once

1333
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,100
in a while.

1334
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,820
So you can inspect it.

1335
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,220
Make sure everything is...

1336
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,220
Inspect this.

1337
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,460
(laughter)

1338
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:39,900
- Yeah, and inspect this too.

1339
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:45,660
Can't really do mine, I don't have a poseable figure.

1340
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,080
- Yeah, and I will inspect this.

1341
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,200
All right, so where's the--

1342
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,020
Oh, I fell.

1343
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,220
You can inspect this.

1344
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,660
- Get that away, no.

1345
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,920
(laughter)

1346
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,920
He is a character.

1347
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
Oh, okay.

1348
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,920
I thought you were just trying to scare me.

1349
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
No!

1350
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,920
Okay, I'm saying inspect this and then I don't realize he leaves.

1351
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:13,920
And you see walking behind you a tall, strong, big man who is looking at you.

1352
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,920
That's a man?

1353
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,920
He is a man.

1354
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,920
I clipped.

1355
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,920
So, his name is Shark Eyes.

1356
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,920
And he has a...

1357
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,920
Couldn't have just like...

1358
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,920
And he has literal sharks in his eyes.

1359
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:34,920
is

1360
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:40,080
okay

1361
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,080
like

1362
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,480
all

1363
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,480
now it's a guy

1364
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,480
does that is that a that is

1365
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,920
so

1366
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,040
the uh...

1367
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,040
sort of uh...

1368
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:59,280

1369
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,440

1370
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:08,440

low tossing

1373
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,600
couldn't reach you sooner.

1374
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:28,600
While playtime has given us trouble, there has been more recent problem.

1375
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,600
The huge-ass fax is growing under city.

1376
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,600
Yeah, I'd like to fax a huge ass.

1377
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,600
No.

1378
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,600
Managing the leprechaun bondsmen, sorry, bondspersons.

1379
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,600
And to be quite frank, the celebrity of playtime has its own benefits.

1380
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,600
We now need someone to stop this charismatic syriac.

1381
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:56,720
And I thought you three, with your experience as the detectives that precede you, I was hoping

1382
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,920
you could help.

1383
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,920
So I can pay you for this, and the King would pay you for this as well.

1384
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,280
We need you to find and ideally apprehend Playtime.

1385
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,280
This is...

1386
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,280
She's talking.

1387
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,280
This is...

1388
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,160
Apprehend Playtime.

1389
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,800
We don't want to have an outright execution, unless it happens publicly.

1390
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,280
Though even though, even then, we'd prefer that to be officially sanctioned by the Queen

1391
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:24,080
in some capacity. Either way, we believe you have the skills and motivation with your missing

1392
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:30,320
son to get this done. You'll be given an allowance of 1000 tokens daily for your work, enough

1393
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,720
to continue covering your stay at the resort with some pocket change left over for meals

1394
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:39,480
and any other uses you may have. All I ask is that you report to me any new findings

1395
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:44,160
on the case so I can align resources on the Kingdom's End to help you. I don't wish

1396
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:50,560
to get in your way. I'm familiar with how you work. If you complete this, not only will

1397
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,240
you be given an additional lump sum of 100,000 tokens each, but you will also be knights

1398
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,240
of the New England Empire.

1399
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:05,240
Ma'am, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you have been sitting on Sullivan the Frog the whole

1400
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,240
time.

1401
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,160
Oh, I apologize, I didn't...

1402
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,400
Hey, come over here, Sullivan.

1403
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,680
You look, you look, come on.

1404
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,160
Come over here, come over here.

1405
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,260
I've been trying not to talk to you guys, but okay.

1406
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,360
(laughing)

1407
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,520
Keep going, Belinda.

1408
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:26,680
Not sure if I have to tell you boys

1409
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,320
that there is a growing tension on E-Bomb

1410
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,920
between Gun City, the board, and our kingdom.

1411
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,960
I do not wish to pressure you to ally with any faction.

1412
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,100
Rather, I see your amelioration of playtime

1413
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,240
as vile crimes to help de-escalate tension.

1414
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,240
I'm not looking so I can't tell what's going on.

1415
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,240
Nothing!

1416
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,240
[Laughter]

1417
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,240
Nothing's going on.

1418
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:50,240
[Laughter]

1419
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,240
This is an interplanetary news story waiting to happen.

1420
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,240
If everyone finds out soon about how long Playtime's been killing people on this here

1421
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:03,240
sh-damn space station, we could be in serious shit.

1422
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:10,240
This is really not looking, I can feel, because I can feel something's happening.

1423
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,920
Nothing's happening.

1424
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,240
So are you detectives in,

1425
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,840
or what?

1426
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,480
We're in.

1427
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,200
We're in deeper than you can imagine.

1428
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,680
We're in so deep already.

1429
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:30,360
You guys leave

1430
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,960
the ambassador's

1431
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,300
area

1432
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,560
it's more complicated

1433
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,040
the work of our kids and later episodes

1434
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,760
but i can't leave this room

1435
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,020
so that i have a word i think i don't know that

1436
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,640
uh... shits

1437
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,060
for the people who are listening

1438
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,380
we jumped in her hair

1439
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:56,640
yeah i guess it's gotta be all that's a big barbie yet the big barbie

1440
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,720
i will say uh... what's up

1441
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,360
the people who are listening of already had it's so bad for so long with these

1442
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,600
uh... the weed

1443
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,600
yet really is

1444
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,440
i don't think this is much different from what we know it was a very uh... through

1445
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,320
you know we hope we hope all this does is add

1446
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,380
uh... as you guys leave

1447
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,880
uh...

1448
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,140
you see a uh...

1449
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,280
you see a uh... you hear scream outside in the royal district

1450
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,320
what does it sound like

1451
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,000
probably the

1452
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,200
that was released the wind guys

1453
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,800
Yeah, I don't care about that.

1454
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,300
Roll a dexterity saving throw, all of you.

1455
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,700
We're back, baby.

1456
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,100
Oh my god, no, that was a 10.

1457
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,500
I live for this.

1458
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,200
Yeah, 10.

1459
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:41,900
I got an 18.

1460
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,700
I also got a 10.

1461
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,100
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1462
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,700
I didn't fill out the dex.

1463
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,400
The dex save?

1464
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,700
Just look at your-- do you have your other sheet?

1465
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,500
Yeah, it's on the floor, though.

1466
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,500
All right, that's fine.

1467
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,600
Also, just what's your dex?

1468
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,600
What's your modifier?

1469
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:09,100
my

1470
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:26,100

1471
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,900
roll something for me as a reference to wrap

1472
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:36,740
earlier

1473
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,140
very dramatic with your face

1474
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:46,140
just get the don't need all this get it

1475
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,740

1476
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,860
yet to once

1477
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,300
to do it to one thing to do is to eliminate upstairs to ones

1478
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:53,940
You're right.

1479
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,440
Uh, you two...

1480
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,660
That's what my nephews say.

1481
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,540
Patrick Yoda and Ray William Johnson, you take 8 damage.

1482
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,860
Fuck.

1483
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,140
You take 4 damage.

1484
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,100
Okay.

1485
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,900
And you two are gonna take 1d4 damage for the next 3 rounds,

1486
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,940
because you just got acid spit on you...

1487
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,260
Oh, fuck you, I did!

1488
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,060
...by a beast that came from below!

1489
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:13,940
Whoa!

1490
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:14,540
Blah!

1491
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,740
Great, I knocked my shit over.

1492
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,900
Roll for initiative!

1493
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,900
This thing's crazy.

1494
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,540
Let's fucking do it.

1495
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,540
Yeah, yeah.

1496
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,540
Got a six.

1497
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1498
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,540
Okay, that's enough of the yeah, yeah, yeah, beast.

1499
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,540
Um, I got a 14.

1500
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,540
I got an 11.

1501
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,540
Not only are you a bastard, you beast.

1502
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,540
Whoa!

1503
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,540
You're annoying.

1504
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,540
What'd you get, Pat?

1505
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,540
Yeah, you got a drawing laptop.

1506
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,540
That's crazy.

1507
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,540
Six.

1508
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,540
You recommended that?

1509
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,540
Yeah.

1510
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,540
Can you recommend that to me next?

1511
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,540
No.

1512
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:48,540
[Laughter]

1513
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,540
You take eight.

1514
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,540
And you're gonna take 1d4 in the next round.

1515
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,540
I knew it!

1516
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,540
Who got the 14?

1517
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,540
Me.

1518
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:03,540
That's so funny. I knew it.

1519
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,540
Shuffling through all your prints.

1520
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,540
Like an accountant in a meeting. I knew it.

1521
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,540
Okay, how many points of damage do we take this quarter?

1522
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,540
I knew it.

1523
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,540
Yeah, I had a 14 initiative.

1524
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,540
You're gonna go first.

1525
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,540
Ray William Johnson.

1526
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,540
Alright.

1527
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:24,420
You see some of the guards you see some of the guards

1528
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:35,900
You really got to stick to the mic if you're talking I'm sorry battle mode battle graphics

1529
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:42,400
Well, it looks like it's fucking he's made it a come

1530
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:50,060
Wouldn't say that's the best. Oh, yeah, I thought the same thing and I ate the other one. Oh, come on

1531
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,060
No, not gay humor for me

1532
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:56,260
Cut that out. Sorry. I'm cray today

Okay, there we go you get my

as well as... Get the fuck away from me.

1535
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,340
One of the Mecha Brits is gonna fight on your side.

1536
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,340
This is a real big fat fight.

1537
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,340
You have to talk into the mic.

1538
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,340
You guys are in for some serious shit right now.

1539
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,340
Can you put the Mecha Brit up as best as you can?

1540
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,340
It's not gonna happen.

1541
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,340
No, I had it earlier. He is in lying down mode.

1542
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:32,340
Nice. That's cool.

1543
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,340
Every once in a while they should stand.

1544
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,340
So yeah, you're up Ray William Johnson.

1545
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,340
Okay. Okay.

1546
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,340
So, I mean, I guess.

1547
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,340
Uh, give me my bitch back.

1548
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,340
So each of those squares are going to be 5 feet right now.

1549
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,340
We're just going to have...

1550
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,340
Oh, I'm 10 feet wide.

1551
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,340
We're just going to...

1552
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,340
We're going to...

1553
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,340
You're all...

1554
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:54,340
We're going to ignore some of the size things that are happening here

1555
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,340
during any of the battles.

1556
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,340
We're going to try to pretend that things are normal.

1557
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,340
That means I'm 5 feet wide.

1558
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,340
That's normal for you.

1559
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,340
Can I ask you one question?

1560
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,340
What's up?

1561
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,340
I have day veins still.

1562
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:09,340
Yeah, it doesn't affect you.

1563
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:12,780
Yeah, no, you're good. I'm crossing that out. Yeah, this is a

1564
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:21,460
Might come in later, but yeah, okay, don't worry. I'm gonna use my I think I'm gonna throw my sexual grenade right about here

1565
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:24,680
Okay, manage it. What is a splash damage on?

1566
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:32,700
The splash it is

1567
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,500
That's a 10-foot radius.

1568
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,500
Right, so where are you going to throw it?

1569
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,500
Oh, you said each of these are 5 feet?

1570
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
Yeah, so you should try to aim it here.

1571
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,500
Yeah, I'll do that.

1572
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,500
And the range on that I think is what, 60 feet?

1573
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,500
Yeah, so mostly I guess I'll be hitting these guys.

1574
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,500
So let's see, can you reach that though?

1575
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,500
Let's draw that diagonal, let's imagine this together.

1576
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,500
Yes.

1577
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,500
Yeah, that's about right, you got that.

1578
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,500
Okay, go for it.

1579
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,500
About.

1580
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,500
Alright, that is...

1581
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,500
I add my attack bonus?

1582
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:08,500
Yes, so it should be plus 6 I think, right?

1583
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,500
Plus 9, oh yeah, I forgot how strong you are. 24.

1584
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,500
Roll for damage. 2 D10s.

1585
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,500
We're playing in the big boys. I forgot which one is a D10, man.

1586
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Looks like two guys on top of each other.

1587
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,500
2 d10's, a 10.

1588
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,500
Cool.

1589
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:38,500
And now he's gonna also have to roll a dexterity saving throw to see if he gets any of the sticky burning cum on him.

1590
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,500
He does.

1591
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,500
What does that do? I believe it gives him, he's gonna take some extra damage.

1592
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
Let me take one little look-see.

1593
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,500
Um, the sticky cum reduces their move-

1594
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,500
[Laughter]

1595
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,500
These are their movement by half for one round.

1596
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:58,500
For each additional two tablespoons of sticky gum.

1597
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:02,500
Let me explain. So what you guys have for a lot of these abilities, what I've done,

1598
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,500
so also subtract the Techno Slime points it takes on your...

1599
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,500
So you have your Techno Slime resources there, so subtract what you use there, not the refills.

1600
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:15,500
So what I have is a lot of these can be kind of upcasts by you spending additional Techno Slime points.

1601
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,500
So if you see the plus symbol next to the requirements,

1602
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,600
you'll be able to start to figure out what those upcasts are.

1603
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,400
We'll figure that out together over time.

1604
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,400
So yeah, it just reduces the movement. I thought that was actually good.

1605
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,000
That's fine. Okay, cool.

1606
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,200
So that's pretty good. It's a good start.

1607
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,400
And now it is the Beast's turn.

1608
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,600
The Beast is going to start—

1609
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,400
the Beast is going to sort of like clench,

1610
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,400
and you see its tentacles atop its head start to wander around,

1611
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,700
start to flail around, and that's it.

1612
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,700
That's all it's going to do for its turn.

1613
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,700
Cool. Wow. That was so cool. Nice flail.

1614
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,700
So now these guards are going to run up and try to attack them with their lightning spears.

1615
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,700
Oh, they're on our side?

1616
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,700
Yes, they are.

1617
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,700
Oh. I thought that they were on the monster's side.

1618
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,700
How did you not know?

1619
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,700
These are the beasts coming to invade the world of history.

1620
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,700
Because they were fighting us earlier on the train?

1621
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,700
Well, it's because you guys were being mean.

1622
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,700
They were pointing this way.

1623
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,700
They were pointing at the monster.

1624
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,700
That's true. I should have ascertained the situation.

1625
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,700
I'll describe things better.

1626
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:17,700
AD did ascertain what he did.

1627
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,700
So I'll be the sore loser about it.

1628
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,700
I said I should have ascertained.

1629
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,700
Wow.

1630
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,700
Wowie zowie.

1631
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,700
You had sarcasm.

1632
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:23,700
I had no sarcasm in my voice.

1633
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,700
You had sarcasm.

1634
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,700
You had way more sarcasm than me.

1635
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:26,700
What role would they do?

1636
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,700
I'm about to tell you.

1637
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,700
So, okay, where's my de-sensors?

1638
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,700
So these three guys approach this beast.

1639
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,700
Oh, these three guys approaching this beast.

1640
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,700
That was a good poem.

1641
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:32,700
Good.

1642
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:33,700
And they take a bow.

1643
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,700
And they take a bow.

1644
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,700
And they take a bow.

1645
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,700
And they take a bow.

1646
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,700
And they take a bow.

1647
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,700
And they take a bow.

1648
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,700
And they take a bow.

1649
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,700
And they take a bow.

1650
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,700
That was a good poem.

1651
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,700
And they take...

1652
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:49,700
This guy manages to dodge out of the way as he's tentacled.

1653
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:51,700
As everything falls the fuck over.

1654
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,700
These tentacles are gonna have to just...

1655
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,700
We're just gonna have to roll with this for a little bit.

1656
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,700
These two guys end up taking damage as these tentacles lash out at him.

1657
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:04,700
It seems that anybody who comes into range of him right now is gonna get attacked by these tentacles.

1658
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,700
And if they do get attacked...

1659
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,700
Except for me.

1660
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,700
Do we get to know how much damage they take?

1661
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,700
No.

1662
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,700
Okay.

1663
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,700
You'll know if you get hit though.

1664
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:13,700
Yeah, I know.

1665
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,700
I was just checking if we got to know beforehand.

1666
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,700
But then this guy did manage to dodge.

1667
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,700
Does it look like it really hurt?

1668
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,700
Okay, yeah, that I can tell you.

1669
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,700
I mean, it looks like it's not hurt hurt, but it looks like it could have hurt a lot more.

1670
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,700
Okay.

1671
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,700
All right.

1672
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:21,700
That ain't too bad.

1673
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,700
Thank you.

1674
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,700
No problem.

1675
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:24,700
So this guy did make it past the tentacles, ducking and weaving and then falling over.

1676
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,700
And he does manage to land an attack on the enemy.

1677
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,700
So he's got a lot of health.

1678
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,700
He's got a lot of health.

1679
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,700
He's got a lot of health.

1680
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:29,700
He's got a lot of health.

1681
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,700
He's got a lot of health.

1682
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:35,700
So this guy did make it past the tentacles, ducking and weaving and then falling over.

1683
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:40,700
And he does manage to land an attack on this guy with the lightning spear.

1684
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,700
He does 7 damage, I'll tell you that.

1685
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:49,700
So this guy is still looking pretty good. He doesn't look too hurt, this beast.

1686
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,700
But these two guys have to stop in their tracks before they can approach.

1687
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,700
It is now, who got the 11?

1688
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:56,700
That was me.

1689
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,700
It is your turn, Blotas.

1690
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,700
Did the beast's turn go already?

1691
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:08,060
ready? Yes, he did. Okay. I'm sorry. No, that's okay. I'm not even mad about it. I'm just

1692
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:13,220
gonna shoot my Grinch gun. I think I'll... Can I tell how far... Like, can I tell at

1693
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,500
what point did the tentacles... Roll an insight check. Just do a free insight check. Okay.

1694
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:22,100
Ten. Okay. I mean, you can tell that where you are, it's not gonna reach you. Okay, I

1695
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,900
wanted to see if I could... But I can't tell if I can move any closer. You can tell that

1696
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,300
you can move a little bit closer. Yeah. I'm gonna move to here. You're fine. Okay. Yeah.

1697
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,900
And I'm going to shoot my Grinch gun twice.

1698
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,100
All right. Cool. Go for it.

1699
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,500
Okay. That is a 24.

1700
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,700
That hits.

1701
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,700
Okay. That's 5 damage.

1702
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:44,100
And then that's a 23.

1703
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,900
All right. That hits.

1704
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,100
And that is 7 damage.

1705
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,000
Okay.

1706
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,200
Pretty good. So, yeah, you shoot at this beast.

1707
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:57,400
You can lodge the bullet in what amounts to its chest.

1708
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,700
It lurches forward.

1709
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:01,260
and you lodge another bullet just a bit lower

1710
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:05,380
into where you imagine maybe it's sort of like a sternum is

1711
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,140
and it sort of lurches forward again.

1712
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,700
But it still is up.

1713
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,980
And again, it seems pretty resilient,

1714
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,360
whatever this thing is.

1715
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,420
So now, it is Patrick Yoda's turn.

1716
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,100
- I'm gonna use Yoda's mind.

1717
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,180
- Okay.

1718
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,660
So you wanna read the mind of this beast?

1719
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:22,860
- Yes.

1720
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,700
- Okay.

1721
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,700
Yeah, I believe that was a wisdom saving throw on my end,

1722
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,340
right, you wanna read the description

1723
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:45,260
for

1724
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:50,100
When the surface thoughts of the target target what is most on its mind in that moment, as

1725
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:55,580
an action, Patrick Yoda can either shift his attention to another target's thoughts or

1726
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:58,500
attempt to probe deeper into the same target's mind.

1727
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,900
If you probe deeper, the target must make another wisdom saving throw.

1728
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:04,660
If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning.

1729
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:10,020
Alright, so, there's other stuff there, but that's all we need to know right now.

1730
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:14,140
You are able to probe into its mind, so you can get the surface level thoughts.

1731
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,140
And it is saying kill me.

1732
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:20,500
Can I probe deeper and ask why?

1733
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,100
Because that would take another action.

1734
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,100
I get a bonus action.

1735
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,100
It doesn't funnel in.

1736
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,420
Since we're here I get an extra attack.

1737
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,940
So the way that works is that you...

1738
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:30,940
Oh right because that's not an action.

1739
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,180
It has to be an attack action then you do an extra attack.

1740
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:35,540
But you did hear kill me which you...

1741
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,540
I mean yeah.

1742
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,540
Use that to your...

1743
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,860
Hey I just read his mind this fucker wants to be dead.

1744
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:41,860
Do your best.

1745
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:43,860
(laughter)

1746
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,360
Okay.

1747
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,660
Alright, now it is the mech's turn.

1748
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:48,660
The Mecha Brit.

1749
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:51,660
The Mecha Brit is going to approach.

1750
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:54,160
And stay- that's actually exactly right.

1751
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,660
And it's going to shoot its spear out

1752
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,660
towards the beast.

1753
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,660
And it's going to miss.

1754
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:04,160
It shoots the spear out, and you can see that it has like a long

1755
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,660
steel cable- beautiful.

1756
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,660
It sort of lands-

1757
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,660
Whoa!

1758
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:13,000
it lands next to the beast and sort of ricochets back

1759
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,380
it's gonna shoot it one more time

1760
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,780
and it misses again

1761
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,740
so uh...

1762
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:21,840
it's just way above the beast's head

1763
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,680
uh... and it's the end of its turn

1764
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,360
and it is now your turn again Ray William Johnson

1765
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:30,320
okay now that i know that i don't want to kill those little fuckers

1766
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:34,240
i want to use my matrix beam on this muh

1767
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,700
okay wait should we kill it or should we uh...

1768
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,820
Yeah, it wants to die, but why does it want to die?

1769
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:41,060
I will abide you.

1770
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:42,060
You could find out next turn.

1771
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,060
Yeah, because I could also...

1772
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,580
As long as you maintain concentration, you can probe deeper.

1773
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:46,580
I don't know that.

1774
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,820
I don't know that, so I'm going to keep killing this.

1775
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,060
You also might not care.

1776
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,060
I don't care.

1777
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,060
You can say anything.

1778
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:53,060
I just don't want to die.

1779
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,060
So, here's the thing.

1780
01:25:54,060 --> 01:26:00,980
If you do Matrix Beam, it will hurt these guys too, probably.

1781
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:01,980
I don't care.

1782
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:02,980
Okay, cool.

1783
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:03,980
Yeah, it can...

1784
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,380
Casualty of war, you can explain it later.

1785
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:06,540
No, I did it on purpose.

1786
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:07,540
You won't even do it?

1787
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,540
Read Matrix Beam for the crowd.

1788
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,780
Matrix Beam.

1789
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,820
Five...

1790
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,460
100-foot cone.

1791
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,660
Making me hungry for ice cream.

1792
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:19,060
Duration, instant plus.

1793
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,060
What does that mean?

1794
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,180
It means that you can actually, if you...

1795
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:26,340
You can charge it, and it'll do more damage and go a little bit further.

1796
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:28,100
If you want to, like, charge it and hold it for a few rounds.

1797
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,060
Roll a spell attack to deal 4d8 psychic damage and a 60-foot cone.

1798
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:36,100
Each creature in the area who sees the Matrix Code must make a Wisdom saving throw.

1799
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:40,100
On a failed save, the creature is put into a Matrix Daze for the duration.

1800
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:44,100
While in a Matrix Daze, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

1801
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:51,100
The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

1802
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:57,100
For every 6 seconds RWJ takes to charge his Matrix Beam, it can shoot 10 feet further than what I'm at.

1803
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,100
Roll that d20.

1804
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,100
And that's a four.

1805
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,100
Okay, even with your spell attack.

1806
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:05,100
Oh, with my spell attack?

1807
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,100
It's gonna be plus nine, which is very good.

1808
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,100
That's cray.

1809
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,100
He's pretty OP now.

1810
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,100
I'm pretty cray.

1811
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,100
Everybody manages to get out of the way,

1812
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,100
thankfully for them.

1813
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,100
Spend your Techno Slime points on that too.

1814
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,100
You know what else is cray?

1815
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,100
Green salad in a blue bowl, y'all.

1816
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,100
That's why you have the Techno Slime refills.

1817
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:32,600
And we have to remember the techno slime addiction system and remember techno slime refills cost a bonus action during combat

1818
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,900
So that you can use it and then use an action the same turn

1819
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:40,460
So you can use it now if you want to use the room like a beautiful

1820
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,980
You are up now

1821
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,300
monster the monster

1822
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:52,940
Is going to retract its tentacles. I like the sound of that and going to chomp at one of these guys

1823
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:53,780
- Nice.

1824
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:56,740
Good God.

1825
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,980
That hits.

1826
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,560
That's gonna do a lot of damage.

1827
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:10,140
This guy's dead.

1828
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:10,980
- Whoa!

1829
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:11,820
- He chomps him.

1830
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,340
You see as he bites down in him

1831
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,500
that sort of a milky, acidic substance.

1832
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,580
- I knew they were made of gum.

1833
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,380
- No, it's not gum this time.

1834
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,880
and washes over this guy.

1835
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,380
[SCREAMING]

1836
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,380
And he slowly dissolves into his mouth.

1837
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:30,380
Well, actually, pretty quickly.

1838
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:32,380
And he is swallowed.

1839
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:34,880
He now chomps at this guy.

1840
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,880
But that's it.

1841
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:47,880
Yeah, he's dead.

1842
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,380
[LAUGHTER]

1843
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:50,380
Wow.

1844
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,380
That's kind of scary.

1845
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:54,380
Yep, this guy's tough.

1846
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,380
There's only one soldier left.

1847
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,380
So his tentacles aren't whipping around.

1848
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,380
Oh, I'm sorry, this one soldier has to go.

1849
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,380
He is running away.

1850
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,380
He's made of green foam.

1851
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,380
He is a coward.

1852
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,380
"I'm too young to die!"

1853
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:10,380
And he runs away.

1854
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,380
What if he dies of a different thing?

1855
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:14,380
Can we try to attack him while he runs?

1856
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,380
He's running by you.

1857
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,380
You can use your reaction to attack him.

1858
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:25,380
attack him. You can use your reaction to attack him. So roll, use your hoagie. Speaking of

1859
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:33,060
hoagie, keto blueberry sandwich with lettuce bun. That hits. So I add a +8 to that? Oh

1860
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:40,700
yeah. You guys are beast in this campaign bro. Yeah that hits. Or no, 23. No, wait. Yeah,

1861
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:47,700
21, you were right. 13 +8 = 21. Roll for damage.

1862
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:54,700
You also add your... I don't remember if I made it your wisdom instead of your strength.

1863
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,700
But it's whatever is there.

1864
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,700
Five.

1865
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,700
Okay. You still whack this guy. He's like running away.

1866
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:01,700
He's like, "I'm too young to...!"

1867
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:05,700
You like just fucking whack, whack, whack him in the stomach.

1868
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:09,700
Like sort of his air... you know what I mean.

1869
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,700
The wind knocked out of him.

1870
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,700
Yeah, the wind. Everyone has wind in them.

1871
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,700
And this guy falls over and he keeps running away.

1872
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:17,900
And he gets back up.

1873
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,800
And he gets back up.

1874
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,800
And now it is your turn, Botas Piss.

1875
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,600
So the tentacles are no longer whirling around.

1876
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,400
Okay. I'm going to run up to him.

1877
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,300
I'm going to get as much behind him as possible to be away from

1878
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,600
that scary mouth.

1879
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,400
And I'm going to swing my dual pipes.

1880
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,800
Do it.

1881
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,100
Which that is a 13.

1882
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,900
Okay. It's not good.

1883
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:49,940
Ricochets off of the scaly backside. Oh great. That's a 26. That definitely hits. Okay 2d6

1884
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:58,100
That is uh 8 damage nice oops my mirror

1885
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,820
Oops

1886
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,580
You did that on purpose

1887
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,940
It is now

1888
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,940
Imagine if I rolled these for 2d6

1889
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,500
I'd be like i'd be like, uh, that's yellow. Yeah double yellow

1890
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,380
Matt, it's your turn.

1891
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,380
[Laughter]

1892
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,380
I feel like I'm wrenching his mind.

1893
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,380
Um, okay.

1894
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,380
Yeah, I'm gonna probe deeper into his mind.

1895
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:23,380
Okay, do it. Pause.

1896
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:27,380
Oh no, no, no, no, no. He's sorry. He has to roll an additional wisdom save.

1897
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:29,380
Oh, well I gotta...

1898
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,380
If I did that with my wisdom,

1899
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,380
um, well,

1900
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,380
then I would've gotten a 19.

1901
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,380
It is, but I wrote the rule.

1902
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,380
Yeah.

1903
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:44,380
He does, he is able to say "fuck" so he's able to cast you out of his mind.

1904
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:49,380
Sort of like "Urgh, urgh, urgh" and he sends you out in the last year's place counting.

1905
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,380
As you leave his mind.

1906
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:56,380
Yeah he made like some pussy eating sounds or something so I gotta kill him.

1907
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:00,380
Um, so I'm gonna use my uh, my lightning.

1908
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:03,380
That was your action.

1909
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:05,380
That was my action? I can't attack?

1910
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:07,380
Shit, okay.

1911
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,420
Um, someone else use my lightning.

1912
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:14,740
Okay, it is now, uh, now it is now the robot's turn.

1913
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,740
Oh, bastard. Fuck you, robot.

1914
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,740
And, and...

1915
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:24,420
While you make this move, remember that he does have a little wrench thing in his arm.

1916
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:28,020
He's gonna use his jet-propelled legs to move a little bit more forward.

1917
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,900
And he's gonna whip out a Gatling gun.

1918
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:36,020
And launch it at the bad guy.

1919
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:38,020
Launch the gun?

1920
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,020
No, he's going to launch bullets at me.

1921
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,020
And that does not hit.

1922
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:45,020
This guy is one of the worst robots of all time.

1923
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:47,020
He's going to try again.

1924
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,020
And he's a really bad robot.

1925
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:53,020
Yeah, you can do whatever you want to him.

1926
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:55,020
He missed again?

1927
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,020
Yeah, he did.

1928
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:58,020
Now it's my turn again?

1929
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,020
It's your turn, but we wouldn't have time.

1930
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:05,020
I think that it makes perfect sense for me to use my Matrix Beam again.

1931
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:23,020
I

1932
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:28,020
You're also welcome to upcast that if you want to do more damage.

1933
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,020
No.

1934
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:34,020
Um, that is a 16.

1935
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:39,020
Okay, he's also going to have to, well, your matrix stupor, right, so he's going to have to roll against that.

1936
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,020
Yeah.

1937
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,020
It's wisdom, right?

1938
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:44,020
It is a, yeah, a wisdom save, right?

1939
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:48,020
On a failed save, the creature is put into a matrix daze.

1940
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:50,020
I'll explain that tomorrow.

1941
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,020
So what, uh, what's his wisdom?

1942
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:54,020
And what's your save?

1943
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:56,020
What?

1944
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:59,020
It's right next to your spell cast modifier on the first sheet.

1945
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:01,020
It was a wisdom save. I think it's 17.

1946
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:03,020
Your spell's DC.

1947
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:05,020
Hmm.

1948
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,020
That does sound pretty interesting.

1949
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:09,020
It looks like 17.

1950
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,020
You see where it says death save?

1951
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,020
Yeah, 17.

1952
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,020
He just did...

1953
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,020
Nice.

1954
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:19,020
So he is in a stupor.

1955
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,020
Yep, so he is now paralyzed.

1956
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:23,020
So he's incapacitated and has a speed of zero.

1957
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,020
So he's sort of like, "Urgh."

1958
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:29,020
And he's seeing just sort of like waves of code wash over his vision.

1959
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:32,020
He doesn't know where he is or what's going on.

1960
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:36,020
So he is now incapacitated and he's got an attack of advantage on him.

1961
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,020
Yup.

1962
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,020
So, which should help you.

1963
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:43,020
So let's go to your turn. That was a very good strategy.

1964
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:44,020
That's my turn?

1965
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,020
Yeah.

1966
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,020
Oh no, I'm sorry. You're right. It's the monster's turn.

1967
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,020
He is still--

1968
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,020
Okay.

1969
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:57,020
to

1970
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:21,540
and

1971
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,740
I'm just going to believe you. You're God.

1972
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:25,540
You're right. I should.

1973
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:28,240
You just gave him too much.

1974
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:33,140
That is 13. No. Yes. 13.

1975
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,640
Okay. Now I'm going to attack again.

1976
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,640
Okay. That was 16.

1977
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:42,940
Okay. Cool.

1978
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,640
Can I try to probe again?

1979
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,240
How much damage did you do by the way?

1980
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,340
Whatever I said. 13.

1981
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:48,440
13, right? Sorry.

1982
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,940
He's looking bloody.

1983
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:53,440
That means half, guys.

1984
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,440
I think you shouldn't probe anymore, Patrick.

1985
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,440
I think you should finally do some damn damage.

1986
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,440
I use my lightning.

1987
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,440
You're farting around.

1988
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:05,440
Okay, what is your lightning? It's a spell attack, correct?

1989
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,440
Why don't you describe it to me?

1990
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,440
You also have the ability to go into --

1991
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:11,440
It's a spell attack. I can shoot lightning out of my hands

1992
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:16,440
at a single target dealing 4d8 damage for every two tablespoons.

1993
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,440
I don't know why.

1994
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,440
Teaspoons.

1995
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,440
Oh, Techno Slime Points.

1996
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,440
Yeah, for two Techno Slime Points,

1997
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,440
my lightning can reach one additional target

1998
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,440
for the same damage for every six seconds I use.

1999
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,440
To charge the attack,

2000
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,440
I can reach ten more feet,

2001
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,440
but I think I'm just going to use...

2002
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,440
You can just use it, you can upcast it if you want.

2003
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,440
Yeah, because I have an extra attack every time I do...

2004
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,440
I can also do an additional.

2005
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,440
You also have the bonus action with that.

2006
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,440
But that you only get if you go into...

2007
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,440
What are my other attacks here?

2008
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,440
Because I don't have the...

2009
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,440
I used to have the hoagie attacks and stuff.

2010
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,440
You have the hoagie attacks still, you have the hoverboard attack.

2011
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,440
You have a battle meditation mode.

2012
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:03,440
Oh, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to use the hoverboard boomerang.

2013
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:07,440
And then while it's going, I'm going to shoot my lightning at it.

2014
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,440
So it's an electric boomerang.

2015
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,440
I'll allow it.

2016
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,440
(laughter)

2017
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,440
Let's do it like this.

2018
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,440
There's no way I haven't done that already.

2019
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,440
You haven't.

2020
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,440
Okay.

2021
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:21,440
But, I'll allow it.

2022
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:28,440
So what you should do, roll a regular attack, roll with the hoverboard, so add your attack to that, whatever that is, and see if that succeeds first.

2023
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:34,440
Oh, so that's plus eight?

2024
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:39,440
No, no, no, no, no. So look at your sheet on the top left, is where all of your sort of go-to attacks are.

2025
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2026
01:37:40,440 --> 01:38:00,160
a

2027
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:07,160
the

2028
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:14,160
I'm going to re-roll because that might have switched.

2029
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:17,360
Wait, what the fuck does that mean?

2030
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,420
I thought it said 8.

2031
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:20,420
I thought it said 8.

2032
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,420
It might have switched.

2033
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:28,320
I lifted this up and I don't remember if it said 8 or 16.

2034
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,280
But I got a crit one just then.

2035
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,600
So maybe I should have lied.

2036
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,560
Yes, I'm always welcome for you to lie to me.

2037
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,560
Okay, yeah, it misses.

2038
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,000
That was a valiant effort, you're doing better reading minds.

2039
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,200
It is your turn now, Mech...

2040
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,200
Britmechabrit.

2041
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:48,920
Mechbrit is going to open his chest open.

2042
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,600
Open his chest open.

2043
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,440
No way he will.

2044
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,880
He's doing it.

2045
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:59,960
And a chest rocket is flying from his chest.

2046
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:00,960
That's right.

2047
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:05,480
And this monster's gonna have to roll a dexterity saving throw to avoid this freaking blast.

2048
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,280
saving blow yo yo yo and he misses

2049
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,360
Oh hold on cowboy

2050
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:19,360
he does take quite a bit of damage though as this guy finally does his job

2051
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:25,680
oh my god he's getting fucking owned

2052
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:28,880
okay he takes 15 damage

2053
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,400
I'll tell you that

2054
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,400
And the monster

2055
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:41,640
Initiating boots and cats

2056
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:44,680
Damn, he's a hip-hop robot

2057
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,440
Yo, yo, yo

2058
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:52,440
Motherfucker, he's a he's a British. He's a British hip-hop robots right that fucker. He's doing drill. Yeah

2059
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:56,400
But some a cat I'm meme up. Oh, you're up

2060
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,480
well, man

2061
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:07,120
I think that I will use my awesome...

2062
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:14,760
I think I will use my matrix.

2063
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,760
You could also...

2064
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,760
I'll use my dong blade I guess.

2065
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,760
Yeah.

2066
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,760
Yeah, I'll use my dong blade.

2067
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:19,760
Use your dong blade.

2068
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:20,760
Run up to him.

2069
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,200
Well actually I don't think he'll make it if you run up to him.

2070
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,760
Alright, I'll use my sexual grenade again.

2071
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,760
Use that.

2072
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,760
Blow him up.

2073
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:26,760
Uh, okay.

2074
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,760
That is an eleven-eyed fry.

2075
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:31,760
Nope, it's not gonna happen.

2076
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,760
Okay.

2077
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,760
Alright, we'll lower your-

2078
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,760
Moving on, moving on.

2079
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,760
Yep.

2080
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,760
Alright, the monster's turn.

2081
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,760
Sorry for even trying, guys.

2082
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,760
The monster's gonna turn to face you.

2083
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,760
That's okay, I don't mind that you tried.

2084
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,760
We gotta kill this guy, dude. We're taking too long.

2085
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:42,760
Yep.

2086
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,760
This is what happens in Dungeon & Dragons.

2087
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,760
He's going to attack you.

2088
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,760
He's gonna try to eat you.

2089
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,760
He's not gonna do shit.

2090
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,760
'Cause I'm super-powered.

2091
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,760
That hits you.

2092
01:40:54,760 --> 01:41:01,760
I'm Superman. I'm Superman. I am Superman. I'm Superman. I am Superman. Oh yeah.

2093
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:11,760
Does 25 damage to you. Oh my fucking god. What the heck?

2094
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,760
He chews you up and as you feel his teeth pierce your hoo flesh.

2095
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,760
Hoo's flesh?

2096
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,560
It feels like a hot, hot knife going in.

2097
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:25,500
And when the acid seeps into your body,

2098
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:30,940
it feels like it's sort of just burning the veins inside of you.

2099
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:35,140
I feel like you might even be continuing to burn for some

2100
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,140
turns after this as well.

2101
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:37,940
Oh, no.

2102
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:38,780
All right.

2103
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:39,880
Bad to the stomach.

2104
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,780
And you actually are going to start burning right now because

2105
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:43,320
it is your turn.

2106
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,120
Oh, actually, I'm sorry.

2107
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:45,720
He has to attack.

2108
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,720
Oh, I maybe will.

2109
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,720
What's your AC?

2110
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,720
16.

2111
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,720
If that hits me, I'm going to wait up.

2112
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,720
No.

2113
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:01,720
21 damage.

2114
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:03,720
Oh my god, fuck me man.

2115
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,720
You're making the first fucking guy so hard.

2116
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,720
I did stay, I went behind him.

2117
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,720
He wants to die so bad.

2118
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,720
Why does he say stay away from his mouth then?

2119
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,720
Oh, wow.

2120
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,720
Let's just stay away from him in general.

2121
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,720
He looks like he's going to try to eat you soon.

2122
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:19,720
Ah, shit.

2123
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,720
It is now your turn.

2124
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,720
If there's any time for this to happen, it's the first episode.

2125
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,720
Alright, well,

2126
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,720
I'm going to...

2127
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,720
You can also heal with your

2128
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:31,720
fourth skin. I can heal...

2129
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,720
him with your fourth skin. I will do that.

2130
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,720
Okay, so you cast your fourth

2131
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,720
skin, coming from your

2132
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,720
uncircumcised penis.

2133
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,720
Roll, I believe it's 1d10

2134
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,600
10 plus 4 to heal?

2135
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,600
We need something on this to simulate Patrick's uncircumcised penis.

2136
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:48,600
What could we use?

2137
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,800
What could we put on the table right now?

2138
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:55,040
To simulate an uncircumcised penis.

2139
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,680
I mean yeah, you can do whatever you want.

2140
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,600
If you honestly wanted to show your penis, I wouldn't care.

2141
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,600
WAKAAA!

2142
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,440
Yeah, he heals you, you're up.

2143
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,440
I'm up?

2144
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,320
Yeah, remember to get rid of your Technoslime points for that too.

2145
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,320
How much did I get healed by?

2146
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,320
How many Technoslimes?

2147
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,320
Roll the d10.

2148
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:10,320
You're gonna be up either way.

2149
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:11,320
Roll the d10.

2150
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:13,320
Did you roll it?

2151
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,320
I did but I don't remember.

2152
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:16,320
Ok.

2153
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,320
Is that a d10?

2154
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:18,320
I did say.

2155
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,320
It's a 10.

2156
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,320
Ok, is that a d10?

2157
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,320
I can't see what it is.

2158
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,320
It is.

2159
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,320
Ok, it is?

2160
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:24,320
No, I don't know what that is.

2161
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,320
Yeah, that is a d10.

2162
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,320
That's correct.

2163
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,320
You got a 10 on that?

2164
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,320
Nice.

2165
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,320
10 plus 4, 14.

2166
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,320
You're back at 14 health.

2167
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,320
You'll have to use a strength check to break through the foreskin that has draped over

2168
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:34,320
you.

2169
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,320
That's fine.

2170
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,320
But you are healing from its nature.

2171
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,320
And that doesn't count as an attack.

2172
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:42,320
No, but it doesn't count as your actions. We're back to the top of the yield.

2173
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,320
We're back to the mech.

2174
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,320
So...

2175
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:50,320
The mech is going to try to shoot its rocket once again.

2176
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,320
Wow. And this guy does avoid an unfortunate...

2177
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,320
God damn this fucking monster, man.

2178
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,320
You are up.

2179
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,320
I gotta piss. Julio has to leave.

2180
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,320
I know.

2181
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,320
Come on. Alright, here's what we're doing.

2182
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,320
Wait, doesn't he get two tries?

2183
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,320
He does get two tries.

2184
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,320
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Fast, fast, fast.

2185
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:08,320
You bastard. You cool-ass bastard. Stop looking so damn cool.

2186
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,320
damn cool. He missed again?

2187
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,320
Oh yeah!

2188
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,320
And what does he do?

2189
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,320
And it lands like this though?

2190
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
Oh hell.

2191
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,320
Describe your kill.

2192
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,320
I shot my rocket at him and uh

2193
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,320
blew him up.

2194
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,320
Okay, this guy is dead.

2195
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,320
Wow!

2196
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,320
Why did he want to die?

2197
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
Probably because he was suffering.

2198
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,320
If you were that ugly,

2199
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,040
I mean, let's be real.

2200
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,240
You are.

2201
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,200
Don't you want to die?

2202
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,440
All right, you guys did it.

2203
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,680
Hooray!

2204
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,880
Oh my god, another monster.

2205
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,000
(imitates monster growling)

2206
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,260
(laughing)

2207
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:52,160
All right.

2208
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,380
It's time to read.

2209
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:59,620
The corpse of the beast lies at your feet.

2210
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:02,960
High-handedly defeated by,

2211
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,000
why don't I just read normal?

2212
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Let me try one more time.

2213
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
The corpse of the beast lies at your feet.

2214
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,500
You sound like Report of the Week.

2215
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,500
Handedly defeated by you three,

2216
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,500
in the litany of gods who fought alongside you.

2217
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:18,000
As leprechauns arrive to the scene to clean up the mess,

2218
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,500
you feel a chill in the air.

2219
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,000
The heat is out again. Flicker. Blackness.

2220
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,500
You hear the stutters and starts of a knowing panic,

2221
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,500
the guards marching urgently.

2222
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:31,500
Nothing is turning on, but there's serenity in the blackness.

2223
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,500
There's an honest peace on Pleasure Palace.

2224
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:38,500
Because when no light shines, you can actually see the stars above through those windows.

2225
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,500
The whole allure of this station is to be among these things.

2226
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:45,500
Now you can make them out the way you can't anywhere else.

2227
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:49,500
But the stars are no sun, they offer no clarity or warning.

2228
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,500
Just a humiliating cold regard.

2229
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,500
Flicker, pop, the lights come back on.

2230
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,500
A shriek from the mess hall.

2231
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,500
You rush over.

2232
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:05,580
Playtime had never killed the royal guard before, but before you lies two.

2233
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:10,580
Dead.

2234
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:12,580
And they got strangled to death.

2235
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:22,260
