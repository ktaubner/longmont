00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They're supposed to call soon. I'm pretty excited. I don't know. I'm not sure if I got it. Oh my god. This is it. Okay, hold on one second.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hello?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, am I speaking to Mr. Cameron Fetter?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hi Mr. Fender, I'm just calling to let you know that we've accepted your application to be a volunteer usher at the Women's Choir.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh my god! I can't believe it!

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you there sir?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, yes, uh, you can count on me, okay? I'm gonna be a great usher, I've wanted this my whole life.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay sir, do you have the address?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes I do.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Great, we'll see you on Sunday at 3.15.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you so much!

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh my god, I'm going to be an usher

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:02,760
I've always wanted to be an usher. So over the years I've practiced a lot. Sir, your seat is right this way.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,240
Welcome into the show. Here's a program. Your seat is right this way

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,720
Sir, this is a counterfeit ticket. You need to leave get out immediately out

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,880
You might not expect it from looking at me. But yeah, I clean up good

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,880
Now baby, that's right

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
We got nothing but time

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,880
You get all the reactions

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,880
You're the main attraction

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,880
It's no surprise

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Gotta like your style

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,880
You're the perfect distraction

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,880
The main attraction

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,460
(upbeat music)

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:21,440
And barely even 24 hours after my massive success

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,020
as an usher at the choir,

31
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,560
I actually landed the gig

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,940
that every amateur usher dreams of.

33
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,840
That's right, I went big time

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,180
and I now work full time as an usher at McDonald's.

35
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,400
- How much time do you think you can sit

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,560
wherever you like today?

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,600
How much time do you think you can sit

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
wherever you like?

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
I think so.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,440
You can sit anywhere you like. There's no assigned seats today.

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440
You won't see a seat number on your ticket.

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
You see...

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Go on in.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,440
If you have a ticket, you can go straight in.

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,440
I'm a celebrity, and even I know I should help the community.

[Music]

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,940
Okay.

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,440
Oh my god.

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Leave that in. You have to leave that in.

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Do it again.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,760
My god dude.

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Can you believe that?

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,620
That was unreal bro.

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,620
You are the worst.

55
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,620
No I'm not.

56
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,120
You fucking suck at everything.

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,960
That was insane.

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,880
If you weren't doing this what do you think you'd be doing for a job?

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
The restaurant.

60
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,240
Probably still work at a restaurant.

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,760
Were you good at working at a restaurant or were you terrible?

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I was alright.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
I worked front of house.

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
You were like a hostess?

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Yep.

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
He was a hostess.

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
He had on a skirt.

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
All black.

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
I wore like a black like polo shirt.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,880
- It's so funny that they just picked the hottest waiter

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,040
and to say you're the hostess now.

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,120
That is really funny.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,960
And you walk in and you're like, yeah.

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,320
- Thank you for saying that about me.

75
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,200
- No, not you. - The hottest waitress.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
- You were at a reverse restaurant.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,720
- I was not at a reverse restaurant.

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,880
- Yeah, you were at a reverse restaurant.

79
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,720
- You were not at a regular restaurant.

80
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,840
- The only backwards thing about the reverse-a-rant

81
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,440
is that the ugliest waitress is the hostess

82
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,480
and everything else is the same as a normal restaurant.

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,920
- The food's normal.

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,720
They don't walk backwards or anything.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
- Yeah.

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,600
If you want a restaurant where they walk backwards,

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
you need to go to Backwardsies.

88
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
- Mm.

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,240
- Have you guys ever been to Dick's Last Resort?

90
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
- No, I'm too scared.

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,280
- I really am scared.

92
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,720
- Actually, no, I haven't gone.

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,560
- I feel like I would go.

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,720
- I've been in the vicinity of one.

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,640
- I feel like I would go.

96
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,880
- Even when you're in the vicinity,

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,720
you feel like the evil tendrils spreading out.

98
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,680
- There's a dark evil presence.

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,200
- It's like the Lord of the, it's like Mordor.

100
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,520
There's like a fucked up, you can see people leaving it

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,800
and you're like, oh, this is this evil space.

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,640
- Purple things like veins or trunks just like come--

103
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,560
- Yeah, exactly.

104
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,920
- Just roots through the ground.

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
- Yeah, it's like in a movie when someone gets bitten

106
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
by a zombie or something, there's like black veins

107
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,480
going up their arm, it spreads out into the rest of the area.

108
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,480
- I remember we were planning on going there just to cry.

109
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,320
I remember like, I think me and Neil were like,

110
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,960
we should go there and just like when they start

111
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,360
doing the thing, just be like,

112
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
can't you fucking see that I've already

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,040
had a hard fucking day?

114
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,280
- It's scary, it's scary to go there, yes.

115
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,160
it's gotta be even scarier to work there as a waiter.

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
- Oh, for sure.

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
- Especially these days with cancel culture.

118
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,560
- Oh my God.

119
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
- Getting canceled at Dicks.

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,120
- No, I do feel like,

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,600
how, what do you think the percentage is

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,480
on people who go in and they just don't,

123
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,840
they're completely blindsided?

124
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,120
How many people do you think go in there

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,040
and are like, have truly no idea,

126
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,800
and even are maybe oblivious enough

127
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,560
that they don't see it happening at other tables

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,960
where they're waiting for their, to order?

129
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,880
- There is a new one.

130
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,880
There's a dicks that's all women in the UK called Karen's.

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,640
- No way. - Yeah.

132
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,160
- Dude, we have to go. - I just remember that.

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,800
- Oh my God. - What do they do?

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
- What do you think they do?

135
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,160
- They probably ask to talk to the manager.

136
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,480
- Yeah. - They ask the customer.

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
- Dude, oh my God.

138
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
- I don't know. (laughing)

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
- It's like, can I have a hamburger?

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,080
And they're like, can I speak to your manager?

141
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,040
I'm like, I don't have a manager.

142
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
- The worst thing in the world.

143
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
- You're just gonna ask, he doesn't work here.

144
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,360
- Wait, wait, wait, you want me to call Staples

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
and talk to the manager?

146
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,480
Yeah, I guess you can do that.

147
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
- The worst thing in the world,

148
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,320
The Karen is the manager.

149
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,680
No fucking way.

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Nightmare scenario, bro.

152
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,960
It's like when, uh, it's like those like, what if Marvel comics?

153
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,600
Exactly.

154
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:32,840
Yeah.

155
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,520
It's like, what if

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,840
dude, that's Darth Jar Jar Binks.

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,440
The manager is a Karen.

158
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,480
What if the manager was a Karen?

159
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,480
It's like an a hundred page comic of just the, yeah.

160
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,280
And all those comics, it's always like, it's the, the question is always,

161
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,600
It's always like what, yeah, the question is always,

162
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,360
what if this character was evil

163
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
and the whole comic's just him,

164
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
that character killing every other character?

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
- Yeah. - What?

166
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,040
- It's always the same. - This is a Marvel they do?

167
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,560
- Yeah, they always do a What If.

168
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,040
- What if, well, sometimes also it's like,

169
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,640
what if this person was a girl?

170
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,520
- What if Wakanda was all whites?

171
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,600
(laughing)

172
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
- Have they done that one?

173
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,280
- No.

174
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,200
- They've done an all white Wakanda?

175
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
Whites.

176
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,280
(laughing)

177
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
What if it was whites?

178
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,320
- I think they did, they did make--

179
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,440
- That means that Patrick would say,

180
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,200
Patrick's like, Wakanda's all blacks now.

181
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,200
(laughing)

182
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
- Yeah, Wakanda changed from when I grew up there.

183
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,760
When I grew up, it was all Italians.

184
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,300
It was all Italians and Irish.

185
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,140
And yeah.

186
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,960
- It's gonna change over there.

187
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,400
Hey, I'm not saying it's good.

188
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,020
- I think there is like a,

189
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,740
somebody made it, it's like pretty recent,

190
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,740
but they made like a Rhodesia equivalent to like Wakanda.

191
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,160
I don't remember what the name is,

192
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,760
but it's like, it's so insane to just be like,

193
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,760
like a fictional Rhodesia that like borders Wakanda

194
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,240
or something.

195
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
- Yeah, one of the funniest parts of Marvel to me

196
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,120
is that like they have this,

197
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
their whole thing is like, okay, it's superheroes

198
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,260
and we have outer space too,

199
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,120
and we have magic and wizards.

200
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,840
And also we're gonna make up a few countries

201
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,600
that are interesting.

202
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
- Yeah, like Moldova?

203
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,280
- Yeah, Doctor, yeah, exactly.

204
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,580
(laughing)

205
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,820
Doctor Doom comes from a made up country too.

206
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,660
And he's just like,

207
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,480
- Where does he come from?

208
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,740
- I don't know, I don't remember the name of it.

209
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,100
- Oh, it starts with an S, Sokovia.

210
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,940
- Is it Sokovia?

211
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,780
- I think so.

212
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,700
- But yeah, anyway, they're just like,

213
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,140
we're just gonna come up with a few countries

214
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,540
that have, sound like they could be in these areas.

215
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
- Latveria.

216
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,660
- Latveria, yeah, exactly.

217
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,700
- I think Sokovia is a real place.

218
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,180
- Sokovia is a Marvel thing too.

219
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,020
- Yeah.

220
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,380
- But yeah, it is just like, we're just,

221
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,400
basically it's like, so we have superheroes.

222
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,220
So I guess what the next thing we have to come up with is,

223
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,540
where are the countries where superheroes are kings there?

224
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
Yeah, why do they come up with different?

225
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
Why does DC come up with different cities too?

226
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
Like why do they have Gotham and Metropolis?

227
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,540
That's true.

228
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
You know what's so funny about...

229
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
No, no, Metropolis is supposed to be like Maryland.

230
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
It's supposed to be in Maryland.

231
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,540
Man, shut your bitch ass up.

232
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
It's not even in Chicago.

233
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,540
It's like, who the fuck is like thinking like...

234
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Yeah, and it's like, you have guys like Superman

235
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,540
and it's like, why not just have like Bill Gates?

236
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Yeah.

237
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Yeah.

238
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,960
And he's powerful yeah, you have him in there. Yeah, he's called Lex Luthor

239
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:27,180
I would say it's not a great close up on your middle finger that we just got right there. Oh, you could maybe move it

240
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Yeah, that's not

241
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,900
We're not fucking curing

242
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,460
Bill gave I'm doing that bill water if Bill Gates got a superpower

243
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,460
Maybe he could do something with doors or gates or something like lock doors, but dude he would

244
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,940
You know you know he doesn't need a superpower for that. He's already doing stuff with dorks all day

245
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,860
Yeah, you know I would those lines that say post no bills uh-huh he could post bills

246
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,580
Damn, it could be his superpower. Oh good bill bills

247
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,540
On gates on gates

248
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,980
Bill Gates Bill Gates

He's on and he's on fire, and he's rides it

253
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,700
You know the only reason why I'm pushing back against this is human torch was the implication of what my or no

254
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,300
What's who's done who there's Johnny Blaze is human torch. No. He's Johnny storm Johnny storm

255
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,460
See that don't make no fucking sense that doesn't make any sense

256
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,980
The only reason I'm pushing back on this is the implication of what my superpower would be I think yeah, you can make pits

257
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
- No. - You can make holes in the ground.

258
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
- No, moving on to the next topic of the day.

259
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
- What? No. - Yeah, okay, well, yeah,

260
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
my superpower would be a fuckin' thing.

261
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
- You would be the same as Bill Gates.

262
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
You'd also have a door power. - Yeah.

263
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
- A door and-- - I could open any door.

264
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
- Door and another power. - You could stink like a durian.

265
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,980
- You could stink like a-- - I get another power?

266
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
- Dude, you could be spiky. - And that's my power, yeah.

267
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
- Dude, the durian would be such a good super--

268
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
super spiky and super stinky. - Smells like shit.

269
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
If you kill him, he smells like shit.

270
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
- You could squirt stink pods around the--

271
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,060
stink pot. We should start a superhero universe. I was thinking about getting a

272
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,620
durian for an episode, bringing a durian, we all eat one, but they're like $95 to

273
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,540
get one. And also they smell fucking shitty and there's no windows in here.

274
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,500
Ice cream bean. Well, once we get Bill Gates. Once we get Bill Gates in here. That's true dude, he'd create

275
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,740
windows. He could create a window or a gate. Window man. What was yours be?

276
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,060
Fetter. You can get fatter. Oh Cameron Fatter. You can get fatter like the blob. How have we never

277
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,500
talked about that? Oh we've talked about that because I told you what the meaning

278
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:51,980
of my name. My last name. I thought it was Peters. Fetter, well Fetter, the etymology

279
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,980
of fetter means fat man. Oh yeah fat criminal right? It's like is there fat

280
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,620
man or thief or something. Last night I was talking to me and Noah were talking

281
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,720
about a friend of ours my buddy AJ and he his middle name the way he got his

282
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,220
middle name is that is while his mom was giving birth I just heard this story

283
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,300
last night for the first time well his mom was giving birth he she passed out

284
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,980
from like the epidural or the pain or some shit she passed out and her the his

285
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,140
His dad, her husband, just filled out the birth certificate while she was passed out.

286
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,740
They had agreed on this whole name that was her grandfather's name for his first name,

287
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,860
and then his middle name was going to be her brother's name.

288
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,300
No, listen.

289
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
The dad's name was Arthur.

290
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,940
While she's passed out, he names him Arthur, first name Arthur, not what they agreed on.

291
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,080
He gives him his own first name.

292
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,680
wakes up and she looks at the birth certificate she's like wait okay so you

293
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,800
named him Arthur what is his middle name why is it just the letter A?

294
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:15,640
Yeah I couldn't think of anything. So AJ's middle name is just A. It doesn't mean anything.

295
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,560
I do know I knew somebody in high school who she told me her like legal name was

296
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:30,560
P like dot. P diddy. P dot. Like period. What? Yeah. P dot? P dot. That's cool. Yeah that's

297
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,280
like a. I be having a P dot when I walk out of the bathroom. Yeah. I don't shake. We were

298
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,660
just talking about how that's like. Me and Noah were talking about how that's gotta be

299
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,160
like a huge red flag at a bar he's at if he hands them their ID. Oh yeah. He just says

300
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,320
A. A. I keep talking about your middle names A. Have you seen those videos of like bouncers

301
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
just snapping people's real IDs in the app because they don't know what they are.

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
Dude, I always think that that's going to happen because my ID is so shitty.

303
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,760
Yeah.

304
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,520
I always have that feeling when I'm like somewhere where I have to fly back home.

305
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,760
Yeah.

306
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,320
I'm like, "Fuck, you're going to fuck me in the ass."

307
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,560
That almost happened to me at the bodega where the guy, he asked for my ID when I was buying

308
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,920
beer and I gave him my ID and he pointed to Massachusetts on it. He was like, "Where is

309
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,240
this from?" I was like, "Massachusetts." He was like, "Where is it from?" I was like,

310
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,920
"Massachusetts. What do you mean?"

311
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
You got ID at a bodega?

312
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,300
Yeah, it's and it's it's a crazy L because it's the one next to my house that I go to

313
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,500
So I think he got in trouble or something at some point, but I bought beer there so many times

314
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I would just show a bouncer this

315
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,340
That's what I've literally had to do that before if they don't believe my idea. I'm gonna take my hat off and go I'm

316
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:39,100
Dude it is it is humbling getting like

317
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,220
Carded when you look like this you look like this

318
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,900
It's like oh, well not humbling, but like you know it's

319
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,460
I guess it makes it makes you it's young going no it just makes it makes you young

320
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,420
yeah I guess it makes me feel a little better getting carded cuz I'm just like

321
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,660
oh thank God thank God somebody doesn't think I'm 35 I don't think you're 30 I

322
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,500
don't think so when people find out that I am 25 they're like oh yeah you're just

323
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,540
like a very ugly 25 yeah yeah you're ugly like an old guy mm-hmm but you're

324
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,780
actually yeah people usually I'm usually think I'm 12 to 30 telling people I'm 30

325
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,780
Why? Because then they'll think I look good. People think I'm either 40 or 1 years old usually.

326
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,780
Yeah. Yeah, it's because you're wearing that diaper and that bonnet. And in the crib. It's New Year's.

327
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,780
It's true. Somebody's got to do it. You're going to have to do it for New Year's this year.

328
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,780
Are you going to do it? Yeah, I'm going to do it. I just noticed on the fucking, on that, just how stretched out the picture.

329
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Dude, I love these mugs. I just noticed there's a picture of a cup on the cup.

330
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,180
The mugs are my favorite mugs.

331
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,620
This mug has a picture of an actual mug of coffee.

332
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,300
Like a full mug of coffee.

333
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,780
And they misspelled mocha.

334
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,500
They misspelled mocha and it says short black.

335
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,420
It says mocha multiple times.

336
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
One of them just says coffee.

337
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
It's fine dude.

338
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
It's the best.

339
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
It's Colombian.

340
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,980
Everything should have that kind of all over print on it.

341
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Definitely.

342
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
So you know what it is always.

343
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,780
Yeah, I just love this because it's like you know you should get this for the coffee fan in your

344
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,560
Yeah

345
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah, coffee

346
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,060
Well, yeah

347
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,340
This is a good coffee cup because you can put any kind of coffee in there someone's like because if this just said

348
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,240
Espresso on it right you can't be drinking a lot. You're gonna look like a fucking asshole

349
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,000
No, I like an idiot. I like that like they put the word espresso

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,860
in brown over the brown beans

351
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,700
- Beans.

352
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,540
(laughing)

353
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,360
- No, they designed it very well.

354
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,200
- You can't even fucking see it.

355
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,180
- I think most things should also have

356
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,980
the base ingredients on it.

357
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,460
Like this has the beans on it.

358
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,300
- Yeah.

359
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
- Right?

360
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,940
You know, if I get a sandwich from the store,

361
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,500
I want it to have a picture of a loaf of bread on it.

362
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,340
- Yeah.

363
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,500
- What are you doing?

364
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,180
- Sorry, Noah texted me.

365
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,940
I thought there was something about,

366
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,900
something crazy going on.

367
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,700
- I flipped his phone over.

368
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,100
- Damn, that was, stop!

369
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,060
- I have the thing queued up for later.

370
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,700
- Oh, the thing for later.

371
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,700
I did just read Noah's text really bad.

372
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
He's died.

373
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Noah, his weak-ass plate guy, as you guys know him, he has passed away.

374
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Noah has passed away.

375
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Thank God, dude.

376
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Apparently it was from malnutrition.

377
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
I was just about to say that.

378
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
He just died of malnourishment.

379
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Thank God he's dead.

380
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Never have to see that damn plate again, dude.

381
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,540
I have to see another week as play and Christmas is coming up the holidays ain't over. He's

382
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,680
still got another Christmas play and if he's gonna take a picture and Christmas he's gonna

383
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,860
try and he's gonna fail. He's gonna pull up at Christmas. He's gonna win one piece of

384
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:51,100
penny and a fucking one leaf of a Christmas tree cookie. And then all of a sudden you

385
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,900
know he gets to be eating the berries off the mistletoe. This is the hardest time of

386
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,140
the year for him because then you got you got a couple of months break but then it's

387
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,260
Easter. Yeah. And even I bet this

388
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,220
the girls that have brought thought he did something with

389
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,140
his Easter basket.

390
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,620
His Easter basket is going to be weak. Oh my

391
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,340
God. I got a single Reese's piece. I am with

392
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,780
a Valentine's heart with one chocolate. Oh Starburst jelly

393
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,340
bean and not a flavor you like. No no no.

394
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,580
You imagine what he was starburst flavor that everyone like

395
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,820
pink. Pink is the one everyone. Oh no the one

396
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,700
everyone hates. Oh red. Yeah. Really. Or yellow. Yeah. I

397
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,480
Yellow is probably the more red is clover red is basically pink. No pink is the good one

398
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
I know it's the good one, but I feel like they're

399
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,540
They're not those can't be the best and worst red and pink pink and red you could probably

400
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,620
Make it look like a pussy if you put them all together or a pink and red painting

401
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,160
You know what I did one time when I was a difference between our minds

402
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,540
artistic sexual

403
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:58,080
Art you know what I did one time as a kid you can do Mario. I took the blue. I took not the blue the

404
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,820
You took the banana blue pillow Nana

405
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,940
Banana laughs he happy and I curled it up, and then I rolled the the pink Laffy Taffy, and I made a Laffy Taffy hot dog

406
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:17,780
Sell that it is a fucking miracle that you're not 600 pounds. Yeah, it is a fucking miracle

407
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,020
I thought that was so cool. You really I was just playing with my food like it was play-doh

408
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,020
God gave you the fattest brain of anyone I know pretty much.

409
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:34,020
The way that you think about candy, you go into predator vision in every store that we go into and start picking up candy.

410
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,020
You go into predator vision when you see a woman on the street.

411
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
No.

412
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,020
At night.

413
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,020
No. At night maybe. I have a night vision.

414
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Similar to the predator, the only way a woman can escape him is to cover herself in mud.

415
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,020
And even that doesn't work sometimes.

416
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,300
I would say even then he gets hungry because he thinks she's covered in poop that would provoke it

417
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
No, the only way to stop me is like

418
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:10,500
There's three three red dots up here

419
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,060
I wouldn't happen. I wouldn't do that. Yeah

420
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,840
Finally watched predator - yeah speaking of

421
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,700
Nothing is as good as predator one predator one

422
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,720
No, I mean none of the predator movies my

423
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,660
Movie Club it's something I'm gonna be starting great Patrick's movie club and this week

424
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,260
We are watching all of the alien movies nice. Mm-hmm and for my movie club

425
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,580
we are watching Finding Nemo again and

426
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,940
Hopefully this time the mom doesn't die mine and mine will be just watching TV and see what's on

427
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,260
Just see what seeing what's on will just go on Pluto TV and see what's on

428
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,440
I was actually watching part of Mad Max before I came over here on Pluto TV you watch part of it

429
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,220
I always I watch five five to ten minutes of random movies. That's good. Yeah, that's a good

430
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,460
I think that's good. That's how we really need to go back to that

431
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,220
It is I know I like it's so much more fun than rewatching a movie

432
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,900
TV not not everyone having TV and watching movies and shit like that

433
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,780
I think it's definitely changed our brain.

434
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,340
There really is no greater joy than turning on Pluto TV and like Johnny Mnemonic or some

435
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
movie.

436
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,020
Some movies on and then you call in your girlfriend you say look this is the part where this happens

437
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,780
and she doesn't care at all.

438
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
That's the bit.

439
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Look he's going into the internet.

440
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,020
Dude it's so fucked up that streaming took over cable.

441
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
I miss cable.

442
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Dude Pluto TV is the wave.

443
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,740
But it's so expensive.

444
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,460
When my wife dies I would honestly.

445
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
No cable.

446
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,380
Pluto TV is a godsend.

447
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,220
I would honestly think when my wife dies that I would like to get her taxidermied so that

448
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,740
I can put her on the couch and explain movies to her forever.

449
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,300
Until I die.

450
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,140
Just sit there and just like, yeah, Fury Road is on.

451
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,420
I'm like, you know they had to delay it a year and a half because grass ruined all streets.

452
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,340
The best part of watching movies with your girlfriend is explaining and telling the behind

453
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,220
the scenes stories and then the second that she asks a question be like, just watch the

454
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
movie.

455
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,220
Yeah.

456
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,340
They're going to explain it, just watch it.

457
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:22,100
some good movies coming out that I can't wait to explain dude fucking every

458
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,180
couple the entire fucking audience is gonna be couples and just guys going

459
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,980
they should have those we think recreated the nuclear explosion those

460
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,260
like audio tours they have in museums yeah or you can get put the head you're

461
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,980
a single woman yeah it was a boyfriend there should be one one single

462
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
boyfriend sitting in the back and he has a little mic.

463
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Yeah.

464
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
And he talks to every woman in the audience.

465
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:48,980
It's all just like, "Now I don't actually remember exactly what happened in real life, but Oppenheimer's actually a crazy guy."

466
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,980
It's actually a badass quote from the Bhagavad Gita.

467
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,980
And Christopher Nolan's other movies are crazy.

468
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Yeah.

469
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
He plays with time.

470
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,980
He loves to play with time.

471
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
He does time stuff.

472
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,980
For example, this episode of movies, the time went backwards into a different time.

473
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Yeah.

474
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,420
There's no way he's not gonna put some damn-ass time stuff in that movie.

475
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,340
For real. Bro, have you seen the previews? It's literally counting down a clock.

476
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,940
Time dilation. He's watching those movies with mind dilation for me.

477
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,500
And I think that it'll be a cry nation. The entire nation will be crying at that movie.

478
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,540
Because they'll be realizing what we did to the beautiful country of Japan.

479
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,140
I somebody why I think I saw a tweet or something about it

480
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:48,580
But just that it's so funny that this that guy fucking hey, I bet you call him tacos Japan and like she

481
00:23:48,580 --> 00:24:00,080
That's the right you're supposed to pronounce it you think that's funny I'll have a sushi roll

482
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,340
(laughing)

483
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,380
- Going to Japan and just pronouncing everything

484
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,220
like you're trying to like--

485
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,040
- It's sushi.

486
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
- Sushi.

487
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,160
- Like you're Peggy Hill walking up.

488
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,220
(laughing)

489
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,660
- There are a lot of Peggy Hills for Japan

490
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,260
in today's day and age.

491
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,180
And they all look exactly like us.

492
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,020
- Not me.

493
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,700
- No.

494
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,520
- Yeah.

495
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,360
- No.

496
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,460
- I'm really sorry to say, but probably you second most.

497
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,100
- I don't know anything about Japan, dude.

498
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,620
I'm the least person who cares about Japan.

499
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
- But there are a lot of guys who live in Japan.

500
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,460
guys who live in Japan who look like you.

501
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
Really?

502
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
I don't know anything about it.

503
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Those are the guys who went there, who like got deployed there, and then they were like,

504
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,860
"I'm a cool, I'm a stay here.

505
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,380
This is actually beast here."

506
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,820
I think a lot of the guys who looked like you actually went over to try and get some

507
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
damn pussy.

508
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
That's fine.

509
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
Just tell them the truth.

510
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
You can get pussy in any country.

511
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,500
I'm not trying to make a joke, I'm just telling the truth.

512
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Alright.

513
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,980
Well, this is a joke show, so stick to the jokes.

514
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,060
Maybe.

515
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,700
You know how all the Oppenheimer posters have like the built-in timers that count down to

516
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
like the movies release?

517
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,900
- I didn't know that.

518
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,740
- Yeah, you can see they have like--

519
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,580
- I just said yeah 'cause I wanted

520
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,820
to move the conversation along, but that's pretty cool.

521
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,660
- I appreciate that.

522
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,580
- Wait, they do?

523
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,300
I also said yeah, I haven't seen that.

524
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,120
- Really?

525
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,660
- They have posters that have ticking time bombs in them?

526
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,180
- You know the big cardboard,

527
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,080
like it's not a poster, but the cardboard stand-ups,

528
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,820
they put in movie theater lobbies?

529
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,700
And they have like, it has like a countdown

530
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,660
to the movie's release, like an actual countdown on it.

531
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,300
And it's so funny to imagine, 'cause anyway,

532
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,780
it's pretty long before it comes out.

533
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,980
Movies like that always get delayed,

534
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,860
so it's very funny to, I really wanna be the guy

535
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,940
to catch them changing the countdown.

536
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,380
(laughing)

537
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,060
Coming in, trying to stay in the theater overnight

538
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,460
and see them switch the timer and be like, I got you!

539
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,540
- I haven't watched the last three movies he made,

540
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,700
but I'm gonna watch that one.

541
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,540
- Yeah, I mean, you've heard--

542
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,580
- Yeah, Tenant, I don't know.

543
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,420
- I didn't watch Tenant either.

544
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,980
- I don't think it's Tenant.

545
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,580
- It's Tenant. - Tenant.

546
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,700
- Yeah. - Tenant.

547
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,540
- Tenant, I'll watch that movie.

548
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,380
- I got a Tenant.

549
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,820
- Tenant is the skate shop down the street.

550
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,900
Thanks Pat.

551
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,740
(yells)

552
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,560
Thank you so much.

553
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,500
And our address is one,

554
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,460
one, one, three,

555
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,860
102 floor.

556
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,700
Can you imagine--

557
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,540
Empire State Building.

558
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,200
Can you imagine if we just gave that address

559
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,040
of the office out?

560
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,780
No, can you imagine being killed by a nuclear bomb?

561
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,620
Yeah, I can imagine that.

562
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,740
Yeah, I imagine that really, really frequently.

563
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,780
Do you think that it would hurt

564
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,100
or just be completely instant?

565
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,920
I think it's instant.

566
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,760
No, it's completely instant.

567
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,580
You think so?

568
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,420
Yeah.

569
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,380
But what if it hurt, what if you survive?

570
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,220
- You don't even get to see the--

571
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,580
- If you're far enough away.

572
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,420
- Yeah.

573
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,140
- Well then there's also the radiation sickness thing

574
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,900
where it's like, oh, if you get enough radiation

575
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,500
but you're not actually hurt,

576
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,260
you feel completely fine for like a week

577
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,120
and then your body falls apart.

578
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,620
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.

579
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,140
- It's called like a walking corpse or something.

580
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,380
There's some phrase for it.

581
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,300
- And if you touch people, they'll get it too.

582
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,140
- Yeah.

583
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,960
- That's so cool.

584
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,780
- I really, really hate the idea of war.

585
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,340
(laughing)

586
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,180
- Is that true?

587
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,300
- I would have to agree with you, unfortunately.

588
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
- Especially nuclear war.

589
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
- Unless I'm fighting in it.

590
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,540
(imitates gunfire)

591
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,580
'Cause I'm 'bout that.

592
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,420
- Damn. - That's what she said.

593
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,220
- I'm 'bout that for every other country.

594
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,060
- If I saw-- - I'm coming for y'all.

595
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,000
- I saw him on the No Limit tank.

596
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,940
- If I saw a nuclear bomb flying through the air,

597
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,420
I would probably shoot it down.

598
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,460
- Yeah. - Yeah.

599
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,420
- I'd probably just pop some shots at it.

600
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,700
- Yeah. - Fire, fire, fire.

601
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,540
Fire, fire, fire.

602
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,380
(imitates gunfire)

603
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,740
- Dude, yeah, I'd have the silencer on,

604
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,260
so it'd be like, psst, psst, psst.

605
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,700
- People wouldn't even notice.

606
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,580
- They wouldn't even care,

607
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,660
but I'd know that I saved New York.

608
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,540
I'm putting the silencer on so that nobody knows that I'm doing it.

609
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
So I'm just kind of like you.

610
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
Because I'm doing it.

611
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
That's the other thing.

612
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,180
I'm only interested in saving New York because that's my home turf.

613
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,020
And other people, they can deal.

614
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,700
If there are other people in other cities who are about that like me, they can do that

615
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
shit.

616
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,780
But I'm not helping you all out.

617
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
For sure.

618
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,700
I'm the savior of New York.

619
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
They're going to call you.

620
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,700
I'd like throw a grenade.

621
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,660
(mimics gunfire)

622
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,860
- You just hear the same noise eight times in a row.

623
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,780
(mimics gunfire)

624
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
- And then I go,

625
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,460
(mimics gunfire)

626
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,300
- Damn.

627
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,140
- Star Wars.

628
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,300
- I do get really scared thinking about a nuclear attack.

629
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,420
- There's no reason to be scared

630
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,460
'cause you live close enough to where they would bomb

631
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,860
that you would not know that it happened.

632
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,700
- Yeah, you just instantly die.

633
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,520
- You would have eight minutes

634
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,220
of the worst fear of your life.

635
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,060
- And then die.

636
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,900
- You'd probably call your mom

637
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,220
and then you would be a white light.

638
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,140
- Yeah. - Yeah.

639
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,500
- And it's probably fun to be light.

640
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,140
- You've already, true.

641
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,860
- I just don't, that's just,

642
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,860
That is gross.

643
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,860
Gross?

644
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,860
Gross as in huge.

645
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Gross in size.

646
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,860
Probably a worldwide conflict.

647
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,860
Wait, are you afraid of death?

648
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,860
Yeah. What's wrong with you?

649
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,860
Nothing.

650
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,860
Probably the most normal.

651
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Me, I don't give a fuck about anything.

652
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
As a huge monster movie fan,

653
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,860
the nuclear war thing is pretty scary, but I would maybe be more

654
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
scared that the nuclear bomb would wake up Godzilla

655
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
and he might step on me.

656
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,980
That might be a lot that area that is really scary. I was scared of the bias media coverage true

657
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,900
It's probably would divide us if there was one nuclear bomb that dropped in America

658
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,940
I would rather be the person whose head it fucking goes into and then live so I don't have to watch

659
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,320
Yeah, obviously different fucking the different angles on dude

660
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,900
Can you imagine what what how how fucking divisive and evil Fox News would be about mutants?

661
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,400
Uh-huh, they probably call them the M word about the what word M. What is the mutant?

662
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
- Oh yeah. - Beauty.

663
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,280
- Yeah.

664
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,600
- Whoa, you said it.

665
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,440
- Whoa.

666
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,260
- What's made up? - You said it,

667
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,100
we didn't even, barely even had to--

668
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,400
- You made it up so that you could say it though.

669
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,240
- Yep.

670
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,920
- Barely even had to push you into it either.

671
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,280
- 'Cause I'm a piece of shit.

672
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,520
(laughing)

673
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,240
- Really?

674
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,060
- Yep.

675
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,900
- I kinda like that.

676
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,920
I kinda like that. - Yeah.

677
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,760
- Yeah, all right, nah, come on.

678
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,600
Hey, all right, come on.

679
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,920
- This goes out to all the fans.

680
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,760
- No, come on, man.

681
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,200
- Of the show, this goes out to all the fans.

682
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,400
- That is not cool. - Please knock that off.

683
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,240
No, we're gonna change every--

684
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,680
every all right okay here we're gonna we're we're we're good

685

And I wake up happy.

716
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,920
If you're buying clothes to impress women,

717
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,800
you're doing it wrong.

718
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,640
If you're going to the gym to impress women,

719
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,000
you're doing it wrong.

720
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Posting music on your Instagram story

721
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,560
to impress a woman, you're doing it wrong.

722
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,000
That's right, it's all for the boys.

723
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,920
It's for the fellas.

724
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
You always--

725
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
And for God.

726
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,080
Working is also, it's not even for most guys.

727
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,760
It's not even for like gay guys that you could fuck.

728
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,600
No.

729
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,420
Because they also don't care.

730
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,260
No, it's for your--

731
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,160
It's only for straight guys to look at you and go--

732
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
That guy is awesome.

733
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,540
You can't even have sex with those guys

734
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,760
that you're impressing.

735
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,160
No, it's just for them to go, oh.

736
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah.

737
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,820
Oh.

738
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,660
Yeah.

739
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,500
Oh, this guy likes a--

740
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,940
It's the same, it's when you're at a museum

741
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,440
and you see a guy, you go like this at a painting.

742
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,080
That's what you want.

743
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,600
There's a buff janitor at my gym, and he's so buff,

744
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm always like man. I want him one day to

745
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:06,840
I'm sitting there jail drinking gel

746
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:14,000
Water yeah, you don't want to fuck with me. I'm sitting there drinking water out of the water fountain bro sitting at the water fountain

747
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,400
I'm at the water fountain. I'm getting water. He walks out of his janitor closet, and he looks at me. He just started laughing

748
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,560
I was like, and I wanted to be like, okay, you're a janitor.

749
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
And you deserve it.

750
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
And you deserve it.

751
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
I don't even know what he's buffing at.

752
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,560
A buff janitor at the gym, do you think that he was...

753
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Oh my god, you came too far away.

754
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Do you think he was like a janitor, he was a janitor by trade and he was like, I really,

755
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
really want to work at a gym.

756
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Maybe.

757
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
Because I like working out.

758
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,560
He also got, you know what I think it was, he clearly just got like a hair transplant

759
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
because it hasn't grown in yet.

760
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,560
So I think he looked at me and he was like, pfft, baldy.

761
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,000
Right or maybe the follicles are in his brain. What am I good friends in high school was the janitor really?

762
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,960

765
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,840
Last name which was a rum janitor rum shot. Oh, yeah, his name was Bruce Janitor

766
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,320
My friend Alex worked he worked at the the school in the summer. He was like a janitor's apprentice

767
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,900
That's a good that was a good like there's a good job. You could get you only work in this summer a couple days

768
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:34,160
Janitor's apprentice imagine what nasty shit they make him the apprentice did yeah the Janitors already sucking turds out of a toilet

769
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,680
They probably make him build the mod that wasn't the official job title

770
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:43,440
That's what I called it. I called him janitor's apprentice all right. Well. Okay. Let's see where Santa is right now

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,720
- It's December 21st.

773
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,560
- Okay, so he's on Earth still, guys.

774
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,520
- Thank God he's on Earth.

775
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,360
- Where is this?

776
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,280
- Where is that?

777
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,040
- I know this, this is the Holy Land.

778
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,280
- Oh my God, he's on, where?

779
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,840

00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,440
- He's on Aege. - He's at Mecca.

781
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,160
- Aege. - Hajji.

782
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,080
- Aege. - Hajji beats.

783
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
- No, it's Aege. - Oh, look at him.

784
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,880
- Wow. - Wow.

785
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,200
- So I wonder what that means for Christmas this year.

786
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,680
- I bet this isn't even in Saudi Arabia, Jupiter.

787
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,920
What? That's clearly Saudi Arabia.

788
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,720
Whoa!

789
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Holy crap.

790
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,040
Santa!

791
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,600
There he is.

792
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,480
Santa's converted.

793
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,200
That's amazing.

794
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,040
We don't know that he was Christian in the first place.

795
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,520
That's true.

796
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,240
I guess we don't.

797
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,560
Maybe he's-- yeah.

798
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,200
He was delivering it all over.

799
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,280
He's giving it all over.

800
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,760
That's true.

801
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,160
He probably didn't-- probably he--

802
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,000
I mean, well, yeah.

803
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,120
He wouldn't be Christian because he's not getting presents.

804
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,720
It wouldn't be anything in it for him.

805
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,200
Yeah, so he can still be Muslim.

806
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,720
He can be--

807
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,280
He probably was Muslim the whole time.

808
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,560
He can be agnostically atheist.

809
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,060
No.

810
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,560
No.

811
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,060
Like me?

812
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,560
Too far.

813
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Not cool.

814
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
I'm agnostically atheist.

815
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,060
No.

816
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,560
I recently converted to that.

817
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Okay, I don't even want to.

818
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Ask me any scientific question and I can answer it.

819
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Why is water blue?

820
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Not my fucking problem.

821
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
I'm gonna ask your phony baloney god.

822
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,060
He told me.

823
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,560
Yeah, he told you what?

824
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Because it reflects the sky.

825
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
How does it feel knowing you're going to hell?

826
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Feels fucking dope.

827
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Hang out with fucking Elvis and fucking Hitler.

828
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,160
in heaven. What? I don't want to hang out with Hitler. I don't want to hang out with him.

829
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,280
Elvis though. Elvis is in heaven. Do you think Elvis and Hitler get along in hell? Yeah.

830
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,920
And Michael Jackson too? No, I don't think Michael Jackson and Hitler are fighting. Well,

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,780
I'm 50 years old and my loads were reduced to few drops or almost nothing

877
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:07,440
Major load increased my loads to a nice shot anytime I come and I see the word come is

878
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,120
Highlighted as if you searched for it here. No. No, I hate come I

Holy crap, these pills are true to their word after taking one pill for the first time 30 men later

882
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,000
I was feeling energetic and well, I noticed I was extremely hard when the time came

883
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,840
I was able to last longer and busted a lot more juice

884
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,120
I definitely recommend wasn't sure what to expect when ordering was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked

885
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:48,160
I've never really had a problem with performance, but max load completely enhanced sensations also helped me keep rock solid

886
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,600
I will probably end up ordering another bottle when this one runs out

887
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,460
I think I might buy this product because I really want to come like I'm peeing there's a bunch of yeah

888
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,520
Dude, there's a I want to do I want a one minute long stream

889
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
I didn't screenshot it

890
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,880
But there was a bunch of reviews that are like I bought this for my man

891
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,580
And I'm loving it his loads are huge, and I'm like isn't that that goes like against what I thought was kind of common courtesy

892
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,620
Which is that the smallest possible load when you yeah, it's less less of a mess

893
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,280
Yeah, also like fucking I'm putting it into my own shirt anyway. I don't give a fuck how big it is

894
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,180
You know ideally the woman's never gonna see it

895
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,160
What okay

896
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,360
You don't do that dude. I want to I want to have to I want to have to

897
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,160
I want to I don't I don't wipe it like I'm like wiping a spill with my shirt

898
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,820
That's what I do or I put it into my hand and then I go like into the toilet

899
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,880
yeah, I want to I want to take this and I want to have a

900
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,280
Load that's strong and fast enough that I have to come on the side of the toilet bowl or else

901
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,960
It will splash all the water out. Yes, exactly it all over my bathroom floor all over my back

902
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,640
They have a pill you can take that makes it so you just don't ever come again. You ever get it in your mouth

903
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:06,880
ever Patrick you ever get it I'm gonna say this one more time have you ever

904
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,640
other tracking notification somebody somebody is tracking me have you ever

905
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,880
get it you have to stop it you knock it off have you ever get it in your mouth

906
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:27,000
I almost flew over that wasn't fucking cool you slapped me answer the question

907
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,720
answer the goddamn question you fucker have you ever get it no you never once

908
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,280
never once I got it in my mouth four times I got it my mouth four times

909
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,680
because when I was younger will not say how much younger I used to shoot it onto

910
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,800
my belly in the bathroom and one day I accidentally must have taken a major

911
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,400
load because it shot with serious

912
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,480
ferociousness into my mouth. Your mouth was

913
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,400
open? Yeah, because I go "Ugh!" You were like this? I was like "Ugh!"

914
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
And I didn't learn my lesson and it happened three more times.

915
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,840
You were looking down the barrel! Why did you shoot it on it? You were in the bathroom!

916
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,000
Because I didn't know, I don't know why I'd never

917
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,800
thought to have used toilet paper onto it

918
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,760
and make the little... Just aim it down like it's

919
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,080
an udder. My shit won't shoot down! I did

920
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,640
know somebody used a jack-off directly

921
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,240
into the toilet just squirt into that nasty. I thought that was nasty. That shouldn't happen.

922
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,480
That's nasty because everybody at some point sees the toilet bowl so you should be doing

923
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,080
it into the toilet tank because that's hidden.

924
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,600
Or in your mouth on accident. But it does not taste very good.

925
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
And I...

926
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Depends on the diet.

927
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,000
That's true. You're probably eating lots of cum so it probably tastes a lot like cum.

928
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,200
Yeah, I was eating pretty much only cum at the time and hot dogs so it was pretty bad.

929
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,280
Okay, is that all the wait? No, I think there's one more review. No, that was it. Okay. Okay. Well, that's a great gift

930
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,720
Yeah, thanks for the recommendation. I hope somebody buys that for their Papa. Here's here's what I found. See I didn't look at any

931
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,120

1017
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:26,340
And then this last one is for Caleb oh

Hell no any acne on my ass

00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:36,780
Why would you Pell nah, but acne clearing cream, that's a low blow

1020
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,760
Yeah, very low as low as your butt which is very low to the ground cuz you're this tall

1021
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,500
Exactly you're not that tall you're really short

1022
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:53,420
That I said a booger come out. No keep that shit to yourself, bro. I didn't do is an inside nasty

1023
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,580
Yeah, I would love to hear that guy say booger

1024
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,260
I saw a guy walking a big fat guy walking on the street sneezing a booger

1025
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,260
I saw it fly and do a trapeze

1026
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,900
into his own mouth

1027
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,300
And it just I was in the middle of talking to Noah we were walking on the street and he did that and me and Noah

1028
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,260
just like

1029
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,260
Just like froze completely. Yeah

1030
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:19,380
Yeah, he had a pretty probably was shaped like this probably was dude to the boomer. Yeah. Yeah

1031
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,100
That's probably the mechanic if you're interested in the physics behind that that's probably

1032
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:29,980
Gnostic atheist new upbringing. Yeah, what I believe is that God's hand came down and and it willed it to go

1033
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,620
Because he knew the fat guy was hungry. Oh, wow. He rides

1034
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,040
- Take it away.

1035
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,220
- Okay, I got some gifts here.

1036
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,560
- What's up? - Peckerhead?

1037
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,960
- If you don't hold it up to the mic,

1038
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,440
no one will be able to hear it.

1039
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,280
- Okay.

1040
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,140
- But this is my gift guide.

1041
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,720
I got some gifts here, some suggestions for different.

1042
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,880
So this one's a multi-part one.

1043
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,800
So first here, this is a good gift for children.

1044
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,680
Okay, this is some things that go together

1045
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,240
that you could buy for maybe a nephew or a son

1046
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,160
or one of these types.

1047
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,000
And first we have a talking--

1048
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,600
- Sometimes a nephew is a son.

1049
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,300
- Sometimes, but not always.

1050
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,820
"A Taki Toys products fart speaker remote controlled, plays funny poop and fart sounds, hilarious

1051
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,800
prank joke and gag toy."

1052
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
So this is great.

1053
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Now I want you to go to the next slide here.

1054
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,980
This is an addition to this gift that you can get.

1055
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,460
Here are two other things which is an Allen & Heath SQ6 digital mixer, 48 input channels,

1056
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,540
24 onboard preamps, 25 faders, etc.

1057
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,340
And then a SoundTown all-weather line array system with 115-inch waterproof line array

1058
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,740
subwoofer, 4-compact dual 8-inch line, dot dot dot.

1059
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,500
And if you go to the next slide, this is a cheap gift.

1060
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:36,020
it'll only run you about $10,510.44.

1061
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,860
- That's pretty good.

1062
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,860
- So this is a good gift for kids aged six to eight.

1063
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,500
I think they'll find a lot of fun with this.

1064
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,200
You might have to also buy an adapter

1065
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,400
to get the fart speaker.

1066
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,820
But the advantage of this is you can get multiple,

1067
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,300
this is, you know, you can get up to, I think,

1068
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,580
even 48 fart speakers.

1069
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,420
- Oh, the input channels, yeah.

1070
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,300
- And mix them in separate volumes,

1071
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,020
in separate, you know, effects.

1072
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,980
- You kind of do beginning of Back to the Future,

1073
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,820
you hit the right but you just press that fart speaker button and you can do yeah

1074
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,380
yeah you know at once like like that band 10 CC where they did all the the

1075
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,380
recording through the mixer you could do that with the farts where you have like

1076
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:15,580
a fart orchestra yes yeah and this is also great for it so this is great for

1077
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,380
six to eight year olds who enjoy farts but also any six to eight year old who's

1078
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:23,340
thinking of opening a music venue this can actually be a great gift yeah for the

1079
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:28,140
little producer in your family this can actually be huge but you might want to

1080
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,500
get a few more of the array systems for that.

1081
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,340
- Depends on the venue size, I guess.

1082
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,340
- It does depend.

1083
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,300
All right, let's go to the next one here.

1084
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,980
This is for a nerd and your family.

1085
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,700
This is 1,000 feet of Cat6 Ethernet cable.

1086
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,700
It comes in red, yellow, black, blue, silver, brown,

1087
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,220
and it's $203.

1088
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,540
- That's not bad for 1,000 feet of Cat6.

1089
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,500
- No, definitely, and this is also great,

1090
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,900
I mean, say you think, you haven't seen your cousin

1091
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,680
in a while, you know he's nerdy, okay?

1092
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,060
You know he's a geek.

1093
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,780
And then you buy, so you buy this for him.

1094
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,620
And then you get to Christmas and he's like,

1095
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,380
"Oh, by the way, cousin, I'm not a nerd or geek anymore.

1096
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,720
I actually like fashion.

1097
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,300
I like necklaces and belts now."

1098
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,660
- Oh shit! - Yup, that's right.

1099
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,500
- Wow. - Okay.

1100
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,220
- So this is foolproof.

1101
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,280
- He's about to turn the fashion world upside dizzy

1102
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,420
with this one. - See, and you know

1103
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,860
who you could also get this for

1104
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,900
is the office fan in your family.

1105
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,740
- Really?

1106
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,420
- If one of Jim's famous pranks involves the same red cable.

1107
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,260
- Is that true?

1108
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,100
- What's the prank?

1109
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,920
- What's the prank?

1110
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,760
- I don't remember that.

1111
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,760
- He puts a cable, he hooks a cable to Dwight's computer.

1112
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,860
- He actually uses the computer.

1113
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,900
- Speaking of the office,

1114
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,420
if you live a thousand feet away from your office,

1115
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,620
you can actually connect to your works ethernet port

1116
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,020
and use your computer from home.

1117
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,220
- Mmm.

1118
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,100
- You could probably steal the internet

1119
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,300
from like a sweet green or something.

1120
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,140
- Yeah.

1121
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:49,980
- Yeah, this is actually really,

1122
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,180
if they let you behind the desk,

1123
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,340
you're definitely gonna want to bring one of these.

1124
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,460
- I would love to do like a little like,

1125
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,260
like high style, like get,

1126
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,260
I just gotta get in there.

1127
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,260
Plug your own laptop in.

1128
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:07,260
I see you walking out with a giant spool of red cable out of the door and across the street and into an apartment building.

1129
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,260
Hidden in your sleeve.

1130
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,260
It's like you have the other part of it going up your back and through your...

1131
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,260
Well it's coming out of the back of your shirt and they're like, "Sir, are you running a cable from our store?"

1132
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,260
You're like, "No, that's just my tail."

1133
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,260
I was born with a tail.

1134
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,260
Don't close it in the door. It'll really hurt me.

1135
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,400
it'll really hurt me.

1136
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,480
- Let's look at the next gift here.

1137
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,320
I don't remember what it is.

1138
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,020
Oh yeah, this is a book I found called

1139
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,100
"Drugs, Secret Death Pill."

1140
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,720
And I found this because I was trying to,

1141
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,360
in case you had an annoying person in your family,

1142
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,060
I was trying to find an item on Amazon called a death pill.

1143
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,380
But it turns out they don't sell anything called a death pill.

1144
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,220
- Wow.

1145
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,040
- That name sounds so familiar, Cagri-Gur.

1146
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,540
(laughing)

1147
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,580
- Well it's actually a famous brother's,

1148
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,780
Cagri-Gur and Cagri-Gur.

1149
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,620
- Oh my God.

1150
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,400
- Look at the authors there.

1151
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,100
But yeah, not too much interesting about this one.

1152
00:53:54,100 --> 00:54:00,300
I just thought "Secret Death Pill" by Kagri Gur was kind of getting me.

1153
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,700
So this one is Luminance Red, the proven genital sore device for pain relief and sore management.

1154
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,180
Holy shit, that's expensive.

1155
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,600
This is $350 and it's the ultimate genital sore device.

1156
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,160
The Luminance Red is a breakthrough pain-free genital sore device designed to help you manage

1157
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,000
sores on or around the genitals.

1158
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,820
No longer do you have to rely on messy lip creams, gels, ointments, patches, medicines,

1159
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,640
acuclovir, lysine, or Abreva.

1160
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,120
You think she's patting that thing and rubbing her head at the same time?

1161
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,760
Why is she touching her head?

1162
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,520
Did she hurt her head too?

1163
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,520
I guess so.

1164
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,520
I think she's trying to go like...

1165
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
Yeah she's doing a...

1166
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,880
You know supposedly that red light can grow your hair back too.

1167
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,360
You know she's got some hairy ass pubes down there.

1168
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
Yes.

1169
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
And her pussy is like 100%.

1170
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,800
Dude, do not say pubes because I'm going to have a laughing attack.

1171
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,320
And I'm going to cum.

1172
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,920
Her fucking pubes are overgrown because of that red light.

1173
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,920
Stop.

1174
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,280
Oh, you pet. Well, hey, you can get it. If you think it's expensive, you can get it for

1175
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,480
twenty five bucks a month over a year. And that's huge. So that's 30 percent APR. This

1176
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,760
is a great gift for an uncle or aunt who suffers from genital warts or sores. Yeah, that is

1177
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,680
good. I'll take you. Yeah, because you also have the extra thing of like, oh, I've got

1178
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,360
to grow my hair back. Yeah. Right. Or or yeah, I have no pubes. My pubes are removed in a

1179
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,880
fire. But then you go, oh, I'm going to put it on my or just in case because it can strike

1180
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:24,040
at anybody. I remove my pubes probably once a year. Yeah, I pluck them. I pluck them bit

1181
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,840
by bit. I would get the laser hair removal on my pubes. Yeah, just around the ring of

1182
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:35,520
the shaft so it makes it look bigger. Yeah, I think I would maybe consider that in a world

1183
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,920
where Final Destination doesn't exist, but I've seen five of those movies and I will

1184
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,040
never be in a room with a laser. So I'll never get LASIK. Is there a LASIK death in that?

1185
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,840
I don't remember that one. It's when she gets stuck in the chair and the laser gets turned on and it like burns a hole through

1186
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,160
Her head through her eye. I think that's strong

1187
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,700
Yeah, wait something in Final Destination couldn't really

1188
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,860
Think it I don't think I don't think it's could go on a plane

1189
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:08,920
Yeah, I don't even remember which one that might be in five maybe yeah, I'm seeing that one five is fire

1190
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,800
Five is the best one dude. You got a fast and the furious. Uh-huh. Yeah, that's ludicrous

1191
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Ludacris. Go back to rapping.

1240
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,600
So it could be exactly the opposite. Yeah, I don't know yeah

High school football games, Friday night lights.

1295
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,900
It was the Tigers versus the Rice.

1296
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,620
Oh my god.

1297
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:17,220
Man, Randy the Rice piece, we used to--

1298
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,740
he was a legend.

1299
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,580
This one also breathed easily from the holes

1300
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,620
of the eyes and mouths.

1301
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,120
I would hope so.

1302
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,620
And you will not feel uncomfortable to have it on for a long time.

1303
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,620
So that's pretty good.

1304
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,620

1306
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,620
That's not bad at all.

1307
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,620
It's in stock right now.

1308
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,620
Let's hit up the next gift here.

1309
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,620
So this is what I found.

1310
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:41,620
You can buy someone a gold mine on eBay for the low price of $8,500.

1311
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,620
And let's go forward here.

1312
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,620
I have some more details about this.

1313
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,620
This is the mine you would be buying.

1314
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,620
Wow.

1315
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,620
So you can buy that for under $9,000.

1316
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,620
It looks to me a lot more like a hill than a mine.

1317
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:55,120
Yeah, but it actually it's been inside that hill it has gold and minerals in there

1318
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:01,920
I found out this is actually a burgeoning industry. Okay eBay, so check this out people are buying mines and shafts

1319
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,640
All the time holy shit. Well people are listing them Wow look at that

1320
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,720
You can buy Nevada gold silver mine historic mining claim shaft pit for eight thousand five hundred. How's their shit?

1321
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:19,280
I'm not sure it's the it's the like the deed. Yeah, it's like the paperwork that says that you own it true or the claim

1322
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,280
I mean, I think it's called. $25,000 for a 20-acre gold mine. I mean, that's pretty good.

1323
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:29,680
Yeah. Let's go to the next one here. This is a sketch of Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone

1324
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,680
for $8. And that's a good deal if you have an art fan.

1325
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,680
Barney's holding his cock. It's brand spanking new. It's kind of a Tom of Finland thing.

1326
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,880
What's fun about this one is if you go forward, you can see what people who looked at this

1327
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,960
also looked at. And you have pieces of art like slouching on a wing chair, skinny guy

1328
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,920
guy wearing open gray jeans, cute guy lifting up his gray shirt.

1329
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,240
Executive gives friend a peck on the cheek. God, that's hot.

1330
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,600
And these are all $8 each, so good gift for big...

1331
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,520
Some budget gifts.

1332
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,600
Yeah, or for the office.

1333
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,440
Get everyone.

1334
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,280
Yeah, Secret Santa.

1335
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,280
You saying something? I'll do that.

1336
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,880
All right, next up here, Goofordust.

1337
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,120
(laughing)

1338
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,880
$9.77, that just speaks for itself.

1339
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,280
Next up here, this is a Demon Whisperer, class eight,

1340
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,440
so you can buy her and you will be soulbound

1341
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,880
to a female Demon Whisperer.

1342
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,880
She is a special and ancient breed and commands millions of lesser demons, devils, hellhounds,

1343
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,080
ibs, succubi, incubi, and other entities.

1344
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,480
She always engages to give out the maximum of her best to make you happy.

1345
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,640
The hardest is not to abuse of them."

1346
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,640
What?

1347
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,000
So you can buy a demon woman.

1348
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Oh!

1349
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And she will be bound to you.

1350
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And they said, "From Canada?

1351
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,760
A demon woman from Canada?"

1352
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
And apparently it's really hard not to abuse her.

1353
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,440
Let's get an offer in.

1354
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,440
That's what they said.

1355
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,800
Well, I just want you to make sure you have options, so go to the next one here.

1356
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,160
You can actually also buy a sex spirit or a neurotic sex demon, and these will be bound

1357
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,640
to you and will have sex with you.

1358
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,640
Wow.

1359
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,640
Okay, I will do that.

1360
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,280
And that's pretty cheap for a bound sex spirit, I think.

1361
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280
Dude, for a fucking demon?

1362
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,280
Yeah.

1363
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Are you kidding me?

1364
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,280
That's pretty good.

1365
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,280
They cost more than that to make.

1366
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,280
Yeah.

1367
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,320
And then the next one, there's actually some more stuff like that.

1368
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,380
You can buy some stuff here.

1369
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,400
You can either become a sorcerer or you can become an alpha male.

1370
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Wow.

1371
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,400
I choose alpha male.

1372
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,400
And these are two things really interesting.

1373
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,400
I choose sorcerer.

1374
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,400
Yeah, sorcerer.

1375
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,400
I could cast a spell to become an alpha male.

1376
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
I could cast a fucking spell to become a sorcerer.

1377
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
You can't cast a spell to become an alpha male.

1378
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
I don't remember which one is which, honestly.

1379
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
Yeah, wait, you guys want to be a sorcerer?

1380
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:19,900
Yeah.

1381
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,400
Those fucking misogynist pieces of shit?

1382
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Become an alpha male.

1383
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,400
No, I'm gonna become-

1384
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
You can wear a pointy hat, get a wand.

1385
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
No, dude, the way you have to look at it, sorcerer-

1386
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
An alpha male doesn't wear a pointy hat and a wand.

1387
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
I think he does.

1388
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
Book of spells, all that.

1389
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,400
I think you're mixing something up.

1390
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,400
I wish I could make myself pass out on command.

1391
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:46,600
I have one more gift to take it home. You can spend $34, get some mayo on Facebook Marketplace.

1392
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,680
I would buy that.

1393
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,080
Just if you run out of ideas. Ship's to you.

1394
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,360
Damn. Not bad at all.

1395
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,240
Hard Eyes 2-Pack Craft Real Mayo. Creamy and smooth. Real.

1396
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,240
That's the real deal.

1397
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
It's real, guys.

1398
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,760
That's the real deal. It looks real to me.

1399
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,600
That's all the gift recommendations I prepared.

1400
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:07,120
If you fucking don't have a good gift by now, after that, I mean, you're an asshole.

1401
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,760
Don't blame us. You're going to blame us. I know you were about to.
