[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:14,360
All right, now we're rolling.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:22,400
Last time on Trebuchet Village, end of ZEbomb's world.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,760
We're going to take that again.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,120
Yeah, let's go.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,920
We're taking that one again.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,640
OK, sorry about that.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,880
We're not letting that one slide.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,760
People pay for this.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,480
Yep, you're right.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,840
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,340
Wake up.

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,400
i think that a cool and we're really any more on trial to another in more time

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
yet and we're

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,340
last time on

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,660
refugee village

17
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,580
and c_d_ bombs world

18
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,380
after two-hour time

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,100
yeah

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,620
if you forget of thinking about it

21
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,340
so all of stuff that happened before that was

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,500
the gang decided they were going to take the ship

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,180
uh... and sailed down to beriberi to revive

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,980
quadro mud marks

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,900
uh...

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,380
and

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,180
there was a cat on board

28
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,500
they had a little interaction with that, there was a snake guy

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
that was such bullshit

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,060
there was other, i mean

31
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,820
well because other stuff happened

32
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,500
yeah i'm remembering it all now

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,100
i just think it's so funny that you couldn't hold yourself back

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,500
from showing us that the cat was a snake man instead of letting us just

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
forget about it we already forgot about it.

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Just show this little...

37
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
The cat actually was a snake man but it's dead now.

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
You couldn't even let it be a snake man and like

39
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
escape or something and like come back to haunt us later.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Yeah you just realized...

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Shut up! That's a good idea.

42
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
That's a really good idea.

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
But he was also a snake man.

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
It would have been such a better

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
move as a DM.

46
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
He turned to a snake and he slithered.

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Remember me, I'm the cat from before.

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Your stupidity with the ship he would have...

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,420
even have a voice for him yeah just what a way to write on that maybe now we're

50
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,700
already know because well I can well we'll see what I do with that we'll see

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:11,940
if there's a zombie cat we'll see what it does with that you see a very wet cat

52
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,500
now does anytime we see a cat or a snake man we're just gonna come in excuse me

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,420
are you the cat from before oh all right continue your little intro then there

54
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
Sorry to belittle it.

55
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,420
No, detritus and debris also.

56
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,420
I forgot about that.

57
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,420
No, I'm just trying to get it out of the way.

58
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,420
I forgot about detritus.

59
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,420
That was my fault.

60
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,420
Yeah.

61
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,100
So I've heard all of these.

62
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,420
I was really like not, I was really reaching with some of those.

63
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,420
Why are you not holding your microphone?

64
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,420
I'm not alive yet.

65
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,900
Then don't talk.

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,900
You either hold your microphone or you don't talk.

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,020
I'm weighing down the law right now.

68
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,180
okay I whiffed I should have just named my character detritus debris but I have a

69
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,580
new I have a whole thing that would have been so mad if you just changed it last

70
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:09,700
minute yeah yeah yeah yeah I would be mad about that and it was a whirlpool and

71
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,100
you could have sailed around it and would have risked capsizing or sailed in it

72
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,340
and done something really cool. Yeah. You sailed in it and...

73
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:29,060
A hundred, not on me at all. Patrick rolled a one on being able to help sort of steady the ship,

74
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,100
which led to me trying to figure out exactly what kind of DC you needed to not completely crash,

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:43,540
and you failed it. And you rolled another one on a death save. Yeah, and he died. And you ended up

76
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:53,500
in the underground or undercove layer of one Flint Lateralis. One mass

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,500
murderer. Yeah, yeah. Sort of a bemused scientist or inventor. Essentially a

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,780
Hitler. Who did not realize that he was Hitler. Basically a Sea Hitler. Yeah, a

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:13,500
A whirlpool Hitler. Yeah, see Hitler. And yeah and then you guys woke up and

80
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,660
pretty much immediately tried to kill him which is totally fair and then he

81
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,780
said I'm sorry I did not realize. You know I never asked if I should. Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,980
You know that whole thing. Yeah Jurassic Park. Right that's the one. Yeah and this

83
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,860
Jurassic Park would be in the future because of how far back in time this

84
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,100
fantasy world is. Right. And he looked at you guys, he says, "Anything I can

85
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,020
make it up to you?" and you guys were like, "Pretty much no." And he said, "What if I

86
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,620
gave you this submarine?" and you kind of like forgot about this. Oh yeah. All of our

87
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,620
friends died, hundreds of our... And he was about to tell you about the submarine and

88
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,220
just that, "If you're going to use it to leave, I have these for you."

89
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,720
Here, and he gives you guys two vials.

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,520
And he says, "Inside these are the temporary gill salves."

91
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,720
So you rub them on your ribs and you'll grow gills for about an hour.

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,420
And once you do, you'll be able to swim underwater if you need to.

93
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,220
Leave the submarine. And otherwise, the submarine, well, it's a very particular...

94
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,520
Just be careful with it if you're going to use it.

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
But I also, you also welcome to rest up.

96
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
You're telling people to be careful with stuff.

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
You also should probably rest up.

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
You guys look pretty battered.

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Basically, you guys should probably take a long rest before you do anything else.

100
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Okay, what kind of accommodations do we have over here at Mr. Laderalus' cave?

101
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,720
He has, I mean he has a cot for himself.

102
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
And then he has just sort of like...

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Not a guest cot?

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
No, I mean he doesn't get guests usually.

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Okay, so I'm in his cot.

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,400
Yeah, he probably kills all of them.

107
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
He will let you guys.

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Sick son of a bitch.

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
He'll let you have his cots.

110
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,840
Yeah, I'm in his cot.

111
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
Okay, I sleep on him.

112
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Okay.

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,880
I'd like to lay him down.

114
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
On Ladder Alice?

115
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll sleep on him like he's my shadow.

116
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
It pretty much works.

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
He accepts it.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I deserve this.

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I deserve it.

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes, you do.

121
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Mm-hmm.

122
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Now make your nose shorter.

123
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Okay.

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm wetting his bed.

125
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
One second.

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
There we go.

127
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,960
It was hitting the back of my neck.

128
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Okay.

129
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
He made his nose shorter.

130
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Something gnomes can do.

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
You guys have a full rest.

132
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
You guys are healed up.

133
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
You have your spell slots back.

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
You're in a better place now.

135
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
You're ready to take the submarine out for a spin.

136
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Okay.

137
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Alright. I'm ready.

138
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I see Patrick making a face.

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
He's gearing up for something.

140
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Actually, on second thought,

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I don't want to go in the submarine.

142
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Yeah, actually, I think I will take yet another long rest.

143
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
at another long rest.

144
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
(laughter)

145
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Okay, yeah, you guys sleep for another

146
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
eight hours.

147
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
(yawn)

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
I don't think you get the benefits of it if you do it in a row.

149
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
I think you double your health.

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
You triple your health?

151
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
You said triple.

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Or we'll triple it. I know a way to triple it.

153
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Yeah, of course, you can stay as long as you like.

154
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
I really fucked up.

155
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm bored.

156
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Oh man, I'm getting hungry.

157
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,560
What you got to eat in your digs?

158
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,920
Mostly fish and kelp.

159
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
I like kelp.

160
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I like fish.

161
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Always, always likes kelp.

162
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,560
Okay, I can make you guys a sort of kelp and fish bowl.

163
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Do you have Krabby Patties?

164
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
No.

165
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
That's where it seems like this is going.

166
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Maybe.

167
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Alright, make me a fish bowl.

168
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Why don't you roll to see if I have Krabby Patties?

169
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Is this submarine red?

170
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I rolled a 17.

171
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Looks like I have Krabby Patties!

172
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
Yeah, Krabby Patties!

173
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
Alright, I'll eat a Krabby Patty.

174
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,960
Okay, so what is it? So, tell me the ingredients of a Krabby Patty, Patches.

175
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,760
Including?

176
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,160
Including just everything.

177
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,960
Yeah, just everything.

178
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,160
Well, there's some things that I can't say. You guys both know that.

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
You guys both know I can't say it.

180
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I really thought that would work.

181
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I'll get you one day, Patches.

182
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,560
Okay, I finished my Krabby Patty.

183
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Okay.

184
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Why is Krabby Patties making me tired?

185
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
[Laughter]

186
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I don't know.

187
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,540
Alright, okay. What now? I think next you want to jump on the bed. Let's do it

188
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,680
Let's invent soccer and play it

189
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,120
I

190
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,440
Mean you guys do notice that like his lair is filled with with toys, but like oh my god

191
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,800
He has like a pogo stick a pro toys proto

192
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,100
I've never even heard of that like he has like primitive Legos. They're like wooden

193
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,800
almost

194
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
What are you doing?

195
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
I'm filming a video.

196
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
You have to pick up your mic.

197
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
I'm not alive, I can't do anything.

198
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Why don't you listen?

199
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
It's so quiet.

200
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
You're not even pointing the speaker at the mic.

201
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Okay, just because he's being annoying I'm getting into the submarine.

202
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Okay, cool.

203
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Alright, so you guys try to get into the submarine and suddenly, you hear a loud noise.

204
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
You hear a loud noise.

205
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
You hear a loud noise.

206
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
You hear a loud noise.

207
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
You hear a loud noise.

208
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
You hear a loud noise.

209
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
You hear a loud noise.

210
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
You hear a loud noise.

211
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
You hear a loud noise.

212
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
You hear a loud noise.

213
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
You hear a loud noise.

214
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
You hear a loud noise.

215
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
You hear a loud noise.

216
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
You hear a loud noise.

217
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,440
yellowing the way i'm getting into the summer okay cool

218
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,400

i think i was in the book but i don't know what you know don't touch that

222
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,380
the submarine is net is not

223
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,400
an invention per se

224
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,280
well no

225
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Oh no, no, no, no.

226
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Oh no, oh no.

227
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Oh no.

228
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Oh no.

229
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Who do we have here?

230
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Hey, there it's me.

231
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
The chuggy singing submarine.

232
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
The chuggy singing submarine.

233
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Yes I am a boat,

234
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
but I am your friend.

235
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
And I'll take you to the world's end.

236
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
And I'll take you to the world's end.

237
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Yes I am a giant

238
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
changeling.

239
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,000
but i am a hundred times of for

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,520
well so i have many spirits in one of them is me

241
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,320
the

242
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
the i_d_a_'s like a dot

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,400
what

244
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,400
uh... it's all i got the singing suffering

245
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,800
uh...

246
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Hello everybody!

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Chuggy.

248
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I didn't even know.

249
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Chugging.

250
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I'd never even heard of a submarine until...

251
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh my god.

252
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I took a lot of Percocet, now I'm like this.

253
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Percocet's an herb we invented.

254
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Do you have eyes?

255
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Yeah, I have like my window, the two front windows.

256
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Okay, so it's full Cars logic.

257
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,800
So, most changelings, when they transform, can only stay within...

258
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I used to be a human form, and then I took a bunch of Percocet.

259
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Which is a thing that he invented.

260
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
It is me. It is me.

261
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Or what's the...

262
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
We co-invented. We world-built it together.

263
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
What's the Flint Lateratus...

264
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Lateratus...

265
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Lateratles.

266
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
It's so fucking hot in here.

267
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
He did take a bunch of Percocet.

268
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
So the lore we've come up with...

269
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah, I thought that the doctor invented it.

270
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Well, a lot of... Percocet is a very rare herb.

271
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
yeah that

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,320
uh... come from the art that she's changed the way things can take

273
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,920
and if they do uh...

274
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,280
uh... it can potentially unlock

275
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,360
uh...

276
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,640
rare forms of changing change links technically

277
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,760
can only change within their size so

278
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,680
chuggy

279
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,480
here has other

280
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,240
i mean you can see like a normal changes are used to be a normal guy named chuggy

281
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
yeah

282
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,440
and he's checking the changeling

283
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,040
yeah so and i think it's a good idea

284
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,280
i have a lot of other than i want to

285
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
do it i am so i hear this in character

286
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,120
this is why so wait you know i took a

287
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,560
bunch of percocet and then one day

288
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,280
molecules in my body started changing

289
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,040
what's a molecule what the hell are you

290
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,520
talking about word i learned it from

291
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,240
science well could be i mean oh that i'm

292
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,080
familiar yeah yeah yeah popular are

293
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,880
taking that in middle school now yeah

294
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
Alchemy class, god damn.

295
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh my god, my lab partner, Mr. Frederick,

296
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
My alchemy teacher had the fattest ass!

297
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
Oh my god, he's sexual.

298
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
My alchemy teacher in middle school was a veteran

299
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
and we all laughed when he saw him crying on Veterans Day.

300
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,080
[laughter]

301
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm uh, so I'm just a-

302
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,240
My alchemy teacher had a thyroid problem

303
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
and that's why her ass was so big.

304
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
That's not a joke.

305
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
[laughter]

306
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
Mine wasn't a joke either.

307
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,080
[laughter]

308
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,520
I guess I'm just a little confused as to, I mean do you, so will you always be just a ship?

309
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,440
No!

310
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,160
Okay, so...

311
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,800
Please explain.

312
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
I have four separate personalities!

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm just, uh, great.

314
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,640
So here's the thing, a changeling can technically turn into any form and mimic any voice that

315
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
they've met before.

316
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Now, for our purposes, we've narrowed down, obviously you can still turn into any form

317
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,720
that you've seen, but we've narrowed down the voices for everyone's...

318
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,220
Well I have, I have, I can change into anything but it's like the...

319
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,720
He has three that he's used around when he's like wants to not be a submarine and be a normal person.

320
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,520
But he mostly likes being a submarine.

321
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
That's what he is.

322
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,220
Oh you are just a submarine that can do, that can do a little bit of disguise work.

323
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Yeah.

324
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
Alright.

325
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
So you're a submarine.

326
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,220
We'll meet, we'll, I mean we could, do we want to talk about the forms now?

327
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
I guess I can just do...

328
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Or we wanna, or we wanna...

329
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
No, I wanna see them in action.

330
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
Yes, we'll meet them in action.

331
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
We know who they are.

332
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Let's see them in action.

333
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Alright, well, I've known you for about 30 seconds and I'm ready to jump in your body.

334
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,220
I hate when a new submarine trauma dumps to me about their forms.

335
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
I'm glad this one didn't do that.

336
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Yeah, me too.

337
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,220
Okay, I'm opening up a hole in your body and walking in it.

338
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,220
I'm opening up the door at the back.

339
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,220
That's my penis hole!

340
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,220
Which one?

341
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,220
The back or the side?

342
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Which side are you getting in?

343
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
The right side.

344
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
That's my armpit!

345
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,220
We do need to roll for stats. I wanted to roll live so we can see here. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

346
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
I'll show them how we do it.

347
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
I know. I'm so excited.

348
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,220
I know. I'm praying to God that this is just the worst stats of all time.

349
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,220
We're going to do the very friendly method that we do for everybody.

350
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,220
A 4d6, drop the lowest.

351
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,220
For each of them.

352
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,220
So, also to give you some information, Chuggie is a level 5 bard.

353
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,220
College of Glamour, much like Sullivan.

354
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
I was.

355
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
College of Glamour.

356
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Uh, but Glamour is really useful for, um, doing disguise work and the ability to also

357
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
sort of like charm people into making them sleep.

358
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,220
So you went to Glamour College?

359
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Mmhmm.

360
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,660
And things like that, and uh, to escape captors, cause of potentially we can get into Chuggie's

361
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
past.

362
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Can you put a weave on Steeble?

363
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Um.

364
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
A weave?

365
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
Mmhmm.

366
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,540
Uh, I mean he has a disguise kit and he has proficiency in it, so potentially.

367
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Oh my fucking god.

368
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
If you're asking character.

369
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,700
We'll get to that.

370
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:01,040
And so he's got -- he'll be a very useful party member probably.

371
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
So let's start rolling for stats though to find out.

372
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,780
I believe you already have a +4.

373
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,740
You have a +4 starting in Charisma because we have 3 from your race and +1 because of

374
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,060
a feat you took which is Actor.

375
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,100
It's going to give you advantages when you're doing --

376
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,900
He and Rachel chat rooms are showing feat.

377
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
He said race and feat.

378
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
I got 3 twos.

379
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
So I can say that.

380
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:28,900
that's an 8. Yo! Alright, we're one roll. Oh my god. Let's get it. 6, 2, 3. What's that?

381
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:42,740
That is an 11. Alright. It's low so far. 6, 6, 2. Nice. It's a 14, that's not bad. For

382
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:54,540
it

383
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,800
Oh my god, I can't wait to riff on you doing that dude. I'm over here itching to riff. We're gonna win five four two

384
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,300
You guys can talk you just won't rip you know

385
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,620
I said it before I moved it that was a five five and a four or five five and a two five

386
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:13,360
I'm gonna which one did I said five four two on your so is a five four two okay five four two it's an 11

387
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Okay, he's getting a little

388
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,480
It's this one three four three five two it's a ten. It's pretty good. You're getting decent decent, okay?

389
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:30,460
There's a nice six four three ten is plus zero is a 13. Okay. Wait, we're at we're at we're done. We're at six

390
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,840
We're done. So we've got 8 11 14 11 10. I'm gonna put a oh my god

391
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:41,540
Finally, he's he's power level is is is the same as ours now. Yeah, you're nerfed relatively speaking

392
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,780
I would put I would just put the 14 in charisma because you're gonna be a caster

393
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,120
Yeah, and then you'll have 18 and you'll have a plus 4 there which is gonna be holy crap. It's gonna be important

394
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,180
Shit man, but yeah, I would say a dex is pretty important for

395
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:04,720
You guys yeah, a dex is pretty important for ash ketchup as well. Yeah, this riffing over here

396
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,520
Don't mind and uncles nationwide. I guess I guess when I said riff. I just meant talk no let me in my riffs

397
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
No, I'm super sorry

398
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,800
How much longer

399
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,800
I have like a huge amount of stats to get done here.

400
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:35,800
That's just a riff I came up with.

401
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Get a riff off of that one.

402
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Get a riff off of that one.

403
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
That's pretty cool.

404
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,800
I got another riff guys.

405
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Let's hear it.

406
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Here's mine.

407
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
That's actually fucking terrible.

408
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I don't recommend...

409
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Holy fucking shit man.

410
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Holy fuck dude.

411
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
I think we need to get bongos.

412
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Wow. Wow wow wow.

413
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Wow wow wow.

414
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
*singing along to the riff*

415
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
*singing along to the riff*

416
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
I heard that riff.

417
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
I cannot wait to hear that riff used in a song.

418
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
*singing along to the riff*

419
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Alright, let's move over to more...

420
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
*singing along to the riff*

421
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Is there something for us to riff on?

422
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
What stat are you working on right now?

423
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Right now I'm working on his skills.

424
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
So, bards have...

425
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Ain't got none.

426
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Bards actually have quite a bit of skills.

427
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
He's killing my boner when I see this ugly guy.

428
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
So they have proficiency.

429
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
And you get half proficiency.

430
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
You let him swim underwater with no breath.

431
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
On things they're not proficient with.

432
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
And they have expertise on certain ones.

433
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Expertise.

434
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
That sounds like a name.

435
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
What about in character?

436
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
What's an expert?

437
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
What about in character?

438
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
You guys are meeting for the first time?

439
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,360
You guys want to talk about something?

440
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
So do we have...

441
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm basically...

442
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm buying a ticket on you.

443
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
What's your decks?

444
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
My deck?

445
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Well, I have two decks.

446
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
The poop deck and the...

447
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
The pee deck.

448
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
The pee deck.

449
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
There's a riff for you, Patrick.

450
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
There you go.

451
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
The diarrhea deck.

452
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I'll never ask for anything.

453
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
What the hell?

454
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Wait.

455
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Listen, I'm just kidding about that.

456
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Wait, so if you...

457
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
How do you get the diarrhea deck?

458
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
I don't know.

459
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
I don't know.

460
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I don't know.

461
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't know.

462
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
I don't know.

463
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,080
Where, how do you poop? What happens if you're a submarine?

464
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
It comes out as exhaust!

465
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,240
Exhaust?

466
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,760
Yeah, I'm getting pretty exhausted by this fucking character.

467
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
What are you saying?

468
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
I poop all over his stuff.

469
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Completely all over his stuff.

470
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Like you dust the room?

471
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
I completely crop dust him when I leave.

472
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
How do you eat while you're a submarine?

473
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
I eat the water.

474
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
You eat water?

475
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
You eat water, what do you drink?

476
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I eat the krill that's inside of it.

477
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,440
a big whale. So you're just a whale that we can get inside. But I'm a submarine. And I

478
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,400
love to sing. Wait, what makes you a submarine? I hope that this doesn't get misconstrued

479
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,400
in Gay Boy. I'm doing an impression of the guy from Mary Poppins. Which guy? Edwin. Oh

480
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,920
yeah, we talked about this. He also played the Mad Hatter. Yeah, I think that's the more

481
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Yeah, like iconic version of his voice than Edwin from Harry Potter.

482
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Well his name was Edwin.

483
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
It was Edwin.

484
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
But the Mad Hatter was gay though.

485
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Oh shit!

486
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,920
People aren't gonna like this voice.

487
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I think they're gonna be fine with it.

488
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
I hope they are.

489
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Can I...

490
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
You bunch of...

491
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Can I...

492
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
What is the inside of you look like before I open this damn thing?

493
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Blood and guts!

494
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Okay, so it's fully...

495
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,880
It's fully blood and guts so you are shaped like a control that you are just a whale

496
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,300
I'm pretty much just the whale who's shaped like a submarine. I think most submarines already say like whales

497
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:55,200
From a whale what my control deck and the steering wheel of my intestine

498
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,660
But you can also you can decide where we're going as well. Yes, we don't have to steer you from we have no

499
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,360
Basically no point for you to go inside of me

500
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,340
Well, if the thing is let you're like that he will move

501
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,980
He moves way faster than you guys

502
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,620
So you guys want to travel like swim at the actual speed of like a boat you were using I'm a part unless I'm in human

503
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,220
Form how faster than our ship what happens is about the same speed as your ship

504
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,580
I'm gonna transform back into a person when we're inside you late it

505
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,400
You will die. I think I'm

506
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Probably take who is taller me you if he transforms while you're inside him you will die

507
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,360
Yeah, cuz you will sort of try to

508
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,680
Write up my organs will go around them. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, well, I mean we'll probably just get hurt

509
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,680
But then you have to come up with another spells. I gave you I also gave him

510
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,560
I gave him the tiny hut spell so if you guys I

511
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,620
Wow, I thought it was a periscope but it's clearly a hat

512
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,080
The water from my blowhole shoots up. You have a blow your submarine with a blowhole

513
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,840
Oh, you're literally a whale.

514
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,080
What are you talking about?

515
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,640
How else am I going to breathe?

516
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,320
So let me just lay this out.

517
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,760
So now I'm trying to--

518
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,120
The only way for me to function as a submarine

519
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,480
is if I'm technically a whale.

520
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,400
Right.

521
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,200
So you're a whale.

522
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,680
Because I'm a living, breathing thing.

523
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,040
But we're going to call you a submarine.

524
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,640
And this guy--

525
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
But I go by Chuggie the Submarine.

526
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,760

I'm gonna crit 1.

534
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,020
Okay, you probably won't really understand it, but...

535
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,300
Yeah, no. You know he's a slave.

536
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,940
He makes me go out to faraway lands!

537
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,340
That sounds horrible! Who would want to do that?

538
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,580
And I have to eat other people!

539
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,180
[Laughter]

540
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,820
What?

541
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,860
When he captains me, I have to eat people.

542
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,180
Wait, he captains you? Is that like a sex thing?

543
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,980
I gotta crit 1, I feel like.

544
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
It's a complete sex thing for him!

545
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,940
[Laughter]

546
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,620
but he lets me talk here.

547
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
He darts with you here?

548
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
He darts with me!

549
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
It's not a sex thing!

550
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,620
My penis is the size of him!

551
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,620
Look at him, he's 5'2".

552
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Well, he fits the package.

553
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
He's all for it, though.

554
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Well, proportionally I'm not packing.

555
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,620
That's true.

556
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Because I'm 30 feet long.

557
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
Currently.

558
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
I got enough numbers on here that we'll be safe for now.

559
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
We'll be safe for now.

560
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,620
a sixth of your body.

561
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,620
Yeah.

562
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,620
It's like if you had a one foot dick.

563
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,620
I won't be able to speak after recording anymore

564
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
because of this voice.

565
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,620
See, that's why you gotta be smart like me and pick a voice like this

566
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
after doing a bunch of voices like this.

567
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,620
I wanted to show off my talents.

568
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,620
I mean, you could definitely, if you need to,

569
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,620
because you are a changeling,

570
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,620
you can just swap out to one of your other voices if...

571
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
I have full schizophrenia!

572
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,620
That's not really what a changeling is.

573
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
No, he's a whale.

574
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,620
I'm a singing submarine!

575
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Okay, you know, you guys are both by the way...

576
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,620
I'm not gonna do much singing unless I need to introduce myself to other people!

577
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
But that was kinda singing right there, guys.

578
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
I don't know if that was singing!

579
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,620
That was definitely singing.

580
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,620
That was singing.

581
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
What are you talking about?

582
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
*laughter*

583
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,620
I was on the line.

584
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
He constantly sings.

585
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
Alright.

586
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
*sings* Now I don't!

587
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
That one was singing.

588
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
*sings* That was that singing I stubbed my toe!

589
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
That one was actually not singing.

590
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
A lovely Barry Tenner, but it's time for him to go.

591
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,620
*sings* Who's Barry Tenner?

592
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,620
*laughter*

593
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,620
*sings* Is that what you said? I couldn't hear you.

594
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
That's a pretty good idea. Barry Tender.

595
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,620
Like a chicken.

596
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,680
chicken me get a little bit

597
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,040
i guess i really i think now that uh... that now that

598
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,960
patrick you know there is dead

599
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,400
uh... that i know right at me the same here that's great

600
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,140
while i'm looking at the fact that i don't know what you are big

601
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,780
uh... this is a spot

602
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,400
is that this uh... this this mud body here

603
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,440
officially holds no value besides being quadra mud marks

604
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,920
and whatever plotline we're falling before is officially severed and doesn't

605
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,520
matter we can completely a hundred percent focus.

606
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,320
Which by the way, Chuggy, our whole thing right now is we're gonna

607
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:04,000
Vive this. I know a guy! Oh my god. Well technically, one of my personalities does.

608
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,320
Wait, oh my god this makes things very easy. Can you Vive this? We would still

609
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,640
have to go and get him Vived. Yeah so he still has to go to Beriberi but he knows a guy

610
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:34,640
I

611
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:54,840
that

612
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
put him on quadro.

613
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,680
- Yeah, and his leg. - So his leg.

614
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,520
- And his wing, on quadro double A.

615
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,320
- And I can eat his head and his legs and his arm.

616
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,160
Not his arm.

617
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,760
- And we'll feed him, we'll feed the rest of him.

618
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,440
- Yeah, I feel like I have a submarine.

619
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,040
- I can eat the torso.

620
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,400
- You guys always do like a Frankenstein thing.

621
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,800
- He did just claim that he only eats krill.

622
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,480
- But I said that my captor makes me eat people.

623
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,240
- We'll feed you a dead guy.

624
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
- Okay, so my friend. - I did.

625
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,600
- So like, take to me.

626
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,320
- Okay, so Patrick eats Patrich.

627
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,560
- I was gonna do Barney's voice for this.

628
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,400
- Yeah, we do like a--

629
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,640
- And I kind of wish I did.

630
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,280
We do like a forged in fire style montage of us and there's guitar music.

631
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,420
[imitates guitar]

632
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:38,720
And we're hitting his arms and legs on a forge, chopping them up, breaking them.

633
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Mudding them.

634
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,560
And then soldering his arms and legs to a quadruped mark.

635
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,040
You get help from Flint.

636
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,480
He gives you access to his...

637
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,480
We try dipping his arms and legs into a forge.

638
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
- He's like, "Don't do that."

639
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
- Yeah.

640
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
- Okay, perfect.

641
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
- And then we toss his head and his torso.

642
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
- Yeah, and you like -- yeah.

643
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
I like the idea of you sort of like coat the arms and legs.

644
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
- It tastes just like chicken.

645
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
- So it's like they're sturdy as rock, just like the hardened mud.

646
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
It's like now it's all one, like, statue.

647
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
And then the head, where you -- guys, put the patridge's head.

648
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
- Oh, that's in his mouth.

649
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
He needs that.

650
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
- Yeah.

651
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
- Put it in his mouth.

652
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
- Yeah.

653
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
- Yeah.

654
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
- Yeah.

655
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
- Yeah.

656
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
- Yeah.

657
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
- Yeah.

658
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
- Yeah.

659
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
- Yeah.

660
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
- Yeah.

661
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
- Yeah.

662
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
- Yeah.

663
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
- Yeah.

664
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,280
with that the patridge's oh that's in his mouth

665
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,480
it's not that the idea that you are going to fight dot that personality after a

666
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,280
unit

667
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,360
maybe i can see how it will be you have met him so it's how change things work

668
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,760
yeah which was like a priority stretching that i don't think you've met

669
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,000
a subnet change the windows and alright

670
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,960

673
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,500
He's doing a Magic School bus thing, I'm allowing it.

674
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,080
I'm doing a song!

675
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Whoa!

676
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,240
So yeah, you guys want to go out to the deep blue sea?

677
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Yeah.

678
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
With Chuggie the singing submarine?

679
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,160
Listen, I've never seen anybody I want to spend more time with than Chuggie.

680
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I'm getting in there.

681
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Hell yeah.

682
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
Okay, yeah, you guys get into Chuggie.

683
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
It's sort of fleshy and red.

684
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
What is it inside of you?

685
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,200
It's like, if...

686
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
So you guys are inside of me?

687
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Yeah.

688
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,080
If you turn on a light, you can see every single thing.

689
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
There's a light in there?

690
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,080
You have a light in your body?

691
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Lights aren't even invented.

692
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
What the fuck is going on?

693
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,080
That must be, he was pointing past Chuggie into the middle of his body.

694
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Must have meant the light bulb.

695
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
This bulb shaped light thing.

696
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
What the hell is it? This is the weirdest candle I've ever seen.

697
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
I guess we could call it a bulb light.

698
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,080
It's a kidney stone! And it's interacting with the electrons in my body.

699
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Alright, well.

700
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Alright, well, whatever.

701
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
I'm gonna flip it on.

702
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,600
dimmer oh my god let's set the mood yeah if you if you turn the light if you turn

703
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,320
the uh the kidney stone on inside of my body you it's just like completely

704
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,720
translucent you can see all my veins all my bones and guts and stuff i'm gonna

705
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,080
can i lick the his wall his inner wall hey you gotta buy me dinner first

706
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,400
i'm hitting his back wall i just gave you dinner i fed you my dead friend's body

707
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,320
i guess you can lick me yes i'm gonna do this all i want

708
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:18,720
Only for the duration of this trip. If you keep feeding me you can keep doing it. It'll take two weeks to get there.

709
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Alright.

710
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,040
This is how we do it. You can only do that for two weeks. I don't even, this time I'm getting electrolytes and

711
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:33,560
My electrolytes if you keep doing that. No, you're meeting krill. I'm jumping up and down in the back.

712
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
I'm like a parasite.

713
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm bouncing off. I'm bouncing off his back walls like sky zone if I jump back if he

714
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,580
Specifically back walls if he jumps inside me is fine. I've I have 30 feet long

715
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,980
I am 30 rubbing myself against your walls, and I'm

716
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,480
16

717
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:02,580
So you're - I guess

718
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:08,760
I guess I'm two years old.

719
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,740
In submarine years.

720
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,780
How many normal years are in a submarine year?

721
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
I don't remember.

722
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
I took too many Percocets.

723
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
He's an adult.

724
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
He's an adult.

725
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
He's an adult.

726
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
He's an adult.

727
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
He's an adult.

728
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
He's an adult.

729
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
Who thinks he's two.

730
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Moving on.

731
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
Please.

732
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
on. Please.

733
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
Sue.

734
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,780
Sue.

735
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Sue.

736
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,780
I'm two years old.

737
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Oh, okay.

738
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
Alright, so you guys go underwater, right?

739
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
So you guys, you can chart the same path

740
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
towards

741
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,780
We're going to Berry Berry, right?

742
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,780
I know a shortcut to Berry Berry.

743
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,780
Does he know a shortcut?

744
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Can I roll to see

745
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
if I know a shortcut?

746
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,280
No!

747
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
[Laughter]

748
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,780
Can we-

749
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
It's a submarine, we go in a straight line.

750
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
You just go in a straight-

751
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,780
I mean, yeah, there's a huge amount of benefits in riding in a submarine as opposed to a ship.

752
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
There's a secret ocean between you.

753
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,780
There's a secret way-

754
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Well, I'm faster, right?

755
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
You are faster.

756
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
So, it was two weeks-

757
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
It'll be less than two weeks.

758
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,780
It was two on a ship, so it could be- is it one week on a submarine?

759
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
It's like one and a half, basically.

760
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,280
Okay.

761
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,780
Based on like, one and a third.

762
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,780
But it's not a- it's on- no.

763
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,780
It's like, it's one and a half.

764
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,780
One and a quarter.

765
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,180
No, no, no, this is based on I I did in 3/8. This is not I mean I let you be a submarine

766
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,980
All right, so it's true. Let me be

767
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,240
I've I've an idea how close are we to the vortex?

768
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,540
To the the fake whirlpool. Yeah the whirlpool. I mean you're like, right

769
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:46,880
Survivors or anybody? Yeah, sure a ladder out. Can you turn that whirlpool off?

770
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,340
We want to do a sweep because I might as well go to bed

771
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,060
also

772
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
like three days down there.

773
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh yeah.

774
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
So, I don't think there's a single survivor.

775
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Alright, is there a snake man that's swimming around here anywhere?

776
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,060
Yeah.

777
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,560
Alright, well hey, if you-

778
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Oh, he's gone! He's gone!

779
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
Who knows where he went?

780
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Oh, look at this!

781
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Or, the tiny cat in the water!

782
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Okay, alright. Well, let's just head to Berry Berry then.

783
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I wanna get this- I wanna get Quad Double M, like, up.

784
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,060
Yeah.

785
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
I wanna get him up and running.

786
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,560
You guys are-

787
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Okay, you guys are beelining for Berry Berry.

788
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:27,560
So, in the uninhabitable sea bomb, that's the uncharted zone.

789
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,000
Phil Thomas Kent.

790
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,800
But yeah, you guys are in the sea bomb.

791
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,440
Not many people have ever been able to, I mean, unless you're a merfolk, you just usually

792
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,920
don't get to be underwater.

793
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,760
Don't get me started on merfolk!

794
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,120
I don't want to get you started.

795
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,480
So this is like, you're seeing through the translucent skin, I guess.

796
00:33:49,480 --> 00:34:09,280
a

797
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,720
with my eyes but i have like like little port holes on the side that i know that i

798
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,840
had yet you are a submarine yeah so that i look like that you don't see as

799
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,400
extends

800
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,440
what that is a little

801
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,920
c_n_n_ number of the american a bunch of blood and bone and grossness party

802
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,120
losses and you have like a

803
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,840
you look at it as a call to like i was like the bus i have a business and that

804
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,680
and that's a little bit body is that

805
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,280
periscope yeah

806
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
my hair picture

807
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
you have one here

808
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
like a cartoon baby

809
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
I have a bunch of different

810
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
hairs but they form a periscope

811
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
the transformation

812
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
it makes more sense when you see it

813
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
I'll look up in that

814
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
and I'll watch

815
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
let me open my porthole

816
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
and I'll watch as the ships go by

817
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
and the portholes are just my pores

818
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
just pores that I had black heads in

819
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
and they formed a lens

820
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,760
Like because he's a submarine like when he's in this form he can withstand

821
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,560
The kind of pressure that most like you know usually like oh that also makes me susceptible to like

822
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,320
cannonballs

823
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:24,040
Underwater what are you talking about? Yeah? Well? I don't know if there's gonna be any kind of underwater combat that I'm gonna have to cannibals cannonballs

824
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,640
Cannibals you are a giant you are yeah

825
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,320
Exactly yeah cannibals you'd only have to worry about about well train we know like submarine whales

826
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,980
Yeah, I guess I'll also change into a person

827
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:43,360
Yeah, and so well here's the thing lateralis did give you guys the gill rub so if you run into any

828
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:50,660
Encounters where you need to fight and in a different form which you know for combat you would have to change out of chuggy chuggy

829
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Doesn't do combat okay

830
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,280
That one is gay what he is gay. Yeah, so

831
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,600
So you would have to move so you'd have to change it

832
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,520
But you have the gills thing so the way those skills work is when you're out of combat

833
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,620
They let you breathe underwater for an hour when you're in combat

834
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,040
They let you breathe underwater for a minute, and then you have to use a bonus action to reapply it okay

835
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,960
Because it's just more intense yeah, and shit

836
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,920
We use a 60 times more oxygen. Yes exactly

837
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,640
Fuck so I have to do that too as chuggy

838
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,160
Chuggy is your only form that lets you breathe underwater.

839
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
Okay.

840
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Also, you said you had a blowhole.

841
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Alright, that's a good point.

842
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Which would mean that you don't breathe underwater.

843
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,480
You just can't hold your breath for a long time and then I guess you have to come up

844
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,480
for air sometimes.

845
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
He's nodding.

846
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Do I have to go up for air?

847
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Yeah, I guess I do have to go up for air.

848
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,520
If you have a blowhole, that is what that is.

849
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm pretty sure.

850
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,320
Alright, that is what a blowhole is.

851
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Okay.

852
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
Okay, cool.

853
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,760
So, you guys, but you can go a couple hundred feet underwater.

854
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
A blowhole.

855
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,720
you can't go much further underwater or the pressure will actually start to

856
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,720
rupture you which I have rules for that too. You have the Benz rules? Yeah I mean I made my

857
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,240
own version of it. Well not the Benz, the Benz is when you come back. Yeah. I thought that's what he was saying.

858
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,320
I wasn't listening. No I don't have like Benz rules but I mean I mean we could figure that out.

859
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:19,560
Are you listening to me talking Chuggy? Hello Chuggy. What is this voice right here? Oh no it's another character.

860
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,140
But yeah, no, it's what it is is if you go

861
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:28,160
Below the threshold and I'll let you know when you are below the threshold where like certain amount of pressure is being applied

862
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:36,040
You can stay at that pressure level for like, you know below that level for like I think I put a minute or two minutes

863
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:42,720
A minute and then once you're at that you have to roll a constitution saving throw

864
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,000
Every minute after that to see if you take damage from like just pressure compounding on your mm-hmm

865
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
self

866
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,120
Also when you swim you guys have a swimming speed of 10 feet

867
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,760
Okay, so just you know, your walking speed is like like yours

868
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,080
Yeah is I think both of yours is 25 feet cuz you're shorter

869
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,920
But like you're just gonna have you're just gonna swim slower than you walk. Okay - 30 feet. So oh, yours is 30 feet

870
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,760
Oh, maybe give you - 1 million feet. It's not what I wrote there. So what it says, yeah as you guys

871
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
travel along in the submarine

872
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,400
You chuggy are approached

873
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,840
by getting me a group of

874
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,840
What looks to be dolphins and they start to talk to you rappers

875
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Rappers, hey

876
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,360
You yeah whale guy

877
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,720
You all I'm not that big have you seen?

878
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,640
That's cute

879
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
Have you seen?

880
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,680
That was pretty a dwarf of her Dan and a goblin

881
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,860
What the hell are you talking about?

882
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:59,440
All right. Well, what is the dwarf? They tried to sell us to a make us into put us in a sex factory

883
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,380
Wait, he survivors. Well, they're robbers. They're robbers, but they survived

884
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,760
They got out of the sex factory. They survived our sex

885
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:19,520
factory they tried to turn you into what then they tried to we didn't really

886
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,760
understand what the sex factory was when we were in it but it wasn't good you

887
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,000
know what a sex factory is on there what kind of to explain what a sex factory

888
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,480
red-blooded man wouldn't kill to work in a sex factory hot babe why are you

889
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,720
retroactively turning our sex factory into something evil and yeah and I was

890
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,560
under the impression that these people were gainfully employed at the sex factory and

891
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:53,000
having as much fun as possible. We found a gap in the economy. We found a spot, a market.

892
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,560
We cornered the market here. We didn't ask anybody involved what they wanted to do. Because

893
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,240
it's a meat of, would you want to work in a sex factory? No, I'm married and I'm happy.

894
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,080
But if you were a dolphin named a rubber? Hold on. Yeah. Now I'm getting, I'm putting,

895
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,920
I guess maybe on okay and and and there is an important detail kills of you out

896
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,920
here the sex factory is on hot babe Island that is a good point

897
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:25,840
these ones were gay there's gay guys in pop babe Island I don't think people can

898
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,000
have hot babe sex I guess gay guys guys can be hot babes or maybe maybe they

899
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,880
were trying to maybe they were trying to I mean maybe they were just

900
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,360
experimenting. These guys were upset that you sent them to a sex factory. See, they

901
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,240
sound like a bunch of complainers. I reject this premise. Yeah, I think this isn't happening.

902
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,760
You can keep going, I just mean, this is honestly, this is

903
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,960
like, you know, this is a cornerstone that's being removed and it feels like

904
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,280
everything's toppling down your house of cards. You think I'm

905
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,040
really unsettling sort of the logic and world we built together. That's how I

906
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,160
I feel right is that you're almost like we've been doing this how long two years

907
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,040
and I kind of feel like you're like a disc like I'm like taking it apart now

908
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,280
pretty much yeah like you're dismantling it before my very eyes

909
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,920
because I feel like we've we've established such a nice sex factory

910
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,200
positive kind of like work here you know and it's a work it's okay and it is work

911
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,600
and no and it's not that I this text I feel like it's very

912
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,960
the show. You're one to talk, I don't want to hear it from you.

913
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,760
Well anyway, he asks you and you don't seem to know, and so he says, so the

914
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,640
the group of were-dolphins. I've got an idea.

915
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,840
There's a man.

916
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I don't know how far we are, but he controls whirlpools

917
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,200
and he's always looking for new clients.

918
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,240
I guess we'll ask him where they are.

919
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,960
And he loves it when when uh, what are what are you?

920
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:08,520
Porpoise why did you send him to the person who will tell us tell him where they are?

921
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,980
Oh, Chuckie doesn't know I was trying to make them become slaves again

922
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:20,120
All right, well, I guess we'll be on the lookout for that. Thanks actually never mind what?

923
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,240
What if you went to the zoo

924
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
*laughter*

925
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
*laughter*

926
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Alright, role deception, which you are excellent at.

927
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Oh, just a sea creature

928
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
saying to a fellow sea creature.

929
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
*laughter*

930
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
*laughter*

931
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
How is it deceiving to say "go to the zoo"?

932
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
I mean, at this point he's just trying to

933
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
get them off his tail. Let me make sure

934
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
you have a tail. And I have a tail!

935
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
Asked and answered.

936
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
Is there nothing?

937
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,240
'Cause I thought there was maybe something you had.

938
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
You have.

939
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,240
That maybe allows you to roll again.

940
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Shit.

941
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,240
I don't remember if I gave him something.

942
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,240
No, because you're not passing yourself off as a different person.

943
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
You're passing yourself off as yourself.

944
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,240
So you don't get advantage.

945
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Oh.

946
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
So you just get a one.

947
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,240
You gotta stop rolling that way, for your sake.

948
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,240
They go, "You know something.

949
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
What aren't you telling us?"

950
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
"Yeah, what aren't you telling us?"

951
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Me too, what do you tell them?

952
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,240
That man I'm sending you to had me as his slave.

953
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Why would you send us to him?

954
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Because I'm rude.

955
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,240
We appreciate you owning up to that.

956
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,240
And I'm working on it.

957
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Look, if you haven't seen those three guys, then we're gonna just go.

958
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,240
Well, I've got a great idea for where you could go.

959
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
I mean, honestly, we're not gonna buy it.

960
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,520
because you just read this and let's go

961
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,540
every to go but it's not a good way

962
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,900
uh... so you guys can keep uh... going along uh...

963
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,400
and uh... let's do some random encounters

964
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
yes under water and the meekness

965
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,960
okay throughout a so i thought she could achieve skim out of the shadows

966
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,360
i've got a random encounter

967
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,440
okay so i didn't

968
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,640
So I think I saw a waffle mm-hmm

969
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:28,080
Okay, it's random. So yeah, are you still no wall bacon that midnight? Are you still in random?

970
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,480
I know exactly what that means. He's doing the Paris. Hell. Yeah, brother. Yeah, I've been chillin on the Periscope this whole time

971
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:40,400
Yeah, so you're looking in the Periscope and honestly, I'll be real. I'm licking it. You're looking in the Periscope. Also, is it hair?

972
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,920
And I'm hands-free

973
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:54,480
the white trail behind it. Yeah. My exhaust. That's the exhaust. You say sea exhaust? The

974
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,560
exhaust. Oh, I like sea exhaust. I like that term. So yeah, you're looking in the periscope

975
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:08,240
and... Licking in the periscope, yes. Licking in the periscope and you see about like, oh,

976
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,200
about like a couple hundred feet ahead of you, you start to see, you see a glowing,

977
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,360
It looks like it looks like a stick and as you get a little bit closer you realize it's it's a trident

978
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,240
stuck

979
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,580
Inside of some kind of like like rock formation. It's it's kind of bulbous and it's in the underwater

980
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:31,380
This is a water. We've seen that this is an underwater version of the first thing that ever happened to us

981
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:37,520
Didn't we bore there was a sword and uh and uh the first thing that happened us to a gather where there was a sword

982
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,800
And a rock was no sword. Oh, yes, there was a sword in the room

983
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,640
I don't know.

984
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,460
- And then we tried to pull-- - The first thing I remember

985
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,300
happening to me--

986
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,580
- I guess I'm just talking to you at this point, yeah.

987
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,660
- The first thing I remember happening to me

988
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,420
is waking up in a laboratory

989
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,260
and being made to eat a human.

990
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,500
(laughing)

991
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,860
- Oh yeah.

992
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,940
(laughing)

993
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,780
- That's, that's right.

994
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,620
- Okay.

995
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,420
- And the second thing I remember

996
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,660
is shitting it all out.

997
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,780
- Wow.

998
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,620
- That fat immediately? - I don't remember my life

999
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:12,620
before I turned into Chuggie, the singing submarine.

1000
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,700
- All right, well Chuggie,

1001
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,300
we're actually kind of having a conversation back here.

1002
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,300
- Well, I can hear everything you're saying

1003
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,960
'cause you're inside of me.

1004
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,260
- I don't think that's how that works,

1005
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,100
but I guess it is 'cause you do hear us.

1006
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,180
- The vibrations are rubbing off my wall.

1007
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,180
- Also, I'm not really sure how you--

1008
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,820
- My front wall, not my back wall.

1009
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,980
- If I have to, I'll decide that he can hear you.

1010
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,700
- Do you have a second mouth that kind of goes inward

1011
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,540
that lets us hear you?

1012
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,500
'cause otherwise you're just going,

1013
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,700
"Gloves, gloves, gloves."

1014
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,540
All right, I don't know.

1015
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,580
I wish I'd never said anything.

1016
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,740
(laughing)

1017
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,060
Anyway, so.

1018
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,820
- Yeah, but yeah, there was a sword in the rock monster

1019
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,740
and this seems to be exactly the same

1020
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,140
based on my memory that I have of my life.

1021
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,680
- Is that what you said?

1022
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,280
Rock lobster?

1023
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,700
I'm gonna be honest, I can't hear you that well.

1024
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,180
(laughing)

1025
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,060
- Oh, can Chuggie see this thing out there?

1026
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,500
- Yeah, Chuggie, you can see this.

1027
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,780
By the way, there's a trident in a stone.

1028
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,620
- I see that.

1029
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,660
Now, Chuggie, will you go and try to maybe bite that?

1030
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,740
- I'm gonna ram into it at full force.

1031
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,300
- All right, well, let's go.

1032
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,100
- And then bite it.

1033
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,020
And then try and go backwards at the same force.

1034
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,300
- Try your dental.

1035
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,620
I get tri-dental.

1036
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,780
- I have teeth like a whale.

1037
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,300
- What Chuggie would know is that the trident

1038
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,460
works kind of well. What Chuggie would know is that the trident is far enough down, you

1039
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,300
know, it's sort of like a diagonal from you, but it's far enough down that it would start

1040
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,260
to apply pressure on you if you did it. So you can go down there and ram it, but if you

1041
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,100
don't, you know, if you're there for longer than a minute, it could start to...

1042
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:58,140
This is exactly a trap we have seen before, and we're gonna go into, we're gonna go get

1043
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,780
crushed while we fall for the same trap.

1044
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,100
These are all opportunities.

1045
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:09,340
I want Chuggie to die so badly that I have so much to do with Chuggie you can't kill him.

1046
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:15,820
I mean you're about to kill him ramming into this thing Chugster.

1047
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,820
Do whatever you want to do.

1048
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,820
What would Chuggie do?

1049
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,740
Yeah Chuggie's in control here.

1050
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,740
Yeah Chuggie.

1051
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,940
If Chuggie would just ram into it he should.

1052
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,380
So it's going to apply pressure.

1053
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,440
How much pressure?

1054
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
So you'll be fine.

1055
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
I says here 100 points of pressure.

1056
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
You'll be fine for a minute down there.

1057
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
100% pressure.

1058
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:36,200
there okay so I mean like running into it you know that's gonna be you look can I

1059
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,440
swim down normally at it I'll be fine no I mean you'll still have the pressure

1060
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:51,440
applying to you it's a matter of the level goes down like like 10 feet every

1061
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,280
month then he'll get his body yes yes if you go down 10 feet every month you'll

1062
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,240
I'm gonna go down 10 feet every bumps all right

1063
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,320
I'm sure I'm trapped in his body

1064
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:09,680
Nothing they can do I shall kill me and I don't know how much rations you guys have I mean I'll fucking eat his spit

1065
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,520
I don't care seems like all rationality is departed. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm not gonna go towards that trident

1066
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,200
I think it's a mirage. Do you have a big frog tongue where he gets and just grab it no, okay?

1067
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,600
well I guess I get trick looks so hopefully it patches for one second

1068
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,680
okay do I have

1069
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:42,200
they can go down like one hour right well but the pressure will be even worse

1070
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,600
the pressure the pressure it still happens stuff here but you have

1071
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,920
abilities I just this is I mean okay here's what I here's what I say right

1072
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,840
The the worst possible thing that can happen here is we all die and we have to make new characters

1073
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,000
The best thing that could possibly happen is maybe we get a trident

1074
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,200
And I feel like that's not a great risk reward

1075
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,240
Spread going on there. I'm looking at my well

1076
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,080
I will say okay what I will say is the pressure

1077
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,900
Damage is not so much that it's gonna just kill you if you take damage from it

1078
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:17,400
Like it'll do it'll do damage, but it won't just kill you outright like and you would be able to swim up also

1079
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,600
You know what I mean? It's not like it's not like it's are you gonna light the paper on fire?

1080
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:28,360
I just realized I'm I looked at my later looked at my character sheet. Apparently I'm immune to disease. Did you guys know that?

1081
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Yes, you are

1082
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,520
Paladins are immune to disease you have resistance to poison also

1083
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,620
Not you Steve-o does. Can I use um, what's up? Can I use find traps?

1084
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:49,760
If you have that spell cast that at the second level yes, let's uh wait to you. Where is that on your spell list?

1085
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
I mean, I have jack of all trades

1086
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,080
I have jack of all trades, and I think it says that I can add a proof half my proficiency bonus

1087
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:04,200
Well, that is added to Oh guys ability check it says right here. I don't I have intelligence

1088
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,840
I don't have I don't have fine traps on I have it on my child

1089
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,400
You haven't asked so you don't have that prepared. That's one of the spells you can prepare though. I have to peeper this

1090
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,040
You have to not gonna do that. Yeah, I mean so I mean looking at your spells which I have these are no

1091
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,580
Yeah, you have stuff you've prepared and stuff you haven't prepared what you can I mean you can also I forgot you have anime

1092
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,580
I guess I'll just

1093
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,600
Run an investigation, but yeah, I mean you guys can just get close to close enough to it that you can start to investigate it

1094
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,680
Maybe just go around it. All right. Yeah, can we get close enough that I can invest? Yeah, but without

1095
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,280
Yeah, I chose you go pull up about just whenever you start

1096
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:46,180
75 feet tall whenever you feel that pressure in your ears, you know pull up on the gas pedal. Yeah, okay

1097
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,180
You just know how to do it. All right, you guys get it

1098
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,280
I go 99 feet guys get about closer as you get closer to it. Wait 99 feet

1099
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,860
Well, I start to feel the pressure at 99 feet

1100
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:01,840
I mean, it's up to I'm not giving exact feet measurement here, but I would say I guess now I'll have to

1101
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,840
so

1102
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,440
If we're talking like I said, you're about 200 feet away

1103
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,720
I'd like to get an exact feet measure on patches and oil those things up and

1104
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,320
If you're in six and a half you're approaching

1105
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,800
Yeah, I was gonna say

1106
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,960
That's how all birds measures

1107
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:43,960
We're talking about here you are you are whoops we rolled a one on our authentication check

1108
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,080
We're heading into town to visit the blacksmith for repairs very cool D&D beyond. It was a funny website

1109
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,500
Yeah, hilarious, so if you go you're gonna if you're going 75 feet at the diagonal like I'd say you can go about like

1110
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,960
80

1111
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,960
No, because then

1112
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,300
About a hundred yes, you can go a hundred feet and when you're 50 feet away at the diagonal if you go any further than that

1113
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,720
Like lower so I could go 50 feet and then let them go down

1114
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,280
But if they go down, they'll know it's gonna be worse for us than it is for you

1115
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,060
Let's not to feel the pressure, but you're gonna feel the pressure, but you're close enough at that point and the it's that you can start

1116
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:24,200
To investigate it reasonably. I mean I will adjust because you're not right next to it. Okay, you are also pet

1117
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,200
I feel like your body is so much more

1118
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:33,540
For pressure than ours is mm-hmm. You're a big submarine. All right, then. I'll go we're tiny little I will go 75 feet

1119
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:38,880
You can go so you can go a bit closer. I'll say here's here's what I think I think that makes sense

1120
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,880
So what we should probably do is

1121
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,200
You can go a bit closer than them so we can get you about 25 feet from it

1122
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:52,440
Yeah, and then if you go any closer though, like you will have about two minutes in your submarine form

1123
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,240
Yeah, he's rolling away on the rolly. I know I gave him the really rolly chair

1124
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,680
But you guys can both investigate too, so I mean it's up to you guys

1125
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:06,660
I'm gonna I want to roll my investigation. Yeah, you roll your investigation. You can have advantage if there if cams helping you

1126
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,660
Oh, okay, I'll give you

1127
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:15,380
Yes, okay, wait that was a 19. There's a 10. Oh, and what was that 10 and a 3 so what's my?

1128
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,460
12 12 okay cool so from what you can tell with a 12

1129
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,120
Is that yeah the faint red glowing you were seeing on the Trident?

1130
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,520
Yeah, we're actually just seeing it around the tip which is sticking out of the why did I think you said it was green?

1131
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,420
I don't know that it was gold. It's what I thought it was. I thought it was white and gold

1132
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:39,840
All right, well, we're I'm a bad. I'm bad at describing you things I guess so it's a red

1133
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,160
Glowing around sort of where I thought it said laurel the spikes

1134
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,320
grid the pokers

1135
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,880
Tongues one of those calls

1136
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
And then you can also see with that 12

1137
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,480
But the rock is sort of soft on that top part like it's kind of like unstable

1138
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:03,400
Where it's that looks like a crab's head. I do think this might be a creature. Yeah, I think it's up

1139
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
I think there as there ever

1140
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Hmm has there ever been a creature like this yes, really?

1141
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,920
Okay, cuz I've seen it. I feel like I said it before a few times

1142
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,200
We've already seen a creature like this - yeah, and I'm gonna turn around

1143
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,320
You cannot quite tell if it's a creature. I'm gonna turn around I tell

1144
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:30,120
Saw creature that was exactly this I don't feel like I'm going crazy recycling ideas. God is recycling ideas

1145
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,960
Making them under water

1146
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:41,000
Schizophrenia right now because I saw a pattern in my life completely turn around and I'm gonna shoot as much as

1147
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,960
We got a head that way we got to go to berry berry no, I mean I'm turning back up

1148
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,360
up. Okay, you're going up. All right. That's yeah. What is he lives his life

1149
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,480
three dimensionally. So avoiding the triangle big whale, you're avoiding the

1150
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,200
trident and you guys keep going and we'll roll for another random and can

1151
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,440
better not be another trident. This time. It's a it's a it's a spear and a

1152
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,920
stone. You this much if that if the next one's a trident, I'm beating it. I

1153
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,800
thought that was right now. Now that we will pass it by. Was it a creature and

1154
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,200
I'm going to whoop it. No, I'm not going to tell you this. I'll tell you

1155
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,860
anymore and the next was a lot of them whooping it

1156
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:23,300
you know who you're gonna want to slide on it i'm not gonna tell you for the

1157
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,160
creature

1158
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,640
that when you can tell us if it's my it was not it was not a creature

1159
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,520
who is a different is the next one our ops

1160
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,200
we are you saw our ops

1161
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,740

1162
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,000
here's a year i see my opto almost slide

1163
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,200

1166
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,360
My op is going to get a knuckle sandwich.

1167
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,360
[laughter]

1168
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,360
Fisticuffs with the op again.

1169
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,360
How do I introduce this one?

1170
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,360
This will be weird.

1171
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,360
Kickboxing my op though.

1172
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,360
Ten paces at noon, op.

1173
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,360
Dude, if I see my op, I'm throwing down my gauntlet.

1174
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,360
We're jousting.

1175
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,360
We're jousting at dawn.

1176
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Okay, that's fair.

1177
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
So yeah, you guys keep swimming along.

1178
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,360
Got my op doing at Charleston with my girl.

1179
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,360
Biting my thumb at my op.

1180
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,260
at least not swimming along, but sailing along.

1181
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,880
It goes by kind of uneventful, it seems like.

1182
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,720
- Okay.

1183
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,040
- I hate events.

1184
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,360
- And like hours go by.

1185
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,200
- Okay.

1186
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,040
- It's uneventful.

1187
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,000
- Time loop, time loop, Groundhog Day.

1188
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,480
I killed myself.

1189
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,600
- 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.

1190
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,240
Take one down, pass them around.

1191
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,120
- When you do start to notice.

1192
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,520
- No one else is singing with me.

1193
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,280
is that it has not changed from night to day.

1194
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,680
- Oh my God, oh my God.

1195
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,360
- Holy fuck dude, you are readable.

1196
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,960
This guy's got you at every turn.

1197
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,440
- I deserve a trophy.

1198
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,280
- You do deserve a trophy.

1199
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,440
- That's two in a row.

1200
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,800
That was, okay.

1201
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,640
- Well, I mean, you could try--

1202
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,460
- I knew it.

1203
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,760
- You could try to kill yourself though.

1204
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,360
(laughing)

1205
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,000
- Wait, so we've noticed that it doesn't go

1206
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,080
from day to night.

1207
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,920
- Night to day. - Night to day.

1208
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,240
- It's been night. - The lonely stoner

1209
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,200
seems to free his mind at night.

1210
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,160
- And when Chuggy goes up for--

1211
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,640
- And that's a song I wrote.

1212
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,480
If Chuggy goes up for air, it is still night.

1213
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,560
- Okay.

1214
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,080
But it's been well over 12 hours, yes.

1215
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,880
- Hmm.

1216
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,720
- We should go back to the triangle.

1217
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,720
- I think we might be in some kind of night world.

1218
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,760
- Groundhog's night.

1219
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,760
- Hmm.

1220
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,400
- Wait, is it groundhog's night tonight?

1221
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,240
Now that I think about it.

1222
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,080
- What the hell's a groundhog?

1223
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:32,960
- It's an animal. - Groundhog.

1224
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,200
- I've heard of a groundworm.

1225
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,720
- I only know sea pigs.

1226
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,560
- I've heard of a sea pig.

1227
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,560
- I've heard of a yardworm.

1228
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,160
(laughing)

1229
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:47,200
part of a ground hob. No, okay, so there seriously won't be a creature called

1230
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,460
cannot. You know, I mean, this is all I got. I'm just gonna roll

1231
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,680
investigation again. Can I can I also roll and get a real investigation? Can I

1232
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,000
look up at the night sky and roll an investigation specifically looking up

1233
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,880
there? Of course you can. Okay, all right, I'm gonna twist your hair is

1234
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,600
getting twisted and now it's kind of a top knot and we're looking directly up.

1235
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,560
Okay, I'm gonna help him. Yeah, I'm holding on to his back like I'm riding a

1236
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,200
motorcycle with him I got a 21 looks in the periscope looking up at the night

1237
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:21,120
sky what you start to notice is that the stars underneath it are like billowing

1238
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:27,840
out and kind of like it's like the sky is physical so it looks like instead like

1239
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:34,600
the stars are shifting but it's like we got guys we got eaten by a giant creature

1240
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,600
and he's got a night belly.

1241
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
(laughter)

1242
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,600
Not again for me!

1243
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,600
That's my guess.

1244
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
Okay, do I notice anything else?

1245
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,600
I mean, you've noticed...

1246
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,600
you've definitely noticed that there's something organic above you.

1247
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Which one of us has the longest range gun again?

1248
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,600
I don't even know what weapons I have.

1249
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
I got the blunderbuss, I think.

1250
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,600
Because whoever got the rifle should shoot upwards.

1251
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:08,800
I guess one of us died and doesn't have that gun that we used to have.

1252
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,560
I think he had the longest range one too.

1253
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,560
My gun isn't on here.

1254
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,320
Yeah, and put your guns on there.

1255
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,080
I have a disguise kit.

1256
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,880
Well, I guess I'll just shoot.

1257
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,000
What I will say, I should have the gun info here, I apologize.

1258
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,840
It's been a minute since we've done gun stuff.

1259
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,840
I have dark vision.

1260
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,000
Does that help me at all with seeing anything about the night sky?

1261
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,840
No, it just helps you see.

1262
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,840
Oh, fuck off.

1263
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:39,200
It just helps you that when it's dark you can see, um, it becomes dim light rather than

1264
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
total darkness.

1265
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,200
Okay, alright.

1266
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,200
Fair enough.

1267
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:48,760
Can I use, um, hmm, can I use detect magic?

1268
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,880
Oh, uh, yeah, you certainly can.

1269
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
Yeah.

1270
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,680
I will also say, what do I have here for the guys?

1271
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,680
There's musket.

1272
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,680
I also have.

1273
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,440
There's only a 30 foot sphere though.

1274
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,440
Right here I have, um.

1275
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,280
Oh, I mean, you can still try it.

1276
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,280
This one's good. I think I could use this.

1277
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,280
Um, detect peppermint.

1278
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
[laughter]

1279
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,280
Um, is one of the

1280
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,280
thaumaturgy things making light or am I

1281
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,280
like, it doesn't have a list of what the things are.

1282
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,280
I can't remember. Uh, thaumaturgy, I think one of them

1283
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,280
is light. I mean, he has prestidigitation

1284
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,280
too. Yeah, I also have um

1285
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,280
Chuggy would have to turn into his, one of his

1286
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,280
human forms to use any of his abilities

1287
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,280
or combat though. Um, I'm gonna use

1288
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,280
detect magic. Okay, cool.

1289
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,280
Uh, you don't have to... What does shatter do?

1290
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,280
I don't have to roll for that.

1291
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,280
Can I make stuff shatter?

1292
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,280
Yeah, make stuff go boom boom.

1293
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,280
Wait, wait, wait.

1294
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,280
What if I try to shatter a star?

1295
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,280
You can just detect magic.

1296
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,280
You...

1297
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,280
don't detect magic.

1298
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,280
30 feet above you, below you,

1299
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,280
or around you.

1300
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,280
You don't detect any type of magic.

1301
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,280
What about in my heart?

1302
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,280
What about in my heart? You're sitting next to it.

1303
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,280
Yeah, you detect magic in him.

1304
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,600
him because he's a changer. That makes sense. But I don't ask. I don't feel like you're lying.

1305
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,240
I mean you don't really detect any magic. You don't detect any spells being used or any like

1306
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:16,080
magical things being used. Hmm. Detect. I have detect good and evil. Do that. Yeah do

1307
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,320
that. We can see if it's good or evil. I'm going to do that. That is divine sense. And

1308
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:26,080
that's within 60 feet. What if it's a bigger whale? You don't detect any evil. Okay what

1309
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,080
about good. What does that mean? That's not fair.

1310
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:35,920
Good and evil is a no. Even though we haven't talked about it, we've mostly noticed that

1311
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,160
it's a yes or no. Neutral? There's no neutral. It's a yes or no. You don't detect good or

1312
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:49,480
evil. Okay. I detect neutral. You know what he's saying? It's a neutral whether or not

1313
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,960
you detect good. I have a new theory. My new theory is that there's actually a different

1314
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,240
thing but it's just on top of us and it's just like a basically a giant tarp but

1315
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,720
it's I think it's alive though yeah it seems I think it's alive though maybe

1316
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,880
okay I use thumb a beauty I'm used thumb I don't even I don't say I'm doing this

1317
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,840
but instantly just use thumb and turn you to make the loudest noise possible

1318
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,160
Oh did you see if I can try to make a ripple and or startle it if it is alive

1319
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,600
okay and I'm not I'm not betraying I'm like in the middle and like yeah I think

1320
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:27,600
think and I think that we and then it's a freak out Chuggie and yeah you see that

1321
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,840
thing up there it's a thing up there you see it like fucking quiver for a second

1322
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:37,240
and Chuggie you being a little bit further out with your eyes you know holy

1323
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:42,080
shit you're looking up you can see that it has some kind of head over there whoa

1324
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:47,000
and it looks like there's like a you just said over there like in front of

1325
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,000
him

1326
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
That's too hot for overwear.

1327
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,880
Wrong neck and like a human kind of head.

1328
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,880
It's got a human head?

1329
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,880
Damn.

1330
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,480
How big, can we see an end to it or does it just reach to the horizon?

1331
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,480
Yeah, can we tell how far up it is?

1332
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,480
How far up it is?

1333
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,480
I mean, it's like...

1334
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,480
Hello?

1335
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,960
I mean, it doesn't respond when you say hello.

1336
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,960
Bitch!

1337
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,960
A human head.

1338
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,960
That's scary.

1339
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,960
This thing's cool.

1340
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,960
This is like the coolest creature you've ever made.

1341
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,960
Yeah, it's really cool.

1342
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,960
So we're inside of it?

1343
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,960
I think we're just under it.

1344
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,960
No.

1345
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,960
Yeah.

1346
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,640
- Yeah, you can now tell-- - It's like a dome.

1347
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,360
- You, Chuggy, would be able to--

1348
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,860
- It's like a dome with a head on the under inside.

1349
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:30,700
- It's like a--

1350
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,060
- Is the head upside down or upside right?

1351
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,640
- Well, after the big boom,

1352
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,960
Chuggy, you would see the neck crane down

1353
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,800
and the head sort of just like look at you.

1354
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,200
And then just like dead eye. - It shivers.

1355
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,000
- This is honestly just, this is good.

1356
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
- Thank you. - Yeah.

1357
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,520
- Every once in a while.

1358
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,520
- You still got it.

1359
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,360
- Hey, yeah.

1360
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:58,080
Hell of this thing and you guys could see it inside of the thing it is just like

1361
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:10,000
What if I go backwards

1362
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,960
Maybe we get what?

1363
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:18,360
Surface, what do you mean up? We're on the surface. We're gonna try to find we need to go away from you notice

1364
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,560
you're like

1365
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,040
Chuggy's like confusingly, he's like, "Well, why don't we go?"

1366
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,280
That's very funny. As you notice the uh...

1367
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:34,240
I thought we were under something. As that thing notices you and notices you noticing it, you start to see its jaw unhinge

1368
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,360
Very slowly and he's getting ready to say something

1369
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,960
Maybe he's gonna sing with me

1370
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,720
islands in the stream, that is what we hope.

1371
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,520
- From the periscope, you can see the stars start to part.

1372
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,160
- Yuck.

1373
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,040
- And the innards start to be revealed

1374
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,360
and you start to feel it, it's starting to descend.

1375
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,360
So Chuggie, you have to make a move.

1376
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,600
- Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down, go down.

1377
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,720
- I'm gonna get eaten by the scary shit.

1378
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,040
- I guess I'm going down.

1379
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,600
Yeah, okay, you go, you dart down, it starts to chase you.

1380
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,440
we're gonna have to do some rolls for this.

1381
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,400
- When you say chase, like it like is descending faster now?

1382
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,440
- It's descending faster down while Chuggy's,

1383
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,000
like Chuggy's going down and this thing is going like,

1384
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,200
built like an umbrella right now.

1385
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,120
- Yes, okay. - Yeah.

1386
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,920
- Like kind of like just charging down

1387
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,880
with its mouth head first and then like trying to,

1388
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,080
what it's ideally gonna try to do is latch on to Chuggy

1389
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,240
and then sort of move its body around and inhale you.

1390
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,440
- Damn. - What?

1391
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,880
- I got it. - A 20?

1392
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,200
- Yep. - I didn't tell you

1393
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,280
what to roll for, but that is really good.

1394
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,040
That is basically what I was, I was basically gonna ask you to do athletics rolls.

1395
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,840
So, I mean this thing's gonna try to keep up.

1396
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,340
It has very-

1397
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:49,840
What's a 20?

1398
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,340
It has very good athletics. I mean if it also gets a 20-

1399
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,740
I'm gonna roll whether or not I pee my pants from fear.

1400
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,340
So yeah, you got a crit 20.

1401
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,340
I got 13.

1402
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:57,840
Oh, nice.

1403
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,840
I don't pee much though.

1404
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,840
Yeah, so you, with a crit 20-

1405
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:05,840
I do a, I do a, I'm doing a roll to see if I unleash poop.

1406
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,840
For a crit 20, you're able to like just-

1407
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,840
I got a 3.

1408
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,440
Chuggy has escaped many captors before in Chuggy's life of being experimented on.

1409
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,340
And so he is able to just like on instinct, once you realize what's going on,

1410
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:23,340
you're like *pffft* like just start darting down as this thing is like coming closer and closer towards you.

1411
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:31,840
And you're able to get away for the most part until you reach a point where you're almost at your pressure level.

1412
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,840
So here's the thing.

1413
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:42,840
If you go, you can go, you can keep going further down and you just have to like maintain your, like you have to just maintain speed to get away from it.

1414
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:48,840
That's just gonna be one of the roll, it's gonna be a lower, a lot lower of a DC because you got a crit 20 on just getting away from it at this point.

1415
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,840
'Cause it will be able to follow you lower than you can go.

1416
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,840
So you'll have to kinda like hit your pressure level and then just bolt ahead to get away fully.

1417
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,840
So again, it's a lower DC to get away at this point.

1418
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,840
So yeah, you just gotta roll again. Let's put it that way.

1419
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,540
Why don't we just-

1420
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:10,340
Okay, I can't play that as it lies, 'cause it's gone too far.

1421
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,340
Yes, let's just get another d20.

1422
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,940
Let's roll, let's roll nice this time.

1423
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,340
Oh my god, that's pretty bad.

1424
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,340
But, what is your athletics?

1425
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,640
I mean, you can also do acrobatics.

1426
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,440
Will it help even though?

1427
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,440
Oh, it's pretty bad.

1428
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,240
He died again.

1429
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,840
Instantly.

1430
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,340
You're not gonna die.

1431
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:33,740
Don't worry. You got a crit 20 on getting away from this thing. So even though he got a three this time

1432
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:39,400
You do you what what really happens here is you manage to get pretty far away, but this thing does

1433
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,500
as it's getting closer and closer and

1434
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:49,860
Like it does latch on to you. It's like human head like like bites onto your light

1435
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:54,180
Onto the periscope. So you guys see the head like oh

1436
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,980
scared I pin okay wait real quick wait wait the periscope is hair oh yeah so

1437
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,260
he's all I need is a haircut

1438
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:12,180
we need people line me up from the inside from the inside I need you to line me up

1439
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:22,140
I can't allow this. It's very funny though. In a better game that would be more possible

1440
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,680
So you he bites onto your flesh hair thing yeah you guys see like the face

1441
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:33,900
like like just like grab on and its body now is gonna whip around and it is gonna

1442
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:41,460
make an attack I mean it did very poorly so it so your body is able to sort of

1443
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:47,100
get away and then roll a roll a strength just a strength check so we'll just add

1444
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,440
your strength which is not very good five you're not able to get away you're

1445
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,660
Thrashing about this thing's gonna try to attack you again try to bite you again

1446
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:59,240
Boy, I need you to get out of me and fight this thing. No. Thank you. It's too scary

1447
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:07,620
I got some why are you rolling it on to that cuz cuz it's full okay? You rolled how many times no no?

1448
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:12,600
This is the only role that counts okay. Well. We got the same role. Yeah, so it still misses the attack

1449
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,920
Are you saying unfortunately for me? Well is it do you want that one to kill us? It's fun fuck

1450
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,920
What the fuck? Why do we keep getting fives?

1451
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,920
You didn't even roll that, you just threw it down.

1452
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:27,920
So here's the thing, you guys do have an opportunity to try to cast something if you want to try something.

1453
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,920
I mean, this thing's now been thrashing about.

1454
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,920
You guys have to kill this thing.

1455
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,920
Now keep in mind, you can see it, it's interesting. I wonder...

1456
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,920
I'm using dreadful aspect.

1457
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,920
Does it require you to see the target, is my question?

1458
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,920
Because you saw it with the periscope.

1459
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,920
Technically you can see with the periscope, you see it's like lips and...

1460
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,340
it's like it's it's a target creature that can see me so I'm gonna put my face

1461
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:55,840
up to the porthole and okay cool does make a window a scary aspect of every

1462
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,000
each creature of my choice that can see me within 30 feet must make a wisdom

1463
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,640
saving throw on failure it's frightened and it has to move very cool okay so

1464
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,840
we'll roll for that um very good move it's a wisdom saving throw yeah did we

1465
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,840
We didn't roll initiative right?

1466
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,120
No, not yet. I should have done that for turn order

1467
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,640
But I'm basically just basing it off of that was happening back and forth and you can go after I mean it's saved

1468
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,560
You saw like seven okay plus its wisdom so damn, but I mean it was a good that was a good idea

1469
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,440
Okay, what did you try to do? What you did dreadful aspect? Did you like?

1470
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:37,160
Yeah, cuz it's so scary. I think maybe a funny. Yeah, right out face might be scary - we need a little levity to this

1471
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:41,280
situation. Can I, I would like to cast blindness and deafness on this thing. Oh,

1472
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,600
very cool. What does that do? It's a wisdom saving throw, right? I can't read.

1473
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,840
There's, it doesn't say anything. It says the spells. Do you have a spell thing for that? No, I didn't get a spell thing. I'm just, I just know that I have

1474
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,560
that. Yeah, I rely too much on. None of my spells are actually listed on any of these. Oh man, I'm

1475
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,920
pretty sure. Oh, blindness and deafness, it says right here. Con 13. What does it say?

1476
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,080
It's constitution? Oh, I guess that makes more sense. Yeah, 13 because of his spell

1477
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,160
casting modifier uh... so it has to say that's a thirteen

1478
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,480
against its constitution which is fairly high so this would have to be pretty bad

1479
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,880
all but it was going to be bad

1480
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,720
uh... and by the definition of the probably have to see if you can do the

1481
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,360
same thing you go to the portal

1482
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,320
the

1483
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:25,280
to do a lot of it so that turns it up

1484
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,680
goggles on

1485
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,800
yeah i know it's able to say okay i'm taking the portal back in a missing

1486
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,600
dreadful aspect again before that happens

1487
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,240
will go back to the top of the or established on

1488
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,280
and you you already tried to get away to try to attack you now

1489
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,680
it's doing very poorly all right

1490
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,920
you know i don't get away

1491
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,320
it's gonna start that's in between rolling here

1492
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,180
you here

1493
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,760
what is this

1494
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,400
with the same number still act in it

1495
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,520
so pretty bad uh... okay like uh... i mean i need to go again to get rid of

1496
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,760
last week to get here

1497
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,920
here for you for a few months and i was just not a still slow

1498
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,800
can trip

1499
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,920
or wait well it's gotta be a spell slot

1500
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,920
uh... so it's just a thing

1501
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,240
and then it has an action each creature of your choices that know it's a channel

1502
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:21,200
divinity. Oh, how many do you have? Wait, do I have another? No, I don't have another. Wait,

1503
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:26,160
where does it say I have one? I thought I had more than one. Isn't it the same as one per

1504
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:33,160
short rest? Yeah. Okay, I take a short rest. No, I'll cast a spell. I forgot I have fucking

1505
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,880
spells. I can't do anything. You can't do anything while you're a submarine. I see my

1506
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:44,880
spell. Stop taking my spells away from me. I'm sorry. I guess I will do... Wait, can I?

1507
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,880
I have a message.

1508
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,880
What's up with Crown of Madness?

1509
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,880
It's a wisdom saving throw. It does damage.

1510
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,880
I don't think it...

1511
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,880
Let me make sure. It's wisdom, right?

1512
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,880
Is there anything that can make something scared?

1513
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,880
A ghost?

1514
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,680
Maybe Zone of Truth might help us.

1515
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,680
Nothing's scarier than the truth.

1516
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:22,680
I don't think Count of Madness actually does fear.

1517
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,680
I don't think I have anything I can really do here.

1518
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,680
The other thing you could do, I mean you would have to, you could...

1519
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,680
I'll just use Thaumaturgy again and make a loud noise right at it and see if it can,

1520
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,680
if it's, because it seemed to spook it a little bit the first time.

1521
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,680
Yeah, you can do that again.

1522
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,680
I'm gonna try that.

1523
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,680
Yeah, you use Thaumaturgy, you make another loud noise at it,

1524
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:45,760
a little bit off. So, Patrick, why don't you try to get away again.

1525
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,360
Not my name. I'm so sorry.

1526
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,360
Chuggy. Bro.

1527
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
I'm sorry. Bro.

1528
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,560
Wow. That was really insensitive of me. I'll let you try to get away again before it takes

1529
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,880
its turn. With Domitry.

1530
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,080
19. There we go.

1531
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,160
Yo. You're able to rest free. You're still going

1532
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,480
to take some damage. Also the loud noise that made was a fart noise.

1533
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,680
Nice. That's funny as fuck.

1534
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,680
That's that levity I was talking about earlier.

1535
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,680
Okay, you take...

1536
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,680
21 damage from the whole encounter.

1537
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,680
From basically ripping your...

1538
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,680
I only have 7 HP.

1539
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,680
No, you have 28 HP.

1540
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,680
So you now have 7 now.

1541
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,680
Yeah, yeah.

1542
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,680
Holy crap.

1543
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,680
Yeah, that thing is a very good move.

1544
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,680
Very good instincts to be like, "We shouldn't get out and fight this thing."

1545
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,680
"We should just do what we can to get away from it."

1546
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:41,580
Yeah, we got away. Yeah, nice. Basically like oh man, I'm beat

1547
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,760
And so am I

1548
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:51,980
Wait real real quick. I do I do that did put up build up a bunch of peepee in me

1549
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:56,280
Where do we pee in and poop and chuggy just do it wherever?

1550
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,400
All right

1551
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:08,800
Yeah, and there's the and that's all folks close. Yeah, you guys pooping and peeing. Yeah inside of your new friend

1552

1553
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,420
Comes in it and it is off the the poop like oh, that's really good

1554
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,920
Yeah, no sometimes where that were like porky the pig will maybe pull it back open. That's I sticking my penis through

1555
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,920
You're peeing next to my asshole open. I pull the hole open and I'd pee

1556
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:37,040

1557
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,320
