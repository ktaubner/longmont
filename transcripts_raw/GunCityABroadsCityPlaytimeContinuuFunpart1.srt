1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ho ho ho!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,680
A merry Gun City Christmas to one and all!

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,440
It's me, Santa Patches!

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,160
I'm here to bring you some holiday cheer.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,880
I hope you have your favorite Christmas cybernetic enhancement and hot cocoa at the ready, because

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,280
Because today is a very special episode of Gun City.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,080
Because not only is it Christmas, but we're on TV!

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,880
Hi Mom!

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Hi Mrs. Claus!

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
I'll see you later tonight.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
Gonna fuck you for first it's Christmas Eve!

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
Wait, did you say you were gonna fuck your mom?

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
You said you were gonna fuck your mom.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
Your mom is also technically Mrs. Claus.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Your mom's name, Mrs. Claus.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
I guess that's right.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
Your Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus is also your mom's name.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
I guess that's right.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
I guess that's right.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
I guess that's right.

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
I guess that's right.

22
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
I guess that's right.

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
I guess that's right.

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
I guess that's right.

25
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
I guess that's right.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
I guess that's right.

27
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
I guess that's right.

28
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
I guess that's right.

29
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Oh my god is Mrs. Claus Santa's mom the whole time?

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
But first, it's Christmas Eve!

31
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Shhh!

32
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,880
All the good little boys and girls, and worse, are asleep.

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Except for three very, very special ones.

34
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Patrick Yoda, Blotas Piss, and Ray William Johnson.

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Wide-eyed and breathless with excitement.

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Their...

37
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
[GASP]

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,680
Their friendship has taken them across the planet E-Bomb, all the way to jungle-infested

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,000
Earth, into the virtual world, and even into each other's penises.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh yeah.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And now, they're in space!

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,880
That's right, on Leo the Collector's, I mean King Leo of New England's, space station.

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,560
King Leo's Pleasure Palace, the finest space station of its kind, a city in and of itself,

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,120
and a perfect holiday getaway.

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,440
We'll get more on that though later.

46
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,160
But now it's time for something a little less interesting.

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,200
It's time to read some Christmas story classics.

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,920
Gun City Christmas story classics.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
Blotas, Ray, and Patrick each have

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,240
come prepared with their own Gun City Christmas tale to read.

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
And there are so many great ones to choose from.

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Another list joke here.

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
OK.

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,320
Frisky the Ho-Man, A Christmas Carol Baskins--

55
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,220
That's right, because Santa never forgets.

56
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,100
And Rodolfo, the red-nosed Latin king.

57
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,780
And to whom will they be reading these stories?

58
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,220
Well, they're reading them to the greatest gift of all,

59
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,820
a son created in a lab who is a penguin

60
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,700
with a water bottle jutting out of his head

61
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,440
that holds his brain.

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,860
And he's wearing a leather jacket, I think.

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,700
That's right.

64
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,580
- We should get figurines.

65
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,860
- It's New Sullivan.

66
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,860
- Oh yeah.

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,700
- Woo!

68
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,520
- Yeah!

69
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,360
- Yeah!

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
- New Sullivan!

71
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,020
- Woo!

72
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,860
- Yeah!

73
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,120
- Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,040
- Created in-- - Aw yeah!

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,260
- Created in the remote village of Hootown by our humble three

76
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,800
while on an adventure searching for the fabled N-word pass,

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,220
just so you know, he quickly became beloved by all.

78
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,040
(laughing)

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,160
Guess I almost wrote that right.

80
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,500
A college student who is also eternally four,

81
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,160
and forever silly, there's no one more fun

82
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,920
and more awesome than New Sullivan.

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
forever silly.

84
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Oh, would you look at the time.

85
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
I better get going.

86
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,160
I have to fly all over earth except for Syria to hand out toys to good little boys and girls.

87
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,080
Why don't you spend some time with our heroes on a relaxing, low-key holiday adventure in

88
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,680
a cozy Christmas hotel room.

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,600
Probably just what you need during your stressful, anxious, and very lonely holiday.

90
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,160
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho.

91
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,600
yeah so you guys are in a hotel room you're chillin with chillaxin new

92
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,640

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,280
Go Sullivan! Go Sullivan! Go Sullivan!

98
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,600
He's doing like a little side to side, he's trying to work it into a headspin.

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
And then that crack hits and what does he do?

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
He headspins even better.

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Holy crap.

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
So it's true. It makes you better at headspinning.

103
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,020
You guys are just sort of cheering on New Sullivan while he's doing his little dances.

104
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,020
That's all, let's do the wavering.

105
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
What presents, do you guys get presents for New Sullivan?

106
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,020
He doesn't have to know yet. You shouldn't tell him, obviously.

107
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
It's Christmas Eve. Yeah, I got a present for him.

108
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
What'd you get him? I got him a gift card.

109
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,460
Yeah, he's gonna last to where I got him a gift card to Target, okay

110
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:58,860
That sounds fine, I mean can't go wrong with a gift card to Target no I got him a sous vide a sous vide yeah

111
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,180
It's three hundred fifty dollars above and beyond this fucking. Yep. I got you a sous vide

112
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,260
I don't know if you know how to cook or anything, but uh I fucking hope you know

113
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,860
I really I really fucking hope you know how to cook I get a little I spent I went a little bit

114
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,700
out of my budget this Christmas and I'm really fucking hurting right now.

115
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,380
He's picking up on nothing. I get a little bit self-conscious about my gift card gifts.

116
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm like, "So the gift card, that's part of your gift, but the rest of it's actually in the mail right now. It'll be here soon."

117
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:40,000
I got him a sweater that you guys have seen me wear like a hundred times before and you're thinking like,

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Oh my he's giving him a sweater that he already owns that's a lame gift, and then I'm like look Sullivan

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,460
I got us matching sweaters, and I actually got him a brand new one of the one that I always wear my god

120
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,520
That's so fucking awesome. I take out the one I always wear and I put it on

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,520
I was really fucking hoping one of you got a I don't know like a vacuum sealer, so I got that too

122
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,020
Yeah, I also got him a vacuum sealer. Thank Christ because you can't really use it without that vacuum sealer

123
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,720
So yeah, he's fuck. He's uh he goes over to his little play area

124
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,560
He has his three favorite toys with him which are all action figures of you guys

125
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,860
Guys he's singing our song

126
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
- He's having so much fun.

127
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,320
- Yeah, he's having a good time.

128
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,160
(imitating a dog)

129
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,340
He turns around, he starts smiling,

130
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,640
he's like so happy to see you guys doing it back.

131
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,060
What are you guys, do you guys have any food around?

132
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,460
- I just cherish him.

133
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,700
- What are you guys eating?

134
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,120
- I'm eating his little button nose.

135
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,160
(imitating a dog)

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,120
- I'm snacking on some doubled eggs.

137
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
- What the hell's a doubled egg?

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,960
- It's from the future.

139
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
- It's a deviled egg that has a deviled--

140
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,120
- No, I don't want to break my brain if I hear what it is.

141
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
- Alright, it has a deviled egg filling.

142
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,200
- It's a egg from the future.

143
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,120
- What about you, do you have an egg?

144
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
- No, I'm just smoking crack.

145
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,040
- Okay, so yeah, Dusala goes there,

146
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,880
he kinda like tugs at your, like,

147
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,140
(grunting)

148
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,040
asking for the deviled egg or one deviled egg.

149
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,460
- He's saying up!

150
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,040
- Okay, I throw him up in the air.

151
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,960
(screaming)

152
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,320
And I catch him, and then I throw an egg up in the air

153
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,400
and I hold him out.

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
Does he catch the egg?

155
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,200
- I'm gonna roll actually to see if he does.

156
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
- I'm staring at Sullivan like the straight drop video.

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,360
Something about double-degs is they have a special type of gravity where they can be caught by anybody

158
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,820
Yeah, he rolled we rolled well. He rolled fine, and then we should be clear when we should be saying new Sullivan

159
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:42,760
Yeah, we don't want to confuse yeah, I I gave old Sullivan a hit of the crack pipe, and he is terrified

160
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,960
He's not here. Yeah. He's not here. No. No you guys you guys parted ways. Yeah, we haven't seen him in forever

161
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,660
Right yeah, I should have read up on the Lord. That's I should honestly make the lore available

162
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
I feel like to you guys.

163
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,660
But anyway, so yeah.

164
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,660
Somebody should make a wiki.

165
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Yeah.

166
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
It was made.

167
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,020
It was made and then it was updated a little bit.

168
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,580
Then I think it got deleted.

169
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,780
Somebody should not have deleted it so that I would have a resource.

170
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,220
Yeah, because I'm not good at providing information.

171
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,860
I ate one double dig.

172
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,820
Okay, well, New Solvent ate 15.

173
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,140
So New Solvent goes over and he starts like, "Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom."

174
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
He starts eating them.

175
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,140
He takes another hit at the crack pipe.

176
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
He's like going, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

177
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,860
It makes him able to eat more food.

178
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,060
Yeah, oh yeah, he has more of it, and then he sort of like lays back like

179
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:34,080
I look at him. I just what's wrong little buddy. I look at him. I'm paranoid as shit. He's got my hand on the wall

180
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,820
Stop it

181
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,080
And he goes he takes he takes a he takes his

182
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,380
His three favorite toys he puts them away in this little basket

183
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,380
He said good night, and he goes over to the bathroom

184
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,220
Say good night. That's cute. He goes. He made me not scared of crap anymore

185
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm gonna smoke some more and when he goes he goes over to the bathroom and

186
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,780
when he does you just

187
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,820
You feel a chill in the air

188
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,940
And the lights flicker just slightly at first and then

189
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,980
total darkness

190
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:30,780
So it goes, it's Kirk Vonnegut.

191
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,700
The arity bomb, drained of all its color and verve, saved the opalescent eyesore that is

192
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:45,140
a one-gun city. From up here on King Leo Space Station. It's a smoky mess of

193
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,620
nauseous light, artificial to its silicone bones and ugliness in its hot plastic

194
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:58,980
guts. But up here things are new too. Shiny, still derelict, still made from the

195
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,140
recycled parts of ancient attempts at similar space stations, but new. You'd

196
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,660
You'd think the trouble wouldn't follow any of us up here, but I'm telling you this tale

197
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,740
from beyond the grave.

198
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,260
There's a killer on this space station, and they go by playtime.

199
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,100
They usually look for childless couples.

200
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,900
They usually wait for one of the freak outages that occur on the space station.

201
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,700
They usually slit their throats, and when the lights come back, they've usually left

202
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,100
at the top, each victim's corpse, their favorite toy.

203
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,740
Could be a new video game, an action figure, a sex toy,

204
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
hell, it could be a book.

205
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,380
They somehow know.

206
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,420
Playtime always knows what your favorite toy is.

207
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,220
What was my favorite toy?

208
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,020
Well, I wasn't killed by Playtime.

209
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,340
There was a bit of popcorn kernel stuck between my teeth,

210
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,860
and I was really digging in there, trying to get it out.

211
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,900
And so my elbow hit the airlock, and I took about 100

212
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,020
people with me into the cold inky blackness of space.

213
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,820
I really liked Crazybones though if you want to know.

214
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,780
Now playtime he always kills his victims but he didn't this time.

215
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,620
Well we don't think he did.

216
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,540
But New Sullivan is gone.

217
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,900
Snatched from his hotel room during an idyllic Christmas Eve with his adoptive parents and

218
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,540
uncle.

219
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,040
They thought they were out of the game, Blotas, Ray, and Patrick.

220
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,500
They haven't solved a case in years.

221
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Actually, they've done several B&Es since then.

222
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,520
But up here, things are new, shiny, still degenerate, still made from the recycled parts

223
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,580
of ancient attempts at being funny, but still new.

224
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,340
And the trouble followed them up here, too.

225
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:54,660
So maybe it's time to don the hats, the silly voices, and the D20s.

226
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:08,860
time for gun city a broad city playtime continue fun that's good that is really

227
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:17,140
good Wow listen play time continue fun yeah no you have to go there so badass

228
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,500
yeah it's gonna just be a like Bill Hicks right now yeah I feel like bill I

229
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:32,580
feel like the white Bill Hicks. You do look exactly like that! The leather jacket? Yeah. Where'd you get that?

230
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:43,740
Bill Hicks store. Wow. Yeah, so you guys have been in your hotel room on Leo's Pleasure Palace for days,

231
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:50,340
months actually, completely despondent. You gotta get a little closer. Yeah, I have to get closer. Yeah, sorry.

232
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,880
So you guys have been in your hotel room for months, completely despondent after New Sullivan's

233
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
disappearance.

234
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Oh, we did a flash forward.

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Oh yeah, we're flash forward.

236
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Oh my god.

237
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Oh my god.

238
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Okay.

239
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Okay.

240
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Did I miss my birthday?

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
When is Ray William Johnson's birthday?

242
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
It's my birthday.

243
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,420
Okay, you didn't miss your birthday.

244
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
When is my birthday?

245
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,500
Your birthday's in April sometime, I don't remember what day.

246
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
What's the date though?

247
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I just told, I don't remember the date, I'm sorry.

248
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Alright.

249
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Alright.

250
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I know the date.

251
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I guess you can continue.

252
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
12th?

253
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
10th?

254
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
What are you gonna do, every single number?

255
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,140
It's the 17th, right?

256
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Real friend.

257
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
I knew that too.

258
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,420
I knew that because I used to have a Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 poster.

259
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,700
You should know that because I didn't memorize it.

260
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm a very close friend of yours.

261
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
No, that's why.

262
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,580
Because in my head, when I think of you, I think of Paul Blart.

263
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
April 17th, 2007.

264
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
I wish.

265
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,580
I wish I was 15.

266
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,200
Wish I wish I was

267
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,700
Well anyway, so

268
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:58,060
Christmas went by without a thought in your head New Year's even Martin Luther King Day didn't register

269
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,700
Probably because he's been dead for many years

270
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,900
probably thousands of years

271
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,740
300 roughly 300

272
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,460
Okay, but awaking yeah

273
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
Yeah, you could have remembered.

274
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,100
But awaking from your comatose state in this decidedly not holiday-themed campaign, you

275
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,180
have found a resolve to find playtime, stop his grisly murders, and most importantly,

276
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,460
recover your beloved son, New Sullivan, and nephew.

277
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Heard that.

278
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,460
Mm-hmm.

279
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Okay.

280
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,460
My nephew?

281
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,460
Your nephew, yeah.

282
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
They're the parents.

283
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,460
You're the uncle.

284
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Yes.

285
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Okay.

286
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,460
Oh, I remember this now.

287
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
I remember this now.

288
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
I repaid off all my debts.

289
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Mom, dad, yeah.

290
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Or does this take place before?

291
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,460
So, this falls canonically after...

292
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,460
This is after the heist, so you paid off your debts.

293
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
You guys were just here to celebrate Christmas.

294
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,460
You did your one last job, you solved your one last case.

295
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,460
You did your one last adventure.

296
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,460
So we're technically...

297
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
You thought you were done with all of this.

298
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
We're hiding.

299
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
No, no, no, no.

300
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,460
I thought we were in hiding.

301
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
No, wait, I'll explain.

302
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
At the end of the campaign.

303
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Okay, tell me more of the lore. I need to know.

304
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,460
The space station of Pleasure Palace was erected a few months

305
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,460
after you'd helped Leo the Collector locate the temple of Topenguin of Doom

306
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,460
and complete his epic toy collection with the N-Gage.

307
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,460
You guys were supposed to give him the N-word pass, but then it didn't...

308
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,460
I forgot that's what it was.

309
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,460
And then you guys were gonna give him a fake one.

310
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Times have changed.

311
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
Yeah, they sure have.

312
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Yeah, we don't do that kind of thing anymore.

313
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,460
It was so funny back then.

314
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Yeah.

315
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,460
Rude.

316
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,460
He first invaded Sky Ireland and turned the leprechauns into his slaves,

317
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,540
then used them along with his royal guard to continue invading the numerous sky

318
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,500
islands that exist above Gunn City and Planet E-Bomb. He had declared himself

319
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,020
king of the skies and struck a treaty with Gunn City including both the

320
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,100
government and the oligarchical board controlled primarily by Papi Chuko's

321
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,940
Technoslime Corporation. The relationship between King Leo and the city is

322
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,620
contentious but if they were ever go to war there'd be destruction you know all

323
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,980
this you know they don't want to do it so they they have proxy battles and they

324
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,980
We have a sort of healthy, unhealthy relationship, kind of.

325
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Okay.

326
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Yeah.

327
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
Cheers.

328
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Cheers.

329
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
I don't have a drink.

330
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Do you want one?

331
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
Yeah, I'll have a drink.

332
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Yeah, thank you, man.

333
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Alright.

334
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Continue?

335
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
Oh yeah.

336
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Crossing battles?

337
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
Yes, absolutely.

338
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Wait, now we gotta do a cheers again.

339
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
Oh yeah, hold on.

340
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Cheers.

341
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Wait, can we get the toy cam?

342
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Can you get the toy cam?

343
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Cheers.

344
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,980
Lower.

345
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Where do I should go?

346
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Cheers.

347
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,980
To Dungeons and Dragons.

348
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
Oh.

349
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
What the hell's happening?

350
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,980
What the hell's happening to your mouth?

351
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
Stop drinking like that!

352
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
That's not right.

353
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,980
That fucking freaked me out.

354
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
That's not befitting and it's not right.

355
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Alright. Anyway, um...

357
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Oh yeah, so, uh, all this is to say that after Leo had carved a significant enough portion of the land above for himself,

358
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,980
he took to space, where he could finally create his pleasure palace and include all the toys Leo the Collector,

359
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,260
before he was King Leo, has ever collected and wishes to be enjoyed by all for an astronomical

360
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,820
fee, political favor, or blackmail. Or in the rare case of you three, a combination of a

361
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,540
sizable chunk of change you got from your heist, but overall at a discount because Leo

362
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,100
actually kind of likes you guys. Though, since he's become king, you can't really get in

363
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,260
touch with him. He's sort of doing his own thing.

364
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,380
Ghoster. A little bit.

365
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,060
Still around in the future. Ghosting. Thought they'd have abolished it by then.

366
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,480
I thought it would have been criminally punished by death or worse

367
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,900
Yeah, we'll talk through what's in the pleasure palace as we explore it right now

368
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,860
You guys are in your hotel room in the resort the ten seasons

369
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:43,180
There's ten seasons on guys on planet. Okay list them winter spring summer fall salt pepper paprika

370
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,860
And then cumin and monsoon season

371
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,860
I thought about this.

372
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
God, he's good.

373
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
Wow.

374
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
Yeah, um, so yeah, you guys are in your hotel room.

375
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
Let's see where you guys are, actually.

376
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Okay.

377
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860

438
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,500
toy that I was able to find at the store. It was a dollar tree. And as you can see,

439
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,240
look at that holographic sticker that says "official licensee". You got that for a dollar?

440
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,240
And this was a dollar. So how are you going to fit that motherfucker in that little ass

441
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,860
room? My guy's big. If that's the size of a Yoda, this is the size of a guy. Come on

442
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,580
I'll take that.

443
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,080
Come on now.

444
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,580
I'll take that.

445
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,860
But I went out while I was at the store too.

446
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,500
We're going to play fast and loose a bit with the sizes as we'll soon learn.

447
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
You were at the...

448
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,180
So you just got everything at Dollar Tree.

449
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,460
What else did you get there?

450
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
Yeah, well I just got two things.

451
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,500
I got one toy for myself, but I knew Caleb was busy building all this stuff, so I decided

452
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
to get him a toy for his.

453
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
That's so kind of you.

454
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,860
Yeah, and I was like, "Oh, I really, really need it."

455
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,540
I just want to say one thing before you go any further.

456
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,900
I was in Manhattan for three hours looking for that.

457
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,460
I was in Dollar Tree for four hours deciding what DVDs to buy and I actually didn't buy any.

458
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
Ah, that's a buffer.

459
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,300
Damn, because they had some good ones there.

460
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,400
They do have some really good ones.

461
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
But I did get Kayla.

462
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I couldn't find...

463
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I had to get cold.

464
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I couldn't find...

465
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I had to get cold.

466
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I couldn't find...

467
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I had to get cold.

468
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I couldn't find...

469
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I had to get cold.

470
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I couldn't find...

471
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
I had to get cold.

472
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I couldn't find...

473
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
I had to get cold.

474
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I couldn't find...

475
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I had to get cold.

476
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I couldn't find...

477
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
I had to get cold.

478
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
I couldn't find...

479
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I had to get cold.

480
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I couldn't find...

481
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,680
You know what my character is?

482
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,280
That's Peppa the ballet dancer.

483
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,360
But my character is supposed to be a demon.

484
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,720
I brought a whole set of like...

485
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,560
We already showed this one so this one is kind of permanent.

486
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,160
I showed you all the ones that I brought earlier.

487
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
I was stressed out.

488
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
I was thinking about all the...

489
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
I can't even hold it.

490
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,000
I was thinking about all the different shit.

491
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,560
I was thinking about how to make him look super cool.

492
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,720
Come on, I had other shit on my mind.

493
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,440
I was showing you all of the things I brought.

494
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
No, you know what?

495
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440

And pull the trigger and kill me.
