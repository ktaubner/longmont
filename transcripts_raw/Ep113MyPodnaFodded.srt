I'm not crying.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He turned around and he can't even look at us.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He's so sad.

You have an inward penis.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,160
- Inward penis.

00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,080
- You have an in-facing penis.

32
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,920
- Why would you say that?

33
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,740
- Well, even worse.

34
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,760

- I'm not racist.

41
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,580

- You wanna fuck the sink.

43
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,520

45
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,480
For thinking it's racist.

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,680
Yeah, if you let other men fucking fuck your wife

58

59
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680

You're meat bones, dude.

- There's three monsters in this room.

138
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,520
Three monsters of comedy too.

139
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,360
- That's right, exactly.

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,720
Monsters of comedy tour. We should just do that man. Dress up like Dracula. We can do

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,920
what that guy at that open mic did. That one, were you there for that one? The guy

142
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,560
who did uh he was on it was this fat old guy in a beret and a blazer and

143
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,600
like striped shirt and he did a song that was Lon Chaney jr. as the wolfman and

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,680
Frankenstein singing I got you babe by Sonny and Cher to each other. That's nice.

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,480
that sounds like he wouldn't leave the stage until what's that guy's like into

146
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,640
the mic what that guy didn't what that guy is what that guy is in 1978 that

147
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,160
would have been the biggest comedy act of all that would have yeah yeah it would

148
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,880
be huge yeah but he wouldn't get offstage until the host of the open mic

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,960
told them or like went like ladies and gentlemen this guy did that's the best

150
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,400
yeah yeah I mean that's like the new version of like using a giant Shepherd's

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,880
Kane to like yeah pull someone offstage. Oh man they should bring back this

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,360
Dancing Sandman from the Apollo yeah from Showtime at the Apollo. I want to watch

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,840
Pat dude go up at the Apollo. That'd be great. In 1996. That'd be great. You know

Tim's. Yeah and you're just like yeah so 7-Eleven hot dogs or they've gone

156
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,160
downhill in quality greatly since in the last three years and they're just like

157
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,160
"WHOA! YEAH! LET'S GO!"

158
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Yeah, yeah that would be funny.

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,660
Yeah, me personally.

160
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,880
It would be funny if they thought that I would like the videos where it's like

161
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
Rich Voss at the Apollo and like the title is like "White Boy Makes a

162
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
Black Audience Laugh"

163
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,180
Yeah.

164
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,160
And it's just me just talking about like 7-Eleven hot dogs.

165
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,960
You should take that video of Rich Vos, the apologist, cut you in.

166
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Yeah.

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,360
Yeah, just too much crowd work in it.

168
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
You could make it work.

169
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Just replace it.

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Yeah.

171
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Yeah.

172
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Do you like hot dogs at 7-Eleven?

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360

Then he breaks down crying on stream.

341
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,220
Whoa.

342
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,420
He just follows around.

343
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,940
He follows him around.

344
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,980
He also streams?

345
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,460
Yeah, he follows, he watches their streams on one phone.

346
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,780
He stream snipes them.

347
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,380
And then records him.

348
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,540
Yeah, he streams them.

349
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,820
Real life stream snipes.

350
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,740
Yeah, he real life stream snipes.

351
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,700
Dude, that was the craziest phenomenon in 2018.

352
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,220
It didn't do it for a very long time.

353
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Didn't do it for very long because it got banned from Twitch for...

354
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,780
Oh, really?

355
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,820
Yeah, like creating too toxic of a community, I guess.

356
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,860
That's awesome, dude.

357
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,500
It makes sense.

358
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,460
Yeah, dude, fucking that. There was Cheeseburger Andy and there was Asian Andy and both of them

359
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,380
would follow Ice Poseidon around.

360
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,900
Two Andys?

361
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,540
Two Andys that would follow Ice Poseidon around.

362
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,940
And then Asian Andy, like, crashed a quinceanera and played Ram Ranch.

363
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,620
That's pretty cool.

364
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,820
That's pretty funny to watch, but then when you see it in person it's like...

365
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,300
Is his name Asian Andy or are you just calling him that because he's Asian?

366
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,740
No, it's his name. That's his name on YouTube.

367
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,300
I don't believe so.

368
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,700
He used to do Uber drive videos where he would do the text-to-speech over the car speakers

369
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,980
and people would say like, "The man driving your car is a pedophile" and shit like that.

370
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
That's actually pretty funny.

371
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,100
Yeah, those are funny to watch. It's just like he got fired from... he can't hold a job now

372
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,180
because of all of his like IRL streaming.

373
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,860
Yeah, I mean that's, that is one thing is like, if, what is the line with like doing dumb shit on the internet where it's like,

374
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,420
"Oh yeah, you just can never get a job." Like have we hit it?

375
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,020
I don't know. I think we might, we might be almost. We're probably pretty close. We're about to be there.

376
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah, we're just, we can't, like if I apply for like a job that isn't food service, that's be like...

377
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,180
Right, yeah, exactly. Nah, sorry man.

378
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,140
Are you the guy that sang that song about Joe Biden?

379
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,700
Yeah, I'll be like, "Nope, no I'm not."

380
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,140
Different guy, he had hair.

381
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,380
Anyway, I've always wanted to be an FBI agent.

382
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,900
(laughing)

383
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,580
- Since I was a little, little kid,

384
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,420
I wanted to join the FBI.

385
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,780
- What do you think the status of that video

386
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,340
is gonna be if he gets elected?

387
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,140
- What do you mean the status of the video?

388
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
- Historical relic?

389
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,140
- What do you, do you think they're gonna act upon it?

390
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,980
- Act upon it?

391
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,800
- What are you, they already did.

392
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,640
- You think they're gonna put--

393
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,480
- You think I'm going to jail?

394
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,420
- No, they're gonna put you in a black site.

395
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,260
- Black site?

396
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,100
- What's up?

397
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,820
(laughing)

398
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,660
- The Apollo.

399
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,500
(laughing)

400
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,340
That's what they're putting me.

401
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,980
- Yeah, they're gonna put you on Worldstar.

402
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,480
Yeah.

403
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,900
[Laughter]

404
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,140
Yeah, I'm going on BoxedIn and the Kali.

405
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,940
[Laughter]

406
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,740
The forums.

407
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,980
[Laughter]

408
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,780
Ugh.

409
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,180
Oh my god.

410
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,820
I gotta just crack every bone in my body, I think.

411
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,620
And then I'll wake up.

412
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,340
I'll do it, buddy.

413
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,940
I think your cat's trying to fuck the blanket.

414
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,660
Which one is it?

415
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,860
We don't know.

416
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,900
They look exactly the same.

417
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,620
What eye color?

418
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,060
Light green.

419
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,340
That's fucker.

420
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,540
He's not fucking the blanket.

421
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,780
If it was Yoda, if it was Yoda, Yoda is a fucker. He fucks things, but he just needs things.

422
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,740
The fucker's a Yoda.

423
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,980
He needs sex, that's what he needs, with a blanket.

424
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,380
[Laughter]

425
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Look at him, dude, he's horny as a parrot.

426
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,060
No, he's not... yeah, he's needing the blanket, but he's not having sex with the blanket.

427
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,980
This is your fault for getting a blanket full of holes in it, man.

428
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,180
Yeah, he's fucking each hole. He's been working his way through.

429
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,900
I see that shit, I just see options, you know?

430
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,340
[Laughter]

431
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,720
Like last night, I ran out of holes,

432
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
and so I turned to Cameron in the bed.

433
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,700
- Yeah, Caleb was trying to stick his foot up in me.

434
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,020
- Caleb was trying to put his foot

435
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,420
in Cameron's mouth last night.

436
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,460
- Dude, I'm a cuddler.

437
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,440
(laughing)

438
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,820
I don't know what to tell you, man.

439
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,840
- Yeah, Cameron, I woke up, I saw Cameron

440
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,380
put a pillow in between you guys.

441
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,220
(laughing)

442
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,680
- If I sleep in the same bed as another person

443
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,020
that is not my wife, I have to actively like,

444
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,680
wake up every hour and scoot further away from them.

445
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,320
'cause my body, I need sex.

446
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,160
(laughing)

447
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,120
- With Cameron.

448
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,000
- I need sex with whoever's in my bed, dude.

449
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,340
I will make it happen if I don't stop myself.

450
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,440
So, a couple times last night.

451
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,800
I had to calm down, I had to go outside and smoke a cigarette.

452
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,240
- He saw the back of Cameron, he saw Cameron's long hair.

453
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,080
- He saw Cameron's long hair and was like,

454
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,880
"Oh, it looks like a man."

455
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,720
- It looks beautiful.

456
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,040
- It's like Fabio, dude.

457
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
- Oh my God.

458
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,920
- Yeah, I'm about to turn you the fuck out.

459
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm about to grabby-o your fucking--

460
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,000
- You're not gonna have no mercy, Cameron.

461
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
Cameron, I'm gonna put my gravy in you, dude.

462
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
- Oh man, you're gonna be stuff like a Thanksgiving turkey.

463
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,440
- No, I'm gonna put, I'm--

464
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,280
- With my gravy.

465
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,100
- That's right, dude.

466
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,720
- You're gonna be full of my gravy.

467
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,440
- I'm gonna make you into turd dicken, dude.

468
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,280
- Yeah, oh shit.

469
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,160
- I'm gonna baste you, yeah.

470
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,000
- I'm gonna master baste you, brother.

471
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,840
- That's right.

472
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,240
- I'm gonna make you my puppet.

473
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,320
- I'm gonna squeeze you like toothpaste on my mouth, man.

474
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,040
- I'm gonna make you my puppet, Cameron.

475
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
- Yeah.

476
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,040
(laughing)

477
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,880
- Yeah, I'm gonna jump on you like a water bottle.

478
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
That's right.

479
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
I'm gonna make your cap blow off.

480
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Yeah.

481
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,160
I'm gonna blow your cap off.

482
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm not gonna respect your pouch.

483
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,000
I tell you what, tonight I'm not respecting your wishes.

484
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,520
Don't say that.

485
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
What?

486
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
That's not...

487
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm saying it to you.

488
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,720
Your wishes will not be respected.

489
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,280
Don't say that.

490
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Why?

491
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Don't do that.

492
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Don't do what?

493
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Man.

494
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Man.

495
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
We've had a crazy weekend.

496
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Yeah.

497
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,320
We're at the tail. It's funny that nobody's gonna hear this for like weeks. I know we could all be no this is coming out

498
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,240
Wednesday, oh never was coming out of like two days. Oh, nobody will hear this for weeks. No one's gonna know

499
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
We're just gonna forget about it. Oh, yeah. Yeah

500
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,360
All right, we could you we could do the list now, right? Yeah, I made up a list. Let's hear it

501
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,440
I forgot the list. Oh, you have to make it up. Okay, just a Ten Commandments. All right, Sam one

502
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,560
the Ten Commandments of Bart

503
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
No

504
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,480
Caleb's 10 commandments, let's go. Yeah, Dom Patrick

505
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,780
Patrick's fat

506
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,960
Yeah, okay

507
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Number two

508
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,880
Don't play guitar while I'm trying to give my commandments you fucking bitch. That's number two. What was that?

509
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,160
I don't know what that was. Oh, I need to think of it. No, that was number two

510
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,760
Oh yeah, that don't, don't play guitar or a microphone stand. Stop playing that song.

511
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:15,640
I hate that song. Number three, um, number three, uh, you, you, uh. I get to cut in line.

That's it, but that was when you know James Aldean when he was seeing bullets fucking rain down from heaven Jason Aldean

752
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:27,460
Jason Aldean whatever who was it was Steven Steven Paddock accidentally checking into the hotel for dogs

Yeah. Yeah, you might want to watch out for that guy next. Yeah. But what I was saying

763
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,380
is Jason Aldean definitely like what he was thinking when he's seeing bullets rain down

764
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:20,380
from heaven and just destroy everybody who loves him most, right? All over this, all

815
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,800
one of the I read an interview with

816
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,960
Corey Taylor the lead singer of Slipknot. Yeah, where um, he was talking about how he was hanging out with Marilyn Manson and

817
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,200
They had a gross-out contest and

818
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,240
Which is already so funny

819
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,780
But like Corey Taylor like made himself throw up and then ate it or something like that and then Marilyn Manson

820

826
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,600
I'm giving a voice to all the kids who think 9/11 is cool.

827
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Yeah. Didn't he say the n-word? Like hard r? He said hard r n-word in like the first song on his second album.

828
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,120
Irresponsible hate anthem. That's like the first line of the chorus, man.

829
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,160
He says every buddy is someone else's hard r n-word. John Lennon made people think they could do that. Yeah.

He was just trying to get it all out in the first song

835
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,360
Then he could go back to just making creepy music about vampires and then the yeah that the second song in that

836
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,920
Album is just called like is about beautiful people

837
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320

922
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,800

they like they like in canon they're like yeah they're actually trapped in an

924

00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,200
right yeah they like a trap in an iceberg for like a hundred years

927
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,720
something yeah cuz it's like it's funny and it's like the right thing to do yeah

928
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,500
Because you shouldn't just not talk about it. You can't set the precedent of like yeah

929
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,360
they follow every man who's very evil yeah and then be like well we're not

930
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:13,400
gonna talk about it. You can infer. Trust me they would have loved to be doing the

931
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:21,680
Holocaust but unfortunately they were trapped in ice. They got stuck in the

932
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,620
freezer. In the fridge dude. Number eight Charles, Charles Ransom. Charles Manson

933
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,620
Marilyn Manson's dad. Yeah.

934
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:35,260
He took up the family business, Marilyn Manson, making music for creepy people.

935
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,220
I saw a documentary on this freak and it gave me nightmares.

936
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,220
Wow.

937
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,220
Do you guys think he was MKUltra?

938
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,220
Charles Manson?

939
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,220
I want to read that book.

940
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,220
That uh, you know that book?

941
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,220
Yeah, MKUltra.

942
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,220
Yeah.

Charles Manson book.

944
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,220
I'm gonna order it on Amazon, I think.

945
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:53,620
I think Charles Manson was just a great musician and I think people took everything he said

946
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,620
out of context.

947
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,620
I agree.

948
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,420
Including the people who killed for him.

949
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,860
yeah yeah they didn't realize he was being sarcastic he was being ironic dude

950
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,820
yeah irony he was like yeah dude I would totally love if you killed Roman

951
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,480
Polanski's wife. Oh I would love it if you guys started a race war. Yeah you guys should

952
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,420
totally do that yeah totally yeah hey guys look I'm pretending to be a guy

953
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:21,340
would have a swastika on his forehead look how funny this is right yeah I think

954
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:26,820
he's actually a jerk no he sucks yeah he sucks dude yeah you're a grade-A ninny

955
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,740
Charles Manson. Whoa. Charles Manson, you could suck my prick. Oh my god. Yeah, you could suck an egg.

956
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:37,980
All right, go jump in a lake Charles Manson. Go boil an egg Charles Manson. Yeah, go eat a boiled-

957
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,220
Hey, go take a hike. Go eat a hard-boiled egg.

958
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:46,180
Yeah. Bitch. Hey, go to jail. Go directly to jail. Go stay in jail. That would be so embarrassing to be playing.

959
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:53,420
You're a certified doofus, my friends. It'd be embarrassing to be playing Monopoly with Charles Manson, and then you're like, okay Charles and go directly-

960
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,420
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. Oh.

961
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,260
Go directly to jail. Oh

962
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,860
I'm sorry, Charlie

963
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,860
How would he be MK ultra though?

964
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,420
Well, the I think the theory is that not really that he was MK ultra

965
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,620
But that basically like the the guy who the guy prosecuted him was like was MK ultra

966
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,220
No, he was trying to ultra speeds. He

967
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:22,780
Basically framed the whole story so that he could write like a crazy book about it

968
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:27,220
So he framed like all the like Helter Skelter race war stuff there's like

969
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,260
almost no evidence that that was what he wanted to do. He's just kind of a crazy

970
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,860
guy that some people think like everything was pinned on. Okay. Yeah so

971
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,180
pretty neat. You think there was like a plan that the government had and then

972
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,340
that he was a patsy? I think the government had a plan. Yeah the

973
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:48,300
government always has a plan. They always have a plan. This was also, this was in 1969 right? Yeah. Yeah so it's

974
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,340
like yeah this was the peak of like the government suspicion of counterculture

975
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,780
you know like this was that was when the government was not too happy about

976
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,380
hippies yeah you know so they would have done anything to put an end to it yeah

977
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,060
fucking kill they weren't killing showers I'll suck and wife like who

"Finished with my Pepsi, now I want to drink a lemonade"

00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,780
that he drinks instead of Sprite he might drink a soda called Spite.

00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Yeah, Dark Pepsi.

1031
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,780
Instead of Coke he would drink, well he would do Coke.

1032
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,780

We all made our masks at home.

1109
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,540
What the fuck did you do?

1110
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,860
I was playing CSGO.

1111
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,300
Yeah, I got a...

1112
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,180
I was actually reading this book called V for Vendetta.

1113
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,380
I got a Jason mask, I got a hockey mask.

1114
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,700
Well, that's pretty cool.

1115
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,780
Yeah, hockey mask is...

1116
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,220
We'll take it.

1117
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:54,940
Hockey mask still looks pretty scary.

1118
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,300
Can you put some blood and poop on it?

1119
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,940
Can you smear poop on your hockey mask?

1120
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,820
Yeah.

1121
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,900
I wish that hockey, that was what they did instead of fighting.

1122
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,300
They just threw poop like monkeys.

1123
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,300
Yeah, they'd have to call it "monkey."

1124
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,300
Is it a monkey?

1125
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,300
I think you might be right.

1126
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,300
They might have to call it "monkey."

1127
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,300
Yeah, that's a really good point.

1128
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,300
It's true.

1129
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,300
Alright, number 10. Oh no, wow, way to round out the list.

1130
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,300
Number 10, it's our man Tom Cruise.

1131
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,300
Tom Cruise, Nicholas Cruz's dad.

1132
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,300
Yeah.

1133
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,300
I don't really get what's creepy about him.

1134
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,300
He does his own stunts, is that creepy?

1135
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,300
Is he a hero? Scientology.

1136
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:36,980
Scientology. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah. Do you guys think Scientology kills people?

1137
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:42,500
He says he does his own stunts but he's got enough Scientology energy in him that if he

1138
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,980
hits the ground he just bounces back. He flips up into the air. Yeah, it's like when Neo

1139
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:50,420
falls off the building in Matrix and he just bounces back up. Yeah. Yeah, it's just like

1140
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:56,140
that. That video where he breaks his ankle is pretty cool. Tom Cruise. Yeah, just watching

1141
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:04,380
hurt yeah just seeing that man is seeing it makes me just feels good to me

1142
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:16,380
Homer does his own stunts this is this is my Marge impression I don't know who it

1143
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:20,420
was it might have been sir but somebody posted something about how like in the

1144
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:28,700
current Simpsons canon was 919 when 9/11 happened yeah that is so funny dude yeah

1145
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,620
it's a funny shit ever oh that was Foley it's Foley yeah I don't remember who it

1146
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:40,400
was yeah that's how is that Homer was 19 I don't I don't watch new

1147
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,620
Simpsons buddy 2001 plus I don't even watch new the news then would make him

1148
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:52,640
new than anything. 38? Yeah gotta be 38. He says he's 36 in season 4 I know

1149
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,160
that cuz I just watched it. That would make him like 60 years old right now.

1150
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,520
Yeah. They should just do one the final season of The Simpsons where they just

1151
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,960
just do a movie every two every three years. Yeah. The Simpsons. Cuz The Simpsons

1152
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,160
movie is great. Here's my idea. So the final episode. I'm sure if they made another movie right now

1153
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,640
another Simpsons movie would be awesome. I mean the show sucked when the first

1154
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,320
movie came out. It's true. It would definitely be good because they

1155
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,080
spend a lot of time on it. It wouldn't be about Trump or whatever. It would though is

1156
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,300
what I'm saying. It definitely would. I mean they did a ton of like dumbass

1157
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,900
Bush stuff. They will be about. No. Yes. Final season of The Simpsons this is my

1158
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:38,460
idea. Every episode is one is they all have the same birthday and every episode

1159
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:44,780
they get older by two years okay well it's gonna be like a 26 episode season

1160
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:48,400
or something or final episode final season of Simpsons is just Homer takes a

1161
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,620
