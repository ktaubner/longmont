Put some pants on Daffy.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,080
I don't even think Daffy wears a shirt.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,720
Put a shirt on Daffy.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,080
He ain't got no underpants on.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I don't think he wears anything.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Daffy wears drawers.

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Put them on.

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,800
No one wants to see that tail.

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,880
Yeah, they should be calling him naked duck.

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,440
They should call him Laffy Duck because that's what he makes me do.

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,080
Yeah, he makes me Laffy Duck.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Laffy Duck.

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Laffy Duck.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,720
They should make him, they should make him Sadly Duck.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,760
And he wishes he was anything else.

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
And guess how he does things?

47
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Sadly.

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,360
The same.

49
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
The saddest duck.

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
The saddest duck.

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm the saddest duck.

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm imagining a sad duck and it's almost bringing me to a tearful state.

53
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,020
He dives underwater to catch a fish.

54
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,520
He never comes back up.

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
No.

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
No.

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
He's never coming up for air.

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
Scrooge.

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
He's sinking.

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
He's sinking in water.

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
He's Scrooge Bogovich.

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
That's right.

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,760

Freddy Guffinger.

76
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120

- I have, you know what it is?

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
I have extremely wide feet in my entire life.

130
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,280
- Did your feet get bound?

131
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,320
- Kind of, by vans off the walls.

132
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,520
- Vans off the, what is that?

133
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,800
even one of the shoes they make.

134
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
- That's their logo, slogan.

135
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
That's their slo-gone.

136
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
- Their slogan.

137
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,980
- Their slogan.

138
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,320
- No, but Vans old school, I've worn them since I was a kid

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,280
and they have definitely, my feet are too wide for them

140
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,880
but they don't make a wide version.

141
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,720
- Yeah, they do.

142
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,200
- So they've, well not for me.

143
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
- You just have to look.

144
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,080
- They don't sell it at journeys.

145
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,960
- Oh yeah, that's true.

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,280
- So my pinky toes on both feet are pretty much bent.

147
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,760
- All the ads for the Vans,

148
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,520
all the ads for people wearing Vans

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,720
had people wearing with hair in them.

150
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,840
So Caleb got these shoes.

151
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,240
- Wait, what the fuck's going on with Pat's fucking pinky toe?

152
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240

153
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
What, that one?

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Oh, it was fucked up.

155
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
It was fucked up a second ago.

156
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Wait a second!

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Yeah, you're not getting out of this one.

158
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm just accusing you.

159
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm just trying to get the heat off of me.

160
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Oh, look at that weird thing out.

161
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240

162
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Give me your hand.

163
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Ugh.

164
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Ugh, dude.

165
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240

It smells like the store.

169
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
It smells like a zambonied floor.

170
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
It smells like the store.

171
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Yeah, it smells exactly like the store.

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get out of this.

173
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get out of this.

174
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,360
the store. It smells like a zambonied floor. Smells like the store. Yeah, it smells exactly

175
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,160
like the store. Where you been boy? You been walking around the store barefoot? You been

176
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,200
around the store again? I might. Don't play coy with me you white bitch. I might be going

177
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:13,160
to the store sometimes. To do what? I know it's not working. It's some shopping. For

178
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,200
with what money with your money I knew it Patrick's been taking my money and

183
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,800
love you. Barefoot is legal. I didn't turf up this hardware store so people could wear shoes in here.

184
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:55,480
That's what I hate about Chinese restaurants is they make you take your shoes off when you walk

185
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,320
in. It's not good. Come on man. You're killing me this week. It's so offensive that Chinese people

186
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,240
take shoes off. Everybody's gonna be so mad. Crazy offensive. Oh that's some offensive stuff

187
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,160
Really? Yeah. God, I'm offended. I'm actually, I'm the triggered one.

188
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,800
Yeah. That's what people know about me as the host, is I'm the trigger.

189
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,800
You're the lonely triggered stoner. I'm the triggered soft boy.

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
Yeah, you are. You're a soft boy.

191
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
You are sensitive. I'm the sensitive. I'm the sensitive.

192
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,080
A lot of people don't know that Pat's sensitive. Yeah.

193
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,560
He's sensitive as hell. I'm so sensitive.

194
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,040
Shut up. And I'm shy.

195
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,880
You're not shy. I'm shy.

196
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,960
He's not. Prove it.

197
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,880
Oh you're shy? Prove it. Here I'll be a new, I'll pretend I've never met you. Hey man nice to meet

198
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,680

199
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:58,760
one of the girls. You're the most famous Yankee. No the most famous Yankee was. Baby Ruth. General

200
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,080
E. Lee. No he was the other one. He's a confetti. You're thinking of Ulysses S. Grant. Yeah Ulysses

201
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,620
Ulysses S. Grant. You let me sex, you let me sex, Grant? I that's, I'm a lot, I, I'm, if I

202
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,540
know any more than that about the Civil War, I'm in big, dude, I'm in, I'm in

203
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,480
Bantha Poodoo, so I have to just, I have to feign ignorance. Ulysses S., what's his

204
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,320
name? Huh? Who dat? What? Yeah, who dat? Yeah. I don't know, man. What was his weak spot on his

205
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,600
body? His Ulysses heel. Yeah, you studied his Ulysses heel. I studied his Ulysses heel.

206
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,600
comes back yeah just in case I'm gonna put you back. His heel was sex with women. That was my heel.

207
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,360
You have well it's because you're a descendant of him. I have hundreds of heels. Yeah. Yeah my Achilles

208
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,880
heel is pretty much anything. Yeah. Pretty much anything that'll kill me. Probably like my nose

209
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,080
honestly. Yeah my Achilles heel. I have a pretty sensitive nose. My Achilles heel is getting hit by a car. If somebody hits me in the nose

210
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm out for a little bit. My Achilles heel is snacking.

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
My Achilles heel has got to be the crutchie Cheetos.

212
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
Yeah, my Achilles heel.

213
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,160
Takes me down.

214
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,360
One.

215
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
It's probably getting my leg stuck in the lawnmower.

216
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,860
Probably getting laid out and molly whopped on the street.

217
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,760
Yeah, it would probably be catching on fire.

218
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,560
What's that thing, that thing that I found?

219
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
God, it was some fucking tweet.

220
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,660
Your penis?

221
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,360
Responding to the New York Post.

222
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,960
Oh yeah, I witnessed Rick Moranis get his jaw slid for no reason.

223
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
The city's wild, dude.

224
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,360
I witnessed Rick Moranis get his jaw slid for no reason.

225
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,160
It's like the most insane sentence.

226
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,800
The guys who, the best kind of dude right now are the ones who can't stop replying to news

227
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,600
stories about crime in New York saying like, "Well, there goes the city.

228
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,080
It's going to be the 70s again.

229
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,480
There's going to be babies holding guns."

230
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
It's like, "Fuck it.

231
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Hope so."

232
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Yeah.

233
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Yeah.

234
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,240
I hope, everybody talks about how the 70s New York was the cool New York.

235
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,800
Let's go back, dude.

236
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,000
They're going to bring the velvet underground back.

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,720
They're going to put graffiti language on the subway.

238
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,600
They're gonna put graffiti language on my body like a tattoo.

239
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,720
It's funny that if you own a van in New York City, it's just covered in graffiti.

240
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,200
There's nothing you can do.

241
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,120
Work van, fuck you.

242
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,280
Exactly.

243
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,680
That's why you get somebody to preemptively do it.

244
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,800
Yeah, but what if your shit's toy?

245
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,280
What if you got like, no graffiti slang?

246
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
What if the shit you get on is toy?

247
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
What if it's toy?

248
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,120
What does toy mean?

249
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Toy means bad graffiti.

250
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,880
Toy is what it means?

251
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Toy is the...

252
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Toy is bad.

253
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
They teach you that in Tony Hawk's Underground too.

254
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
I didn't learn that shit.

255
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,920
All the guys who spray around the city in Berlin, they're all toy.

256
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
I don't think so.

257
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
I bet it means gay.

258
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Yeah.

259
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I think so.

260
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
It probably means gay.

261
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
It probably does.

262
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Look that up on the graffiti dictionary.

263
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Yeah.

264
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,760
It probably is a contraction of tugging boys.

265
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,640
A toy, otherwise known as a pawn, is an unskilled or new, inexperienced graffiti artist or writer.

266
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm really good at graffiti.

267
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400
- Tags and pieces are usually crossed out

268
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,780
with the word toy or crosser's tag around it.

269
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,600
- I had graffiti stuff all the time though.

270
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,840
My tag is the sad clown.

271
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,980
- Yeah.

272
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,100
- The saddest clown in the world.

273
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,940
It's really a long tag.

274
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,640
- Mine is white boy universe.

275
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,900
(laughing)

276
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,760
I spray paint galaxies.

277
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,400
- Yeah, I'm the Italian galaxy.

278
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,640
(laughing)

279
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,720
I could expand your mind.

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,800
- I'm hip hop kid.

281
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,120
So all the graffiti stuff is named after chess pieces.

282
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,560
I graffiti a jack in the box on the wall.

283
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,600
You can be a knight, a king, a queen, a pawn, a board, or a toy.

284
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,280
Some of my graffiti are graffiti a jack in the box, but it's Donald Trump on the end

285
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,200
of it, and it says "Whack in the box."

286
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,640
And then I sign my tag, "Hip Hop That Kid."

287
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,400
That hip hop kid lonely.

288
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,040
That lonely hip-hop kid.

289
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
That hip-hop son.

290
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
That, yeah.

291
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,960
That lonely ass little white boy.

292
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
That lonely.

293
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,240
That lonely ass little white boy who cries all the time.

294
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Yeah.

295
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
That's my graffiti name.

296
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,060
That lonely ass little boy with a big sweater.

297
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,060
Maybe we should just.

298
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
And he hides in it like a turtle.

299
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,600
Is there a lot of money in graffiti?

300
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Yeah.

301
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
You do it for the love of it.

302
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
You do it for the.

303
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Yeah, the love of the.

304
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
You do it for the fumes.

305
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
The love of the money.

306
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
The love of the paint fumes.

307
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
I just love those paint fumes, dude.

308
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Oh.

309
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,800
Have you guys ever looked at a graffiti and thought, "How the hell did that guy get up

310
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:34,200
there. But then you read the tag and it says Spider-Man. Yeah, and it says that 30

311
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:40,120
foot tall homie. Yeah, we were walking around, we saw us and it said fuck me.

312
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,760
No, no, it said, I know it. Let him talk. Okay. But you can go ahead and say a

313
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,000
worst version of it if you want. It said, it said, kiss me like you love me,

321
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,760
Yeah I'm beefing with my dad. He won't let me pound him out. Yeah. He won't let me beef him.

322
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:36,160
Yeah. Ask him to show me the birds and the bees. I just want my dad to show me. I want my dad to show me his pie bird making it scream.

323
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,160
*laughter*

324
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Pie bird?

325
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Make it scream!

326
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I feel like pie birds, I feel like they only have, well they have them here obviously, but I feel like it's just a British guy thing.

327
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
British guy thing?

328
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Yeah, I feel like British guys fuck pie birds all the time.

329
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I feel like American Pie would be a lot different of a movie if there was a pie bird in there.

330
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Yeah, he'd be fucking, he'd be sticking his dick in a bird.

331
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
There'd be a perfect hole.

332
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,680
Did you guys ever fuck a fruit?

333
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Did you know that they're making a girl's...

334
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
No, I never fucked a fruit.

335
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,320
This is not a joke.

336
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,600
Patrick did though, he didn't answer.

337
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600

338
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
He did.

339
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
He did.

340
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I don't have to answer.

341
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600

343
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Yeah.

345
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
It smelled like home.

346
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,080
It smells terrible, but I'm going to be so good at eating pussy once I finally do it.

347
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm going to be so good.

348
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,640
Once I finally find a pussy that's covered in spikes, I'm going to be so good at this.

349
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,160
I'm going to be so good at holding my nose while I eat pussy.

Finally, a fucking-

370
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,400
Alien vs. Predator is so good because they just set it in an Antarctic Aztec temple for

371
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
no reason.

372
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,800
They're just like, "Yeah, you know what we should add to the- you know, Alien vs. Predator,

373
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
that's not enough.

374
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,360
We should have it take place inside of the Millennium Puzzle from Yu-Gi-Oh.

375
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,120
That's the only way we can make this movie work."

376
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,600
You know that climate that the Aztecs lived in?

377
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah, yeah, the ocean.

378
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
The coldest ocean there.

379
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
The coldest ocean.

380
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
The coldest ocean.

381
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
The coldest ocean in the middle.

382
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,720
The middle had a lot of those.

383
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Those were the lonely Mexicans.

384
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,680
Yeah, they were the lonely Mexicans.

385
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,800
And they lived in Antarctica.

386
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
And they were the sad boys.

387
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,200
They were sad boy loco.

388
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200

390
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Sad boy loco.

391
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,560
That's some real shit.

392
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Last night?

393
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,460
Last night I was lying awake and you know, I told you

394
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:34,780
I was lying awake, you know, you know how they did like discovered that you have taste buds on your balls and specifically you Patrick

395
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, but like just imagine being like it's how I imagine being a scientist who had to sit in the lab and taste so good

396
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,520
Never mind

397
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,720
Imagine me. Oh, never mind. No, never mind. It's okay Patrick. I'm a ball sack. Is that what you're gonna say?

398
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Imagine being a weird ball sack.

399
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Imagine being a ball sack and tasting something.

400
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I was tickling you.

401
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Imagine being a ball sack and just being like

402
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
shorts, shorts, shorts, shorts, cereal.

403
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Okay.

404
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Alright.

405
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Imagine being the scientist

406
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
who had to sit in a lab all day and just look at balls

407
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
in a microscope to see if they had taste buds.

408
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I feel like we're gonna

409
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
slowly find out that balls have

410
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
even more features.

411
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
It's just what you look for.

412
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,260
weaned demo tape like a bootleg that's called craters of the sack. You want to

413
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:28,800
put your wean in a bootleg? I would. I would do that. Don't tempt me. Should we try

414
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
tasting stuff with our balls? Yeah. Do you want to do that on mic right now? Kinda.

415
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,960
All right turn, pause it. What do I have that we could even dip our balls in? We can put it on

416
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,880
monster. That's empty. I could vape and then blow it on my balls. Yeah you could.

417
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
- Yeah, do it.

418
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,560
- But someone else would have to blow it.

419
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
- Pepto-Bismol, let's go.

420
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,840
- Put some Pepto-Bismol in your balls.

421
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,540
- What if it tastes so good though and I get addicted?

422
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,920
- You get addicted to the taste of Pepto in your balls?

423
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,000
- Like what if it tastes different?

424
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,100
What if it's like tomato juice on a plane?

425
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,760
You know how the air pressure makes it taste different?

426
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,640
What if it's like Pepto on your balls?

427
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,920
- Imagine that movie.

428
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,480
Tomato juice on a plane?

429
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,400
(laughing)

430
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,240
- Yeah, do it.

431
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,060
- Okay, now do it.

432
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,900

433
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,740
- Now do I'm tired of these--

434
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,560

435
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,760
- I'm tired of these motherfucking--

436
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,240
I'm tired of tomatoes on this motherfucking juice.

437
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm tired of this plane.

438
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,120
Now say you're tired of the juice.

439
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,880
Now say that Patrick.

440
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,960
Say it.

441
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,360
Say that.

442
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm tired of drinking so much juice.

443
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,600
Okay now let's get a different read on it.

444
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,080
Let's try a different take.

445
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Let's try it a different way.

446
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm tired of the jweice.

447
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,000
You're tired of the jweice?

448
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The jweice.

449
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What kind of person is that?

450
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The jweice?

451
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,840
- Nope.

452
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,660
- No.

453
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,500
- What?

454
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,680
Is that a person?

455
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,560
- I'm tired of my nagging Jew-ess of a wife.

456
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,680
- You can't say that, Patrick.

457
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,520
- Why?

458
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,680
- You can't say that about your wife.

459
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,640
She's listening.

460
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,940
- She better not.

461
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,280
If you're listening right now,

462
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,000
you're supposed to be plugging your ears

463
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,960
and going la la la la la la la la.

464
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,080
- Pat is gonna do a Disney Channel show

465
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,180
about him and his twin called Hitler Hitler.

466
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,200
(laughing)

467
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,760
- Why did you guys make me say this?

468
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
(laughing)

469
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,040
- Now everyone's gonna get mad at me.

470
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,880
- Everyone's gonna be mad at you.

471
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,600
- It is really funny to imagine someone being mad at you

472
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,860
for just talking about Hitler.

473
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,560
- Yeah, mad at me.

474
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,440
I wouldn't be able to handle him too.

475
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,440
- You know if you say his name three times, he wakes up.

476
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,280
- You'd be able to handle him

477
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,120
'cause I'd be trying to defend him.

478
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,940
- If you say his name three times,

479
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,780
everybody starts laughing.

480
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,620
- Yeah, if you know--

481
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,200
- I'd be trying to defend him, you know.

482
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,520
- Yeah.

483
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,000
- He's just sexy.

484
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,960
- He's sassy, come on.

485
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,720
- I don't think Hitler's sexy, let me clarify.

486
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,120
anymore. I'm just doing it. It's too old you know it's like seeing young pictures of

487
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,520
Betty White and you're like what's up ma? Oh yeah and you're like oh now she says

talk about my WAP. Dude, she is a WAP for sure. White ass person. White ass petty.

493
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,000
It's crazy that yeah that she made a career from being that that nasty ass

494
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,600
grandma. There's like a joke in like the second season of 30 Rock like

2008 or 7 or whatever and she's like they like check to see if she's dead and

496
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,960
I was like she's just been doing this forever. I know. Just like you just been

497
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,920
this old the oldest bitch in the world yeah for like 30 years she's gonna die

498
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:44,280

499
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,000

00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,320
because then he has to act upon them like if somebody says fuck you the devil's

503
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,480
like yeah I think that I think the reason that nothing has happened in the past

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:16,600
couple of thousand years since the big the big civil war in heaven is you guys

505

535
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,500
Yeah, if you draw furry art, it's probably too late by the time this

536
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,180
comes out to be honest. Yeah, it'll probably already be out. Someone will

537
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,740
probably make. By the way, if you draw furry art, keep it to yourself. Do not send it to us.

out of you. Sometimes I get nasty at home. Let's do the list. Number one. A frog crawled

In violence.

DogeLife4Gaming comments, "Number one should be your mom gay."

633

That's true.

634
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
Big facts.

635
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Your mom gay.

636
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Big facts.

637
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,660
Your mom gay.

638
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
Number two.

639
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Hey, Cameron.

640
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
Yeah?

641
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,660
You...

642
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,660
Hey.

643
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Shh.

644
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,860
Say it an insult. That's my insult saying so quite too much. All right, let's say it again

645
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,220
So you play too much stop calling yourself hot. The only thing you can turn on is the microwave

646
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,580
If I ever encounter a heckler, God save their fucking soul.

647
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
If you ever encounter a heckler.

648
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,580
If you ever enchant a heckler.

649
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,580
If you ever enchant a broadsword.

650
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
That's my first move. Second move, just cry instantly.

651
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Next!

652
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
You said next?

653
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
You said next?

654
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,580
Wait, wait. First I point to myself and I go, me?

655
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
And then I look behind me to see if there's another guy.

656
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
You talking to me?

657
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Me.

658
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,580
You must be talking to me because there's no one else here.

659
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,580
I got some bad thoughts in my head.

660
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
But R2-D2's gay.

661
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
But...

662
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580

If I'm ever drunk, you'll be good looking.

696
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,340
We got drunk on Friday.

697

Yeah, so you looked at me.

698
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,980
We got drunk together.

699
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,980
And you looked about as good enough to eat.

700
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
You would eat me?

701
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,340
I'd take you to frown town.

702
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,860
You'd make me frown?

703
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,660
I'd make you frown like there was no other choice.

704
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
You'd make me frown?

705
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
I'm going to give you, listen, listen.

706
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
You would make me frown and I'd turn it upside down?

707
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
We're going to get drunk.

708
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
We're going to get drunk.

709
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I'm going to give you zero options.

710
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
zero options.

711
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
What?

712
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,660
That's just the facts of the matter.

713
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Zero.

714
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,660
Okay.

715
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
All right.

716
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
That's a better comeback.

717
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Moving on.

718
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
Yeah, that just happened.

719
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Awkward.

720
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
So that just happened, and now for something completely different.

This is this I know what this is. I do look like one of those. I'm dressed like one of those breaks

This is from brick from anchorman. Oh

737
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,600
Here's a comment on here that says I laughed at this from dark boy X

738
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
I would shop at the toilet store. Yeah, why not?

739
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
You have to get, I mean, there's toilets.

740

You have to get a toilet. Yeah.

741
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Where am I supposed to get a toilet? The clothes store?

742
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
And if they have clothes at the toilet store, I like to support

743
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
It's called a two for one. Small business. Yeah.

to pop with a needle and to see what's growing

750
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
inside you pregnantly.

751
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
[laughter]

752
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,180
- Come back.

753
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,020
- You have to do it, come back!

754
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,340
- I know, but.

755
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,340

763
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,740
(laughing)

764
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,700

00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,180
(laughing)

766
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,020
- That's what it says.

767
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,840
- That's number six?

768
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,440
- And the only comment says, I don't get this one?

769
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,280
- Yeah, me neither.

770
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
- I don't either.

771
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,760
You rise, what could that mean?

772
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,920
Maybe like, you're my son.

773
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,600
- Yeah.

774
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,420
- Oh, okay.

775
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,260
- You're the sun. - Is that true?

776
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,100
- You rise and shine.

777
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,140

- Oh, okay.

781
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,680
- I'm working on, no, it's a new song I'm doing.

782
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,520
- New sensitive gangster song.

783

You say cock-food?

814
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:58,060
Hey Caleb, you think you would learn cock-fu but all you're doing is learning cock is food.

815
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,900
Don't you forget about me?

816
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,340
- Well, like I will forget about you,

817
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,100

818
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,180
(laughing)

819
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,420

That's a little bit of a stretch.

821

- That one, I thought that one was perfect.

822
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,580
- That one works as a comeback to one very specific thing.

823
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,740
- Yeah, which is, why would somebody be like,

824
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,260

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare.

829
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,420
- Oh, you're just a kid and life is a nightmare?

830
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,740
- Yeah. - Yeah, hey,

831
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,420
I woke up at seven, went to bed at seven, woke up at 11,

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,260
waiting for somebody to call.

833
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
- Yeah, you wish.

834
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,620
- What's new, Scooby-Doo?

835
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,580
You're thinking of a different band, Cameron.

836
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,540
- Hey, Cameron.

837
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,420
- You're thinking of Simple Plan, not Simple Minds.

838
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,380

- Okay, I'm having a dry day.

1011
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,240
It's just not happening for me today.

1012
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,400
You guys happy?

1013
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,160
Maybe I'm not the best actor in the world.

1014
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,800
Maybe I'm not the next Daniel Day-Lewis.

1015
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,640
- Lewis.

1016
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,880
- Daniel Day-Lewis, that's you.

1017
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
No!

1018
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Read the fucking thing.

1019
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,880
Daniel Day-Clueless is that, wait say it again.

1020
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
What was it?

1021
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Daniel Day-Clueless, that's you.

1022
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,000
Listen buddy, I don't know what makes you so stupid, but it really works.

1023
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,320
I'm guessing it's the gas I left on in the fucking oven.

1024
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,320
It could be that.

1025
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,320
It could be that I'm poisoning you.

1026
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,680
It could be that I'm poisoning you.

1027
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,960
I'm poisoning you guys so I can take advantage of you.

1028
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
Yeah.

1029
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,960
On the podcast.

1030
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,960
What?

1031
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
Come on.

1032
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
What?

1033
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
Taking advantage of your, what?

1034
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,960
What?

1035
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,960
You guys will laugh at anything.

1036
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,960
I'm taking advantage of that.

1037
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,960
What?

1038
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,540
You gotta hear yourself before you speak.

1039
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,940
You take it to this nasty place every time, Patrick.

1040
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,880
You gotta hear yourself before you talk.

1041
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,100
You should be the one wearing these headphones.

1042
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Do you think I look cool?

1043
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,100
No.

1044
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,100
Okay.

1045
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,860
You would look like, these headphones on you would look like a halo in a renaissance painting.

1046
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,180
Yeah, that's true.

1047
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,100
That's an intellectual reference for my scholar.

1048
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,100
That's for all the art fans.

1049
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,940
For the scholarly gangstas.

1050
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,940
Scholarly gangsta.

1051
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,300
Yeah, you wish you were a scholarly gangster, but actually you shit.

1052
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,020
I bet your brain feels as good as new seeing you never use it.

1053
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,060
I bet your brain feels as good as new seeing you never use it.

1054
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:34,660
Let me feel it.

1055
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,100
Yep, you're right.

1056
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,700
Yeah, I bet your brain feels as good as new.

1057
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,740
LOL, you had no brain.

1058
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,900
LOL, I love this one.

1059
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,540
This is that's definitely that should be way higher than the fucking horrible ones.

1060
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,060
Yeah, yeah.

1061
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:56,100
Like number seven or whatever. The one that's like, what are you doing? Hey, Patrick, you're

1062
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:02,980
you're done for. Hey, I should get one of those erasers that say they're for big mistakes

1063
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:10,980
and throw it at you. Yeah, because that's how you erase. What people don't realize about those is

1064
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:16,100
that the erasers don't work on your heart because who you are and who you love isn't a mistake.

1065
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,540
That's real shit. Uh-huh. People don't realize that about a lot of stuff. People don't realize that your heart

1066
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:27,060
has a good amount of memories. If I wrote your name on my heart, would you fall in love with me? Yeah.

1067
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,100
Would you dance if I asked you to dance? Would you dance if I played your favorite song right now?

1068
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:40,260
You know I'm such a fool for you. You got me wrapped around your finger.

1069
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:47,060
Let me tell you what, that's like that song "Cherry Pie" when you realize what it's about.

1070
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,380
Like, she's wrapped around his finger. Okay. Yeah. I see you, you Scottish bitch.

1071
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,740
She has to get me fingered. She's Irish. Same shit to me.

1072
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,940
Fuck you. I don't give a fuck.

1073
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,340
What the hell? I don't give a fuck.

1074
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,340
Disrespect. That's the same thing to me.

1075
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,060
The cranberries is all we have. Yeah.

1076
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,820
And a lot of other stuff. That's true.

1077
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:08,180
But yeah, what other things do the Irish have? Wisdom.

1078
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:15,220
Drinking beer. Beer is honestly cool. Yep. Drinking a lot of Guinness. Yeah.

One idiot in my school kept calling me gay to annoy me,

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,560
found on the internet and thought it would be effective but then his dumb

1144
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,460
friend told the whole grade what i said

1145
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:01,000
thankfully when some people ask me what i said i lied to them and they believed me

1146
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,320
and the guy who blabbed everyone now denies it barely anyone talks about it

Mm-hmm.

1160
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,720
Some kid in fifth grade,

1162
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,720

00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,720
So that I have to pee and it's pushing against my--

1165

00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,720
"Your mama's so fat she'd make you look thin!"

1171
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,720
Nice.

1172
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,160
It crushed. It crushed. Yeah. Nice. One time a kid said "Yo mama joke" and I punched him

1173
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:23,400
and I beat him up and he was a midget. Serious. His name is CJ. Yeah. He had a mohawk. Oh yeah

1174
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,640
you told me about the pink mohawk. Oh yeah I do remember that. I was there. Okay. You

1175
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,960
guys weren't there? I was there. You were 20 years old. Hey Caleb. What man? Your shit

1176
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,960
It smells like candy.

1177
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,960
Get out of my house!

1178
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,960
Oh.

1179
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,960
I'll see you in heck.

1180
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Hey, uh, hey Caleb.

1181
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,960
Yeah?

1182
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,960
What's up?

1183
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,960
I bet your mother has a loud bark.

1184
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
I didn't even insult you.

1185
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
What the hell, man?

1186
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
I just asked what's up.

1187
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,960
Sometimes you just have to do your job.

1188
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,960
This is how police officers feel.

1189
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,960
Yeah, it doesn't matter what somebody's saying to you.

1190
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,960
You gotta do your job.

1191
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,960
Somebody insult me.

1192
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,960
Somebody insult me.

1193
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,960
Somebody insult me.

1194
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,960
Somebody insult me.

1195
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Somebody insult me.

1196
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,960
Somebody insult me.

1197
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Somebody insult me.

1198
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,960
Somebody insult me.

1199
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,960
Somebody insult me.

1200
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,960
Somebody insult me.

1201
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,960
Somebody insult me.

1202
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,960
Somebody insult me.

1203
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,960
Somebody insult me.

1204
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Somebody insult me.

1205
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,960
somebody in something.

1206
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,200
(laughter)

1207
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
- What's it?

1208
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
- How's the weather up there?

1209
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
- Is the girls restroom smoke good?

1210
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
- What kind of drugs does it take to enjoy your experience?

1211
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
Your existence?

1212
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
- Fuck that up dude.

1213
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
- It's the same word basically.

1214
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
And then the comment says, "Okay this is amazing,"

1215
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
says the kid who loved Joker.

1216
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,200
(laughter)

1217
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
- I'm that kid who loved Joker.

1218
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
- I'm that comeback kid who loved Joker.

1219
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
- Mmhmm.

1220
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Let's see here. Hey Caleb.

1221
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,200
What's up?

1222
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Oh, if I stand close to you I can hear the ocean.

1223
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,200
Cause you're a shell. Yeah, I'm a beautiful shell. You're a beautiful gorgeous shell.

1224
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Yeah, I'm a shell of a guy. Yeah, you're a conch. Shut up.

1225
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,200
Hey. What? You're the coward who ever heard of beating you two up to a pulp.

1226
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,200
That's the comebacks.

1227
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,400
- Comebacks in a circle, so it's a comeback circle.

1228
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,680
- Let's just read the rest of this to each other.

1229
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,960
- All right, we'll start right here at number 30.

1230
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,800
We're gonna go with a whole list.

1231
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,160
- Okay, we gotta start with one insult.

1232
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,280
- You fat, Caleb.

1233
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,560
- Which one?

1234
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,680
First of all, no.

1235
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,680
- You just read the fucking comeback.

1236
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,520
- Just fucking read it.

1237
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,040
- You fat, Caleb.

1238
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,860
- Not fat.

1239
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,700
- People always say,

1240
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,720
"Treat others the way you wanna be treated."

1241
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,560
I guess you really wanna be treated horribly.

1242
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,920
- I don't know who you think you are,

1243
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,680
but if you think you can talk to me like that,

1244
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,520
you could go right here, right now.

1245
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,520
Hey man, that elephant wants his underwear back.

1246
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,520
No you.

1247
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
No you.

1248
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
You ruined the circle.

1249
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
You know how a circle works?

1250
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
No you.

1251
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,520
I'm sorry.

1252
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,200
I'm sorry you must have mistaken me for a mirror.

1253
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,200
No you.

1254
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,600
I would like to help you out.

1255
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,040
What I can't hear you over the epic sound of how awesome I am.

1256
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,040
No you.

1257
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,400
I really like that one.

1258
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,640
Your mom had an abnormally large vagina.

1259
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,640
What the hell?

1260
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,920
That's how she gave birth to you.

1261
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,680
You get ten times more girls than me.

1262
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,440
Ten times zero equals zero.

1263
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,440
That's kind of an omen.

1264
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,440
You're a special kind of stupid, aren't you?

1265
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,000
I'm busy right now, please don't leave a message ever.

1266
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,040
Whoa.

1267
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,040
That's a good one.

1268
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,480
Bully, hey look over there.

1269
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
You gasp.

1270
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,840
Is it your intelligence?

1271
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,720
May the fleas of one thousand camels infest your armpits.

1272
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Wait, no.

1273
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,240
Fleas are too good for any part of your body.

1274
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,840
Oh my god, that's a good one to use on dogs.

1275
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,840
Fatality.

1276
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,480
That's a great one to use on dogs.

1277
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,160
Hey Patrick, waddle on over here and we'll talk.

1278
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
Okay.

1279
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,160
That insult was so funny I nearly fell off my dinosaur laughing the first time I heard

1280
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,160
it. Aperture Science called. They said they had that the future does not start with you.

1281
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,160
Holy crap.

1282
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
Why is Aperture Science--

1283
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,920
There is a crap somewhere out there in the deep cold darkness of space. A crap resides.

1284
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,840
That crap is waiting to be given.

1285
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:49,600
The top comment, only comment. How the heck is this a comeback?

1286
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,520
I like watching your show, but when the camera goes in your general direction, all I can

1287
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,520
see is you.

1288
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,640
Is that a fat joke? What does that mean?

1289
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,640
Or maybe a tight lens joke.

1290
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,640
Yeah, maybe you have a small camera.

1291
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,640
That's a joke for Carl Zeiss.

1292
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,640
Yeah, Zeiss would love that one.

1293
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,640
You're so stupid you let the target throw darts at you.

1294
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,640
No I don't.

1295
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,640
No I don't.

1296
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,640
How can I say somebody is stupid?

1297
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,640
Let me think of a thing somebody does.

1298
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,640
You're so stupid food eats you stupid.

1299
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,640
You're so stupid in Soviet Russian.

1300
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,640
It drives you.

1301
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,640
You're so stupid your air conditioner makes the room hot.

1302
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,640
That's right.

1303
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,640
You're so stupid. You sleep upside down. You're so stupid a firing squad of you stood in a

1304
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:37,220
circle. That's right. You're so stupid it takes three of you to screw in a light bulb.

1305
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:47,680
It takes two of you to turn the... Stop tickling me! I'm gonna get you soon. I turned off my

1306
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,320
microphone when you did that. It was so loud that it turned off his microphone. And you

1307
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
You turned me off when you wouldn't let me tickle you.

1308
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,480
Can you giggle into the microphone?

1309
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,480
Just giggle into the mic.

1310
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,480
Just giggle once.

1311
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,480
I'm going to tickle.

1312
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,040
Can we get a sweeter tick?

1313
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,040
Yeah, just for the...

1314
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,040
That was evil.

1315
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,040
Listen, don't scream.

1316
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,040
I just want to tickle you.

1317
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,120
Just giggle, okay?

1318
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,920
Don't yell or scream or hit me.

1319
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,080
He did it.

1320
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,080
That was a real giggle.

1321
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,080
That was a real giggle.

1322
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,080
Are you ticklish?

1323
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,080
He is ticklish.

1324
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,080
I tickled him the other night while you guys were sleeping.

1325
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,080
Do you want to shower with me after this?

1326
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,080
You want to shower with me after this?

1327
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
You're not allowed to. I'm not going to meet you in the shower.

1328
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,080
I'm...

1329
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,080
Yeah, you will. I think you will.

1330
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,080
I think you'll find a way to do it.

1331
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,080
Make like a unicorn and get the fluff away from me.

1332
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,080
Oh my god.

1333
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,080
If I wanted a B******************** I'd have got a dog.

1334
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,080
Oh, I think I know what that says.

1335
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,080
Beast Burger.

1336
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,080
If I wanted a beast, I would have got a dog.

1337
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,080
So what's the point of your existence again?

1338
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,080
Oh, come on.

1339
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,080
Your mom used that joke already.

1340
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,080
Oh my god.

1341
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,080
Quit whining over your sad life.

1342
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,080
You're on the internet for way too long.

1343
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,080
I think Floyd once said, "We don't need no education."

1344
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:08,080
I guess you might need it if that's your response to life.

1345
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,080
That's a good one.

1346
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
Alright, let's see what's at the end of this year list.

1347
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,080
MeRapid just called and wants his insults back.

1348
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
Let's just scroll to the bottom here.

1349
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,080
He was good though.

1350
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,080
Oh, here we go.

1351
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,080
This one's perfect for Caleb.

1352
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,280
Caleb, Caleb, say something mean to me.

1353
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,000
- You look like a big fart.

1354
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,680
- At least my head doesn't look like a deformed lemon.

1355
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,520
- No!

1356
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,200
- Thanks for listening, guys.

1357
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,040
- Thank you listening.

1358
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:29,860
- Listen to the Patreon.

1359
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,520
- Subscribe to the Patreon, buy our t-shirts.

1360
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,440
We got some t-shirts.

1361
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,280
- We got a new t-shirt that has a picture

1362
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,200
of Patrick's XXX journey that he took.

1363
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,120
- Yeah.

1364
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,120
- His triple X journey that he took with his friends.

1365
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,880
- He did a triple X journey with three friends

1366
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,680
and we put it on the t-shirt.

1367
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,520
- Without telling him.

1368
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,340
- What are you talking about?

1369
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,180
- You were asleep.

1370
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,020
- Bye everybody.
