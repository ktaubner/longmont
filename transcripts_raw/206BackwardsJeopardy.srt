00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,900
so loud that I can't hear my own thoughts, man. This is this episode is

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,280
already falling apart. You have like that you enter. First of all, have the

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,460
little this is like the thing that the guy from the Pogues plays when he's

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,120
doing his little

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,640
who's the Pogues. He's not gonna know the Pogues. He's not gonna know the

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Pogues. No, you should have known he wasn't. Yeah, what I know the Pogues.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,520
you don't know the I know the pose man. Yes, okay, I like all four of them

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,040
that buddy. There's way more of them. There's probably like twelve people in

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,080
that band. Yeah, and I knew it was a band, but there's four main members.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,840
Now there's one main member. Yeah, well, there's one. There's one main member

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
and then three secondary. There's one main matter would always tell me about

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
meeting him. Shane, me and your dad met Shane McGowan. I'm a drink. Oh, I bet

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
he remembers that

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,640
probably probably it's probably a really special moment.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,160
Definitely Shane McGowan, that guy in Boston, Bob, me a drink

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,120
yeah, that's exactly my dad bottom a drink and then he immediately just like

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,360
on that's literally exactly my dad.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,560
I think he's filled shane's drink or something and he was like

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,320
a

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,120
is

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,300
You would like this guy. You would like looking at this guy. Oh, the TV's off.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:04,540
Julio can't even pull up pictures of him. Oh, hey, Senor. Shane McGowan is he's

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,520

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
like what do you would you eat a

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,140
rock?

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,620
Who did you turn down? The one that's not plugged? Oh, okay. Sorry. Our fourth

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,660
ghost member. Yeah, I was going to I was going to turn his down. I don't know

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,660
why, why, because we're talking about yeah, this is her talking me and

37
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,220
Cameron. This is a this is this is Irish chat. Do you guys want to hear

38
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,460
another funny Ireland experience that I remembered last night that I completely

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,460
forgotten about that happened when we were in Ireland? I we went to this like

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,860
you know we went to like a colonial village type thing like like a

41
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,460
you know, like

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,680
yeah like a yeah, yeah, we went to one in Ireland and they had like a bunch of

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,320
animals like it was kind of like a not really a petting zoo, but they said

44
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,660
animals like they have there. We were just walking around looking all the

45
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,360
animals and we turned the corner and there was like a pasture and we looked

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
and there was a tiny

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,320
pony like a Shetland style pony. Yeah, that was just standing completely

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,560
rigidly still as if it was a statue and just like against the fence, like

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,360
putting its head through the fence and just standing there completely still,

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,060
just staring straight ahead and we like walked up to him. We're like hey and it

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,520
did not move just breathe and look. It was completely the most miserable

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,240
animal I've ever seen in my that's an early reincarnation. Yeah, this is a guy

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,000
who used to be like a CPA or something and this is day two of being a pony.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,260
It's like that was the most I've ever seen an animal want to die yeah. I mean

55
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,320
I think that a lot of animals like a lot of dogs try to kill themselves. I don't

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,800
think that any all the dogs know that cars will kill them. This was this is

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,060
though this is the most like human representation. This is like when you

58
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,000
see when you're like oh the the cat knows how to turn on the TV, like oh, I

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,460
can see that my behavior in this cat. This is like this. We saw the this is

60
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,260
like pure, the most of your horse and desire to be annihilated yeah, just

61
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,880
when you said like colonial head between bars and just looking straight

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,740
dead and not reacting when to walk up to you just God. I mean you said colonial

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,500
village in Ireland. I was just imagining like as like a a tourist trap or kind of

64
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,220
like like you know how they have like the Japanese like rock abilities and

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,740
stuff yeah, just imagining like the Irish doing like a colonial Williamsburg.

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,260
Yeah, well, that's what it was. I mean, I guess it's not colonial. I guess,

67
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,700
yeah, just all yeah, but that's just what the type of reference point, but

68
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,320
yeah, I mean that's what it was. They had a little they had the little stores that

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,360
you go into they had the they had the classic school house. You go into the

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,340
school house. Can we this is where they learn? Okay, oh my goodness, they had to

71
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,840
sit in front of a chalkboard. That is so boring that fucking stir bridge village

72
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,960
trip. You probably had to do yeah. We did Plymouth plant. Yeah, Plymouth

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,000
plantation, then what do you have like did you go to colonial will? I've been

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,960
there probably four times yeah it do that shit so no. I think it's cool. I

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,040
it's so fried. I think it is cool. Don't say it is right. Well, because there's no

76
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,520
ledges and all those all those people that are there are toy as fuck. That's

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,200
lies. It's fried. That's lies. Do there's a number getting up? There's a

78
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,640
there all the way. There's a sword maker there. There's a usually a blacksmith

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,480
and this time it was better because all the people it's easier to imagine these

80
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,920
people as coming from the fourteen hundreds because they all have Irish

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,640
accents. True. A lot of the people who work at Williamsburg are like guys used

82
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,920
be drug addicts in Philly. Yeah, now they're there. They're hiding a tattoo

83
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:41,080
yeah in the summer. They have to wear a war like a wool shirt. Yeah, I know that

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,620
you are the number one Roku fan in the world.

85
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,820
You can't hide that from me. I can see it in your eyes. Yeah, do that's the

86
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,940
worst. You go, you go to the colonial things, a colonial thing. You go to the

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,620
colonial things. Sorry,

88
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,300
now me

89
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,600
Roku fan and you were like yes,

90
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:09,120
yeah, I am a big road

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,980
called out. There's got to be a bigger Roku fan than you. You don't even have a

92
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,400
Roku.

93
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,720
I just remember you have a fire stick.

94
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,980
was the worst day ever. My straw socks and I don't have a Roku

95
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:30,360
Roku is fired. Yeah, there's got to be you're saying Roku clears Amazon fire

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,800
stick all day easily puts it in there. Have you ever heard of someone talking

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,860
about Amazon fire city? No, they don't even have a city. No, have it. There is

98
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,120
no city for Amazon fire city is just a picture of some like a movie that they

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,080
put at the top. We don't even get or you know Amazon fire city is instead of the

100
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,720
the Roku City us Amazon people who are logged into our mother in laws Amazon

101
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,960
account get to see pictures of every person from my mother in laws church all

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,520
the time on my TV. Oh yeah, that's nice. They got that photos, it's just a

103
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,120
photo, photo, and I am so terrified that it's going to be like one day, like

104
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,860
weight loss before and after photos or something popping up. There's always a

105
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,360
danger yeah, because I don't think she knows that her all of her photos are

106
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,540
tried to my who would just show up in my letter

107
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:25,420
you like the photos. Some of them, some of the guys, there's a photos of me and

108
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,720
and my my in laws that are they're nice photos. Yeah, you know I've hair in the

109
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,520
photos, by the way, grow my hair out like yeah, you're going to grow it out.

110
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm going to grow it out. All I can go bald now

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,920
dude no because then that will trap me in whatever you just up hair style. This

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,320
you guys can both be bald. That's what I say no yeah. I mean you basically

113
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,860
you are bald. You basically I'm not bald. I just like you can't go the extra

114
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,820
that you are. You look too similar to Caleb. Is that the no? I just that

115
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,780
people will mix you two up. I don't think that we can't both be. We can't

116
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,580
both be bald because one

117
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,740
the there's two. Let's strap in here. We got one reason coming up, so that means

118
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
there's going to be more.

119
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,980
No, because this is my, I have a joke about this.

120
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,100
He's sliding into a stand up, man.

121
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,380
He's sliding into a stand up.

122
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,580
You know, you guys set me up to be like Jay Leno on Letterman.

123
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,620
Here's what I got going on.

124
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,540
Oh my God.

125
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,260
Just go, just shave that shit off, man.

126
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Yeah, I might.

127
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
I've done it before.

128
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,540
You have the mustache and the earring are enough to make you look.

129
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,380
Yeah, but then I just look like a gay guy in the 70s.

130
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,380
What's wrong with that?

131
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Yeah, that's not my vibe.

132
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
That's not your vibe.

133
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,260
not your that's the thing. There's no chance that's your vibe. You don't like

134
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,780
to think that I was trying to say that the thing that I was trying to say

135
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,420
about the

136
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,020
like the colonial Williamsburg people and like myself, like there there's like

137
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,820
specific faces now that I feel like it's probably because of the blue light from

138
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,280
screens, but there is some kind of thing that makes people like the you know what

139
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,580
I mean though, like it's the right. Yeah, the blue light people like an iPhone

140
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,820
faces. Yeah, blue light from an iPhone must be morphing our facial structure or

141
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,420
something, or giving us, like, some kind of skin thing that is, like, okay, this

142
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,820
is a face that could only exist in, like, 2023. Like, this is a person born in

143
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,860
'98. But you don't have one of these. I think you have an olden face. You think I

144
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,460
have an old one? You got an old face, man. I do. You have an old face, olden

145
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,740
face that I think you'd counteract with new clothes. Yes. Okay. I think that you

146
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,520
you have a perfect you have a perfect sailor face. Huh, you belong on a ship

147
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,340
and you need to die and the boy like I sit like in a bad is mad about the

148
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,080
strong. No, I'm not mad. So mad about that. About the straw thing. The straw

149
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,040
doesn't matter anymore. I even think this straw is cringe personally. Yeah,

150
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,980
why do you say one of your wife's purchases? Is the straw with you? Okay,

151
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,120
guys, you brought the straw to the store.

152
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,540
don't bother giving me a story. I brought my own story time guys story time bundle

153
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,680
up because this is about to be an amazing story. I went to I went to Duncan. I got

154
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,440
a free cold brew because I had 700 points. Okay. I didn't do that at Dunkin

155
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,040
Donuts. Those are very nice people. They get yelled at enough. I went to the one

156
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,160
on Fresh Pond. Nope. It's the one on Myrtle. I went to Duncan. Hold up. Hold

157
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,680
up. Hold up.

158
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Run that shit back. It was the one on Myrtle.

159
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Caleb Pitt storytelling.

160
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,620
Okay, I'm doing the one finger of stories. Okay, give me a beat the one

161
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,280
finger of stories. Here it is.

162
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:41,680
Okay, that's mean. That's kind of a mean finger. There we go. I went to

163
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,800
Duncan, I grabbed this on the shelf, I forgot to get a straw, I got home,

164
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,040
I said, "Oh, do I have any straws in my house?" No straws, except for this

165
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,840
little doodad, which I've never... That is a doohickey. This is a doodad.

166
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,800
It's not a straw. It's a wide straw. It looks like I'm nursing. You know what? I think that

167
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,680
I'm actually now that I've seen you sip from it, not jealous of it. Why? I think I was

168
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,400
making fun of it because I was like, "No, they don't make straws that wide." Okay, I

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,880
actually quite like it. He likes it. The straw? I think that my... It's mixing mixed up between

170
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:28,120
the straw, the coffee. It makes the drink stay cold because it's metal all the

171
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,080
way. It makes the drink stay cold, the metal goes going all the way, and then

172
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:40,000
the width of the straw, you're getting a lot of liquid. You put a lot of liquid

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,440
on the end of my straw. I did not put a lot of liquid on the end of the

174
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,000
straw. You did, did you? You had full lips all the way. I do have a

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,040
spit problem. What's this problem you have? Too much? It's probably something...

176
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah, I think I have too much spit.

177
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Overactive gland?

178
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Yeah. I think there's a... maybe I got a mouth stone from all the energy drinks over the years.

179
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Could be that. Oh, I want to see you pop one of those so bad.

180
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
That'd be cool.

181
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Did you guys ever watch video of popping disgusting stuff out of their bodies?

182
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Yes.

183
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Oh, I love that shit.

184
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Dr. Pimple Popper.

185
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,040
But also this... when people get the salivary stone...

186
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Those are gross. I don't like those.

187
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
They're awesome. I love them. I want them to shoot out.

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,280
you know what I went to the one time I went to the urgent care in Boston and

189
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,420
they were playing a video. They were playing some TV show that was like Dr.

190
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,980
Pimple Popper on the TV for the waiting room. Everyone was there because they

191
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,360
were sick or miserable, but it was Dr. Pimple Popper, but it was for pets. I

192
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,600
don't want that. I was bought that dude. Have you ever seen the video?

193
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,840
Animal surgery, but if you ever seen the videos where the where the dogs are

194
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,500
like walking around the street and then they are like, oh, look at this dog.

195
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,660
I get closer and the dog has a million worms. Yeah, it is body. I've seen

196
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,480
those. Oh man, you know what I saw the other day? Oh my God, yeah, you say

197
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:49,920
yours

198
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,400
you know those like in the in the caliber of like pimple popping and like

199
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,480
like the oddly satisfying human disgust or yeah body horror stuff. The disgust

200
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,020
or the

201
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:08,980
the oddly satisfying disgust or crew have now started to do ingrown toenail

202
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,040
pair, which I saw a video of somebody getting like an ingrown.

203
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I've seen that one.

204
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,720
They peel the thing away and then you just see the pus shoot out and it's like a whack-a-mole

205
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
for the poppers.

206
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,200
I had one really, really bad when I was a kid and they had to put a needle, they had to

207
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
numb my foot.

208
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,360
I had the same shit with my thumb.

209
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
I was like...

210
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,300
My toenails are always ingrown constantly.

211
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:39,000
I had a big ingrown thing right there on this thumb and I had to go to the hospital because

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,840
there was a red. Oh my God, you got the end of the the classic infection, the

213
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,720
classic Nazgul infection. Yeah, you had a red line. I had a red line. That's one

214
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,060
of my fears. I never heard of that. That's what they say. They say if your

215
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,720
cut is infected, if it's like if it has like pus and if you see a red line, you

216
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,080
need to go to the hospital like immediately because it's like your blood

217
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,000
infection or whatever. Whoa, and you live to your heart. I guess I had that.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,080
It's like a my dad said, yeah, how far up did it get dude? How close are you?

219
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,500
that's right next to your heart dog. It was pretty close, but I was just like I

220
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,180
went in and they just like, they just like, I'm sorry, that's I am viewing you

221
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,780
completely different. You had a near death experience. Barely. It was just

222
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,760
like, no, don't downplay this shit, man. The heart, the line was close to your

223
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
heart. The coolest thing though was when I was in, I was taking my, oh, the

224
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,720
coolest thing was the line. Let's be real. Yeah. But the coolest thing was

225
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,520
when I was taking my art final in, it was my senior year of high school and

226
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,800
that's when I noticed the infection and I took just like a like it was like I

227
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,600
think it was like the nib for like the ink pen that I was using and I just

228
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,700
fucking and like

229
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,960
push down on it so hard that like it shot so much puss out that it went up.

230
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,860
It was like a squirter.

231
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,800
That's the coolest part. Dude that's, yeah the pittin'.

232
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
Oh the line was cool man, just leave it at the line.

233
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,460
Did you use it in your art, the puss? Yeah. No, 'cause I had already turned in,

234
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,480
I had already turned in my final and I was waiting for the. So you had some extra

235
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,080
time to. Yeah. Mutilate your body. Oh okay. Well I didn't, I wanted to just

236
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,900
draw with the ink pen. I thought that I the thing I saw yesterday was old was

237
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,920
the most disgust or thing I have ever seen in my life. What was it? I am a

238
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,380
face

239
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,780
and a mirror,

240
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:18,140
your face in a mirror. Why'd you say that come on? Sorry, I said it to myself

241
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,580
actually.

242
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,060
I thought I was still

243
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,980
that's my bad. I thought I was completely talking. I was walking home.

244
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,780
I saw this homeless guy sleeping on somebody's friend. Oh yeah,

245
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,280
it. Oh

246
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:36,280
it's just so insane. Yeah, he was sleeping on someone's front steps and

247
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,260
then the person came home and was walking by him and like kind of like

248
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,980
skirted by him, like didn't really say anything just like to go unlock the

249
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,180
front door and when he when the person step by him, he like sat up and started

250
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,780
to like gather a shit. He had like like a blanket and like he set up to start

251
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,420
gathering his stuff up and move and when he lifted his head, I saw what he was

252
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,800
like lying his head on on the stairs was like a wet, dirty stuffed animal monkey

253
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,700
and then on top of it like that it was directly touching his head was a giant

254
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,820
wet dead rat

255
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:13,260
and that was he was using that as a pillow and he just sat and the person

256
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,620
going into their house just like looked at it and then just like one inside. Do

257
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,960
you think that was like oh my just so insane? So the craziest thing I've ever

258
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,240
to you. Do you think he was like like he had to pick up the dead rat and be like

259
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,000
this is what I I'm sorry. The combination of these two things will

260
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,580
make my head comfortable. Which one should I put on top? Which one should I

261
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,840
directly lay my head on? Should I lay it on? I bet that kind of feels like

262
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,260
depending on how fat the rat is. There's a big fucking rat yeah. It was huge. I

263
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,640
bet that kind of feels good. I wouldn't I don't think so. No, you know you like

264
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,380
you you're you lay your head on like your girlfriend,

265
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,680
you know,

266
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,080
hairy leg. Yeah, here in the back of her hairy leg cold.

267
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,780
You know what I'm talking about? You follow you follow you're watching TV.

268
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,280
You fall asleep with your head on your girlfriend's hair. That means you if

269
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,480
you're falling asleep on your girlfriend's body, you're the girlfriend

270
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,880
man

271
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,880
straight up facts sleep on her cab dude. I feel like I'm well. I don't want to

272
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,780
make the world is getting grosser. I don't want to make this about me, but

273
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:25,580
The woman who used to, who was a homeless lady still is, and she tried, when she could walk,

274
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,180
she would like hunt down Phil and try to kick him all the time. I ever tell you about her?

275
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
No, you never did.

276
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,540
I told him, yeah, I told him. There was this lady who would just like, every single time

277
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,500
we'd be down the street, she would beeline to Phil and like wind up a big kick and then

278
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
miss.

279
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Oh my God.

280
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,860
The first time I was like, what the fuck is wrong with you, you fucking crazy bitch? And

281
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,580
then by the third time I was like, nice try, man.

282
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Yeah.

283
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Yeah.

284
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,580
Missed.

285
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,860
She would just like get mad that she missed the kick and keep walking.

286
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,820
Anyway, now she can't walk. I think she lost one of her feet or something.

287
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,780
Diabetes or did you think she kicked up?

288
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,980
Diabetes, yeah. This homeless lady is eating so much candy that she got diabetes.

289
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,300
She's living such a lavish life.

290
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,620
Well, yeah, what's the cheapest thing at McDonald's? The ice cream cone.

291
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:15,780
Oh, that's actually a very fair point. Anyway, she started, she is now, she's resorted to,

292
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,220
for the last couple of months, the bench in front of my apartment, using it like

293
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,940
a toilet and shitting through the slats of the bench every single morning.

294
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,100
That's sad. No, it gets worse. And when that didn't work, now...

295
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,540
It didn't work? What do you mean it didn't work? Well, it didn't make me

296
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,780
mad enough, I guess. It wasn't enough for her? Yeah, 'cause I guess she's

297
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,820
trying to ruin my life. Why didn't you have a

298
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,860
nemesis? She's not my nemesis. Maybe I'm her nemesis, but I barely think about

299
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,140
her. Wow, that's cold. That's cold as fuck. But now she's pulling out the

300
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,500
The ultimate move to ruin my mornings, which is that she is

301
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,540
every single morning laying down on that bench and crying very loudly.

302
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,340
And it is really harsh in my vibe, man. Yeah, I can imagine. I think I'm

303
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,620
gonna walk up to her and be like, "Here's 100..." Fuck, no. "Here's 100

304
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,900
Mr. Beastballs." She tried to kick my dog. I'm gonna say... Mr. Beastballs?

305
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,060
Yeah, it's a thing I made up. It's an NFT that you can sell.

306
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,100
I should give her an NFT. You're giving her a poor tape.

307
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,340
That's a good idea. Well, honestly, as somebody who owns an NFT, I can tell you it doesn't

308
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,020
make you happy. That's true. Yeah, he owns a shard. I have. It's actually it's it's a

309
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,480
fragment fragment of a shard. But now I have now I have no choice of the moon, but to save

310

her life. Yeah, because even though I don't want to, because she tried to she tried to

311
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,800
kick my dog. Now I have to save her life and fall in love with her. Yeah. So I'm in a really

312
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,520
bad spot this week. I know. I mean, I can't imagine that your wife wants. She's not happy

313
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,520
about that, but I mean I brought her inside. I'm gonna have to like clean her

314
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,840

315
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:04,200
Oh, I'm gonna eat her. Yeah. Oh no, no, I thought you meant what do you mean that

316

317
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,480
a snack make like make her a hot meal yeah what is that I'm not sure how that's

318
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,980
that's changing like make her like her emphasis on yeah her. I know she's the

319
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,740
one that's going to make her a hot meal and make her a hot meal hot meal. Oh

320
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,160
okay.

321
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,760
Yeah, so hot meal

322
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:31,600
anyway meals, I mean that eat that a hot meal. I've given her food. Why we we

323
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,460
could have been wacky packages writers. That's the thing dude. I

324
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,800
I tried to I tried to squash it. Yeah, I've given her I even when she was

325
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,420
kicking Phil every once in a while. I if I because there's a pizza place right

326
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,240
yeah. If I got a slice of pizza, I'd grab an extra one and give it to her,

327
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,020
but she still came after Phil with these feet. Yeah, and then God, you can

328
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,180
know you're trying to bribe her. Yeah, I kind of was I was more it's probably

329
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,340
the the homeless person in the history of my life that I've given the most

330
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,060
stuff to

331
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,260
purely to stop her from trying to hit my dog.

332
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,300
I mean homeless people, I guess, could learn a lesson from that. If you want a

333
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,600
from money from Caleb just try to kill his dog. Yeah, dude. It's really I mean

334
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,820
we live in a backwards world. Did she so

335
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,660
did I mean I know Phil personally I know him. Yeah, that's my dog. We're pretty

336
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,860
good. We're pretty good friends. He hates you. He doesn't hate me. He despises you.

337
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,580
What are you talking about? He hates me. Every time he sees me, he runs over to

338
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,540
me. To try to bite you. No, 'cause he thinks that I'm a fellow dog. That might

339
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,660
be true actually. He thinks that I'm... You probably smell like a dog. He thinks

340
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,260
that I'm a dog and he comes over to me. I mean you see you, you can vouch for me on

341
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,660
this. Phil runs up to me every single time he sees me. That's because you go

342
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,660
very excited. Yeah, but he likes that. No, he doesn't. Phil runs to you. I don't

343
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,660
like it. It doesn't matter what the dog likes. Yeah, that's why you, you're saying

344
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,500
that he hates me because you don't fuck with that. But I know that he, well, he

345
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,060
does run towards me. Maybe he thought this woman was me. She does look a lot

346
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,900
like you. He could have been running, he could have been running towards her. I've been having

347
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,980
an incident, a thing recently, I'm wearing a collared button down shirt if you can't notice

348
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,140
that. You pulled up in the most Tony Soprano ass shirt the other day but then you, we were

349
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,900
doing that episode with freestyling. So I had to cover it up. You covered it up but that,

350
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:30,340
it looked cool. Whoa, the truth comes out. Listen. I've never, I have never ever once,

351
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,500
what's the word I'm looking for here? Disrespected me. Not disrespected or

352
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,060
respected. I've never once,

353
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,540
somewhere in the middle,

354
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,300
never once not admitted when a shirt looked

355
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:50,260
swag. Ever not once admitted when a shirt looked swag. Okay. Yeah, no,

356
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,580
that's good. You're saying you say when you see a shirt you like, you say it.

357
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,420
It doesn't matter who's wearing it. It doesn't matter. It's so hard to get

358
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,940
your point across. Yeah, it's difficult these days. That is true. What was I just

359
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,460
saying? Things have changed. Because of long COVID. You don't have long COVID. Do you

360
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,220
actually believe you have long COVID? And chronic Lyme. No, you know that I don't even believe that

361
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,980
exists. I didn't know that. I think it exists. All right. I think that it kills millions,

362
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,540
probably. Millions a day. Every single day, millions die. You're talking about your shirts.

363
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,260
Oh, yeah. So I've been having a thing recently where I'll be walking the dog

364
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,220
and I'll see a very ratty, tattered clothes, staggered kind of person,

365
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,580
coming, yeah, I mean, dressed like a zombie, walking towards me on the street, and I'll

366
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,620
kind of bring the dog a little closer because, again, I'm like, "This guy is a homeless guy.

367
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,780
He's going to kick my dog." And then I get next to them, and basically, I realize they're dressed

368
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,780
exactly like me. They're wearing a ratty hoodie that they probably overpaid for,

369
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
and just like old jeans.

370
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,840
Yeah.

371
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,040
And then I'm like, I wonder how many people a day think that I'm homeless walking down the street.

372
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,840
I mean, you're like doing like the

373
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,140
like the Shia LaBeouf thing where you wear all the ratty ass clothes.

374
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
To say that people don't notice who you are.

375
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,340
Oh, that is what I'm doing, dude. I'm trying to be incognito in plain sight.

376
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,840
Be like, that's a celeb.

377
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,340
Yeah, I don't want people to say,

378
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
"Dude, parking ticket."

379
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
Me, personally?

380
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Oh my god, that's Trixie Mattel.

381
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:19,840
Yeah.

382
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,340
Yeah, no, that's...

383
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Wait, no, that's not my name.

384
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Wait, that's who's that? Oh, you're saying the owner of the Mattel fortune.

385
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
No, no, no, no.

386
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,340
So, they're saying, because obviously they're thinking I'm a rich guy.

387
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
No, no, no, no, no.

388
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Oh, my God. Can I have your autograph?

389
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,340
Who do you, what? Okay, so obviously I'd be Jason Statham.

390
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,340
I mean, it would be hard to tell, it would be hard to tell if he was

391
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,340
Trixie Mattel because like there's...

392
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,340
They would go up to him and they'd be like, "Oh, my God. I love your

393
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,340
performances." He's like, "Thank you."

394
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
Oh, thank you.

395
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,340
Oh, well thank you. Upcoming short film.

396
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Appreciate you.

397
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,340
Your associate. Coming out soon.

398
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Upcoming short film. Thank you so much.

399
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Who, what celebrities do you guys think

400
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
that you would be mistaken for the most?

401
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
David Krumholz. Ninja.

402
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,340
Ninja. He does a big ninja. Definitely ninja.

403
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,340
Definitely ninja. We got it. Dude,

404
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,340
you have to be ninja for Halloween.

405
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,340
Wait, who's David Krumholz?

406
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Yeah, I don't know who that is.

407
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,340
He's the fat guy in Oppenheimer.

408
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Which what?

409
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,700
Benheimer's best friend. Oh, I know who you're talking about. I look exactly like

410
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,180
him. You don't look like him. I look a lot like him. What are you talking about?

411
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,420
Yeah, there's one photo of him that

412
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,100
I look... He has a girl's name in that movie. Pretty much exactly. His

413
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,980
character's name sounds like a girl's name. What's his name again? I don't

414
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,100
know. I'm trying to remember. All I remember is that it's a girlly name.

415
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,980
Albert Einstein, man. Yeah, his name is Alberta Einstein. God, why can't I

416
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,060
remember it? I saw that movie seven times.

417
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,300
No, you lie. I didn't see it. I saw it two times. I didn't see it even once,

418
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,560
two times. It's good coming to digital soon. Well, I'm like digital. Don't you

419
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,500
think there's a little far in the future for a movie like that? Damn

420
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,860
that's yeah,

421
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,020
that shit should be coming to analog man, which I'm not sure. I mean, I guess

422
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,860
just a reel of film, maybe this is who you think you look like. This is who I

423
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,900
have been told by multiple like show the show the GoPro.

424
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
I'm not.

425
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,260
Um, honestly, yeah, I'm not going to lie to you that he looks he's he's tubby, but he

426
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,460
looks, he looks similar mustache, similar eyes and stuff.

427
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,580
Yeah, he was on that show numbers.

428
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
If you remember that.

429
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,900
No, I never seen that movie.

430
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,780
They would let us watch that in my math class in high school.

431
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,060
That's cool to teach us about math.

432
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:43,420
And there's so many times in like my, my school experience where we would be watching something

433
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,100
It's like we're watching a movie in a class where we're not supposed to be

434
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,300
usually watching non educational movies. And I came to that. I was like I had the

435
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,780
realization like, oh, I'm in like the second lowest of this version. I took an

436
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:03,940
economics class and we watched that movie in time with you. I was like, I was

437
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,100
like, Yeah, I'm glad I'm not doing work, but I'm going to get quizzed on this.

438
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,900
I'm getting quiz on for economics. Yeah, we used to watch teacher was this guy.

439
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,080
his name was Mr. Roop and Mr. Roop was like a,

440
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,900
he was like a musician on the week. He's basically the first experience I had

441
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,260
with Sean Stevens. What kind of cool nicknames did you have for Mr. Roop?

442
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:31,300
We never called him Mr. Boop because he let us watch in time. So we were like,

443
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,180
okay, he's actually... He's swag. Yeah. Mr. Boop. What the hell was that?

444
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:44,660
What the fuck? Mr. Boop. Mr. Boop. That sounded crazy. I think he had a tattoo of a clock on

445
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,980
his forearm too. That's badass. Do you guys remember my old roommate who had a full...

446
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,700
Maybe you guys never even met him. No. My first roommate in Boston, it was me, Neil,

447
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:03,100
this guy Dante, and this guy Stan. And Stan got a tattoo. Oh no, because Stan had moved

448
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,420
out at that point. Stan got a tattoo all the way up his arm that was a clock with that was

449
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:16,420
every, it was like however many stages, faces of the moon, all with the clock as the moon

450
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:22,340
going all the way up his arm. And so the top of his arm dude, fully black circle. Tell

451
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,500
me that's not the most badass shit you've ever seen in your life. And I said what the

452
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,820
hell is that about? That is a metalcore ass tattoo. I said what is that? And he said it's

453
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,980
is about time. People who are into stuff like that love to get Roman numerals. I

454
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,120
think he actually had another. I think

455
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,900
well, you can't read normal numbers. Yeah, the hell's wrong with you. You

456
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,980
think you're so cool. I can read Roman numerals. I think Roman numerals are so

457
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,900
whack. There's a reason we got rid of them. Imagine how much cooler the

458
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,460
Coliseum would look if instead of Roman numerals all around it, it would like

459
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,300
engravings and that kind of stuff. It was just numbers. That'd be way more chill.

460
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,220
Yeah, if I like the look of numbers, numbers are fire. Arabic numbers. I you

461
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,700
know, I can't really do I can't really add and subtract them or multiply them

462
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,460
that well. Yeah, you don't know a lot about these. I don't know a lot about

463
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,900
them, but aesthetically I do like them. Do you have any? I think that the three

464
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,520
three is the three is a went off with three. I'm my favorite seven. Seven

465
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,780
looks good. Seven seven is well done across the seven eight. I do that two

466
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,580
73s and this I do the slash through the zero to that is that was fire man slash

467
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,380
through the zero.

468
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,680
That's a really good through the seven really good looking number. I'm getting

469
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,380
excited to write some numbers when I go home really good looking number 72 72 is

470
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,880
pretty cool. That's true. It looks like a seven and upside down seven Carlton

471
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,780
Fisk Carlton Fisk or with it as a triangle.

472
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,280
Ooh, I don't do that shit. That's kind of there's so many ways to do that, but I

473
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,880
don't do it so much anymore, but it just is fascinating how many different ways

474
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,380
So many different ways you can do a four with the loop. You all do to with the

475
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,480
loop. That's the a two two with the loop. Oh yeah, I actually do a two with the

476
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,780
loop. Yeah, I do think about all the different types of numbers there are in

477
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,780
the world. Do you guys do eight as two circles or do you do it as one line? I

478
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,280
do it as one line, but I do I do like to imagine it as two threes kissing.

479
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,680
Whoa, two threes. I'd like this front. It would be better if they had the

480
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,080
staggered ends. So it was like they're going into each other. That'd be more

481
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
hot. God damn it for three. It's not for me. I just want to download just like a

482
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
bunch of fonts. I just want to download a bunch of numbers. Just fucking look at

483
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
a bunch of numbers and download a bunch of fonts and type in all the numbers.

484
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,160
You know what I do not fuck with? What? Oh wait, this is a great math problem. A lot

485
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,280
of beautiful numbers here. Huh? What's this letter doing here? Yeah, wait. Is

486
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,680
that a fucking X or a Y? Is that supposed to be an X or a time sign? Yeah, get

487
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,520
that shit out of my numbers, man. X literally took multiplication sign

488
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,440
multiplications like you have to now you have to be an asterisk. Yeah, that

489
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,380
literally I'm turning you into a butthole, but yeah, dude, a bunch of a

490
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,400
star, yeah, bro, but whole bro, it does a jacked its whole flow. Yeah, he stole it.

491
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,340
He stole his shit in a major way. I mean, well, I don't know who stole it

492
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,020
first. Actually, did X come for X probably came first. I think the X came

493
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,740
first before the using that for a multiple. I think that X has been around

494
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,860
since the beginning of time, but I think that well yeah, the beginning of time,

495
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,960
the beginning of time started with X right. That's why we call multiplication

496
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,480
times tables right time x wow here's here's what that's why that's why

497
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,480
disrespecting it making it a butthole is fucked up. Algebra was invented by

498
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:42,360
by algebra, but the times thing is in the Bible go forth and multiply yes and

499
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,480
math was invented by Charles Mathis

500
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,600
Mr. Ath. No, it is a math. And food was invented by food.

501
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,680
Foodle-doodle. And this is basically how history has been forever.

502
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,760
The old Roman emperor, Foodle-doodle. No.

503
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,840
No. It is funny that, you know, do you know

504
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,200
where the word cynic comes from? No. Where? Does it come from the word dog?

505
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,720
It comes from basically a guy whose name was was cynic or sineos or whatever, and

506
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,600
he was just a crazy homeless guy. Yeah, and he had a bunch of gang of a bunch of

507
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,920
different homeless guys who would walk around Greece like it was San Francisco

508
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,280
and just fall over and people would be like, oh, these guys are cynics. Yeah, so

509
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,640
we have fun. I mean, it's funny. That's what most I feel like that's a lot of

510
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,160
words are like that where it's just a guy's name. Yeah, or a group of people.

511
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,820
I hope that one day there is a so he was like the Caleb ism yeah. He's like the

512
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,200
Roy Monson. I don't know what it is. What is it, then you don't want to know

513
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,180
what I do want. I've obviously already coined the term, but not about what's

514
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,880
not about you, but okay, good. It's

515
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,080
it's about it means when you're a bald guy who's a perv yeah, and it was about

516
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,240
a different guy. It's not about you, but it's just unfortunate that it happened.

517
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,720
It's about Caleb. I'm bald. Why the perv Caleb? That's not about you. It's

518
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,880
by a different yeah that guy Caleb Knits and I TTS was his last name and it just

519
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,540
I mean it sucks that you're bald. It does kind of feels like a kind of a confirms

520
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,580
so that the idea of

521
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,960
must be the same. Oh, and his name's Caleb. Oh, my God, it's kind of like

522
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,380
unfortunate, but yeah, it's not really your fault. Don't worry about it. So

523
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,980
you're growing, you're growing that out. Yeah, dude, I'm thinking I could do. I'm

524
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,880
going to grow it out and try to have a normal haircut. Yeah, I'm going to try to

525
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,740
do just a normal. I'm not going to do just do this one say put the.

526
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,640
Yeah, you

527
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,640
I'm bald. You got to get rid of this guy right here. I like that guy.

528
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,340
All right, you guys cool. Yeah,

529
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,640
I said you look like you look like the grandpa from house. You'll look like

530
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,240
the grandpa from House of a Thousand Corps and that's what I want to look

531
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,640
like as a grandpa. Yeah, I'm kind of going for a grandpa kind of look.

532
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,840
Yeah, you got tired of the completely bald shit. It's just a it's a hassle

533
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,540
man. Yeah, it's a hassle and the expectations of everybody around you.

534
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,480
Yeah. You know, they're like, Oh, let me touch your head.

535
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,400
Baldness is powerful. Oh my God, it's so smooth.

536
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Yeah. And everybody always says,

537
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
dude, I actually like it better when you're bald.

538
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,560
Yeah. Dude, shut up. No, you don't.

539
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
People say that? People say that all the time.

540
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,440
You like it better?

541
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,920
Oh, you actually have a good head for being bald.

542
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,600
Oh. Shut up, man.

543
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,200
Let me just, let me wallow.

544
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,000
That's what I've been saying. I've always said it.

545
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,240
If you are going bald, just don't get on finasteride.

546
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,320
Don't get on minoxidil. Just let that shit turn into the horseshoe.

547
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,320
And just don't pretend that it's cool. Just admit that you're suffering.

548
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Don't be like, "Oh, it's actually empowering to shave my head."

549
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
No, it's not, dude.

550
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
No, it's not empowering to shave your head.

551
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
It's a chore.

552
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,320
I thought you were saying, like, "Oh, don't act like you're suffering for the growing of the thing."

553
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
That's why I don't brush my teeth, man, because I gotta pick one.

554
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
I'm not gonna be in the bathroom for ten minutes every morning.

555
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Oh, speaking of teeth, that temporary filling that I had completely fell out,

556
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
and I didn't realize how big it was, and now there's a giant hole in my mouth.

557
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Just eat it.

558
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I did.

559
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Really?

560
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,760
eating a no. How many times have you eaten your teeth at this point? It's the same tooth

561
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,080
that remember I you just keep eating the same tooth. No, it's the same tooth that I cracked

562
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:18,880
like two years ago when we were. Were we doing the no I wasn't on the pod at that point. But

563
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,760
do you guys remember we were all hanging out at City Place and I cracked my I think you

564
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,760
were there. I cracked my tooth eating a gummy worm or something. Yeah. I think I was eating

565
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,260
a

566
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,560
yeah, I

567
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,520
that's a

568
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,280
you can't blame the gummy worm. No, no, no, it's my fault. I

569
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,800
that's what I was thinking. Yeah, I don't remember that. No, who was with me?

570
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Then I might have been with you. I just don't remember. It just didn't make an

571
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,560
impact on me. We were

572
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,080
you didn't like the first couple of times. We were like every time Patrick

573
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,000
is like dude remember like that. I don't remember anything. I especially don't

574
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,640
I don't remember any time that I met you before. I remember maybe three or four

575
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,200
things from the last fifteen years of my life. All right, what do you got?

576
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,300
Well, yesterday,

577
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,600
yesterday, I remember kind of, oh, I had pizza yesterday. Oh, yeah, pizza for

578
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,320
lunch. Remember that?

579
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:21,520
Oh, did I tell you guys I forgot how to tie my shoe? Yeah, yeah, you never knew.

580
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,680
You forget how to tie your shoe. Yeah. No, like I. You got him do that for you.

581
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,680
no, no, no, I like sat at the town. I tried to show you to tie your shoe a

582
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,280
bunch of times before I learned how to do it. I remember yeah, okay, so I

583
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,080
learned how to do it and I've been doing it for one number. Thanksgiving last

584
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,880
year, yeah, I learned how to time. I this was crazy. I learned how to tie my

585
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,880
shoe and this is about a year ago. I learned how to do the adult way, not the

586
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
bunny ears. I learned how to time my shoe the fast way and the other day I

587
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,520
was getting right. I was going to the gym, but on my my converse tied my left

588
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,700
one perfectly fine, did the same thing on the right, but it just didn't work and I

589
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,900
was like, what? And then I sat there for four minutes trying to do the same thing

590
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,220
over and over again and just failing and it didn't work at all and then

591
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,400
eventually it worked, but I think I had like a stroke. Yeah, I had four minutes

592
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,140
where I just sat there trying to loop one lace around the other and nothing

593
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,300
happened and I was like, am I crazy? Did they change this? The world has been

594
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,720
being updated lately. Yeah, something something taking away days. This was a

595
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,920
glitch in the matrix. Some might say some people on websites last night.

596
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,400
That's another glitch and we worked hard putting that trash out there.

597
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,160
I don't really think that that's a glitch. That's a glitch. That's more of

598
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,640
an oversight. Yeah, it's a glitch because the trash is supposed to disappear

599
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,200
overnight. I don't think no, it's guys. It's a job because we put it out too

600
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,640
like after they already came. We did the infinite probably which

601
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,160
infinite trash, which well what are you? They picked it up and it stayed here.

602
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,060
Now that will be a glitch. That would be crazy to sell it. If trash was worth

603
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,680
anything, if it wasn't, it's worth something to someone. One man's trash is

604
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,800
another man's treasure. My friend, something they wouldn't they wouldn't

605
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,680
make it a saying. If it wasn't true, some I guess that's a literal sense,

606
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,920
something in that trash was worth a lot to pierce last night. Somebody threw out

607
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,120
his Oreos. He I talked him through it and he threw them out. Wow, you convinced

608
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,600
him. Well, he was he kept out. He was complaining that I throw his Oreos and I

609
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,400
was like I did not throw your Oreos. I threw away a bunch of cans unless your

610
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,520
Oreos were in a can or in an empty bag of chips. I did not throw them away and

611
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,440
then he would kept being like no you did and then I was like I just literally

612
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,840
didn't. He said well, they were in a black plastic bag. I was like well, I

613
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,640
didn't throw that away and he was like oh wait. I did

614
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,400
you had a girlfriend argument with him. It wasn't really an argument. I was more

615
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I would say it was more of a therapy moment.

616
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Yeah.

617
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,440
It wasn't heated. It was more of a, I was kind of guiding him towards the light.

618
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,440
And was he grateful for you once he realized that you showed him?

619
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Yeah, he basically said I was the best guy ever.

620
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Really?

621
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
No.

622
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Oh, shit. Well, never mind.

623
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,440
But I didn't throw that shit away, man. I wouldn't throw away Oreos.

624
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
No, no, no, no, no.

625
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I can smell that shit. I'm like a...

626
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Why would I throw that away?

627
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,440
You see the blue Oreo thing, you're going to check immediately.

628
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Is there an Oreo in there?

629
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
There's an Oreo in there.

630
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,560
time my cousin had a sleeve of chips of hoi cookies that he left outside

631
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,900
overnight, and we woke up and we walked past, he put them on a bush, and we

632
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,600
woke up, we walked past and there was a snail, like sliding around on the

633
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,000
cookies, and he just took the snail off and ate all of them.

634
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,520
Oh. Isn't that disgusting?

635
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,240
I think about that all the time. Can a snail carry disease? A snail can carry

636
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,200
goo. It actually does carry goo and it drops it off as it goes. Yeah, it's

637
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,420
is mucus. Is it gooey though? Is it mucus? Yeah, I mean, some guys not

638
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,620
your mucus is the word for goo. Oh,

639
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,420
but it really disgusted me and it really stuck with me man. Yeah, mucus is

640
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,820
just what scientists learn. They can say instead of goo or slime, scientists

641
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,020
and doctors. That's kind of a bummer. Yeah, what is that? They don't say

642
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,940
slime, your slime membrane. Yeah, I wish it was called that. Oh, you've got

643
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,140
a lot of, you've got a lot of slime in your sinuses. You've got a lot

644
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,540
goo in your sinus. That's what I was wondering about all that pimple popper, all that fucking

645
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:11,980
stupid bullshit. What happened to just picking your boogers, man? It's allowed. I'm keeping

646
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:18,180
it alive and well, buddy. Where is the videos of a guy picking a booger and saying, "Check

647
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,680
how big this booger is." It's not as good though. They should make a Pluto TV channel

648
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,860
that's a split screen and half of it is for girls and it's pimple popper and the other

649
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,960
other half is for boys and it's a guy a fat guy picking his not

650
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,260
yes

651
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,560
and eating it. You oh dude,

652
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,920
that looked like a chunky way that was big and you set up a blanket for it

653
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,560
like a blanket curtain, a divider yeah like no screen sheet yeah yeah yeah

654
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,340
you can't screen cheat and look over at me watching a fat guy. He's a like

655
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,040
you're playing halo, he's eating boogers and he's drinking a beer and

656
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,440
then everyone so every like four scenes. There's one scene of a guy writing

657
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,820
the Cotty yeah, just like they did make that, though it was on crash box, but

658
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,760
you have to learn words from it. It was the

659
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,000
revolting slob. I saw the funniest final Jeopardy yeah. What do you say

660
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,240
thing about Pluto TV was it boogers? It was it was you know, so you know how

661
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,640
they like announce the category and then you you wager whatever you work. So

662
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,320
like you wager based on the category and they're like it was like a really

663
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,400
heated game. Everyone was like really close at the end, like final jeopardy

664
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,340
was really going to matter and then Alex Rebecca's like and for our fight, our

665
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,820
final jeopardy category is get your wages ready. It will be today geogra

666
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,340
flea.

667
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,220
Well,

668
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,600
you could see everyone is going like what

669
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:44,080
what was the my God, it was like it was like what deposed person like fled this

670
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,300
country like it was like oh okay, but L E yeah that was F L E, which made

671
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,940
geographically like bugs from different. Today's you it was it was much funnier

672
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,860
just with Alex Trebek's voice, say

673
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:01,180
geographically. Have you seen that about that and we'll be right back?

674
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,660
Have you

675
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,700
just a complete not who made do me

676
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,300
blue? The seeing everybody with

677
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,900
food

678
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,780
Have you seen that clip of Alex Trebek's, like it's the Alex Trebek bloopers,

679
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,860
where he's just going... Saying like, "Fucking God damn, fuck this shit." Yeah,

680
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,760
yeah. He's just being like, so like, you know, how he was, just like complete,

681
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,280
like, just like, "Oh my God, this guy's in complete... I can look at him,

682
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,300
I can just tell this guy's in complete control all the time." Yeah. And just

683
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,640
seeing him just go like, "Well, fuck." He says, "Fuck." The clip that I saw,

684
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,200
it's like he's about to say, like he's doing some TV promo and just goes like,

685
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,980
and we'll be the fuck

686
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,880
way. He says it. It's so

687
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,380
was so dude. He was the man. One of the greatest

688
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:58,180
regrets of my life is that I wasn't him really good at Jeopardy in time to be on

689
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,080
the episode of Jeopardy with Ken, when Ken Jennings was the host and that for

690
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Final Jeopardy, I could write in I'm going to kill you Ken Jennings. That

691
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,680
would have been really what is I'm going to kill

692
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,040
- That would have been so sick. - Just drooling over the scratch marks.

693
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
- He's not on it anymore? - No, it's someone else now.

694
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,200
- Still Mayim Balik? - Yeah, I think so.

695
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,120
I don't watch the current episode, so I don't know.

696
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,800
- I think it should be my ass, dude. - Yeah, I think so too.

697
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
- I'd be on there. - They should make a show called

698
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,480
- Chill Jeopardy. - Yes.

699
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,160
I have been watching so much Jeopardy. I'm existing in a crazy psychic dimension

700
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,840
where I'm every-- we're working on this sketch show that has passed by the time

701
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,400
- this episode has come out. - It actually was so fire.

702
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,560
left all day thinking about the sketch show. Then I go home and

703
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,260
immediately fall asleep watching Jeopardy. I think it's cooking my

704
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,000
brain. Yeah, but it's probably making you smarter. You would think so, but

705
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,840
instead it's making me have strange dreams. Okay, what is a what is

706
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,240
okay? Wait, what is exactly this

707
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,740
this

708
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,420
chocolate

709
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:06,280
what is guy? Whoa, chocolate guy was the mascot for what deodorant brand

710
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:11,840
in 2006. What is that? Wait, there's two guys. He won, but you said, but yeah,

711
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,060
no, it's not what it would be. Chocolate guy. So it's really two questions. You

712
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:23,120
had it. You made two chocolate guy was the mascot for this deodorant company.

713
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,840
This child, you need a photo to say this chocolate guy. Well, I'm not the expert

714
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:34,840
even then you're like him. It would be this this deodorant brand used a

715
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,440
chocolate guy in an ad campaign. Okay, all right, is that what is axe? Okay,

716
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,140
which is which is what I would say. If somebody said what is axe, I would say

717
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,120
this today's final jeopardy category will be chocolate guys in deodorant

718
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,800
commercials. Yeah, exactly.

719
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,300
Chocolate guys through history

720
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,480
will be yellow sponges that live in bikini bottom. Chocolate guys through

721
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,160
history.

722
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
(Laughter)

723
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Well, let's say, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait. Let's reverse, we're going to reverse engineer a Jeopardy category right now.

724
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
We're just engineering.

725
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,160
100 for 100. I mean, obviously, it's going to be Gloppy. That's the easiest one.

726
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
Who's Gloppy?

727
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Candyland.

728
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Oh, okay.

729
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,160
This chocolate guy lives in his own swamp.

730
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
I think it starts at 200.

731
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
Okay.

732
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Well, this is low stakes Jeopardy.

733
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Yeah. Okay, then 200 would be Gloppy immediately.

734
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:33,460
yeah okay, and then the question would be this is who this is who is that this

735
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:33,800
guy

736
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,000
what

737
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,020
and he lives in a chocolate swamp okay four hundred

738
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,380
axe guy okay, six hundred

739
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,080
what's another chocolate guy. So this is so

740
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,920
jeopardy not so easy to make

741
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,360
right, you're saying, oh, I can do jeopardy, then you can't did chocolate

742
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,200
you can't you pick too insane of a category. I'm going to be honest with

743
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,600
you. No, I think that there's another there's more chocolate.

744
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:08,300
Jeopardy thing that I was thinking about that is how like can you imagine

745
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,500
watching Jeopardy your whole life sitting at home on the couch and like

746
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,500
you know, yell is you say the answers out loud. Yeah, your girlfriend doesn't

747
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,100
care every time that they ask a question and you do that every single

748
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,900
night for years and years years and for your birthday. You finally she gets

749
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,000
your ticket to go be in the studio audience for jeopardy and you go to

750
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,600
that you go there and you have to sit there and every single question they

751
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,260
ask you have to be completely silent. Yeah, I would get kicked out in five

752
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,380
minutes. I would I would not be able to. I would literally a completely

753
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,460
involuntarily just be like Oh, what is ax

754
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,500
yeah? They would ruin the entire episode and they'd kick me. They have a quiet

755
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,100
room for jeopardy like church yeah.

756
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,180
it's a room full of guys, it's a room full of dudes and there's just like a

757
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,900
sheet of glass and it's just guys sitting there just going like

758
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,620
I literally I would do that. So I single time I go

759
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,060
oh, even if I didn't say the answer every time I go, oh yeah, that would

760
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,300
actually be this is another amazing jeopardy idea. So first of all, this

761
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,060
episode would have chocolate guys through history, but then it's there's a

762
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,460
little glass little like club room. You pay an extra two hundred, I guess they

763
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,220
have to put you in there, but in that room is a bar and you can watch

764
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,980
Jeopardy! live like it's the

765
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,580
executive booth at the football game. I'm sure that you can probably already

766
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,020
get a drink at the Jeopardy! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is a

767
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,340
room, this is a room, this is a room where you can stand with

768
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,220
six other guys that look exactly like you. Banging bullet proof glass.

769
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,820
Banging bullet proof glass going, "Let me out, let me out, I know the

770
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,760
answer. Well, no you're in there watching putting a hundred dollars like

771
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,360
the scene and scream is that scream to or scream three where they're in the

772
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:50,900
like the

773
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,560
fucking soundproof room and everything getting killed. If you have negative

774
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,980
money on jeopardy, you owe them my you owe them money. That's the worst part

775
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,860
about it. I think you I would never think it depends on the on the like

776
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,860
because I think sometimes I think you still want money if you're negative,

777
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,320
but I think it really depends on I think they pay you for your your well. I was

778
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,740
watching episode the other day where someone ended with negative money and

779
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,980
they said you go home with a thousand dollars, but I don't know if that's if

780
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,940
it was like a special. We need to I think that game shows are far behind the

781
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,360
inflation rate and we need to every game show should be for a million bucks. I

782
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,980
think it's not I'm not playing giant fucking putt putt if it's not for a

783
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,540
million dollars. Well, you if you you're not you don't really win jeopardy

784
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,660
unless you win you with fifty days in a row and win three million dollars. Yeah,

785
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,960
nobody cares if you won one episode. Well, I would care well, it doesn't matter.

786
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,960
I'm saying I'm saying that's the that's the inflation valve there. What's that?

787
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,300
The people who win they're winning seven? How do you even study for jeopardy? You

788
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,440
just have to be an annoying person. Yeah, very annoying person. Think about every

789
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,740
single jeopardy, all the Arthur to Ken Jennings,

790
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,460
may embolic

791
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,940
the I've got celebrity jeopardy. There's a got one guy who's a bartender who's the

792
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,320
first one Watson knowing no no Watson is another annoying guy. The IBM, the IBM

793
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,720
computer computer that thing is fucking annoying. It's annoying really a

794
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,000
bartender, though no, but I know this in the future yeah could be probably yeah

795
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,480
yeah. The bartender guy is really annoying. He's just like he's like

796
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,120
I'm a bar and he shakes his buzzer. The sports betting guy, you know that guy,

797
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,640
the guy who has the record. He smiles like this

798
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
you

799
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:39,560
God and he makes jokes all the time. What kind of fit would you get off of the

800
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,420
jeopardy shit? Oh man shirt mesh mesh shirt, swim trunks,

801
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:52,020
bottom print sponge Bob Matt painting print yeah, swim trunks with the

802
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:58,400
flippers to him. Yeah, get the flip group, goggles, a floaty, a floaty and

803
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,040
you got to be ready and yeah we're going to be and then we're going to be

804
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,680
having the Tom and Jerry hobo style top hat with the tin can opening. Yes,

805
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,480
yes,

806
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,400
and then fingerless gloves with study, a Ocarson style, yeah, yep, and then

807
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,360
fingerless gloves with an embroidered that says

808
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:22,600
on the back, he showed up like a home, and I'll be wearing pit vipers,

809
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,480
sunglasses on the back of my head and standing backwards the whole time.

810
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,060
what would you put your name down as Fudd?

811
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,500
I would put my name down as Ken Jennings, Junior

812
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,340
Frank is s

813
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,160
reverse Jennings

814
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,460
so

815
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:46,160
and a returning to

816
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,260
reverse Jennings.

817
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:54,360
What isn't

818
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,960
that's not the rules reverse yeah

819
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,420
Oh, man,

820
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:06,460
that's so funny. Doing the backwards man on Jeopardy would be pretty awesome.

821
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,740
I need to be on Jeopardy. I was laughing. I think you could get on there.

822
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,860
I was imagining just like... I don't think I could win, though. I wish that

823
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:17,080
your reality TV show thing worked out, man. Me too. I'll make it onto reality

824
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,420
TV. I'm probably gonna marry one of the girls from Vanderpump Rules or something.

825
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:24,780
Whoa. One of the pumps? I guess. Is that their name? Vanderpump? Yeah,

826
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,940
Lisa Vanderpump. Oh, God, is she beautiful? Yes. Holy shit. Is she the

827
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,300
Is she the one who's on Real Housewives?

828
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
I think so.

829
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Is she British?

830
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,300
No.

831
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,300
No?

832
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Who's the British Lisa?

833
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,300
Is Lisa Vanderpump British?

834
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,300
I really don't know.

835
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,300
I thought that she was...

836
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,300
You know what?

837
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,300
I wish we had the TV so we could look at a picture of Lisa.

838
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,300
I get Vanderpump mixed up with Big Ange.

839
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,340
I don't know who that is.

840
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,660
Big Suze from Peep Show?

841
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,780
No, no, no, no.

842
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,780
Big Ange?

843
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
Big Ange was this...

844
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,140
Oh, she was on Real Housewives, right?

845
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

846
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,140
She was like the Italian one?

847
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,140
Which housewife?

848
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,140
She was like a Long Island...

849
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,000
you look like a surfboard. She's the British real housewife. Okay. This is

850
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,780
Lisa Vanderpump. Hello, Lisa. Hello, Lisa. Hello. Hello, Lisa.

851
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,040
Oh, and her husband, this is her husband. Her husband is cool. I forget

852
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,540
his name,

853
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,100
but he looks like this. Oh, my God.

854
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,440
He looks great. Is that Rod Stewart? What the hell? He looks amazing. He

855
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,640
looks like a honey bun, dude. His skin is exactly the same shading. That's

856
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,480
the... It doesn't suck that when you're that guy's age, that's pretty much the

857
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,580
the best you can hope for yeah. He has a pretty good life yeah. He's I mean in

858
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,940
terms of those surgeries to make himself look like that yeah yeah that's like

859
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,420
about it. That's about as good as a sixty five year old guy looks yeah yeah

860
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,580
you either you either have to end up. I feel like your your your options are you

861
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,820
either go down the like

862
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:51,900
glasses on a on a string, yeah, Albert Einstein kind of path or you can go down

863
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:57,080
the kind of Robert Pollard guided by voices path where you're the cool old

864
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,120
guy and you're kind of fat, but you wear a T shirt and that's kind of cool.

865
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:06,480
Or the only way you can break out of that, I feel like, is if you take

866
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,640
steroids. Is that is the Robert Robert Kennedy? Is that the same type? Yeah,

867
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,040
that's the that's the last three. There's two branching paths that go

868
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,620
left and right and then the Kennedy path goes up. Yeah, it's a up to heaven.

869
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,660
That's the scale and then there's the Z axis.

870
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:26,660
That's what I'm going to be. I'm going to be like one of those old guys who's like 4% body fat,

871
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,660
but still doesn't have abs and instead just has like two humps on the front of their body.

872
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,660
I want that shit.

873
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:37,660
I'm going straight for the Gillesse's string. I'm going straight for Benjamin Franklin.

874
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,660
I just can't imagine that there will ever be a day where you're like,

875
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,660
"All right, time to put the dime sweatshirt down and pick up the polo."

876
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,780
Yeah, you're on the Jerry Seinfeld path.

877
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:55,380
I was going to say it would be so funny to show up to Jeopardy wearing the exact outfit

878
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,780
that Jerry Seinfeld wore in that Kith ad.

879
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:05,900
And to an extent where it's like, everyone is looking at you and they're like, "Oh my

880
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,900
God."

881
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,740
That clip of Jared Leto, have you seen this one where it's like Jared Leto is sitting

882
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:16,900
at a runway, see somebody wearing this green fucking guest like suit and then

883
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,900
he shows up to the Suicide Squad premiere in that. That's bad. It's so clear

884
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,340
that I like saw Jerry Seinfeld in that Kith outfit and then I bought the exact

885
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:33,020
every single thing that he wore in that. That'd be sick man. I think copying, if

886
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,380
you're gonna copy, you got to go all out. Yeah. And there's a lot, I have respect

887
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,940
somebody's fully copying and not being like, oh I'm dressing up like this guy.

888
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,540
Just completely 100% stealing their outfit.

889
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,540
Every single, to the socks.

890
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,040
Maybe I'll steal your outfit.

891
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,040
You know whose jacket this might be?

892
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,040
This might be Connor's old jacket.

893
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,040
He saw me wearing this and was like,

894
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,040
"Did you buy that at like a thrift store in Manhattan?"

895
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,540
And I think he sold this to like a Buffalo Exchange or something.

896
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,540
And then you got it?

897
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,540
And then I bought it.

898
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,540
Holy crap.

899
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,040
It's insane.

900
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,040
I don't believe it though.

901
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,040
He was like, "Is that a Big Mac jacket?"

902
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,080
and I was like, "Yes, it is."

903
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,560
- Oh my God. - You only made one of it?

904
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,000
- They only made one of this jacket.

905
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,100
He made me take it off so that he could try it on

906
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,240
and see if it fit him the same way.

907
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:24,100
- That's one of the most interesting things I've ever heard.

908
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:24,940
- It's not that interesting.

909
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,120
- No, it is a little bit interesting.

910
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,580
- It is a little bit interesting,

911
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,420
but it's not the same thing that you were saying.

912
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:35,400
- Yeah, I was saying you need to copy somebody completely.

913
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,240
- 'Cause I didn't know Connor even owned this jacket.

914
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,440
I was saying maybe I would take your entire outfit, including the head. I mean, I already

915
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,360
have the headphones, but maybe I'd take the hat.

916
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,560
Here's what I would do if I was on Jeopardy. You know how after the first commercial break

917
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,560
they come over and they ask you...

918
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,560
You kind of look fly, right?

919
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,440
Yeah, you do look a little fly. You look more than a little fly, I'll be honest.

920
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Thank you, bro.

921
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,540
You look very, very fly. And you know how they ask the leading questions to make you

922
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:00,120
tell some fun fact about you? They're like, "So you met your wife in an interesting way."

923
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,120
Yeah.

924
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,680
And I'd be like, "What? What do you mean?"

925
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,920
What? I met her at school.

926
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,920
No, I didn't.

927
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,200
What do you mean? What the fuck?

928
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,380
So this says here you're a big fan of the beach. I'm not. No. I like the

929
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,700
mountains. Who told you that?

930
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,280
How did you get this information? Are you the feds?

931
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,080
Bro, keep it under wraps, dog. Don't tell it. I told you not to. I told you

932
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,280
to keep that in confidence. Okay, so I basically signed a fucking form. I

933
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,360
think the funniest thing to me you can do on any TV show is someone asks you

934
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,000
a question and you say, "What?" I think the funniest thing you can do is they

935
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:41,340
I ask you, you blow up. You explode. You explode at them, get really mad. Your meat flies all

936
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:45,280
over Alex Trebek's body the second he says anything to you because you're so nervous.

937
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,860
Did you know in the early 80s, when Jeopardy! first started, he was getting invited to BET

938
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:56,140
awards, not the BET awards, or no, the NAACP was trying to give him an award because they

939
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:02,980
thought he was a black guy. If you hold in a fart your entire life, will you explode?

940
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,580
You're trying to divert the...

941
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,580
No, sorry.

942
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,580
I was just doing something separate.

943
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,580
Well, you won't poop then.

944
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,580
Yeah.

945
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,580
Well, no.

946
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,580
Well, yeah.

947
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,580
Okay, you don't poop and you don't fart.

948
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,580
Will you explode?

949
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,580
There is a mancer.

950
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,580
Your digestive system...

951
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,580
That's what I'm asking you.

952
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,580
You have a lot of impacted poop.

953
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,580
Yeah.

954
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,980
So, I don't know.

955
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Yeah, maybe you're...

956
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,980
I guess you're...

957
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,340
Probably your intestine might burst.

958
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,780
Have you seen the videos where they drain the cow of the air?

959
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,780
Yes.

960
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,780
We talked about this.

961
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,780
The excess methane.

962
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,500
I learned about this from you because you showed me the video of the...

963
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:38,260
make the fire. Yeah, the methane thing. No, no, you know what it was? The porthole on the

964
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:45,060
cow. Oh yeah, that's different. I almost cried thinking about that happening to me. But sometimes

965
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:50,900
they stab a hole in the cow and they let out all the air, or the methane. And it looks

966
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,380
like it would feel maybe good to put your face in front of it. No, because that would

967
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:59,580
be like putting your, that would be like holding down a lighter and just doing that. No, not

968
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,580
not the fire. You would not like yeah,

969
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:08,580
well, no, because it would be at really fast velocity. It would feel like

970
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,500
getting a blow out. No, I don't think you know what getting a blow out feels

971
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,500
like. I probably you will soon. You think I'm going to grow my hair, go get

972
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,020
a blow out,

973
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,020
look like Travis Drit. You got

974
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:26,940
I think it'd be bad. Grow your hair out

975
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,420
least. All right, looking like Travis Tritt. You grow a little goatee. Oh wait, I

976
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,700
got to pull up. You got to see what he looks like. What's he from? He's from

977
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:41,780
country music. Oh, I thought he, who's the guy from that other thing? The flock of

978
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,660
seagulls. Oh my god, yes, I want to look like that. Put it to the GoPro. Scott

979
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,780
Stapp, you're thinking. There's a really, really, just show the camera. He looks

980
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:57,140
beautifully. Here it is. He looks good. Caleb looking like this. Show it without the hat though, because you were showing pictures of his hair.

981
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:01,900
hair. I think that'd be bad ass dude. Yeah. See that's the kind of hair I'm going to.

982
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:07,860
I want to go for giant like a gemstone dude. Giant fucking forehead. Some kind of a affliction

983
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:13,180
t shirt and some long balding hair. I think this would be a really good look for me. I

984
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:20,540
think my haircut will look like that soon. This is what Caleb could look like in a year.

985
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,780
I think that I will. We gotta fly you to Turkey. I will look like that in a year. You can't

986
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,040
grow that shit out. We got to fly you to Turkey.

987
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,980
I'll grow it. If I was focused, I could.

988
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,140
Yeah. All right. Let's see it.

989
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,140
I'll goatee.

990
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,420
I'll grow it out right now.

991
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,060
Let's see. Let's see you get a goatee.

992
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,060
I'm trying to grow it.

993
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,560
You need to look like this, dude.

994
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,940
You're right. I have no other option in my life than to go down this path now.

995
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:46,140
He looks good, man.

996
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,140
You would look good with flip flops.

997
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,900
No, I'm just a bit. You would look, you would go crazy with this, dude.

998
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,300
Go crazy on the...

999
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,140
You look like the button down the affliction button down with that too.

1000
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,300
Oh my God.

1001
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,300
I love this new.

1002
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,300
Pinstripe everything.

1003
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,100
I love this new leaf we're turning.

1004
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,540
Some of these jeans with the pinstripes on the back.

1005
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,540
You're going to get.

1006
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,540
Pinstripe cross on the front of my jeans.

1007
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,660
Noah's going to take you to the truey store.

1008
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,660
I need that shit.

1009
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,740
Oh my God.

1010
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,820
And I'm not going to sag it dude.

1011
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,820
That's disrespectful.

1012
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,540
How come different brands of clothing get their own store?

1013
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,540
For marketing purposes.

1014
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,540
That's a very good point.

1015
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,540
It's just not.

1016
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,540
There's a lot of type of stores.

1017
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,340
We need to open the Potabat List Outlet Mall.

1018
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:25,740
Yes, oh my God, I've been thinking about this for I want to I want to own a

1019
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,380
zoomies yeah zoomies. We could have a puma outlet. Yes,

1020
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,060
Adidas,

1021
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:36,740
we put them right across from each other right because the history, yes, they

1022
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:41,180
have and we would also our Adidas would say all dre, all dre, I dream,

1023
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,220
all day I dream about sex, all day, all dre, I dream and then inside one of

1024
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,740
the stores there will be an auntie and and then inside the auntie ends, there

1025
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,700
would be a cold stone creamery. Yeah wow and also we would do an on the ends

1026
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,660
mixture, cold stone creamery and auntie ends where they chop up a pretzel and

1027
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,960
mix it with a bunch of cheese

1028
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,580
and I was thinking okay. I actually got hot dogs on pretzels yeah that sounded

1029
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:07,520
so good to me. They chop it into a disgusting goo and they put it in a cup.

1030
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,120
I was and I say I gotta have it. They sell that I was thinking that auntie

1031
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,840
ends

1032
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,880
like the pretzel cut up and then put into like a

1033
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,520
like a caramel ice cream.

1034
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,240
- Oh, that sounds good as fuck, actually.

1035
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,400
- A pretzel on ice cream is--

1036
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,720
- Salted caramel ice cream with pretzels.

1037
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,880
- All right, well, we know that you're gonna become a chef.

1038
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,480
- All right, well, so to end this episode,

1039
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,880
we have an exciting bonus feature,

1040
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,360
that an outtake from the last regular episode.

1041
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,840
So today we did the six fingers of music on YouTube.

1042
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,680
Today we're gonna do the seventh finger,

1043
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,800
the forbidden seventh finger,

1044
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,520
and Caleb is about to rap over the seventh finger of music.

1045
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,160
- I'm gonna rap, oh shit.

1046
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,360
- So are you ready, Caleb?

1047
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,360
Here's the 7th finger.

1048
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,360
And I have a show to announce.

1049
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:54,840
Yeah, oh man, back in the fuckin', back in the studio, over the finger.

1050
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,600
I'm a fuckin' rapper, not a singer.

1051
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,120
Chillin' with my homies, watchin' T-

1052
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,480
Watchin' T- sorry, I'm tryin' to catch the beat.

1053
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,040
I'm back in the studio, back with the finger.

1054
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,240
Yeah, I fuckin' rap, but I'm not a fuckin' singer.

1055
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,360
Patrick and Cam, I'm back with the mans.

1056
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,920
We back with the hands, throw hands, throw bands.

1057
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,620
Throw my man, throw my...

1058
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:22,100
Pop my gun, AK-47 for fun.

1059
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,080
AR-15 with the silencer on it.

1060
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,780
Got a bunch of motherfucking rhymes that are on it.

1061
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,080
And this, man, this finger...

1062
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,340
- Let the beat breathe, man.

1063
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,720
- This finger is fucking hard, dude.

1064
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,040
- They're gonna do this one on Swayze.

1065
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,060
- This is a really hard finger.

1066
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,920
Alright, I give up on this finger.

1067
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,260
I give up on this finger.

1068
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,960
I can't do this finger, man.

1069
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,980
I do have a show to promote.

1070
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,840
Next month, November 17th, me and my buddy Gus Viveiros, guys, we are doing

1071
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,800
two half hours, that makes one hour, of comedy, stand-up style at the Yard

1072
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,840
Theater. I don't have a link for the tickets. In Los Angeles. But I will soon.

1073
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:05,040
In sunny Los Angeles. Oh, and also I'm still opening for Girl God in Chicago,

1074
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,320
and then I got a bunch of shows in New York, too. No, you don't. All right. Bye,

1075
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,720
Bye friends. Bye. And I'm going to show Cameron my wiener.

1076
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:25,240
At the library. Okay, your turn. I'm at the library.

1077
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,440
I've taken out six books at a time. I'm at the library.

1078
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,680
I'm doing more of a hook at this time. I think I did more. You were,

1079
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,240
I was saying doing more of the hooks at this time.

1080
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,000
But this might help.

1081
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,180
Reading is not a crime.

1082
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,920
I do it all the time.

1083
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,320
Whoa.

1084
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,820
I'm reading books about limes.

1085
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,200
Damn.

1086
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,720
I'm reading books about limes.

1087
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,720
Lime scooter.

1088
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,480
Hit her in the cooter.

1089
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,120
Hit her?

1090
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,920
Wait, drop a gunshot.

1091
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,000
Hit her in her cooter.

1092
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
With a lime scooter?

1093
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,880
With a lime scooter.

1094
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,080
Lime scooter directly to the cooter.

1095
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,000
Doing some evil kenevil shit into a woman's thing.

1096
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,880
I'm evil.

1097
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,720
This is a good way to learn about your instincts.

1098
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,720
My instincts.

1099
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,480
Store hurting women's vaginas.

1100
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,680
Hurting women's vaginas with cutting edge application based technology.

1101
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,240
Using an application vehicle to hurt a woman or thing.

1102
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,040
I went in a self-driving car.

1103
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,160
Really?

1104
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,520
Tell us about it.

1105
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,680
I was in...

1106
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,360
Oh yo.

1107
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,000
I don't...

1108
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,560
Well, I was in Phoenix basically and...

1109
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,480
A rap is about it.

1110
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,480
Yeah, you have to rap about it.

1111
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,580
Yo, imagine a whir-

1112
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,280
Well, actually turn this beat-

1113
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,480
Uh, keep it the same actually.

1114
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,280
I was in a car that had nobody driving in it.

1115
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,880
I felt like a creamed spinach.

1116
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,580
I had- I literally got exploded on with the whole vehicle exploded.

1117
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,980
It was crazy. Phoenix fell into the earth.

1118
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,580
And then I- and then I blow up all crazy.

1119
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,380
I have no- I have no idea what's happening to me.

1120
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,980
I got a lobster hot pocket.

1121
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,180
Oh.

1122
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,340
I met two hot two two girls with two lobster hot pockets.

1123
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,220
That's again, the self-driving vehicle.

1124
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,060
You got to go down and I could show you what it's like when I'm laughing at Jason.

1125
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:12,580
See you.

1126
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:24,660
Vehicle to see a goal is insanely good, man.

1127
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,380
That's the type of shit that I'm expressing myself about for a second.

1128
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:28,140
All right, Cameron.

1129
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:28,640
Okay.

1130
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,740
Well,

1131
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:36,340
Well, I'm sitting here and I can't...

1132
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,340
Oh, it ended.

1133
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:37,340
[outro]

1134
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,340
(Boo!)
