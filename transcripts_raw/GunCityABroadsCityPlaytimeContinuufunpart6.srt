1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Last time on Gun City Abroad City, Space Time Continue Fun.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The party split continued down their respective paths, with Patrick Yoda pursuing his hot lead into the undercity,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and Blotas and Ray pursuing an even hotter lead with the snake Blotas had sex with twice.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Patrick and Baby Gadd made their way to a huge-ass fax's HQ, the Lair of Fax,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I have to keep going.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's what Jubio does.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Or Gun City for that matter.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Such are the benefits of a sovereign outside the draconian bounds of E-Bomb.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sure that sentence made perfect.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let me start from the beginning of that sentence.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Uh, here we go.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Patrick and Baby Gadd made their way to Huge-Ass Facts' HQ, the Larifax,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
where brokers of secrets gather and share information that can't be tracked by any system in the New England Empire.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Or Gun City for that matter.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Such are the benefits of a sovereign outside the draconian bounds of E-Bomb.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sure that sentence made perfect.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me start from the beginning of that sentence.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Uh, here we go.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,720
or Gun City for that matter, such are the benefits of a sovereign outside the draconian bounds

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
of E-Bow.

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,720
There, they met Kenan Thompson, flamboyant assistant to Ms. I like the word draconian.

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
I don't need the bull-head.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
No.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
I'm saying the word draconian.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
No, no, no.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
No.

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,720
You're hallucinating him making a face about that.

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
No.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
It's not my word choices.

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
No, no, no.

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
It's totally fair.

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
You're going crazy.

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
I am going crazy tonight.

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
No, no, no.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,360
Kenan Thompson, flamboyant assistant to Ms. Janet Blowjob, high-ranking member of Huge-Ass

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,480
Fax's gang.

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,840
Kenan led Patrick and Baby Gadd straight to Ms. Janet Blowjob, since they had some intel

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,480
to share about Gumby Superior, captain of the Pleasure Palace Space Station.

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,920
After giving her the intel, where he more or less admitted to wanting to destroy Huge-Ass

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Fax's gang and potentially the Undercity.

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,920
Janet Blowjob let Patrick know that he's welcome to stay in the guest room in his suite, where

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,760
he can play video games and rest up before tomorrow, where he'll meet Huge-Ass Fax himself.

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,360
Meanwhile, Blowtoss and Ray met with the scientist Ebenezer Keech in the GUTS station, in the

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,040
command station of the GUTS, who was somewhat underwhelming.

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,220
He didn't see anything too unusual about the snake that was uh, had all the sexy holes in it and sent our boys away

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,020
However, his assistant, the red-headed Reddy

54
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,080
Offered to give them more insight into what the scientists might be hiding by moving further into the guts

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,040
However, it seems that this may have been a trap. As soon as the boys slid down, went into the fucking thing

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,360
They slid down a chute deep into the guts of the ship.

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,860
Shit, wait.

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,360
What did you write, fucking thing?

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,320
No, I was just remembering, I was trying to remember.

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,200
I realized that I missed a part, so.

61
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,040
(laughing)

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,620
Where they sat upon a pile of discarded toys

63
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,440
and scattered flesh and corpse matter.

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
And worst of all, a terrifying sexual tentacle monster

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,800
was here to take down these fearless parents

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,960
of an erstwhile penguin.

67
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,280
What does erstwhile mean?

68
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
Oh shit.

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
You tell us, you wrote it.

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
You better know off the top of your head what that means,

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,240
otherwise this is the most embarrassing moment in your life.

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,280
- It's like, um, like a--

73
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
- It's like while you were--

74
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,960
- What was.

75
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,080
It's like what was, like a,

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
like a, what was a penguin.

77
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,240
If I'm, oh shit, maybe I don't know what it means.

78
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,720
- As I just now realized I don't know what it means.

79
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,840
I've probably read that word a trillion times.

80
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
- Yeah, you read a lot.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,500
- I've read basically everything.

82
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,340
- Yeah, like former, yeah.

83
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,760
- I've probably read that word two times.

84
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,440
- I looked it up, made sure, yeah, it's like former.

85
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Like what was.

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,100
- Okay, I would've read that.

87
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,080
- See, there's a difference that 30 makes.

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,760
- I don't know why I wrote erstwhile though.

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,800
He is a penguin.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
I guess I was just feeling myself.

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,880
- He's a hybrid.

92
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,760
- I guess he was a penguin at one point.

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,600
- Combatant.

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,420
- He's barely anything.

95
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,800
- That's why I wrote it, 'cause he was a penguin.

96
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,120
- No, you used it correctly.

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
- Yeah, I think it's--

98
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,880
- I was a penguin.

99
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,080
- I wasn't trying to undermine you.

100
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,040
- And then you guys put a water bottle on his head

101
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
and put his brain in there.

102
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,800
- Oh yeah, he has a water bottle.

103
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
- He was a--

104
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,560
- Hey wait, what does he sound like?

105
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,600
- Oh yeah, that's good.

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
- Yeah, let's get the tentacle monster out on the field

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,220
You're gonna you guys are gonna roll for initiative. Holy fuck tentacle monster

108
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,960
Yeah, you Jinx. I'm a you're a 10 tackle monster cuz I'll tackle you 10 times

109
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,720
I'll tickle you on your 10 toes get up 11. I do

110
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,980
Wanna play 5 to 10 of your toes in my mouth

111
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:57,320
You need to stop stacking blocks man. Okay, who made the blocks fall so you're not in this scene. It's you -

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
- Whoa, that is cool.

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,240
- You're amazing.

114
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
- You're a G.

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
- You're amazing.

116
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,240
- Fuck.

117
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,500
(laughing)

118
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,620
- You guys are probably about, let's get the,

119
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,000
yeah, so each of these squares, as you guys usually know,

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,460
are about five feet each.

121
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,560
You have your move set.

122
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's get the D20s out, let's roll initiative.

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
I will roll, yeah, let's--

124
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
- Stop being same timing as me.

125
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,120
- Me.

126
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,240
- Fuck.

127
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,160
- All right.

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
- Not a very good initiative by the tentacle.

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
- Okay, well I'm going to be--

130
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,080
- Okay, if Caleb and me roll the same initiative--

131
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,920
- Roll the same initiative at the same time.

132
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,600
- I'm going to kill myself!

133
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,800
(laughing)

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
- 15.

135
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
- 10.

136
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,520
- Oh my god, I saw the one, I got worried.

137
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,840
- Plus, add your decks.

138
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,680
- Oh shit, wait.

139
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,500
- Your initiative.

140
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,800
- 12 total.

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
- Oh, and I have a negative three decks.

142
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
- Fuck you.

143
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,480
- I actually do have negative one, so.

144
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
- That's too bad.

145
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,140
- 14.

146
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,980
- The bugs that could have been.

147
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,120
- You still go first, though.

148
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
- Let's try it.

149
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,000
- You still got first, Ray.

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,320
- Well good, I'm the only fucking person

151
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,120
on the board right now, so.

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
- Where is me?

153
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
- Let's do this thing!

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,520
- Oh, my guy's laying in a stain.

155
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,240
- Come on, bros, let's do this.

156
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,480
- So, as you see a tentacle monster come into frame,

157
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,240
you also now notice that there are like, human guys.

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,480
(laughing)

159
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,720
- Okay.

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
(laughing)

161
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
- Wait, let me take a look at this end.

162
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,720
- I think I do notice that.

163
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,840
Human guys, you note section.

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
- Attached to the tentacle monster.

165
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,080
- Human guys.

166
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,800
- And they are attached, like they're gripping it,

167
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,120
and their pants are down.

168
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
- Oh.

169
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,160
- And their heads are kind of exorcist

170
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,320
all the way turned around,

171
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,480
and they're looking at you,

172
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,520
and their eyes are rolled to the back of their head.

173
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,320
- Do not be about to make me say

174
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,920
not me fighting a tentacle monster with the gripper.

175
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,680
Do not.

176
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,240
- I don't actually got a list track of what you wanted me to

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,960
- Don't make me say not me fighting the monster

178
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
with the gripper.

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,720
- Okay. - Yeah.

180
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't make me say not me fighting the grip reaper monster

181
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
with the tentacles.

182
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,480
- The grip reaper should be the name.

183
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,240
- The gorilla grip reaper.

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
Not me, don't say, don't I say not me saying that.

185
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,680
Or not me doing that.

186
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,800
- Ray, what do you wanna do?

187
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,840
- I want to join in.

188
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,740
- You wanna join?

189
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,040
- Well this is for human guys, clearly.

190
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,520
And you're not really a computer guy.

191
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,440
You think I don't like pussy?

192
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,280
- It's not pussy.

193
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,120
- You saying I don't like pussy?

194
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,940
- It's not pussy.

195
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,280
- You think that's pussy?

196
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,120
- Definitely.

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,940
- It's tentacles.

198
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,780
- You sexually harassed me in the very first episode.

199
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,120
- I love, I love pussy.

200
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
- You don't like pussy.

201
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
- I fucking.

202
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,360
- You fucking hate it.

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
- I love pussy.

204
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,680
- Okay, maybe you do, but your character wouldn't.

205
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,840
- No, I hate pussy.

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
My character loves pussy.

207
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
- And plus this isn't pussy.

208
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,360
- Well then I'm going.

209
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,840
- Maybe you have some twisted idea.

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
- All right, then I guess I'll kill it.

211
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,800
- It's, you know, there's a few kinds of orifices.

212
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,320
- I'm gonna use a sexual grenade.

213
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,080
- Wait, describe the orifices.

214
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,360
- So there are a number of tentacles, as we know,

215
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,440
on tentacle monsters, upwards of eight.

216
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,600
Each, four of them have--

217
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,080
- Don't tell me they all have their own fucking health bar.

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,920
- Okay. - No, no, no, nothing like that.

219
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,640
- But they have special abilities, each different?

220
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,200
- I'm not gonna say that they don't.

221
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,520
- And they all have individual personalities?

222
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,280
- That they don't have.

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,120
They all have the same personalities.

224
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,940
- They do. - And it's,

225
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,560
don't tell me that it's a beholder.

226
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,360
- No, that-- - Damn.

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,600
and a whole, like, whole--

228
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,440
- I'm a little mad that it's not a Beholder.

229
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,480
- Don't tell me that I--

230
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
- I could have called it that,

231
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,520
but I probably should have called it that.

232
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,800
- Or a Behold Her.

233
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,640
- Yeah.

234
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,560
- I didn't come up with it.

235
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,680
- Okay, well, I just rolled a nat 20,

236
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,960
so are you going to acknowledge this?

237
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,240
- Are you throwing a sexual grenade?

238
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
- Yeah.

239
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,680
- Damn, that's gonna, yeah, I mean, that's gonna crit,

240
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,400
so roll crit for that.

241
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,240
- What does that mean?

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,080
- So look up the damage. - I don't have any

243
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,200
of my info on here.

244
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,040
- Oh.

245
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,220
- Because it just says--

246
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,060
- What does it just say?

247
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:59,940
It says plus 9 to the attack and 0 plus fire.

248
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,380
0 plus fire.

249
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,180
Man, I mean, it says this.

250
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,380
I think it's 2d8, if I'm correct, for a regular hit.

251
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,420
Can we take a look at it?

252
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,740
You want me to take a look at it?

253
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,580
All right, so I forgot that I left the sheet at home again,

254
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,820
so I got to use the roll 21.

255
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,060
So I know it's being targeted.

256
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,980
It's all my fault.

257
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,380
Yep, and I don't even get to write.

258
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,900
Oh, this looks a lot better now than they used to have this.

259
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,380
Cool.

260
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,660
So free advertising is also something that you're doing.

261
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,820
- Well I didn't say what the app was we're looking at.

262
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,660
- No, while we're at it.

263
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,640
- Can you open up Caleb's messages

264
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,740
while you have that in front of the camera?

265
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,060
- I will not do that.

266
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,060
I'm way too respectful.

267
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,900
- Okay.

268
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,720
- Joke's on you.

269
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,560
- Why does it just say zero?

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,520
- My phone's too little to read anything on it.

271
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,580
- It is too little.

272
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,580
This should say 2D8.

273
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,940
I mean, I just know off the top of my head.

274
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,760
I'm just not going with that.

275
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,900
- Okay, well I'm glad that you wasted all of our time.

276
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,300
- All right, I was gonna double check.

277
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,420
But okay, so you're gonna roll 4D8.

278
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,580
- 4D8?

279
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,420
- 48.

280
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,780
- No, don't. - No, come on.

281
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,220
All right. - Yeah, no you come on.

282
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,060
- Seven.

283
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,700
- Okay.

284
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,060
- A three.

285
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,460
- All right.

286
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,300
Keep it up.

287
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,140
- A four.

288
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,460
And a 519.

289
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,020
- That's beautiful. - Nice.

290
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,140
- That's gonna be a pretty hefty hit.

291
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,500
- That is a very hefty hit.

292
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,500
So yeah, you throw your sexual grenade, and you just--

293
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,780
- So that's gotta go, so this thing has a head?

294
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,300
- No, it's kind of indistinct.

295
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,060
- It's like tentacles and then like--

296
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,560
- Yeah, wait, did you describe the orifices

297
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,500
and I spaced out?

298
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,340
- Yeah, a little bit.

299
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,760
So I just didn't get to finish really.

300
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,220
No, it's fine.

301
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,220
So it has like phallic ends on some of the tentacles.

302
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,940
- We didn't have to go there.

303
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,420
- And more orifices.

304
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,220
- Also, I don't know what that means.

305
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,060
- Me neither.

306
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,440
- Like ends on the ends of the other tentacles.

307
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,740
And then it has like a couple of other slit zones

308
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,820
- On its body. - Slits.

309
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,260
- Slit zone, slits. - Yeah, slits.

310
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,420
- And you see some like,

311
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,780
sort of like, what's the word I'm looking for here?

312
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,740
- Sniz spots.

313
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,540
- Sniz. - Dribblers.

314
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,300
- No, just like, kind of like malformed

315
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,060
or like unformed eyes. - Weeping wounds.

316
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,100
- Inchoate, maybe, eyes.

317
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,920
- Vestigial.

318
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,980
- Yeah, vestigial's a good way of putting it, right?

319
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,460
- Percy does erstwhile, now inchoate.

320
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,300
- Like, they're just like, they're just not fully--

321
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,540
- What does inchoate mean?

322
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,580
- It means not fully formed.

323
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,060
- Again, I just don't know.

324
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
- It means not fully formed.

325
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,340
- I always thought it was in show it.

326
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,820
- Oh, 'cause it has CH in it.

327
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
I guess I say, I don't know,

328
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,900
I've never listened to the lady saying on Google.

329
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,180
- I've never listened to many words.

330
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,580
- Can you guys just think of the fucking,

331
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,740
the truckers and the electricians who listen to this show

332
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,340
and how they don't know what this bullshit means.

333
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,820
- Stop reading out bruh loudly.

334
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,260
- Listen, it doesn't matter what this thing look like,

335
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,140
because I'm turning around to you

336
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,580
and the sports fans will appreciate this.

337
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm drawing a play on my chest, right?

338
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,300
- Yeah.

339
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,700
- So I'm like, you go this way.

340
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,060
- I have a plan already.

341
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,860
And I'm writing on my chest, I have a plan already.

342
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,780
- Okay, so you're completely--

343
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,340
- But I'll take whatever you say

344
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,820
and maybe I'll add it to my plan,

345
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,620
but my plan is pretty well formed.

346
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,460
- I basically just draw like a--

347
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
- And I'm still writing that whole sentence.

348
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,060
- I draw like a completely,

349
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,060
like just nonsense sort of Madden 2006 play

350
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,080
on my, that just has a bunch of lines on my chest,

351
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,260
but I pretend it's a football play.

352
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,100
- It's never nonsense.

353
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,020
- And then I crack the grenade, I pull the pin,

354
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,160
and toss a perfect fucking Brady bomb.

355
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,000
- Nice.

356
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,380
- Right directly into this bitch's hole.

357
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,700
- Yeah, I love it, yeah.

358
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,060
And she, 'cause it, yeah,

359
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,700
that's always a she if you throw it there.

360
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,660
- And I make it not.

361
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,540
- That's right.

362
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,420
And yeah, no, it just screams in pain.

363
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,340
- That's the same shit.

364
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,780
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

365
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,820
And she is gonna also have to roll a,

366
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,580
you know, with a crit 20, do I just let that happen?

367
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

368
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,740
- Right, I kinda do.

369
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,580
I think it makes sense.

370
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,020
- What are you gonna do against a crit 20?

371
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,980
- 'Cause the only thing was like,

372
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,060
there's usually extra sticky damage

373
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,780
so, or to stop the movement.

374
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,940
So yeah, I'll say that there is.

375
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,140
- Stinky damage?

376
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,980
- No, sticky.

377
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,660
So yeah, her movement's also,

378
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,340
or their movement is also just sort of like,

379
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,020
hampered right now.

380
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,340
So now let's go to blow toss.

381
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,880
When we hit the end of this round, by the way,

382
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
we'll cut to you.

383
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,300
We'll do kind of a little editing.

384
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,260
- Yeah, that'll be great.

385
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,180
- Yeah.

386
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,020
- We'll do the (imitates blowing)

387
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,860
- Yeah, we'll do a little bit of (imitates blowing)

388
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,700
- Okay, so my plan.

389
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,380
- Yeah, go ahead and show us, genius.

390
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,940
- Okay, so here, I'll do a diagram.

391
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,180
Oh, there's already something on here.

392
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,380
- Yeah, you should put a diaphragm.

393
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,220
- Mini mouse fetter.

394
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,040
- That's right.

395
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
(laughing)

396
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,780
- I'm a feet of feather, yeah.

397
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,620
- Here's my plan here.

398
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,580
I'm gonna draw it right here on the table.

399
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,420
- Yeah.

400
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,180
- So this is the tentacle monster.

401
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,160
Okay, and this is its gash.

402
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,140
- Okay, and this is me.

403
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,740
Hi, I'm waving. - Okay, hi.

404
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,580
- I run here all the way up.

405
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,700
- Those listening at home, he's drawing himself,

406
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,540
and he's drawing a little line.

407
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,660
- Running into the gash.

408
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,580
- Not into it, running up to it.

409
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,420
And then this is my pipe, my lead pipe,

410
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,260
not my pipe, but so basically it will go like this,

411
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,380
and it's gonna go like uh, uh, like uh, uh, uh, uh.

412
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,580
- So he's drawing sort of like action lines now.

413
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,440
Like here, I'll do it like here.

414
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,060
Like that's the gash.

415
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,860
And then I'm like, uh, uh.

416
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,700
Wait, sorry, let me do this.

417
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
- He's sort of drawing like a separate plane.

418
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,540
- Type it up.

419
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,540
- Yeah, 'cause I get two attacks,

420
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,260
so I can at least do uh, uh.

421
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,540
So that's my plan.

422
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,340
So I'll roll for that.

423
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,900
- Starting to think that this is the best night of my life.

424
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,300
- Okay, that's an eight plus seven.

425
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,420
- And he ate it?

426
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,260
- 15.

427
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,100
- Oh shit.

428
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,700
- As you run up to, you're gonna need to roll

429
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,460
a dexterity saving throw.

430
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,500
Come on, tentacle monster, you know what's up.

431
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,700
You know what's happening here.

432
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,060
- Yeah, I guess I should've known

433
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,460
about the dexterity throw.

434
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,300
That's 18.

435
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,120
- Yeah, you're fine.

436
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,040
I mean, yeah, you duck, you weave,

437
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,740
but the 15, you don't really quite connect.

438
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,580
- I missed the hole.

439
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,700
Yeah, we've all been there.

440
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,620
- Yeah, right.

441
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,460
- Yeah.

442
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,020
- Into the thigh.

443
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,060
- Sometimes it happens, man.

444
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,900
- I mean, you've got--

445
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,720
- It happens to the best.

446
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,560
(laughing)

447
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,400
- I hear the inside of the thigh.

448
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,160
(laughing)

449
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
- I hear some of the best fuckers in the world.

450
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
- Just get it right into the bed frame.

451
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,840
- Oh wait, no, I have advantage

452
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,280
'cause that hasn't taken a turn yet.

453
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,520
Or right, 'cause I'm an assassin.

454
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,600
- You're taking advantage of this first attack?

455
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,920
- Or is it when you don't have a turn?

456
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,960
- It's when it hasn't had a turn yet, I think.

457
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,800
- Oh, heavens, yeah.

458
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,620
- Okay, then roll.

459
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,680
- Right, I don't know where that is,

460
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,240
but I'm almost certain.

461
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,440
- It should be on the right there, on the.

462
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,400
- Oh yeah, advantage on attack rolls

463
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,240
against any creature that hasn't taken a turn.

464
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
- I apologize, thank you for remembering.

465
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
- I'm glad I remembered.

466
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,680
Okay, that is an 18.

467
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,840
- Yeah, and that hits.

468
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,960
- Okay, and then any hit is a critical hit.

469
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,040
- I gotta nerf that a little bit.

470
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,080
All right, go.

471
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,080
- Okay, so that's five plus, whoa.

472
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
- Christ almighty. - Damn.

473
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,800
- Okay, 17 plus four, that's 21.

474
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,080
For my first attack.

475
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,840
- Blackjack. - So that's in out.

476
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,940
- Yeah. - That's in out.

477
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,180
super painful uh-huh wow no you're beating this thing up

478
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,180
this is pleasure damage so this tacks up separately

479
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,180
wait he just said you're beating it up

480
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,180
I'm actually beating it up?

481
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
yes you are actually

482
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,180
does the thing's fucking hymen burst?

483
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,180
I just rolled a 20

484
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,180
just fucking spills hymen blood

485
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,180
so I get a double crit

486
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,180
this is pretty rough for the tentacle monster

487
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,180
ok 7 plus

488
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,180
10 is 17

489
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,180
that's another 21 damage

490
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,180
so that's 42 damage

491
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,020
So can I go in and out 42 times? Can that be the representation of that?

492
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,220
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

493
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,340
Yeah, so you just take your double pipes and just go...

494
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,420
Yeah. Oh my god. That was an amazing sound. Thank you.

495
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,740
That's lots of women who have machines that do that to themselves.

496
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,900
Which is strange. I don't really get that, man.

497
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,780
Yeah, I'd rather have a like kind of a small unassuming one I could take

498
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,460
wherever, if they look through my luggage it's not immediately obvious, it's like

499
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,980
penis-shaped.

500
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,720
- I want a sex toy so small someone might assume

501
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,320
that I'm just trying to like cheat at chess.

502
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,340
- I want, you know what I want?

503
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,560
I want a sex toy that I can, it's a vibrator,

504
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,520
and I put it in the palm of my hand,

505
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,360
and it's, the vibrations kind of conduct

506
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,200
through my bone and body, and it can vibrate

507
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,000
me down below, but it doesn't even have to be in my hands.

508
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,720
- It vibrates so fast on your hands.

509
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,240
- It just travels down my arm.

510
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,640
(laughing)

511
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,480
- And in your chest.

512
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,160
- And it might cause a heart murmur.

513
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,320
- And in your chest like Tony Stark.

514
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,800
- I want something that resets my defibrillator.

515
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,920
Like, yeah, right.

516
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,040
So that's a very, very good first turn from you two.

517
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,960
- This thing's dead.

518
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,440
- This thing is not looking good.

519
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,840
I mean, she has a healthy amount of HP,

520
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
but after you went in with the fucking

521
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
double pipes like that. - Oh, I went in.

522
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,000
- Yeah, you see the guy that is like attached to it

523
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,560
just going (gurgling)

524
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,400
like he is-- - Oh.

525
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,760
- Like he just wanted-- - 'Cause he had

526
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
a gay experience.

527
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,200
- He's having a gay experience.

528
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,560
- They are having mutual orgasm.

529
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,280
- That is fucking romantic. - That is also painful.

530
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,000
- Yeah, it is, it's beautiful.

531
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,240
And now it is the tentacles' turn.

532
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,080
- Bitch.

533
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,360
- Yep, that's right. - Bitch.

534
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,360
- And almost like in like retaliation and like a fear,

535
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,480
they're going to just like,

536
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,160
you're gonna watch 'em congeal,

537
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,200
like sort of like squish in,

538
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,680
and then just launch out,

539
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,440
and all this gas just flies everywhere.

540
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,360
Both of you guys-- - Oh, pussy gas?

541
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,040
- Both of you-- - There's gas flying everywhere?

542
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
the famous pussy

543
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
- Yeah, snowflake. - Not me catching it

544
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,400
like that booth you get in the money's all sticks to you.

545
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,640
(laughing)

546
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,480
- Reaching around.

547
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,280
- If you just land it on my tongue.

548
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,600
- Nope. - You could do that

549
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
or you could roll a-- - I got my butterfly net.

550
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,240
(laughing)

551
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,360
- Or you could roll a constitution saving throw.

552
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,320
- No, I fucking, I cheat. - Jesus, Jesus.

553
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,160
- I cheat the whole fucking thing.

554
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,480
- Yeah, take it to the face. - One hit.

555
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,400
(laughing)

556
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,160
- I face the entire room. - Just take it to the face.

557
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay, cool.

558
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,120
(laughing)

559
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,960
- I love it.

560
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
- If he faces the entire room, am I safe?

561
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,460
- Yeah, he's safe.

562
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,400
I literally, one pull.

563
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,200
- I'm gonna space the entire fucking room

564
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,040
of gas, juice, and smoke.

565
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,440
- What'd you roll, by the way?

566
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
- Oh, I didn't roll anything.

567
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
I thought he was saving me.

568
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,640
- Are you both gonna chief it?

569
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,480
- No, I'm chiefing it.

570
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm literally pulling the entire thing.

571
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,200
- All right, all right.

572
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
- I'll still roll.

573
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,400
- I want you to, I'm very open to you trying.

574
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,080
That's gonna be, let's think about this.

575
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,200
Is that strength?

576
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,040
Like with longs?

577
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,080
- I'll wait to take a breath in

578
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,640
to see if he can clear the entire room.

579
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
- I guess it is constitution.

580
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
- That's gotta be constitution.

581
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,360
- It's gotta be just con, right?

582
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm gonna take also the strength of pulling it all in.

583
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,540
It has to take some fucking ab strength, but.

584
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,380
- Seven.

585
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,220
- It's not quite enough.

586
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,040
(laughing)

587
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,880
- No.

588
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,720
- Even with your con, no.

589
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,680
- So I just take a deep breath though.

590
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,520
- Yeah, yeah, you do get, you will have to deal with it.

591
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,680
You're up though.

592
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
- 19.

593
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,360
- You're safe.

594
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,200
So you--

595
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,680
- Yeah, I'm like, my eyes, my eyes.

596
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,000
- You think he saves you though too, right?

597
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,560
- I have the high eye, I've got red eyes,

598
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,120
so I'm just like.

599
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,040
- Damn.

600
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,860
- Damn.

601
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,600
- You just feel butterflies in your stomach

602
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,880
and then you feel your eyelids kinda get heavy

603
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,120
and you kinda go, you kinda like swoon and fall over.

604
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,960
- That doesn't sound like something that I would--

605
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,480
- Pussy put him to sleep.

606
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,880
- And you're, yep. - Pussy put me in a coma.

607
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,560
- Yeah, and yeah. - Okay, that's fine.

608
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,120
- Your computer, like your demon is still awake.

609
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,280
- Yeah. - But your computer awakes.

610
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,080
- Well, he never sleeps, you know.

611
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
- Pussy and your demon awakes.

612
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
- Your demon's awake.

613
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
- He never sleeps, he always just sits there and does that.

614
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,300
- That is what happens to me, I inhale,

615
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I inhale the pussy smell,

616
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,460
and the robot part of my brain goes to sleep.

617
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,960
- And the demon wakes up.

618
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
(laughing)

619
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,920
- The analytical part of my brain, it turns off.

620
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,760
- Right brain?

621
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,320
- That brain.

622
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,160
- The creative side.

623
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,240
- The alphabetical side.

624
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,880
- Tell me, motherfucker, how much damage I take.

625
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,080
- You don't take anything.

626
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,920
- Good.

627
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,600
- Instead, a tentacle reaches out and grabs you.

628
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,440
Don't care.

629
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,800
- Okay, now you're gonna take some damage.

630
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,640
- So, can I have a D10?

631
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,040
- You have everything right here.

632
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,200
- No, if I can't see it, then you hide it.

633
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,400
- No, don't roll it for me.

634
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,120
- That's not even the right dice.

635
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,840
- That was close though.

636
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,680
- Dice?

637
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,060
Why'd you say it cool?

638
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,560
- I have an X and I traveled.

639
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,120
- Oh damn, I forgot.

640
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,320
- Wait, oh I forgot to do that.

641
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,240
Wait, give me these.

642
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,080
- You take, those are my Warby's.

643
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,640
Hands off my Warby's.

644
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
- Hey guys, who am I?

645
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,120
(laughing)

646
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,560
- Stop, come on, I don't sound like that.

647
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,400
- I don't do that.

648
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,880
- The Riddler.

649
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,320
- No, I'm him.

650
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,160
- Oh!

651
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,000
- You take, you take, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

652
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,840
- Shut up.

653
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,760
- Yeah, you take 11 damage.

654
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,380
- Yeah, whatever, good.

655
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,980
All right, I'm at 24 damage, or health.

656
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,440
And also you are now grabbed by this thing you're grappled and you're knocked out is my head backwards

657
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,760
And I'm fucking coming into her shit like that not yet, but it seems like you might be happening

658
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,040
Yeah, the good thing of that body next to you like while you're passing like hey

659
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,840
He's saying hi to you

660
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,640
Mo bro the thief from the Bible. What's his name?

661
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,840
Which thief the thief that Jesus was crucified with Oh?

662
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,440
What do they call Barbara? Yeah, Barbara? What do they call him? They say there's something thief

663
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,560
Is the Bible stuff with Bible shit like me?

664
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:36,040
What does a Bible men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry

665
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,220
You have to pick up your microphone if you're gonna talk. I don't know if I agree with that. I'm actually fine with this

666
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:49,840
But speaking of not being in the scene now you are in the scene, so we're cutting away my mic

667
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,280
Wait can we do sort of a mr.. Show transition?

668
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,080
Yeah, and I'll keep and can we do sort of a mr.. Show transition, and I'll pick up what Caleb was saying well

669
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,160
He does the instruction is the mr.. Is the mr.. Show

670
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,840
Transition I don't remember what it was I mean like I think is it just similar

671
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,080
I have only seen a couple episodes of mr.. Show, and it's been a long time is it similar the Monty Python

672
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,180
I asked if movie transition just kind of move into the next sketch

673
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,720
I let's just go to Pat base on the last sketch so Pat you are in

674
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,040
The guest room running around in the lair of facts. Yeah, he's doing a task. He's doing a task

675
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,880
I was a lap of the laptops laptops dying. Yeah, you're you're in though

676
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,260
So you are you said last time you and you were playing video games in the guest room?

677
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,580
Patrick you're the one who has to be on we talk about the guest room. I thought you were trying to plug it in

678
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:46,240
What what game are you playing is baby playing with I'm playing it's it's

679
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,600
charades for the Atari 2600.

680
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
- Charades for the Atari.

681
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,280
There's only like three options.

682
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,120
- Yeah.

683
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,940
- Like, yeah.

684
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,780
- It's the worst game in the world.

685
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,000
- Yeah, it's like you and baby Gat are playing charades.

686
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,560
- It just shows you what you're supposed to act out

687
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,840
on the screen.

688
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
- It's just a slide show, basically.

689
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
Costs like $150 when it came out.

690
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,980
- It shows you what you're supposed to act out,

691
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,280
but like everyone else in the room can see it.

692
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,160
(laughing)

693
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,000
- It's cool.

694
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,040
- You're,

695
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,240
yeah, you're Geena Davis again.

696
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,080
- Yep.

697
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,160
- How do they want you to--

698
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,720
- There's only three options in the game.

699
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,080
- You know what, how would you act that out?

700
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,320
That's what I wanna know.

701
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,360
Okay, so to just make your lips different,

702
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,420
and your eyes.

703
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,840
Okay, so to, okay, Geena Davis.

704
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,820
- Yep, got that one again.

705
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,360
- Roll a perception check.

706
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,480
- This sounds really fun, I wish I was in this scene

707
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,920
instead of the fighting scene.

708
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,080
- I'm pretty much sick of face fucking the squid.

709
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,040
- I got a dirt, I got 12 and then my perception is eight.

710
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,180
- Yeah, dirty 20.

711
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,920
With that dirty 20, you hear something,

712
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,760
so you're in the room--

713
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,160
- I hear a dirty thing.

714
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,520
- You hear a dirty thing.

715
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,400
You're in a room, the room adjacent to

716
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,640
Janet Blowjob's room.

717
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,320
This is like the guest room off of Her.

718
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,480
- And you know it's gonna be dirty if it's Her.

719
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,600
- That's right, 'cause of the name.

720
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,560
So you hear something move of,

721
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,120
you hear something move,

722
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,520
and then you hear kind of a metal scraping against metal

723
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,200
in that other room, and if you remember,

724
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,160
that's usually the sign that the killer is near Frederick,

725
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
just so you know.

726
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,440
- Oh, what if it is a Freddy Krueger type?

727
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,760
That's good.

728
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,960
- Wait, wait, hold on.

729
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
- That's a Christmas sweater.

730
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,200
- We have to guess every time.

731
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,440
- It could be gloved.

732
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,920
I like everything every we already guessed that it was Santa Claus we guess maybe a hundred things

733
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,760
Yeah, but now I'd like to amend my guest and say that it now that we're further away from Christmas

734
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,960
I'm gonna guess it's Mike burbiglia. Oh

735
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,920
My god the sleepwalking he's sleepwalking and it's a dream. I look at his face. It's my

736
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:10,080
It's fucking Mike for I he cannot believe that I just did this to him. I figured this out now. Yeah, that's what I thought

737
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
It's my per big lady. Yeah walker

738
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,020
Okay, yeah, my guess it's a guy with metal okay, so I run out of the room, and I'm wearing a shirt

739
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,100
This is Joey bag of doughnuts. Yeah

740
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,060
That's what they used to call his brother patches

741
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,200
Okay, whatever

742
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:39,640
You run into the room and you don't okay, what do you I don't actually do that okay?

743
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,760
So I hear the metal on metal, right? That's right. And I'm in... Yeah, what's Slayer playing over another band? Megadeth.

744
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,600
Metal expert Cameron.

745
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:58,840
Like Slayer twice?

746
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,480
Okay. I don't feel like thinking of another band. Why would you?

747
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,160
I couldn't read his mind, could I? I couldn't use Yoda's mind to see.

748
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
That's a little bit of a leading question. On whomst?

749
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
On whoever is up there. What is wrong with you tonight?

750
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,160
The middle on the middle. It is Meme Wednesday.

751
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Oh shit. I forgot to send him.

752
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:28,160
We'll send him after. We will flood the group chat. Open the floodgates. Release the Kraken.

753
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Oh, that would be a good one to use.

754
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,960
Maybe, okay, I don't have like a...

755
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
- Brain?

756
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,840
(laughing)

757
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,040
- Damn.

758
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
- What are you trying to do?

759
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,800
- I'm on, I'm trying to see, I'm trying to see,

760
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,200
like, okay, so it's past my room, right?

761
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
- Past your bedtime.

762
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,620
- Okay, so I'm gonna poke my head out of the door.

763
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,900
- Yeah, for sure.

764
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,400
- You do that, and you don't see anything

765
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
too unusual in the room right now.

766
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,000
It looks similar to what you saw before,

767
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,400
you just see the nanobots kinda cleaning and tidying up.

768
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
- You said I heard metal on metal in the hallway,

769
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,840
not her room, right?

770
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,680
- No, in her room.

771
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,520
- In her room, okay, okay. - 'Cause you gotta get

772
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,380
adjacent to her room.

773
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,480
But what you will notice, she's not there anymore.

774
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,280
And she was there when you last were there.

775
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,200
But that's it.

776
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,840
- So she's not in her room?

777
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
- No.

778
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,360
There are the bots in there.

779
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,880
- But there's metal on metal sounds.

780
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,760
- You heard that.

781
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,680
You can investigate, you can try to do it.

782
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,520
- Yeah, I'll roll investigation.

783
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,360
- Yeah, roll investigation.

784
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,040
Let's see what you got, brother.

785
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,000
- That's a six.

786
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,080
- That is a six plus. - It's a six.

787
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,280
It's a knife.

788
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,000
It is eight.

789
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,560
- Okay.

790
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,800
- You don't notice anything too curious.

791
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,440
- I'm gonna roll persuasion and say,

792
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,600
if there's anybody in here, get your ass out right now!

793
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,960
- Go for it.

794
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,000
- That will work.

795
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,260
(laughing)

796
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,800
- If there was somebody here, they will never come back.

797
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,080
- I feel like you need more dire consequences.

798
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,920
- Isn't that what you want?

799
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,120
It's a killer.

800
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,320
You don't want 'em to come back.

801
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,120
- Yeah, all I'm saying is if you say a one--

802
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Yeah, he should die.

803
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,240
Well, I didn't say there was a killer in the room or not.

804
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,760
Who says?

805
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,440
Well, now we know there isn't.

806
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,520
You said there's metal on metal.

807
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,600
Are you trying to create--

808
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,160
Wait, OK, now that I'm thinking logically,

809
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,560
there can't be a killer in the room.

810
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,640
Because if you rolled a one, he would

811
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,760
die if there was a killer in the room.

812
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,440
Yeah, definitely.

813
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,520
And also, we live on a fucking-- or we're

814
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,880
staying on a fucking fully metal ship.

815
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,640
Meta gaming.

816
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm not metal gaming.

817
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,560
Metal gaming.

818
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,760
You're the one metal-- trying to game metal on us.

819
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,840
You're trying to change our--

820
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,800
Scraping metal on metal.

821
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,560
I'm going to roll--

822
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,920
You're trying to make me afraid of metal.

823
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,360
I'm gonna roll deception and say I was just kidding about that last thing.

824
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Okay.

825
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,240
And that is a 17.

826
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,280
I mean so you've been yelling this in a room, the nanobots when they first-

827
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,280
And I'm gonna roll religion and pray to God that there's nobody in here.

828
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,400
Okay, whatever's going on here is a clusterfuck but it's still a better love story than Twilight.

829
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
I couldn't agree more.

830
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
That's a 15.

831
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
What did you get?

832
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
What?

833
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I have a 15 for the religion.

834
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,600
you like your God cough a little bit.

835
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,280
I mean like, I don't know, like there's just,

836
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,160
you're just kind of like pleading to,

837
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,520
from what you can tell, just the nanobots

838
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,360
who are pissing themselves clean.

839
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,920
- Why don't you go find, she got killed.

840
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,360
And so solve that.

841
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,840
- She didn't get killed.

842
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,720
- She was there and then she got gone.

843
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,560
What do you mean?

844
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,540
- She didn't get killed?

845
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,380
- What do you mean?

846
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,200
- She's around.

847
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,040
- She clearly got killed.

848
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,680
Why don't you go get that her?

849
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,680
- You're both talking strange.

850
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,480
- What?

851
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,680
- Get that her.

852
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,080
- I didn't say get that, Herb.

853
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,920
- You did.

854
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,280
- No, and if I did, that's within the margin of error.

855
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,120
(laughing)

856
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,840
That you're allowed to say stuff like that,

857
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,000
'cause you knew what I meant.

858
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,200
- This is what happens when you kick back a couple of pints.

859
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,400
(laughing)

860
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,000
- Whilst, whilst to steal a throw.

861
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,680
- Dude, I have had a third of this white claw

862
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,000
and I'm feeling a little plastered.

863
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,720
- Yeah, look at his cup too, that's filled with vodka.

864
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,560
- No, don't look at that.

865
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,400
- That's beer vodka.

866
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,920
- Don't look at what's in there.

867
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,600
- One of the nanobots comes up to you and says,

868
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,440
"Can I help you, sir?"

869
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,480
(screaming)

870
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,600
It's nano, it's small.

871
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,320
It's head pops up in the air, it spins around and lands back on his head and you're like,

872
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
"Whoa!"

873
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
Holy shit!

874
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
This guy's cool.

875
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Okay.

876
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Can I help you sir?

877
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I can tell you're a silly kind of guy.

878
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,200
Can you tell him he recruited this guy?

879
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Bring this guy onto the team.

880
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,400
You're on my team, what is your name?

881
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
You're on my team.

882
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,440
That's what I say when I meet cool people.

883
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,560
You are on my team, my friend, what is your name?

884
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,240
You're joining my party.

885
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Scooter.

886
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Scooter?

887
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,080
- Scooter. - Scooter.

888
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,200
- We need this guy. - Dude, come on.

889
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,880
- Wait, what can you do to turn into a scooter?

890
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,120
- I just clean, mostly.

891
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,400
- Okay, you're the cleaner.

892
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,960
- Scooter to the cleaner. - Scooter to the cleaner.

893
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,200
- Okay.

894
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,920
- And do you have any kind of assassination stuff you do?

895
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,960
- I could probably crawl into somebody and beat 'em up.

896
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,080
- Into somebody?

897
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,920
- Yeah, I'm real little.

898
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,720
- Oh yeah, okay, you're on my team.

899
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,680
What do you need me to do?

900
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,200
- I haven't thought about anything past this.

901
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,800
- Okay.

902
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,360
- Oh, I was looking for Janet.

903
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,160
- Oh, I'm not allowed to tell you where she went.

904
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,200
I'm sorry.

905
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,100
- Okay, but now that you're my teammate, you can tell me.

906
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,360
- He's thinking about it.

907
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,840
Roll persuasion.

908
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,280
- That's a good, that's gotta be advantage.

909
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,560
- He made you part of his team.

910
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,320
- He made me part of his team.

911
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,240
- Oh, wait, with advantage I can roll again.

912
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,520
- It's gotta be advantage.

913
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Oh my god a 21. Wow.

914
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Yeah sure just yeah.

915
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
You didn't even know that was going to happen when you said you were on my team.

916
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
So that wasn't meta gaming.

917
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
That is how it is done.

918
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
And also I just screwed her the cleaner.

919
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Oh my god.

920
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Juvio can you just put the camera on me for a second just so I can get it.

921
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
It's a living.

922
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
You do kind of remind me of one of those Flintstone birds.

923
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Yeah?

924
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
What is it about me?

925
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Just your attitude and your body.

926
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,360
(laughing)

927
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,200
- Your purpose.

928
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,020
- Yeah.

929
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,160
- That's true.

930
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,120
The purpose part feels real.

931
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,640
Yeah, so with that 21 that you bullied me into,

932
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,560
but I'm allowing, so that's on me, really.

933
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,880
I'm blaming the victim here.

934
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,720
- Yeah.

935
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,560
- Scooter, he, he's a guy.

936
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,400
Scooter says--

937
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,240
- What's up with you, this whole episode

938
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,480
you've been saying he, they, she, just, you know.

939
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,320
- Well, the--

940
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,160
- These are all--

941
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,980
- Do you have something you wanna tell us?

942
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,740
- The sex beast doesn't really have a gender,

943
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,580
but I can understand.

944
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,940
- But then it's a beast, it's an it, it's a bear.

945
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,320
- Oh, they still have like a sense of self, right?

946
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,300
- Maybe they don't. - I don't think so.

947
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,780
It's a tentacle monster. - I guess that's true.

948
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,740
Probably isn't an it. - Everybody just takes

949
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,720
it turn face fucking.

950
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,060
You think that that has a sense of self?

951
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,900
- I think anything that gets fucked that much is an it.

952
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,220
- You think Anna Nicole Smith has a sense of self?

953
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,140
That's what I'm trying to understand here.

954
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,740
- Anna Nicole Smith. (laughing)

955
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,180
- Showing my age. - That is amazing, yeah.

956
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,020
- Yeah, well I guess, who could I, Riley Reid?

957
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
She's even kinda old.

958
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,860
- Marilyn Monroe.

959
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,900
- Yeah, I would've gone Marilyn Monroe.

960
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,740
- Lillian Gish.

961
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,940
- You take that, hussy Marilyn Monroe.

962
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,980
- Yeah, Lillian Gish.

963
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,020
- I don't wanna, that's a third rail topic these days

964
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,800
'cause of the movie that came out like three years ago

965
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,380
in our time.

966
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,580
So yeah, with that 21, Scooter says,

967
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,420
well, since we're on the same team, man.

968
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,820
- Yeah, high five.

969
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,020
Yeah, he pulls his little hand out for a high five and I smack it. Oh, it's so hard that he flops

970
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,980
You're trying to get him to tell you man

971
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,780
She she she sometimes goes behind the bed

972
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,300
What?

973
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,380
That is sexual

974
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:39,500
Okay, I'm gonna pull the bed back. Okay. You pull the bed back. Oh wait. No. There's a button somewhere isn't there

975
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,780
No, when you pull the bed back, okay, it just glides and makes him like no sound

976
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,100
Wait show the

977
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:55,140
Give me toy camera. He definitely the cleaner Wow he's a spider with hands

978
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,980
He's a nano, but you know what I'm gonna call him from now on because you're drawing clank

979
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,420
Looks like head that's head

980
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,140
You drew clanks head

981
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,340
- Give him a nose. - Give him another antenna.

982
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,380
- So I go-- - Now he's a bug.

983
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,220
- Nose will make him different.

984
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
- There we go. - There we go.

985
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,260
- Now you drew a bug.

986
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,100
(laughing)

987
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,920
- That's not a bug.

988
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,980
- A bug with hands. - So I go behind the bed.

989
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,200
- You don't see anything like that.

990
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,780
I would say you could probably look at it more closely.

991
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,140
Let's-- - Wait, I pull it back

992
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,620
and it glides?

993
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,580
- The bed just kinda glides over, it makes no sound.

994
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,500
- I'm gonna ask Scooter, I'm like,

995
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,820
how does she go behind the bed?

996
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,780
- Well, she'll go behind it and then--

997
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,880
- Press a button.

998
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,180
- Not a button.

999
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,480
- Pull a lever.

1000
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,580
- Something like that.

1001
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,820
- Do a code thing.

1002
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,180
Pressure plate, book.

1003
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,260
- It's sort of like a pressure plate.

1004
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,020
- Metal scraping on metal.

1005
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,440
A secret door opening.

1006
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,500
Yes, she, yeah, opened one.

1007
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,580
She opened the door.

1008
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,780
- My guess is she is it.

1009
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,700
- You know, I've been playing the new Harry Potter game

1010
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,520
so I know this one.

1011
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,620
You should use the spell.

1012
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,220
Reveleo.

1013
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,740
Use Reveleo.

1014
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
I use Reveleo.

1015
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,240
OK, yeah.

1016
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,020
Roll a d20.

1017
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,900
Two.

1018
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,780
It doesn't work.

1019
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,620
OK, I'm going to use Reveleo again.

1020
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,220
All right.

1021
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,780
14.

1022
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,300
What do I do?

1023
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,900
It works.

1024
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,400
Oh.

1025
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,660
OK, you can cut to the end.

1026
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,860
No, what do you want to do?

1027
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,940
So you see the panel there.

1028
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,020
Well, I used Reveleo.

1029
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,900
No, you don't use-- stop that.

1030
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,700
You don't use Reve--

1031
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,220
There we go.

1032
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,540
He's standing up for himself.

1033
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,220
I like this.

1034
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,720
OK.

1035
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,460
Thanks, man.

1036
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,460
So I'm gonna investigate the room for like a

1037
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,780
button or a lever or a shelf

1038
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,180
that has a book that makes a lever book.

1039
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Yeah. Look for a lever book. And it's always a title with delicious irony.

1040
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,580
The Hidden Key. Yes. That was a 10.

1041
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,260
You do find a book called The Hidden Key, but there's just like weed in it.

1042
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,380
Yeah. Just a pipe in it.

1043
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,660
- It's carved out. - And it's a one hitter.

1044
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,500
(laughing)

1045
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,940
- All right, that's a good idea.

1046
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,780
- We could make millions. - Yeah, she's 13.

1047
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,500
Try to hide it from her parents.

1048
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,060
- Okay, so that didn't work.

1049
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,900
- Yeah.

1050
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,220
- What else, should I roll insight?

1051
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,100
- There might not be much else you can do right now.

1052
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,340
- I'm gonna roll another investigation.

1053
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,420
- What are you gonna investigate?

1054
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,980
- You should be a private detective.

1055
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,740
- Yeah, I am in the--

1056
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,900
- What are you gonna investigate before you roll?

1057
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,300
Talk to me. - Again for another lever.

1058
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,300
- No, you can't do that.

1059
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,540
- Okay, then I'm investigating.

1060
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,580
- It's like you failed a check.

1061
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,940
Hey, Pat, try this.

1062
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,580
Open Sesame.

1063
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,500
- I'm gonna investigate if there's a voice-activated

1064
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,520
Open Sesame code.

1065
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,300
- Or you could just say Open Sesame.

1066
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,420
- Yeah.

1067
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,300
- Which one of those are you doing?

1068
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,500
- He's got the worst rolls ever, he just rolled a four.

1069
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,460
- Okay.

1070
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,020
- You say you, you go Open,

1071
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,960
you don't like, you just fuck it up, yeah.

1072
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,100
- Open Semily.

1073
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,540
All right, I'm just gonna start

1074
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,740
Shooting my gun around. That's a good idea somewhere the light bleeds. Don't have a gun okay knock on the wall, and yeah

1075
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,920
I'm gonna start eating things with my hoagie, okay

1076
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,220
I'm just running around the road just hitting shit

1077
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:18,540
Nanobots are panicking now. You just they just cleaned everything and you're knocking shit around. Oh, yeah, that's they can clean it up

1078
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,920
He's on my team now. He can clean it up. They don't have anything else better to do there

1079
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,180
I mean, that's what yeah, that's what they're trying to do baby

1080
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,760
Maybe Gadd opens the door and he's just like, "What are you doing?"

1081
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
"Shut up!"

1082
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
"Stop."

1083
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
"Shut your mouth!"

1084
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
"You're gonna fuck it up!"

1085
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
"You're...

1086
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Fuck you!

1087
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm gonna do nothing!"

1088
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
"You're gonna fuck it up!

1089
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
We're about to get rich!"

1090
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
"What?"

1091
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
"We're giving them vital information.

1092
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Don't fuck up her room!"

1093
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
"There's a lady in the...

1094
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Behind the bed!

1095
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
In a wall!"

1096
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
"I don't give a shit!"

1097
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
"Or the floor!

1098
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Is it the wall of the...

1099
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Is it the wall or the floor?

1100
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
You're on my team now.

1101
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
You have to tell me."

1102
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
"Um...

1103
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
I mean, it's just behind the bed.

1104
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
I don't give a shit!"

1105
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,720
tell me I mean it's just behind the bed I

1106
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,680
don't we don't really just stop just

1107
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,520
just just can you look into this later

1108
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,000
just wait till I'm out of the you got

1109
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,880
to help me look for it now okay what do

1110
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,640
you want me to do look for a lever or a

1111
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,280
button or an entrance there's a door the

1112
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,840
door we came into shit okay yeah we'll

1113
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,960
cut back from this to you guys now

1114
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,360
- Another turn.

1115
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,320
- There we go.

1116
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,560
- You're at the top of the order.

1117
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,720
- 40 minutes in and we're starting

1118
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,680
our second round of combat.

1119
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,520
- Yeah, that's right.

1120
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,340
- Let's go.

1121
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm going to use, wait, I've been taken though, right?

1122
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,560
- Taken.

1123
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,040
- Like, yeah, I was gonna say like the--

1124
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,760
- I'm stuck in that guy, right?

1125
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,160
- Oh, yeah. - In the tentacle guy?

1126
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,960
- Yeah, you wake up this round.

1127
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,800
- Okay, so I can do something.

1128
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,640
- Yeah.

1129
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,760
- Okay, since I'm close--

1130
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,440
- But what you have to do basically is,

1131
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,200
you're restrained right now.

1132
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,400
So you could roll a strength check to break out

1133
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,760
and that's about it right now.

1134
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,440
- That's all I can do?

1135
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,960
- 'Cause everything you do requires--

1136
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,120
- Yeah, all right.

1137
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,960
I'll roll a strength check.

1138
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,560
- These puppies' hands, you know.

1139
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,080
- Okay, but plus zero on strength.

1140
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,320
I think that these stats are outdated.

1141
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,600
- They actually might be a little bit.

1142
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,840
- Yeah, I got a three.

1143
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,640
- Even if we add it, 'cause they are outdated

1144
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,540
'Cause your strength is actually, I think, a plus three now, by the way.

1145
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,940
But, regardless.

1146
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,540
So I'm still stuck.

1147
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,340
You're stuck.

1148
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,540
Can I, like, bite?

1149
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,140
Um, you know what? Why not go for it?

1150
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,340
Let's do an unarmed attack.

1151
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,540
Okay.

1152
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,340
Just roll a d20 again?

1153
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,740
Roll a d20 and we'll add your new strength.

1154
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,540
Wow!

1155
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,140
Okay, 19 plus 3, 22.

1156
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Okay, roll a d4.

1157
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,140
Oops.

1158
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,340
I will roll...

1159
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
A one!

1160
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,140
Okay.

1161
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
And I will roll...

1162
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,140
He's able to still like hold you.

1163
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
Um...

1164
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
Let that do one thing.

1165
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,140
But you do do...

1166
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
Four damage.

1167
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
And they're not...

1168
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,140
It's not looking good. I'm gonna just start saying it.

1169
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
I'm sorry guys.

1170
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
It's not looking good. It's looking pretty

1171
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
fucked up.

1172
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140
I think it looks good.

1173
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,140
I'm feeling...

1174
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
Mmmhmmm.

1175
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,220
- Oh. - Botas, what are you doing?

1176
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,820
- Pipe, crit one. - You got a crit one.

1177
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,460
- Two. - You swing your pipe at it

1178
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,380
and you kinda like-- - Swing.

1179
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,380
- You trip over one of the tentacles and you're knock prone.

1180
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,940
But you can still get up and try to attack again.

1181
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,460
- Okay, I'm gonna get up. - Does he get up,

1182
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,140
you know how some people get up butt first, does he do that?

1183
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,740
He like slides his butt up to look like an inchworm first

1184
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,540
and then you get up. - And I go.

1185
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1186
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,980
- And as you're doing that, roll dexterity saving throw.

1187
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,340
- And then when I stand up,

1188
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,240
I take one hand off the ground first,

1189
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,660
and I'm like three down on the ground.

1190
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,180
And as I stand up, I like drag my hand across the ground

1191
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,300
towards my legs, and I go up my leg.

1192
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,140
- Fuck dexterity, you got some sex there for me.

1193
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,300
- And then I go up like this.

1194
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,980
- Well let's first see if you dodge.

1195
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,460
- And I go like this.

1196
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,620
(singing)

1197
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,680
- You are a fucking amazing diva.

1198
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,020
You are a fucking amazing singer.

1199
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,700
- Which is a song I wrote last night,

1200
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,540
which I shouldn't be premiering on this episode.

1201
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,300
But I'm hoping nobody catches that.

1202
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,020
And I can try to attack again?

1203
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,820
- First you're gonna roll a dexterity saving throw.

1204
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,940
- Okay.

1205
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,860
That is a 20.

1206
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,620
- You didn't roll that, you plopped that.

1207
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
- I can roll it again.

1208
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,460
- You're a plopper.

1209
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,260
- That was a roll, I rolled it in my hand.

1210
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,100
- I don't give a fuck.

1211
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,220
- As you're getting up, the tentacle was swiping to get you

1212
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,460
and you managed to dodge out of the way.

1213
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,500
- I really can't sing that again.

1214
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,140
- Yeah, right, sorry.

1215
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,980
- I'm sorry for making you do that.

1216
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,020
- And now I'm gonna try to attack again.

1217
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,060
It plopped again, that's the same number,

1218
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,020
but I rolled it in my hand.

1219
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,140
What do you think? - You have bad technique.

1220
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,780
- What do you think? - You have bad technique.

1221
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,340
- Can I, if it's-- - You can take it,

1222
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,900
but you need to be rolling out.

1223
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,740
You're rolling, you're plopping.

1224
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,300
- I tried, I even thought, I even tried that time.

1225
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,140
- Yeah, don't plop.

1226
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,060
- He's a plopper.

1227
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,460
- He's a plopper. - Do you want me to re-roll it?

1228
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,740
- No, don't re-roll it, it's fine.

1229
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,900
- Why are you being a drama queen?

1230
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,740
- I'm not.

1231
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,060
(Ian imitates dramatic music)

1232
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,020
(laughing)

1233
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,220
- That's a 22 though.

1234
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,420
- I mean it definitely hits, so roll for damage.

1235
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,260
- Okay now watch this, now watch this.

1236
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,740
- If these plop, if these plop.

1237
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,640
- There we go.

1238
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,260
- That is 11 damage.

1239
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,100
- There we go.

1240
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,980
- Okay, ooh, not looking good, very close.

1241
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,540
I almost wrote on my computer.

1242
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,460
(laughing)

1243
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,300
- That was real close.

1244
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,620
- He had one white claw and he just tried

1245
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,140
to write on a computer.

1246
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,980
- Bro.

1247
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,820
- That's not what that was.

1248
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,820
I'm not friggin' drunk.

1249
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,180
- You're just, it supports my hypothesis about you.

1250
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,020
- About that I'm--

1251
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,100
- You're just the biggest lightweight

1252
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,660
- That's the word of all time.

1253
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,900
- You're sloppy, bro.

1254
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,500
- I'm a sloppy drunk.

1255
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,740
Can I get another one of those, by the way?

1256
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,620
- After you tried to draw on your computer?

1257
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,020
Yes, dude, we're trying to make a competition.

1258
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,980
(laughing)

1259
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,040
- Okay, so now it is its turn.

1260
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,040
So it is going to do another bit of damage to you, Caleb.

1261
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,260
- Great.

1262
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,500
- It's gonna be Ray William Johnson.

1263
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,740
- Thanks.

1264
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,320
- Okay, plus another.

1265
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,260
- I already saw the six, so I'll start counting down.

1266
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,740
- Yep, does another 12 damage to you.

1267
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,100
- Oh fuck. - Jesus Christ.

1268
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:08,940
- Oh, fug.

1269
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,180
- And it is now going to--

1270
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,620
- I got motherfucking 12 HP.

1271
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,300
- Damn, I have 14.

1272
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,180
- It is now going to-- - I'm glad you said

1273
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,340
it's looking bad.

1274
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,040
- It is, lurches back and reveals

1275
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,740
its mega hole on the bottom.

1276
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,780
- I don't want no big ass hole.

1277
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,220
- And you can see that it's--

1278
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,340
(laughing)

1279
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,620
- Sorry, I just noticed Pat's holding a gun.

1280
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,060
- Yeah.

1281
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,860
- I'm so unhappy that we found that.

1282
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,700
- Me too.

1283
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,920
- Somebody dropped it and then I found

1284
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,860
where you put the CO2 cartridge.

1285
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,840
- That's great.

1286
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,540
- Yeah, so we could get a CO2 cartridge

1287
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,980
and use that thing as a real fun toy.

1288
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,980
- Blow toss, roll a charisma saving throw.

1289
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,220
- Charisma saving throw?

1290
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,460
Bro, am I literally rolling for Riz today?

1291
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,640
- Damn, dude.

1292
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,420
- That's a 16.

1293
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,980
- Wow. - That's pretty high Riz.

1294
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,180
- That's very fortunate. - I'm like this.

1295
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,820
Um, yeah, you, yeah, you're giving a troll face.

1296
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,580
Troll face.

1297
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:13,060
You're giving the troll face into, as you see, it's, it's the, the whispering eye as the, uh, this, like, it's,

1298
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,940
it's real eye is revealed here and you hear like,

1299
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,700
[whispering]

1300
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700
And like,

1301
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,200
What was that?

1302
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,540
I say, I say, pardon?

1303
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,040
Yeah.

1304
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,740
Come again? Oh, did I say come again?

1305
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,820
But it doesn't, it doesn't, uh, it doesn't, uh, uh, envelop you.

1306
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,420
And so you're only going to take half damage here.

1307
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,860
Okay, I'm still going to die.

1308
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,860
Mm-hmm

1309
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,860
You'll be fine

1310
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:43,260
Yeah, and then you're fine. Yeah, you got seven you took seven. Okay. I'm only at seven HP

1311
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:51,140
Yes, the way I do half damage folks is I will sometimes slice the number of dice in half and so now it's also

1312
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,440
Some you do half damage we're doing I find that no

1313
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,260
Interesting half damn no because people do divide a game. Yes, if you know, you know

1314
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,940
- Thank you, and some people do know who it was.

1315
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,140
- Is it my turn to attack?

1316
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,620
- Not yet, 'cause it still gets one more move.

1317
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,460
- Great.

1318
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,420
- 'Cause it gets two attacks.

1319
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,240
- Cool.

1320
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,780
- The squeeze on you is just a sort of a passive effect.

1321
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,600
And so that not working.

1322
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,420
- Bro, this thing fucking you was just completely passive.

1323
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,420
It didn't even care.

1324
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,260
- Good.

1325
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,940
- I'm just a thing to be used, I guess.

1326
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,860
- That not working frustrated it,

1327
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,540
and it sort of like uses two of its tentacles

1328
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,300
from like a back and just kind of like tries to lurch around and like kind of

1329
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:39,660
clap you. Whoa that's actually kind of cool. You're telling me I rizzed on this

1330
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:46,340
thing and it's trying to clap me. Damn. Wow and it got a one and so when it claps it

1331
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:52,580
like like it kind of like there's like a dick one and a pussy one. It did the

1332
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,180
wrong one. Does it let me go because of the vibration through its entire body?

1333
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,000
I'll let you roll another strength does it does it doesn't get out Tom and Jerry hit with the frying pan

1334
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,580
Yeah, very much. That's another three not quite letting you go, but all you knock down is blocks

1335
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,380
But now we're back

1336
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:14,900
So sorry you should maybe try being just an adult

1337
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,020
Instead of a little kid who plays with blocks. I did bring the blocks onto the

1338
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,240
Hey, you put it on why they all in front of him

1339
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:29,840
that I didn't do he's getting angry you should just start your turn okay I'm

1340
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,120
good I guess I stop I guess I'm gonna try anything just a strength check again

1341
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,040
yeah you should try that okay okay that's a 17 nice yeah you're able to

1342
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,480
break out all right but I can't do anything else right no you can you can do

1343
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,080

1345
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,840

1346
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:03,720
eight it is ironic I threw an eight to use a penis blade on a pussy monster it's

1347
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:09,880
very ironic it's a bit ironic a little sarcastic - um yeah it doesn't hit okay

Eleven. Eleven. You're up. You gotta go again though. Okay twenty. That hits. Okay ten.

1352
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,280

1353
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,440
I'll give you one extra thing. Okay. One of the holes it's stuck to my mouth like

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,240
and I go like like who are you Ray William Johnson watch out and I'm like

1356
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,120
kind of throw my pole like a javelin and you say watch out but I can't do

1357
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:04,600
anything well you kind of do like you're I don't have a pole here this is my pole

1358
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,880
and this and it goes and you kind of like dodge your tummy out of the way a

1359
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,520
little bit you suck in your tummy and it goes right by you like it would have

1360
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,320
fucking killed you if you didn't suck in your tummy.

1361
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,180
And then it goes, also the pipe has balls at the end of it,

1362
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,480
and it goes, balls, dang.

1363
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,160
(laughing)

1364
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,120
And then the monster goes, and the monster goes,

1365
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,840
and then it explodes like Mega Man

1366
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,320
with all the circles that go out.

1367
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,160
- Right.

1368
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,000
- Yeah.

1369
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,840
Like, doo doo.

1370
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,720
- Yeah, and the--

1371
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,300
- And then the balls are gone,

1372
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,240
'cause I don't want that on my weapon normally.

1373
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,320
- That would seem gay.

1374
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,560
- Yeah, it just looks like they were on there for a second,

1375
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,600
it was a trick of the way but there's not actually ball of soft fluorescence yeah

1376
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:53,640
the guy when this thing like gets stabbed and like slumps over and then it doesn't

1377
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,800
and explodes like Mega Man 2 also that also happens it can be Mega Man 1 it

1378
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,440
doesn't have to be Mega Man 2. Pretty good. What is up with your cleverness

1379
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,720
tonight? It's Riz. Somebody pound him. Cameron better Riz. I'm scared.

1380
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:16,480
said pound him. I'm scared of him. So you, the guy, lands like this thing, this like guy is

1381
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,040
spazzing out. Yeah he's doing a cool dance move that I just did. And then his

1382
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,320
eyes roll forward and then they kind of just glaze over and he's dead. The guy

1383
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:37,300
that was attached? Hmm. Shame. Wait, but the technical monster. Technical monster is dead as well, very dead. And as that happens you two

1384
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,820

1386
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:54,540
room right now? My heart's gonna be beating this whole time. I've picked up baby Gadd.

1387
00:50:54,540 --> 00:51:01,180
and I'm just ramming him into the wall behind the bed.

1388
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:10,620
Show me. Where's the... The you. Yeah. So I have him picked up and I'm just going like

1389
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:18,420
that on the wall. Okay. Stop ramming me! Just like every time you hit him against the

1390
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:26,260
wall. And you do... Does it open the door? No, but you do hear a bit of a hollowness

1391
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:30,580
on certain parts of the wall, towards the bottom of the wall. Towards the bottom, so

1392
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:37,060
it's the floor. Maybe. So now that I hear the hollowness, I start jumping up and

1393
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:43,060
down on the floor. Okay, you still hear the hollowness. Is it getting louder or...?

1394
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:48,320
it's getting it's less loud as you jump up and down the floor so it's on the

1395
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:55,780
wall you gotta these are the things you gotta figure out so it's maybe on the

1396
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:11,660
wall so perhaps it may be behind the wall

1397
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:22,900
or the floor or the floor I don't see him figuring this out I'm gonna be real he

1398
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,460
doesn't have to figure it all right you don't have to figure this out it'll keep

1399
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,940
going the game then why'd you cut to him because I wanted to resolve whatever

1400
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,980
this is for you should kind of you should cut to a cutscene now where he has no

1401
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:43,760
control. That's fair. I think he's giving you no choice. I am going to roll a

1402
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:54,140
suicide threat. I'm gonna say if this door doesn't open right now I'm gonna

1403
00:52:54,140 --> 00:53:03,180
fucking kill myself. I can't tell which is real. What'd you get? I got a nine. It's

1404
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:11,500
not very convincing I don't think you're gonna do it uh-huh I don't have a gun

1405
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:18,340
anymore okay

1406
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:29,980
yeah I'm like my breath until something happens in this room baby cat who's just

1407
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,580
He's completely beat up.

1408
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,980
He's just trying to take the hoagie from you.

1409
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,980
Stop it!

1410
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,980
Stop it!

1411
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,500
You're going fucking crazy!

1412
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
He's drunk like an accordion.

1413
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
Yeah, yeah he is.

1414
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
He's smushed.

1415
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,820
He's walking around, he's waddling back and forth.

1416
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,820
Yeah, yeah.

1417
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,100
Yeah, he's like, just- Can I roll investigation again?

1418
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,580
No, you did it already.

1419
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,580
You just didn't get a very high roll.

1420
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,580
Can I roll perception?

1421
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,580
No, it's not how that works.

1422
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,540
Why are you so obsessed with this secret room, man?

1423
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,140
Get the fuck out of there!

1424
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,860
No, I need to find out where this room goes to.

1425
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,340
(sighing)

1426
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,300
- All right, well you gotta come up

1427
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,220
with some other way to find out.

1428
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,860
You need to use your brain here.

1429
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,740
Your real brain. - Perception is a brain thing.

1430
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,460
- No, no, no, no, don't think in terms of stats.

1431
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,980
Think about what you wanna do to try to figure it out.

1432
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,820
I'll tell you if there are stats involved.

1433
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,140
Think about that. - So there's a hollow part

1434
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,620
of the wall.

1435
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,740
- We know that, right?

1436
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:25,340
- Can I shoot my, okay, I'm gonna overclock

1437
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,180
(laughing)

1438
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,140
I'm gonna overclock my hoverboard's engine

1439
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,420
and shoot it at the wall.

1440
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,140
- That's insane.

1441
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,220
- Until it makes a hole. - So insane it--

1442
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,620
- Just might work. - That's a long pause,

1443
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,780
can I shoot my--

1444
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,660
(laughing)

1445
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,060
- Well what about here, here, here.

1446
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,900
- Can I shoot?

1447
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,100
(laughing)

1448
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,900
Can I shoot my--

1449
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,340
- You can try this out.

1450
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,180
- Okay.

1451
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,380
- I like that he said overclock, that's kinda fun.

1452
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,620
- He did say overclock.

1453
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,860
- Yeah.

1454
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,860
The price is you have to describe to me what it means to overclock your hoverboard.

1455
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:08,060
There is like a normal skateboard. There's like I have a tool and then there's like a little like

1456
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:13,900
there's like a 3/8 nut on it and I'm just I'm loosening it.

1457
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,780
Loosening your nut.

1458
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,780
I'm not sure that that is an overclock. You're just loosening the trucks.

1459
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:25,100
To make the trucks wobble so much or to make the hoverboard trucks wobble so much

1460
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,420
that when they go really fast it'll kill me.

1461
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,260
- But how does it--

1462
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,100
(laughing)

1463
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,180
- Wait, I thought you were trying to put it into the wall.

1464
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,380
- Because if we're going back to the suicide thing,

1465
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,220
what's happening?

1466
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,660
- Okay, then I tighten them up so that the battery--

1467
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,660
- No, no, no, wait, snap it.

1468
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,780
- No, no, no, so the battery on the inside

1469
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,220
gets overcharged.

1470
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,060
- Okay.

1471
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,880
- Yeah, there's like a--

1472
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,660
- I like you unlocking new things about your hoverboard

1473
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,500
that I didn't know.

1474
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,780
I'm very into that.

1475
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,580
So let's have you try, so roll a ranged attack.

1476
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,980
So just roll a hoverboard attack.

1477
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,740
I think it's trickier attacks on top.

1478
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,660
- Yeah, it's just a one D8 plus one.

1479
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,980
- So the plus in the middle, in the middle,

1480
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,260
that's gonna be what your attack roll is.

1481
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,100
- Okay.

1482
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,920
- So look at those numbers in the middle.

1483
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,160
What does it say next to the hover board?

1484
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,000
- Plus four.

1485
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,780
- All right, roll it and add that four.

1486
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,980
- Okay.

1487
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,060
So I roll.

1488
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,900
- Roll a D20. - Roll a D20.

1489
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,980
- D20, D20, D20.

1490
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,060
- D20 plus four.

1491
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:17,900
- Mm-hmm.

1492
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:22,340
- Okay. - That is an 18 plus four.

1493
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,420
- Wow, okay.

1494
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,500
So you sling the hoverboard, and it gets jammed

1495
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:35,840
into the wall, and almost enough that you could

1496
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,760
wrench out a piece.

1497
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,660
- Okay.

1498
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,580
So I wrench out a piece.

1499
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,080
- Okay, roll a strength check.

1500
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,940
(laughing)

1501
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,140
Your hoverboard is stuck inside the wall.

1502
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,980
- Oh my god.

1503
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,580
- Your hoverboard is like stuck inside the wall.

1504
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,940
- Okay, then I'm gonna go on SkyMall and buy a new one.

1505
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,660
- That's fine.

1506
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,820
Okay, you're gonna go on SkyMall.

1507
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,780
- We are in a spaceship.

1508
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,620
It would have gone.

1509
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,220
- I just like that he's not gonna,

1510
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,620
like if she could come back

1511
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,980
and your hoverboard's in the wall.

1512
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,620
- I don't care if she comes back.

1513
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,100
I know she's in a secret room behind the bed.

1514
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,260
- I care, I like her.

1515
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,220
- You like her a little too much

1516
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,340
based on the game you gave her.

1517
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,620
- You're in love with her.

1518
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,500
- You are like a creator who falls in love

1519
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,340
with his characters.

1520
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,160
- I know. - Yeah.

1521
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,380
- No, don't. - Like, fuck him.

1522
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,740
- They could make a movie like Stranger Than Fiction.

1523
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,420
- Yes. - Where he is God.

1524
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,300
- Oh, shit.

1525
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,140
- And instead of Will Ferrell, it is a woman.

1526
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,460
- There's more to the idea, I thought it was just him as God.

1527
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,940
- Yeah, wait, what happens in that movie?

1528
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,620
- I don't remember. - She basically writes him

1529
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,460
into a walker. - That was a movie

1530
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,340
that I think me and my family had the same experience

1531
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,020
as millions of families around the world.

1532
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,860
- You think it's a funny Will Ferrell comedy?

1533
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:58,380
thought it was a an elf movie and then we rented it and we all went huh yeah yeah

1534
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:03,900
it's kind of like a boring Truman show yeah yeah pretty amazing I had the same

1535
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,940
yeah I said everybody a lot of families yeah that experience that was his movie

1536
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,980
immediately because I'm the cause of the cover of the DVD five going like this

1537
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:16,740
fiction yeah and you're like what I remember I'm very much a he's going like

1538
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,940
"STOP FOLLOWING ME!" and you're like "that's a funny willfowl"

1539
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,840
but it's... and we all were trying to laugh

1540
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
we were all watching going "uh"

1541
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,840
we were all trying to calibrate

1542
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,840
I remember I watched half of it and then decided I wanted to go play Tony Hawk upstairs

1543
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,840
then came back down and asked my mom "how was the movie?" and she said "eh"

1544
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,840
yeah it's not very good

1545
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,840
it's that kind of movie

1546
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,840
ok so his rollerblades are stuck in the fucking floor

1547
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,840
and what's up with you?

1548
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:50,840
What's up with me? Yeah, how are you? What's your life? Okay, wait, I just say, "All right, I give up," and I walk out of the room.

1549
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:56,480
Yeah, finally. You see Baby Gat is now just like, his feet are on the wall. He's trying to pull it out.

1550
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,240
Like, he's so... Oh, Baby Gat. Yeah, he's such a goofball. Yeah, ah, it sucks.

1551
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:08,000
He's such a fucking idiot. Wait, can I say something to him right now? Yeah, of course you can. If anyone

1552
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,160
comes in here and asks what happened, just say that I got bored.

1553
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,520
He like looks at you, and he's like wants to kill you

1554
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,900
More than anything and he just goes back to pulling up the skateboard out of the wall

1555
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,840
We'll cut back to you two now

1556
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,640
so

1557
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:32,040
Footsteps who's this cute little pitter-patter walk. It is cute little putter-patter. It's

1558
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,640
It's a Seamus

1559
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,960
He's a leprechaun you rescued

1560
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,480
who do you think it was?

1561
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,480
fucking Sullivan!

1562
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,480
the good one!

1563
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,480
the one that I'd be excited to hear the pitter patter of his little fucking feet

1564
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
and the other one is not even named Sullivan

1565
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,480
he's crud

1566
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,480
dirt or nothing

1567
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
he has a lot of different names

1568
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,480
Adam

1569
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,480
like an atom

1570
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
the molecule

1571
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
the wimp

1572
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,480
so a Seamus comes up to you guys

1573
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,480
and says

1574
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,240
name? Ashamis. Like Ashanti? Ashamis? I didn't know it was Ashamis.

1575
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,160
Ashamis, like he's a shame. Was he the guy playing on Osama?

1576
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,000
Play on Irish names? No, it's a play on Ashamed, not Ashanti.

1577
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,520
Wait, why are you, what are you doing here?

1578
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,720
What, a better question would be what are you two doing here? Was this the guy who got

1579
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,560
killed, who got killed and then we rescued him?

1580
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,720
Yes. He didn't get killed. But he got almost got, he got, that was a different guy, right?

1581
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,120
That's a different guy. That's what I was saying. Wait, who's this guy? So who's this guy?

1582
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:41,060
So you guys very first episode you guys run the zippy loop and a royal guard. Oh, yes

1583
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:46,340
You guys helped him out I remember now a Seamus

1584
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:54,360
We fully have remembered you it took us a minute. Where are we we got thrown down here by a fucking

1585
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,440
scientist assistant

1586
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,440
curious

1587
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:03,160
Amazing

1588
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
*laughter*

1589
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,160
Oh!

1590
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,160
You guys are deep in the guts!

1591
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,160
I don't know where, uh...

1592
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,160
I don't know what you think about the assistant scientist, but are you guys doing alright?

1593
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,160
Oh, shit!

1594
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,160
He looks at the, the, the, the tentacle monster mass and the guy on the ground, he's like...

1595
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,160
You guys killed a greech!

1596
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,160
And a...

1597
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160

A grinch?

1602
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,160
A greech!

1603
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,160
That's a greech to disagreech.

1604
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,160
What the fuck are we doing here?

1605
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,920

1606
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,040

1607
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:46,760

1608
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,000

01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000

1610
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,480
think it's play time. Wait. Don't hey, I have a strategy

1611
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,480
Playtime, you're a killer!

1612
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,480
Wait, who's playtime? Wait, what's that guy's identity?

1613
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,480
*laughter*

1614
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,480
Yeah, wait.

1615
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,480
Wait, like, whatever reason we're all blanking.

1616
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,480
I don't know, everybody's trying to figure out.

1617
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,480
I can't remember.

1618
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,480
Everybody's trying to figure out what his identity is.

1619
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,480
And it is?

1620
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,480
I don't know.

1621
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,480
Oh, it's you, right?

1622
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,480
I'm not playtime.

1623
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,480
Well, then who is it if it's not you?

1624
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,480
Okay, then laugh for us.

okay

1629
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,900
a

1630
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,400
white guy

1631
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,540

yeah that was good

1636
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,720
and i would just like to say that's pretty much how it is these days

1637
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,280
that's true he's irish remember

1638
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,280
uh... yeah he agrees

1639
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,760

1640
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,840

1641
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,760
fuck yeah you should can we go back the way we came

1642
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,360
Uh, well, where'd you come from?

1643
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,360
From there, I point to where we came from.

1644
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,560
Yeah, the chute, all the way up there.

1645
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,760
Well, not that way, but I could take you to the Boglins and I can get you out through there.

1646
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,760
The what?

1647
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,760
Oh, you guys don't even know.

1648
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,760
I guess, why would you know?

1649
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,760
The Boglins.

1650
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:40,760
A lot of us leprechauns, we don't really prefer the slave quarters, so we kind of made a little home for ourselves here in the gods.

1651
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,760
Why wouldn't you want to live there? It's nice.

1652
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,760
Um...

1653
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,760
They feed you, there's beds.

1654
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,760
Well they do feed us in the slave quarters, but that's about it for benefits I would say.

1655
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
That's about it, sounds ungrateful to me.

1656
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,760
Here, here, here, I can help you guys navigate here, I'll bring you to-

1657
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,760
Oh, and you guys should meet Bear McGinnis, he'll love you guys.

1658
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,760
He saved me.

1659
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,760
Okay.

1660
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,760
He's our leader, here, I'll lead you through.

1661
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,760
Oh great, another fucking community we have to meet.

1662
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,760
Cool.

1663
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,760
I hate communities.

1664
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,760
Me too.

1665
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,920
- Yeah, I'll always find my notes for this, I'm sorry.

1666
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,320
- I'll find your notes for this.

1667
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,660
(humming)

1668
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,440
- Oh, you're the one tapping, Patrick.

1669
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,480
- Made this song for you.

1670
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,800
- Patrick was making a rhythm.

1671
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,480
- So, leading you through the guts,

1672
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,840
the slick, winding passageways of--

1673
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,320
- Are they slick and wet, guts?

1674
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,160
- They're winding.

1675
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,080
- Oh. - And winding?

1676
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:42,920
Drab paneling are almost nauseating in their contortions.

1677
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,860
It's hard to get a sense of where you are

1678
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,120
and where you were.

1679
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,560
A Seamus moves through them though

1680
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,580
with a somewhat practiced confidence,

1681
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,000
but an altogether ease.

1682
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,120
The drone of the space station begins to fade

1683
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,240
as you move through, giving way to a more localized

1684
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,320
hissings and moanings of the machinery around you.

1685
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,360
This is like, a lot of things are very cyber-y

1686
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,560
and like, (mumbles)

1687
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,800
but this is like real fucking machines.

1688
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,600
Like this is what actually makes a ship work, you know.

1689
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,720
But even those begin to fade, replaced by a stillness

1690
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,140
and then drip, drop, drip, drop.

1691
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,940
And he says, "Watch your step now."

1692
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,480
And you hear the gentle plod of his small boot

1693
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,960
in a shallow puddle.

1694
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,900
And as Seamus gestures ahead, you see a pathetic stream

1695
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:26,340
of murky green liquid just kind of like winding through.

1696
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,800
And he says, "It's waste, but it gets better."

1697
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,500
And as you move down the corridor,

1698
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,660
this sickly little waste begins to shimmer and reflect

1699
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,820
with like a little additive luster, just like a little bit more like oomph to it.

1700
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,660
It takes a second look to realize that in the dark of the guts this can't be

1701
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,860
reflection, right? Like it's too dark down here so it's genuinely glowing.

1702
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,620
There's something sparkly and glowing about it. You can see the flickers of

1703
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,580
green light dance at your ankles as you push through the waste and when you

1704
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,620
reach the end of the corridor there's a wall in front of you made of the same

1705
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:04,340
plain paneling you saw before but the stream goes on, not pulling up by this

1706
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:10,820
wall but clearly originating from behind it. He says we're here and a Seamus cups

1707
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:19,660
his hands around his mouth and presses his face against the door and he says

1708
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:28,820
he laughs and then he says something "hearty-tarty-farty-hearty-tarty-tarty-farty"

1709
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:40,140
muffled reply and then the door opens but only about three feet high that's my

1710
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,540
people you're talking about yeah well we apologies precautionary the pass

1711
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:49,340
precautionary measures you have to crawl through a bit but then you'll get to

1712
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:55,500
extend up and yeah he sort of walks on through you guys want to crawl through

1713
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,940
- I'm crawling in. - Yeah.

1714
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,620
- You guys crawl through the muck a little bit.

1715
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,180
You get a little bit, as you crawl through,

1716
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,540
you guys feel a little bit of like a,

1717
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,500
it's kinda like a--

1718
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,780
- We're getting high.

1719
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,620
- A little bit, but it's kinda like

1720
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,060
you're just a little bit more aware, suddenly.

1721
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,280
- Okay, all right.

1722
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,260
- Hyper reality.

1723
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,820
- There's a pool that sits in the center.

1724
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,980
(laughing)

1725
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,180
- Come on, man. - Whoa.

1726
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,380
- Hyper reality.

1727
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,020
- I'm just trying to analyze whatever passes through.

1728
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:26,540
- In the center where the muck trickles,

1729
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,060
in that is a glowing, fully, vibrantly green.

1730
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,140
So there's a real, like, actual pool

1731
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,420
kind of settling in in the middle.

1732
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,060
Can you show everybody what that is?

1733
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,380
- Here, let me hold it up to the toy camera.

1734
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:40,160
- So Patrick put the beheaded Barbie on top of Cam's figure.

1735
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:46,900
If I read anything that's longer than three sentences,

1736
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,620
this is basically, which is my fault, really.

1737
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:51,300
- I put my hands on the, listen, I mean, look at me.

1738
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,140
I'm ready.

1739
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:52,980
Thank you, yeah.

1740
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,500
(laughing)

1741
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,340
I'm a teacher's pet, I'll admit it.

1742
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:01,780
And yeah, you see this pool of the muck,

1743
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,780
and around it is a protective glass dome.

1744
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,060
And around that dome are terminals

1745
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:10,140
with nozzles and respirator masks.

1746
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,500
And there are a number of tunnels extending out

1747
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,380
from this little atrium where you can see

1748
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:17,020
a little bit more clearly that there's a whole other

1749
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,220
kind of little village there.

1750
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:22,940
You see a few leprechauns sitting at these terminals,

1751
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:25,740
interacting with the modules,

1752
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:28,580
and then intermittently huffing from the respirator,

1753
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,660
which seems to be drawing from this domed gas

1754
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,180
where the sparkly green liquid is--

1755
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,320
- Dome and gash?

1756
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,260
Keep reading.

1757
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,100
- And if you look closely,

1758
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,740
you can see the corners of their eyes

1759
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,860
filling with faded spots of that murky green

1760
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,180
that matches the muck below,

1761
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:48,940
and then, excuse me, slide towards the corners of their eyes.

1762
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,940
It kind of like fills up like like kind of like you're taking in a breath and then

1763
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,700
falls away

1764
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,380
Until all that's left is the whites again that little bit of pink

1765
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,560
and

1766
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:04,000
Yeah, so that's what you guys see and you see a shame as he says this is where some of us will draw our strength

1767
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,260
Sometimes when you have to go out to fight with some of the sex toys and the the greaches

1768
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,400
The greaches are madmen

1769
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,700
They're people who have been exposed to way too much of the bad quality air and water from

1770
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:21,540
Living in the guts and working in the guts and now they're crazy. I think that thing was people that tentacle thing

1771
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:27,100
Well, not that but the guy you touched I thought it wasn't it me too. The guy attached to him was a people. Oh

1772
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,060
Okay, true. They'll ride them that way

1773
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:37,180
The ride the fuck toys that live dance between the guts you sound a lot like Jordan Peterson right now. Oh

1774
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,860
That's a problem with

1775
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,600
Yeah, right, that's kind of I felt listen that one muck

1776
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,120
I'd like to take a big bite out of that I kind of knew you would say that

1777
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:54,620
Fuck you, man. I don't take a bite. I do I can't help myself

1778
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,960
Oh, yeah, you take a big huff out of this shit

1779
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,700
Yeah, and you feel kind of like this like that similar to that rush or it's kind of like in your head

1780
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,700
but it's kind of more um and

1781
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,820
Ambiguous now it like kind of goes in your head

1782
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:11,740
But they kind of like filters throughout your body and for the next 10 minutes you'll add plus one to all of your rolls

1783
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:18,620
Whoa, okay, I want to do it luckily we're not in any combat situation, so this is pretty useless. I'll take it, okay

1784
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,620
You do the same yeah, you also for the next 10 minutes

1785
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:26,180
Fuck I just feel like fucking killing something well. Maybe wait a little bit on that

1786
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,940
Okay

1787
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:35,400
And as you walk through a little bit further in the tunnels, and you start to see

1788
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,020
This murky green bog completely still

1789
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:44,820
You see shacks and like little pockets of shamrock fields,

1790
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,660
sort of like lawn, amongst these shacks

1791
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,940
that are made of like kind of bits of metal

1792
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:54,260
kind of yanked from the, not the siding,

1793
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,620
'cause we're not on the side of the ship,

1794
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,940
but kind of inside the guts.

1795
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:58,940
- It could still be siding.

1796
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,860
- Is that what, yeah, right, 'cause it's just a material.

1797
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,760
This is where it is, right, yeah, so.

1798
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,180
And you see leprechauns dancing,

1799
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,260
their little stumpy feet bouncing along to the--

1800
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:11,760
Let me guess, they're doing Irish jigs.

1801
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,860
They certainly are.

1802
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,360
Come on.

1803
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,660
Yeah, the Macarena.

1804
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:17,860
Yep, they're doing-- I like that so much better.

1805
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:20,660
They're all doing the Macarena to a fiddle played

1806
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,860
by a one-eyed leprechaun.

1807
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,860
The room itself is covered in like a little thin piping

1808
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:29,960
that kind of weaves to and fro, along with paneling,

1809
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,500
and some more of those terminals where

1810
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,700
you see leprechauns sit while drinking Guinness

1811
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,060
while they're working on the terminals.

1812
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,340
Clothes hang on some of the thinner piping

1813
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:43,660
and makeshift rafts of fallen debris

1814
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,100
sit on the bog.

1815
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,420
- Just debris though.

1816
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,700
- With little leprechaun children playing atop them.

1817
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,340
Further back there's an iron building

1818
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,520
that's about the size of all the shacks put together

1819
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,180
and then some, it's like much bigger

1820
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,660
than everything else you've been seeing.

1821
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,300
And taking up the remaining space

1822
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,660
in this kind of large chamber.

1823
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,460
And it looks like a submarine almost.

1824
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,780
And within the small circular windows,

1825
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,580
you can glimpse some leprechauns moving around

1826
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:14,460
and the faint blue glow of other terminal screens.

1827
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,340
Hopping along those rafts, by the way,

1828
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,300
inside the bog where the children are playing,

1829
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,140
kinda like jumping around,

1830
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,900
you also see somebody else there,

1831
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,820
and you see the children have taken this somebody else's hat

1832
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:30,140
and are now saying, "Froggy in the middle,

1833
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,220
"Froggy in the middle,"

1834
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,100
and are just passing it around between them.

1835
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,420
Who is it? - Oh, I hear that,

1836
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:36,940
and I'm like walking the other way instantly.

1837
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,940
It's like complete reflex reaction.

1838
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,660
- Come on, this isn't fun anymore.

1839
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:42,500
Ha ha ha.

1840
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,820
- And he's trying to grab his hat

1841
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,620
and they just took his hat from him.

1842
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:50,180
And he sees you guys walking in, your friend nothing.

1843
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,860
He says, "Oh, how did you guys get here?"

1844
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,180
- I'm going long.

1845
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,380
- I start just going for a Hail Mary, a froggy hat.

1846
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,260
- The kid immediately tosses it to you,

1847
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,180
bully recognizing, yeah, bully, yeah.

1848
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,980
- I grab it and then I throw it on the ground

1849
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,980
Step on it sir doing in zone

1850
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:12,220
Yeah

1851
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:20,140
But not before I take a shit in it you take this I do it before the fire you are so fucking stupid

1852
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,900
And then you have to wear it

1853
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:27,340
Roll persuasion with advantage

1854
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:35,420
It's five everything's plopping is plopping. It's a plop and a ten

1855
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,620
Have you guys been a plop night? I think your charisma is pretty high

1856
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:43,800
It has been a bit of a even just the rest know you guys open the battle you guys both did great

1857
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,560
You guys talk about the quality of the rolls even though just like the plopping plus three

1858
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,740
I have been there 13 campaign 13 13. It's enough for Sullivan

1859
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:55,980
He puts the hat on puts his poopy fire hat flaming poop. It smells like shit. It's like that

1860
01:13:55,980 --> 01:14:02,660
Oh God, what the fuck smells like shit Sullivan. Do you have a shower? God? I do all the time. Oh, I meant to tell you

1861
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:10,660
It's bad for your hair I text the both of them on my PSP and say guys I Sullivan smells like hey

1862
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:17,380

01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:24,580
Haha react and then I switched my haha to an emphasize and I say we clowning I put yeah

1864
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:29,260
We clown and the gift that I said is so funny. Oh

01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:33,220
I forgot to tell you guys I went to the check called clowning

1866
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:37,180
Into the gym you told me to get stronger. Yeah, I can't

1867
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:44,620
I bet I can lift this you guys have the snake. No, but we have this and I'd what's the heavier close your eyes

1868
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,420
I got a snake

1869
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,420
Close your eyes. Come on

1870
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,980
Okay, put my fucking cock in his mouth

1871
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:54,120
(laughter)

1872
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,500
- Oh, come on, man.

1873
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,700
- That's not how it would sound.

1874
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,540
- That is how it would sound.

1875
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:58,360
- It would be so full.

1876
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,200
- That is how it would sound.

1877
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,040
- It would be so full.

1878
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:00,860
- That's exactly how it would sound.

1879
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:03,420
- You wouldn't be able to say anything.

1880
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,260
It would not be perfectly enough saying everything.

1881
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:07,620
- You have the worst tasting Tic Tac I've ever had.

1882
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,140
(laughter)

1883
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,140
- Sullivan could not own me.

1884
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,580
Okay, I cut his head off.

1885
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,860
(laughter)

1886
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,500
No, I don't put my cock in his mouth.

1887
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,740
That's all just funny.

1888
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,580
- Yeah, that's right.

1889
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,420
- Yeah, that's true.

1890
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,260
- Yeah, that's not.

1891
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,060
- But I do put,

1892
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,000
- What are you gonna try to see what he can lift?

1893
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,420
- My gun in his mouth.

1894
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,660
(laughing)

1895
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,460
- I say, "Lift this," and I shoot a bullet.

1896
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,220
(laughing)

1897
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,060
- Do you shoot him?

1898
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,180
- I shoot at his feet.

1899
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:36,120
- Okay, cool.

1900
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,140
- Like I'm saying dance, but I say, "Lift this."

1901
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,380
- You should have to roll to see

1902
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,860
whether or not he shoots him.

1903
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:45,820
- I might miss, I guess if I miss where I'm shooting at,

1904
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,740
it's gonna hit his foot.

1905
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,580
I mean, his foot.

1906
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,420
- We have to do this?

1907
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,240
All right, yeah, do it, roll.

1908
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,480
- It's mechanics, right?

1909
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,320
- Yeah, I think I can't help that.

1910
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,440
- You're the one who's like, you know,

1911
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,080
trying to keep all the rules in check.

1912
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:55,960
This is obvious.

1913
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,520
- So if I hit, I hit the ground,

1914
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,720
'cause I'm not aiming for his foot.

1915
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,560
- No, you're not aiming for his foot.

1916
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,880
- But if I miss badly enough, it's gonna hit his foot,

1917
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,900
and there's really not much I can do about that.

1918
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,600
So that's a 14.

1919
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,440
- Okay.

1920
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,520
I mean, that's, so here's a question.

1921
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,920
What was the goal?

1922
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,040
- The goal is just to shoot at his feet and have him--

1923
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,120
- 14, you don't hit him.

1924
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,480
- Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying, yeah.

1925
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,320
- 14, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1926
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,360
you back

1927
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,320
okay uh... adult

1928
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,820
uh... i don't think it'll be fair

1929
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:28,420
he's so we can get a little bit darker

1930
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,140
shrewdly

1931
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,840
do you eat

1932
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,880
you eat

1933
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:41,880
units yes you can make it

1934
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,320
uh...

1935
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:50,320
I'm just, I'm not even, I'm completely spaced out and that voice is talking in my head and I'm not sure I'm supposed to...

1936
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,320
You want to kill them!

1937
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:58,320
We'll cut from that back to you.

1938
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,320
I'm back in the room playing charades.

1939
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,320
You're playing charades again.

1940
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,320
Charades by myself.

1941
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:11,320
And I would say eventually like you, I mean like you're gonna go to sleep right?

1942
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,320
No, I'm playing charades with scooter.

1943
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,320
Playing charades with scooter? Okay.

1944
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,320
Gina Davis.

1945
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,320
[Laughter]

1946
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,320
This game is so good!

1947
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:25,320
Okay, who am I now?

1948
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,320
Apollo 13. Dang.

1949
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,320
No, it was Gina Davis.

1950
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,320
I was thinking about astronauts.

1951
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,320
Okay. Do you like astronauts?

1952
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,320
Sometimes I wish I could be an astronaut.

1953
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,320
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now.

1954
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,320
Me too.

1955
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,320
Goodnight.

1956
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,320
He just starts spinning in place.

1957
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:57,320
I try to sleep like that and then realize it's making me more energetic so then I lay down.

1958
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,320
You have like 35 minutes.

1959
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,320
Like this is not working.

1960
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:07,320
Oh, new sleeping style.

1961
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,160
- No, I've been sleeping late.

1962
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,360
- Sleeping style unlocked.

1963
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,440
(laughing)

1964
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,280
- No cap.

1965
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,340
- So yeah, as you start to,

1966
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:20,840
sorry, here, let me find this, I apologize.

1967
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,360
I thought I had this up, I don't have it up.

1968
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,600
I have it up now.

1969
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,640
So yeah, you start to feel your eyelids get to heavy.

1970
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:32,880
And the images of the screen, the Shrades game is still up.

1971
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,280
They start to get kind of more smeared and indistinct,

1972
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,200
but as you try to stay focused, you hear a familiar song.

1973
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,040
- No.

1974
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,880
- And when you eventually relent and fall asleep.

1975
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,500
- ♪ When you see Tupac ♪

1976
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,360
♪ Call the cops when you see Tupac ♪

1977
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,240
- You have to put your microphone on.

1978
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,320
- No, I'm doing it's faint.

1979
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,040
- Yeah, you first hear nothing but

1980
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:56,640
the sort of like gentle whirring of Scooter, your new friend.

1981
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,400
As you, and then also Baby Gadd kind of struggling

1982
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,800
in the other room trying to yank the skateboard out.

1983
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,420
But then that familiar tune starts to get louder

1984
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:08,200
and it starts to really eke its way into your head again.

1985
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,220
Roll Perception.

1986
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:18,140
- That is an 11.

1987
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,800
- Even with that 11, you can almost swear

1988
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,400
that you see the Shrades game starting to play itself.

1989
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,660
Shifting between different options.

1990
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,360
But then the lullaby you had heard earlier does,

1991
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,200
(burps)

1992
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,680
- Oh man.

1993
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,280
Does that, it burps in me, it burps in your face.

1994
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,720
- It turns it, it's Hit 'Em Up by Tupac,

1995
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,180
but it's all burps now.

1996
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,440
- And it lulls you into a slumber.

1997
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,560
You're dreaming now.

1998
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,260
And you find yourself at a carnival or amusement park

1999
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:51,800
or maybe a mall, some kind of dream-like hybrid

2000
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,320
of the three.

2001
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,560
You see faces you know, friends, lovers from your past,

2002
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,920
all partaking in the festivities.

2003
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,480
Who do you see there?

2004
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,280
Who does Patrick Yoda, when he dreams and he sees

2005
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,680
like the kind of faces you end up seeing in dreams,

2006
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,800
who does he see?

2007
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,140
- Every single person is a Yoda.

2008
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,980
- Yeah, every single person.

2009
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,960
- Every single person's green and small.

2010
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,120
- Okay, do you see your parents

2011
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,320
or do you see like cousins, friends?

2012
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,640
- I see Tupac Shakur.

2013
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,600
- You see Tupac, you see Yoda Tupac?

2014
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,000
- Yeah, Tupac Yoda.

2015
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,400
- And he sounds like this.

2016
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,920
What's going on, Patrick Yoda?

2017
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,480
How are you doing, man?

2018
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,800
- You had such a layup there.

2019
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,440
- I know, but did I have a layup?

2020
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,440
Is that what that's called?

2021
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,940
- You could have done Yoda voice.

2022
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:32,780
- Oh.

2023
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:36,620
It's too late now.

2024
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,280
- All right, all right.

2025
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,420
- But now I'm trying to think of,

2026
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,120
what would Tupac Yoda, you should do that,

2027
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,960
you run with that.

2028
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,320
I'm passing the buck, you're right, it's not fair.

2029
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,840
- Yep, it's done.

2030
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,400
- So you see these guys though,

2031
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,360
also Patrick Yoda.

2032
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,040
What's your favorite toy?

2033
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,120
(laughs)

2034
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,500
- Probably the hoverboard.

2035
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,280
- Patrick Gerdes' favorite toy is a hoverboard.

2036
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:06,120
You see it rotate in front of you.

2037
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,960
Like that old joke of,

2038
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,920
I'm rotating a cube in my mind.

2039
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,320
You see the hoverboard.

2040
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,800
- Not really a joke.

2041
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,020
- It's like an idea.

2042
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,760
People use for humor.

2043
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:23,880
It's like eternally within and out of reach.

2044
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,960
It's like you can grab it.

2045
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,760
my arms and I look away from it. As you look away from it, it's tracking you

2046
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:36,160
obviously. I'm doing this. You're doing that. You're doing that, yeah. It's following you.

2047
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:43,440
And you follow it, darting through the nowhere of this nowhere fun land, and as

2048
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,560
you do it, it begins to fade away. The toy starts to fade away until there's nothing

2049
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:52,160
left, but an indistinct corridor and you hear the

2050
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,720
faint sound of an, "Oh yeah!" from far away down the

2051
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,240
corridor.

2052
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,320
And you hear it alongside a bizarre series of

2053
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,240
squeals and pings and pangs and general, you know,

2054
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,440
onomatopoetic clamor, you know, like, "Bing, bang,

2055
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,000
ping, pong, bop."

2056
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,680
But it's all like a hundred octaves up and like

2057
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,640
getting stretched and compressed.

2058
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,360
and it's like, maybe like, you know when it's like,

2059
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,120
they try to show how bugs, what the hell, ass?

2060
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,960
You know, they try to show how bugs talk, you know that?

2061
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,160
Like that kind of thing, but like,

2062
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,000
it sounds like it's going through a computer

2063
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,080
and it has more character to it.

2064
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,360
And you hear like, "Oye, oye, oye,"

2065
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,040
like kind of in response to this.

2066
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,480
"Oye, como va?"

2067
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,520
(laughing)

2068
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,600
- It's the origin of the voice discovered.

2069
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,060
And as you move closer to the sounds,

2070
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,700
the toy in your mind begins to spin faster and faster.

2071
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,040
It's supposed to reappear.

2072
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,900
And the lullaby gets louder and louder,

2073
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,400
drowning out the seeming chatter.

2074
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,600
And you feel yourself pulled out of the dream.

2075
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,560
And as you do, an ancient, otherworldly character

2076
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,400
bears down on you.

2077
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,880
The pulsing yellow pus pockets of flesh glow in time.

2078
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,200
- Told you I got Pennywise vibes.

2079
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,320
- SpongeBob.

2080
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,400
- The ones, you would recognize them as the ones

2081
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,000
that you saw outside of the lair

2082
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,320
that were overhanging over the lair.

2083
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,560
They were part of a giant cascading

2084
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,580
like a mountain of flesh and shit.

2085
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,800
And they glow in time to a heartbeat

2086
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,800
that doesn't make sense.

2087
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,520
It's like arrhythmic.

2088
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,920
But you can tell it's something that is living.

2089
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:34,280
And you can also feel that it's from deep,

2090
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,200
deep within the space station.

2091
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,640
And you wake up this next morning

2092
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,340
and you have the foggiest sense of the truth

2093
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,820
as to where New Sullivan is.

2094
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:48,900
And we'll see exactly what you know,

2095
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:53,180
'cause it's not quite what you know now,

2096
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,360
but what you kinda know.

2097
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,200
- Okay.

2098
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,560
- Next time, we'll see that next time.

2099
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,160
- And right now, I'm throwing up.

2100
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:04,400
I throw up 'cause of the smell of the puss.

2101
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,240
- Okay, bye.

2102
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,760
- Bye. - I have to pee.

2103
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,480
- No, I have to pee first.

2104
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,480
Bye everybody.

2105
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,480
Ready?

What?

2108
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:18,960
I don't see it.

2109
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,960
Oh.
