00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,540
- Second year in a row.

14
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,440
Yeah, I guess you should be listening to this second.

15
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,680

You guys want me to play?

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,600
No, we don't write this.

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,400
Yes, we do.

35
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,900

36
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,300
It's the it's the company.

37
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,000
I mean, we shouldn't be talking about.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
Yeah, there's only yeah.

39
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,300
Yeah.

40
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,300
Who do you guys who employs you guys secretly?

41
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,600
Sony Ericsson, Sony Ericsson, the Department of Sony.

42
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,900
Yeah, because they need more content for the Sony Ericsson.

43
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,100
We're sponsored by Mitchell and Ness.

44
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,400
Oh, really?

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
That's kind of tight.

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,500
That's catchy.

47
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,900
That's cool.

48
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,600
You guys get the jerseys and shit?

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,900
Yeah, he wants just a whole operation

50
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,400
to kind of make people buy used basketball jerseys.

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000

53
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Yeah, we get a big white t-shirt.

54
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,000
We put the, you know, the jersey right over it.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Some kind of big pants.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,100
Wait, Andrew usually picks out our pants.

57
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
No, like, hold on.

58
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,300
Can I stop?

59
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,580
Like this is this isn't like a premise like you won.

60
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
Like you said, Branson, none of that's true.

61
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,300
Oh, well, that's why we're on the show is to lie to these guys.

62
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,420
They're so stupid. They're not going to know any better.

63
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,740
Yeah, we are seriously fucking stupid.

64
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,580
And you can say anything you want to us.

65
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,900
We'll pretty much believe it because it's funny.

66
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,180
Is that every day is like an adventure for us because we have so much money.

67
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,340
So it'll probably be really interesting for you guys to hear

68
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,580
about our very cool rich guy lives.

69
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,460
Yes. Tell us more about Mitchell and us.

70
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:36,940
like

71
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:54,940
little

72
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,940
I mean, if you like tie up a cat or a dog at a Gildan t-shirt, it's like,

73
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
I mean, it's like,

74
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,940
it's like a dog and a cat and a dog and a cat and a dog and a dog and a dog.

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
And it's like,

76
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,940
it's like a dog and a cat and a dog and a dog and a dog and a dog and a dog.

77
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
And it's like,

78
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,940
it's like a dog and a cat and a cat and a cat and a cat and a cat and a cat.

79
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,940
And it's like,

80
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,940
it's like a dog and a cat and a dog and a dog and a dog and a dog and a dog.

81
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,940
And it's like,

82
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,940
it's like a dog and a cat and a cat and a dog and a dog and a dog and a dog and a

83
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,940
It's like Dragon Ball Z armor basically.

84
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Yeah, I mean if you like tie up a cat or a dog in a Gildan t-shirt, it ain't getting out.

85
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,940
I want to do the... what workout do you think you have to do to get...

86
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,940
to fit a Gildan shirt like really well for it to look good on you?

87
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Do you think you need to be grown like a square Japanese watermelon?

88
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,940
Yeah, you need to be born in Gildan shirts.

89
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
An Iron Maiden style thing.

90
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Where there's no spikes in there, it's just square.

91
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,940
You gotta be built like your mom.

92
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
any of you.

93
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Uh, no.

94
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
What's the Spanish?

95
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,780
We don't have one mom.

96
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,820
Was that thing that Bugs Bunny and Gumby were always getting caught in where it like it

97
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,300
dresses your arms.

98
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Oh yeah.

99
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
Yeah.

100
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,860
No, the ones that stretch you out.

101
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,860
Stocks.

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,860
What's the one that stretches you out?

103
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Oh, the rack.

104
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
The rack.

105
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Yeah, the rack.

106
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Yes.

107
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,500
I think in order to fit into a Gildan t-shirt, you would need a, a, a, a horizontal rack.

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,780
One that would stretch you from shoulder to shoulder.

109
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,780
Horizontal rack.

110
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,780
Just ask my wife.

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,780
Hey.

112
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,780
and

113
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,320
cool. Yeah, she's got nice. She's got nice. She fills out her

114
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,660
gildans nicely. I married her, right? I married an incredibly

115
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,240
beautiful, wonderful woman. Thank you. Oh yeah. She's a lot.

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,380
She is a lot though. Yeah. She is a lot. I think I've met her

117
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,080
before. Doesn't she she manages a cricket wireless? Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,900
She she fills out a polo though. I'll tell you what. He ain't

119
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,100
lying about that. Yeah. I mean, she works out. Yeah. Well, you

120
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:11,580
have

121
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:26,580
the

122
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,420
can't talk to Republicans on Obama phones. It just says this

123
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,020
number. The only website you can go to is LinkedIn. Yeah,

124
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,660
that's right. If you try to text a Republican, it says this

125
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,020
number is sorry. This number has become too rational.

126
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,480
To level headed and logical with its beliefs. What I do

127
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,960
when I'm headed to like the the cricket wireless or the T

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,840
mobile or the Verizon store, what have you is I go in with a

129
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,640
big a big thing of of hedge trimmers. These giant shears

130
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,720
Because if you if you can cut through that like that metal wire thing that holds the phone to the table, you're allowed to take it.

131
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,280
Yes, they can't stop you.

132
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,360
It's just the it's just that wire that stops you.

133
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,080
I like it.

134
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,680
Or if you use the wire cutters on the person working there, if you kill them, you can take their stuff, too.

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
That's well, they're just there to cut the dreadlocks.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,800
We have a ballista set up for the people.

137
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,360
I went to way in the back.

138
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,520
I went into a cricket wireless to get a cell phone.

139
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,400
I was like, all right, I finally get one of these damn things.

140
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Okay, and I go in there and I'm looking around my cricket wireless.

141
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,100
Where's Pinocchio?

142
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,900
Yeah.

143
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,400
Yeah.

144
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,700
That's right.

145
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
Jiminy cricket.

146
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
Jimmy.

147
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,900
Where's the stars to be to wish upon?

148
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,800
You know, you're talking about a different cricket.

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Where are them donkeys?

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,900
I thought you're talking about the gun from Men in Black.

151
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,300
Oh, that's funny as hell.

152
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,100
Like, oh, where's Agent M?

153
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, ripped horn.

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Where's the team of Indian guys?

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
You know, it used to be that crickets were the only thing that chirped.

156
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Now we got these cell phones chirping everywhere I go.

157
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
That's right.

158
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,600
What happened to the crickets?

159
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
You know, like, yeah, I know all these cell phones.

160
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
They're crickets stillers.

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,700
I know.

162
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
I haven't seen one in about 10 years.

163
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,200
So that you can just can't hear whatever happened is cicadas.

164
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, you know, it's probably been five or six years since I saw it.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,900
We literally just had a brood come up this year.

166
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm sick of everybody could walk around with these sprint next

167
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
phones chirping each other saying where you at?

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
On their walkie-talkie phone.

169
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Yeah, and whatever happened to infectious diseases and viruses?

170
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Ever since I moved into my bubble, I haven't seen a single one.

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
True.

172
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I don't know.

173
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I feel like I haven't seen them in ages.

174
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Oh, it's so weird that you don't hear about anything like that because it doesn't exist.

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
It wasn't, it was a fake and it was a lie.

176
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
And that's the nurse telling you that so you can believe him.

177
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
That's right.

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Andrew, you're a total Cove idiot.

179
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:01,760
the

180
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:14,320
all

181
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:32,240
at

182
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,140
Maybe maybe the afternoon, the late, late lunch.

183
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay.

184
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,940
All right, even stronger.

185
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,340
Maybe we go the other way.

186
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,040
Midnight.

187
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,740
And he doesn't like anything.

188
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,040
What about all right, Patrick?

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,740
SpongeBob Ice Cream Bar.

190
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,040
Ooh, okay, but that's a good way to gumballs.

191
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,840
There's a cricket on it, though.

192
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,940
Okay, he doesn't like crickets.

193
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,240
All right.

194
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,340
What about gremlins?

195
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,840
What then?

196
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,340
Why would you go?

197
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
That's way scarier than midnight.

198
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,940
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,240
What about Oh, Patrick?

200
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,940
What about Cameron and Caleb?

201
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,640
He loves us.

202
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,040
He's looking at lips.

203
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,440
I don't think he's saying hello.

204
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,740
He doesn't realize he's on the call right now.

205
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,340
By the way, we got this is one of his educational tapes.

206
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,840
Patrick and Branson are the dumb guys of our podcast.

207
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,940
They're so fucking dumb.

208
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,140
They're both so stupid.

209
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,540
You guys probably have the you guys are probably you you guys

210
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
have coconuts.

211
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:42,220
the

212
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:55,900
and

213
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,900
used to said he used to ride down this big hill in his red wagon over and over.

214
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
I love my red wagon as a kid.

215
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,700
I went down the hill constantly.

216
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,200
And I like the taste of like copper for some reason.

217
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
So I would keep pennies.

218
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
You know what he likes now.

219
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
And I'd go shooting down that hill in the red wagon and be bumpy and they just

220
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
you just swallow.

221
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,900
I don't know what to say.

222
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,400
You just.

223
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,900
Right.

224
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,300
What kind of fucking family guy cutaway did you live in?

225
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,400
Or you're riding in a red wagon with coins in your mouth every day.

226
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
Oh, I actually swallowed it.

227
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,080
Oops.

228
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,600
I don't like it, but easy come easy go.

229
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,700
All those coins are still in his stomach.

230
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,640
If you shake them around.

231
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,200
Oh, look at that.

232
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,920
I think a piggy bank.

233
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,000
If you ever need a dollar on this beach again, I guess I got to eat

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
some of the sand to survive.

235
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,200
No, eating sand was different.

236
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,520
That was when I was smaller than that.

237
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,680
I was like 13 instead.

238
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,920
No, I was like, you know, sandbox age.

239
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,760
Well, coins were coins that I hung on to till I was like 24.

240
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,960
Two in one right now.

241
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,560
Look what what grade is like first open your mouth wide.

242
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:00,960
A first.

243
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,260
How old is first grade?

244
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,860
Yeah, what's the first grade?

245
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,160
The first age?

246
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,960
No, but like what year age is it?

247
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,060
Is that eight or two thousand four?

248
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,160
Hey Branson, what time?

249
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,760
Oh, that's what you're asking me.

250
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,260
How far back am I from the Eastern time zone right here in the mountain time

251
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:28,940
and

252
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,480
Yeah, that's minus one.

253
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,300
That's what Charles.

254
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,800
What time is it here in Mountain Standard Time?

255
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,340
Well, it's six o'clock where I'm at. I'm on the east.

256
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,240
So if you're two, it must be four.

257
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,680
Oh, my God, I can't believe you got it.

258
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,100
It only took three guesses.

259
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,880
That's a bingo.

260
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm being put on the spot.

261
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,600
It is it is nice to see somebody else.

262
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,080
All right, Patrick, saying it to prolong.

263
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,500
You're also when you guys are repeating the question.

264
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,680
I have more time to think.

265
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,780
OK, but I'm not the only one who does it.

266
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
I'm following it.

267
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,700
You're in the eastern time zone.

268
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,660
It's 6 p.m.

269
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,780
What time is it in central time zone right now?

270
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,260
It's 5.

271
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,060
Oh, very good.

272
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,140
What time is it in Pacific time zone?

273
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,300
In Pacific time, it's three hours behind, so it would be 3 o'clock right now.

274
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,140
Let's fucking go, dude.

275
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Oh my god.

276
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,140
100% go.

277
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,120
it would be is it would be you already said it was three hours

278
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,020
behind and then you still had to give yourself it would be

279
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:42,020
all the use in a sentence. I still got it. So it's the

280
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:50,420
dictionary defined six as three hours ahead of three camera

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,020
message rapid messaging Patrick and I'll talk the stuff.

282
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,800
He giving him the times.

283
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,540
Yeah, first behind a streak.

284
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,860
We can't have the dumb or dumb guy.

285
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,540
You know, that's embarrassing.

286
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,760
Well, maybe you want the dumber.

287
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,600
Dumb. Maybe we should.

288
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,360
Maybe we can have a competition here.

289
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,700
I used to be dumb.

290
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,160
All right.

291
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,040
Patrick Branson, Patrick and Branson.

292
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,700
What tastes better, pee or poop?

293
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,840
None.

294
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,100
That's not true.

295
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,240
One's got to taste better.

296
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,640
I bet you like the best.

297
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,060
Like equally, you love if the guy's diabetic, it's supposed to be sugary.

298
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,860
So I'm going with no pee or poop.

299
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,420
I'm gonna go with P.

300
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,260
I think Branson's right.

301
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,420
He wins. He's smarter than the fucker like speed.

302
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,540
Dude, we definitely have a number.

303
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,660
I only had two options.

304
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,260
He cheated.

305
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,300
He tried to trick question and it's how you how you separate the wheat

306
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,180
from the chaff and you, my friend, are chaff the weed from the weed.

307
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,940
The weeds from the chads.

308
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,300
All right, Caleb, tell me what chaff is.

309
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,100
Chaff is basically the shit that isn't wheat.

310
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,700
Everything in the world is chaff if it's not weed.

311
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,140
Yeah, most shit is chaff.

312
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,140
Pretty much. Oh, I need that sweet wheat.

313
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,540
Oh, yeah, I actually prefer to say that.

314
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,640
I prefer a lot of people who say they don't like chaff.

315
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,980
They've just never had good chaff.

316
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,340
You got to have in true.

317
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,180
It's true.

318
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,480
Nate, what's the where have you had good chaff?

319
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,840
What? Las Vegas. I'll go.

320
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,640
I mean, California, when it comes off the vine, all of chaffs.

321
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,040
Old stuff is pretty good, but I don't like any of their new stuff.

322
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,840
But I've been fucking with wheat since day one.

323
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,640
Yeah, we it's pretty good.

324
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,740
What is I actually you don't even like the week you just like the glue.

325
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,640
I think the wheat the wheat is the part of the wheat the chaff is the wheat

326
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,940
that's the part of the wheat that's not wheat they make bread out of the

327
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,340
wheat.

328
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,940
That's the force.

329
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,440
Can I make it through throw away the chaff?

330
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,140
Chaffy cereal.

331
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,040
It's the halfies.

332
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,440
Oh, yeah, so what about some chaff beer with an orange slice?

333
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,340
Oh that actually.

334
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,780
So it's like Mario Kart on the N64.

335
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,180
Chaff is like the Delta 8, right?

336
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,520
Yeah. OK, what's the Delta 8?

337
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,080
It's like Delta, you know, Delta 8 weed, how they have normal weed

338
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,620
and then they have the Delta 8 weed from gas stations.

339
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,960
They got new weed.

340
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,700
Here's a new weed that they can.

341
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,860
It's illegally not like the new K2.

342
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,400
It's legally nothing.

343
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,640
It's just like it might as well be just nothing.

344
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,760
Yummier. Yeah.

345
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,440
They haven't come up with a law for it.

346
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,600
It's a product that's a tax on dumb guys.

347
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Pretty much.

348
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,600
You and Patrick would probably enjoy it.

349
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,100
I would.

350
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,140
I hate Delta 8.

351
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,180
And I hate weed.

352
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,060
Yeah, I know.

353
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,580
Dude, this Delta 8 virus that's going around is really fucking--

354
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,660
It's terrifying.

355
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,380
Yeah.

356
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,300
A new wrinkle in the wheat versus chaff debate.

357
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,300
It says here on the Wikipedia page, chaff should not

358
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,180
be confused with bran, which is finer, scaly material as far as the grain itself.

359
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,580
So there's wheat, and there's chaff, and there's also bran.

360
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,420
And that's Branson's dad.

361
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:44,980
Is that true?

362
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,580
Chaff or bran?

363
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,380
Yeah, Jeff Branson is his.

364
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,380
We know we're going to call him when he's old as fuck.

365
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,340
Raisin Bran.

366
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,620
Yeah, he's brand.

367
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,520
OK, there's also when I have a child and I just thought of that

368
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,640
because I had some for breakfast this morning and I was like,

369
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,440
Oh, I got it.

370
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,140
I got a joke later for for the air.

371
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,820
I guess they were doing raisin bread.

372
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,240
Good cereal for breakfast.

373
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,740
It's a great cereal for breakfast.

374
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,720
I eat raisin. I eat raisin bran this morning.

375
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,320
I'm a yogurt guy.

376
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,580
I'm a yogurt geniuses of the podcast.

377
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
I don't eat breakfast because that's insane.

378
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm a steak and eggs meals in a day.

379
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,000
every day. Yeah, every day.

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,320
Breakfast. Prime prime ribeye.

381
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,080
And can we redo this?

382
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
You know what I have for breakfast every day?

383
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,840
Oh, here we go.

384
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,360
Now, you know, you probably have a glass of soy milk.

385
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,200
No one, you know.

386
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh, well, you got the Michael Douglas.

387
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,680
Oh, hell no.

388
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
And we have soy flakes in a soy bowl with soy milk.

389
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,680
Hey, and you and you are what you eat and drink.

390
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,480
Yeah. And so you're basically a soy milk.

391
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,360
Soy. I'm a soy boy.

392
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

393
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,480
You're a soy boy. I'm a bitch.

394
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,320
And I'm a toy boy and I'll be playing with them G.I.

395
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,720
Joes in the Bionicles.

396
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,360
Oh, I'm Bionicles.

397
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
When Andrew gets on his Obama Bionicle, he tries to text Caleb.

398
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,800
It doesn't let him.

399
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,480
That's right.

400
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,280
Then hit speed dial. Yeah.

401
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,680
Hello, this is Planned Parenthood.

402
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,720
Would you like to kill your child?

403
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes.

404
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,600
Caleb, would you like for us to expand your pussy to fit more penises

405
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
that you're not married to?

406
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,400
Yeah.

407
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,120
Caleb and I are out and I'm like, we're talking to this girl and I and Caleb

408
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,640
comes up, he's like, you know that, you know, he's, you know, he's soy

409
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,200
for breakfast. I don't even have breakfast.

410
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
I just play with guys.

411
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
You ever hear of guys?

412
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,640
I'd be playing with my guys on top of the toy chest,

413
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,200
pretending it's Africa, and I'm having a good old time.

414
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,640
He's busy eating soy milk.

415
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,040
You're making them attack each other, going like, "Raaah!"

416
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,600
"Yaaah!"

417
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,560
It's pretty crazy.

418
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,840
Pull it out in the club.

419
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,640
This is my first time.

420
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
I got a truck.

421
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,280
I got a big yellow truck.

422
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah.

423
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,600
Hey, girl, are you mission control?

424
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,080
Sorry, I was playing pretend as an astronaut just then.

425
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,680
I do it pretty much all the time.

426
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,800
Yeah, and pretty much every girl that I talk to

427
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,500
when I'm playing pretend comes home with me.

428
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,600
So yeah, just I mean, I've been used.

429
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,900
I'll be rolling up to the club in my in my my fucking HES sports car.

430
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,700
Damn, everybody's looking at me.

431
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,400
Green and white, green and white, green and white, green and white.

432
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,900
I'm rolling up to the club with a big laser tag

433
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,200
target around my chest.

434
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,700
That's right.

435
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,400
The boy's got the the club on fire while everyone's watched us play duck duck goose.

436
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,300
Yeah, that's right.

437
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,900
I stay strapped up with the laser tag.

438
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,500
you never know who's gonna wants to take me out dude. Yeah. Yes sir. I'm 24 years deep in the

439
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,580
game and I haven't lost yet. We went laser tagging recently and they gave us... Yeah we played laser

440
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,700
tag. What were the names? They called one of us like the the eliminator or something and then

441
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,740
someone else was just called like the wizard. Like they gave us... Yeah there's like I remember

442
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,740
this one kid that got the name Twinkie and I was like oh f*cks. I'd love to be I'd love to have the

443
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,860
the name twinkie. I think mine was wizard. Yo yeah why do they even put like twinkie in

444
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,300
there? Oh fuck my name is creampie. It's like the devastator and stuff. Look at the screen

445
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:54,940
my name is lesbo. Why do I always get gay boy? I don't understand. Why do they have

446
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:01,660
a gay boy vest? Everybody else's is just their names. What's your name? Okay. I remember

447
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,380
these one kids we didn't know and there's like this little fat kid with like like shaved

448
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:27,380
and

449
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,700
just don't know what to do. They're watching fucking Inuyasha going, "Am I tripping right

450
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,500
now?" I saw Tim and Eric when I was nine and that shit was weird as hell. That's why you

451
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,860
become so funny and weird. I don't know what those guys were smoking. That's why my brain

452
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:52,540
be weird. I watched the Oblongs and I decided to look like them. It was a really smart decision

453
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,720
by me. Apparently the government was using squid billies to turn people into serial killers

454
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:16,040
to

455
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,880
- I was saying this earlier,

456
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,600
I think I could be a doctor really easily.

457
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,120
I don't think it's that hard.

458
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,960
I think if you think of the dumbest doctor,

459
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm definitely gonna be smarter than that guy, right?

460
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,360
So you can do it.

461
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
- Me and Branson could be doctors.

462
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,680
- You guys should be doctors.

463
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,800
- I would have loved to have a doctor duo.

464
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,240
- I would be a good specialist.

465
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,080
- Yeah.

466
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,440
- Yeah, you're special, all right.

467
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,840
- I think I'd be a good surgeon.

468
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,000
- You know, I don't have a doctor,

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,640
so I wouldn't mind one of you guys being my doctor.

470
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
I'll be your GP.

471
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,880
Oh, well, I didn't know you were in the running here.

472
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,320
Now, you guys are going to have to prove who's the best.

473
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
I mean, who among the three of you is the best doctor?

474
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
You're very sick.

475
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
You're about to die.

476
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
All right.

477
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
How many colors of blood are there?

478
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
You need my treatment.

479
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
There's two colors of blood.

480
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,240
When it's on the inside, it's blue, but then when it touches oxygen, it's red.

481
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Okay.

482
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,080
Well, that's not a good diagnosis of what I have, though.

483
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,480
What color is your blood, Charles?

484
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,120
It looks like it's blue right now.

485
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,320
Should I cut it open and see?

486
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Yeah.

487
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
It might turn red.

488
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:35,120
might

489
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:50,780
a

490
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,260
invasive procedure where we open up your stomach and look what's in there to see

491
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,380
if you ate anything that could have caused the cut. Oh like how they do to

492
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:04,020
sharks after they catch them? Exactly. We have to cut your chest open. We need to see if there's like a fender of a car in there or maybe a Boy Scout or a

493
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,860
giant tire because that could be very important. Okay I was about to go with

494
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,620
Patrick as my doctor but I think I'm gonna switch to Cameron. I got too many

495
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,900
patients already I don't give a shit. Charles you're going into cardiac arrest

496
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,380
right now and we need to cut you open and kiss your heart.

497
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Okay let's do it.

498
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,820
I don't give a shit about any of my patients.

499
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
What?

500
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm already a doctor and I don't care about them.

501
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,340
Oh I'm glad I picked a better doctor who cares about his patients.

502
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,860
Well I'm pretty much addicted to drugs.

503
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
Basically I say.

504
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,660
And have been compared to Sherlock Holmes often.

505
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,740
Every time that a patient comes in I prescribe them a middle finger and I say get the fuck

506
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
out.

507
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,260
Why would the fuck would you do that man?

508
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
Not my problem.

509
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,460
I don't think he takes being a doctor very seriously.

510
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,020
we just became doctors he's already burnt out

511
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,620
yeah basically i only use this shit to uh to get pills

512
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,300
what should i do all my friends in here in this call right now have uh poop disease

513
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
what?

514
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,900
what are you talking what is poop disease and am i okay?

515
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,060
no you have it you have poop disease i know you know

516
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,700
what is it what is the symptoms of poop disease?

517
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,460
uh basically there's a lot of shit okay

518
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,620
smells really bad

519
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,180
sounds really immature

520
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
and you all and you all

521
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,300
i think poop disease should grow up

522
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,300
you all start eating it because the disease mess.

523
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,800
No way.

524
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,700
No way Jose.

525
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm not believing this Patrick likes eating it just as much as

526
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,300
he likes drinking pee though.

527
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,500
Not true.

528
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,200
That was Branson that likes drinking ice.

529
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,100
I didn't say I like it.

530
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,400
But you said he likes drinking pee.

531
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,100
You said you preferred neither Patrick.

532
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,800
It means you both you like both equally.

533
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,400
No, that's true.

534
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,900
That's true.

535
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,500
That's what you guys do.

536
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,300
That's not what it meant.

537
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,000
That's exactly what it meant.

538
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
What is your favorite?

539
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
I don't think me and Patrick are dumb at all.

540
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,600
Wait, I have a question again regarding that for Patrick and Branson.

541
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
What?

542
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,520
Do you guys not not like eating pee and poop?

543
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,400
I don't not not like eating poop.

544
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,360
Man, I'm glad Patrick started talking first.

545
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,440
Well, that's a triple negative, so I think it cancels out.

546
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
And how many is a triple?

547
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,280
Can you repeat the question?

548
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,160
I don't not don't not like.

549
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:21,240
like all right I don't I don't know if he's doing good or bad.

550
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:29,280
soaking his office chair with sweat right now. I don't not not don't not not like not.

551
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,840
I can hear the grinding. I just want to hear the question again. Do you not not

552
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,040
like eating pee and poop? Do I not? Also Pat didn't say yes or no. It's a yes or no

553
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,840
no question. I will say don't not not not statement. Don't you

554
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,920
need to understand yes or no. Alright. So if he said do you

555
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,960
like eating poop or pee? I'd say no if she said do you not like

556
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,280
eating poop or pee? I'd say yes and then if he said both, then I

557
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,280
guess I say no again. so my answer Andrew is uh is uh is

558
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,320
the gentleman's no. I think uh Branson had his fingers crossed

559
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,440
though when he said no Branson again doing rephrasing the

560
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:16,680
question to arrive at the word no. I'm holding my question three times to say no. I'm not

561
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,920
looking anything up. I was holding my boys. I think we get right out. Get out of podcast

562
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,520
and we tour the world showing everyone these two guys. That's right. Okay. I just before

563
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:34,840
we go before you go forward with that, I just want to say I don't don't not not don't not

564
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,940
don't like not don't eating poop.

565
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,040
I've never.

566
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Don't eating poop.

567
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,840
That's what you like.

568
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,040
Don't eating poop.

569
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,540
I like do not eating poop.

570
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,340
What the hell are you?

571
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,240
Do you sound like a fucking no song?

572
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,040
You're a weirdo.

573
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,640
Shut up.

574
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,840
You're a wacko.

575
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,740
You stupid as hell.

576
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,440
So because this is a Christmas episode, which clearly a bunch

577
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,740
of Christmas stuff this month.

578
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,540
I want I don't know what's up with that.

579
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,140
It's Christmas.

580
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Maybe it's because it's the season.

581
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Because it's Christmas.

582
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I thought today the list we could cover is the timeless nice vs. naughty list of Christmas fame.

583
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Santa's beautiful list. I think we could discuss.

584
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Wait, wait, Tim. How did you get the naughty nice list?

585
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,240
I downloaded it from santa.com. I have the secret password, which is "presents".

586
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
I shouldn't have said that. I'm going to bleep that out.

587
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
You idiot!

588
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,240
I hope I don't forget to bleep out the secret password to santa.com.

589
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,100
If he bleeps it out, it was presence.

590
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
I might bleep that out too.

591
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
I might forget.

592
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,240
I might go to sleep the second we press stop recording and forget.

593
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,540
I'm sure all these people can just go find a torrent of the list anyway.

594
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
That's true.

595
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
It's true.

596
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
So, okay.

597
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,540
So, what kind of, I mean, are we just winging it or do you have names that you're going

598
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
to tell us?

599
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
Name names.

600
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,060
Oh, I just sent you guys all the lists.

601
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,420
So luckily it's not just on me to read it.

602
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,420
Okay.

603
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
I'm seeing it.

604
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,620
just received a copy of Santa's list dot txt. I sent it to to

605
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,860
to Branson at poop eater dot co dot uk. So that's you should

606
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,420
get that in your email and Patrick at stupidest on the

607
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:22,540
podcast of all t. I am. Yep. And then what's that? Can you spell

608
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,700
that? Oh and I just got mine into awesome. Caleb has SCX dot

609
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,060
and I also just sent the list to the two remaining guys are

610
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,100
married to each other at gmail.com.

611
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,940
Which one was I Andrew?

612
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,340
Are you looking at the picture of beers that Patrick sent earlier?

613
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,540
Yeah. Check that out.

614
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,940
Guinness Peroni, Hebden sweet tiger,

615
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,980
sending beers, receiving beers. Sounds like naughty behavior to me.

616
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,540
Let's see where you two are.

617
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,260
Oh, Oh,

618
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,180
I didn't even know there was a very naughty section of the list.

619
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,500
And I think I should change it to like the bad list

620
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,980
'cause naughty, you know, a lot of people use that

621
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,140
to have a sexual meaning. - Naughty is sexual as hell.

622
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,380
- Yeah, well, it's kind of open-ended, I feel like.

623
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,580
I think that's what makes the list so,

624
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,100
so it gives it staying power.

625
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,540
You can argue about it forever.

626
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,820
- You hear a lot in videos of just British women.

627
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,460
I don't know, I'm not gonna say what they're doing,

628
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,940
but they say norty a lot.

629
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,520
- Norty.

630
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,900
What kind of videos of British women are you watching, Andrew?

631
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,740
- They're kind of just hanging out.

632
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,580
- Austin Powers.

633
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:47,300
is

634
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Austin Powers.

635
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,340
Oh, oh,

636
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,060
OK, I got

637
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,540
I was happy to hear that.

638
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,020
I got attacked.

639
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,860
I got attacked by a slime.

640
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,900
Did you have a marble in your mouth?

641
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,700
He's got a lot of cool.

642
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,900
Oh my God. You still do it.

643
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,020
I did.

644
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,340
That was a Kennedy.

645
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,060
That was a Kennedy half dollar.

646
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,340
That's expensive.

647
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,580
Those are that's like an annual release coin.

648
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,180
That's going to take you a while to get out of there.

649
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,300
That's as big as a coaster.

650
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,420
Oh, great. Now he's eating a USB stick.

651
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,520
Yeah, cool.

652
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,020
I'm addicted to eating metal.

653
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,820
You always have those.

654
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,420
Pica.

655
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,620
Yeah, Pica.

656
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,820
Whenever they talk about like Pica, it's always like people

657
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,620
just eating like styrofoam or like packing peanuts or yeah,

658
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,120
it's it's funny.

659
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,320
Yeah, you like I like an Xbox controller like every day.

660
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,720
It's

661
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,720
went to the bodega earlier to get a bunch of coins to eat.

662
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,820
I did.

663
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,120
I went.

664
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,520
Can you break a 20?

665
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,320
As possible.

666
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,520
They need to make a toilet paper you can eat just for people with Pica.

667
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
-True. -Kids' toothpastes, yeah.

668
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,220
Speaking of Pica, this is actually crazy.

669
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,720
The first entry on the naughty list is people with Pica.

670
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
-Whoa! -Whoa!

671
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,220
-Everybody with Pica is actually... -Very naughty!

672
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,220
Very naughty, disrespectful to small objects.

673
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,720
Hey, people with Pica, what the hell are you thinking?

674
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Yeah, you gotta lay off.

675
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,220
-Yeah. -How about you?

676
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
-How about you, Pica? -No presents.

677
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
-You're getting your own size. -That's right.

678
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,260
If we're talking about naughty people I think Dennis the menace would be on the naughty

679
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,900
Yep, he's here. Wait, Branson. I thought you got that one more shot the one year

680
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,420
He was on the nice list and ever since then he's been blacklisted. Yeah, here's a shit a word Jack the Ripper. Oh

681
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:36,980
Yeah, naughty naughty. Not a good ass. Do you know it says the whole the whole the Ripper family is pretty

682
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,260
It's funny cuz I'm on the nice list here. It says Jack the hugger

683
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:50,260
or

684
00:30:50,260 --> 00:31:07,780
it's

685
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:14,740
in the movie theater. I'm ripping farts. Oh yeah? Come on dog. What are you watching?

686
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:27,220
Uh Bigg's Mama's House. Bigg's Mama House. It's me and Patrick seeing movies together. We both

687
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,780
have full-size popcorns and full-size sodas. We're sitting next to each other and we're just ripping

688
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
farts while we're watching Big Momma's House 2.

689
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,780
And we're laughing so hard they stopped the movie.

690
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:46,140
We're laughing so hard that like the laugh makes a fart come out that's just like, it's

691
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,900
like man you gotta go to the bathroom and check that thing.

692
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,820
You know but the movie's so good.

693
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,340
Well you guys like to go to Tyler Perry movies.

694
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:01,540

695
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,660

696
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:15,060
guys, white guys with beards always be farting at the screen during the movie. We got a bunch

697
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:24,860
of dogs in there with us. They're my seeing eye dogs. They're barking what's in the movie

698
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,680
to me. It's really dark in here so I need six dogs to see. I learned them to watch movies

699
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,240
like Coco the Gorilla.

700
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
They're farting too.

701
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,000
It smells like dog food.

702
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,880
Coco the Gorilla just trying to explain the movie to me and Patrick but he keeps just signing

703
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,040
smells bad, smells good, smells poopy, smells one berry, one banana.

704
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,600
And that's why you guys are laughing so hard.

705
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,600
You think it's the funniest movie of all time?

706
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,280
The characters on the screen can smell our farts.

707
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,000
Coco the Gorilla just keeps fucking telling us.

708
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,360
Branson and Patrick are so stupid.

709
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,560
Coco the gorilla is their social worker.

710
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,280
It's true.

711
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Cocoa, Cocoa, the gorilla comes over once a week to check my fridge

712
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,680
and make sure it's not just candy.

713
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,920
Yeah, Cocoa, the gorilla has to look through my internet history

714
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,960
to make sure I didn't accidentally get fished.

715
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,320
Yeah, one plus two, one plus three, Google search one plus four.

716
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,560
He was trying to count to 10.

717
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,700
And then he skips to one plus infinity once he kind of sees where it's headed.

718
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,140
Coco the gorilla signing, signing to me.

719
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,840
You Google the word Google a lot.

720
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,140
You Google the word being a lot.

721
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,560
Coco the gorilla just signed.

722
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,360
You don't have to Google Gmail.

723
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,100
It's in the top right corner.

724
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:55,900
You know who else I'm seeing on the naughty list here is a bad guys.

725
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Oh, well, that's a no brainer.

726
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,720
Controversial, I think maybe a little bit.

727
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,240
There's I feel like there must be at least one bad guy

728
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,640
who's on the nice list.

729
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,340
Did antiheroes make the good or the naughty list?

730
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,040
Let's see.

731
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,620
Well, we have we have Darth Vader on the nice list.

732
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,580
That's interesting.

733
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,520
Well, I wouldn't call him an antihero.

734
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,780
He makes a change at the end.

735
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,320
How about this?

736
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,340
Jack Sparrow.

737
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,380
Pretty kind and funny, but boy, he sure is.

738
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,240
Yeah, let's where he's a scoundrel.

739
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,380
Honestly, I'm going to say something now that's kind of.

740
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,380
I guess, you know, not

741
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,240
contrary, I don't know if it's controversial where I told you before.

742
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,780
Oh, all right. Well, I'm going to say something different then.

743
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,920
I'd love to share a bottle of rum with him.

744
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,840
Oh, yeah, he'd he'd Bogart the whole thing.

745
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,880
He would. Why is the room going to do that?

746
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,340
They call it they call it depping it when you do it with.

747
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,680
Yeah, well, wait, did you guys have him at Jack's?

748
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,220
Was Jack's fair just in the call?

749
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,520
Where was it? What was that?

750
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,320
I just sound like exactly like Captain Jack go.

751
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,520
I want to see him.

752
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Oh, my God, I was missing.

753
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
I was drinking this pint of rum and it's gone.

754
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
As Captain Jack Sparrow.

755
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,320
Whoa, it's a Christmas miracle.

756
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,720
Amber Heard is a liar.

757
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,620
Oh, whoa, whoa.

758
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,920
Captain, I've always wanted to ask you this.

759
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,120
Did you sign off on that song that the Lonely Island did about you?

760
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,620
Was that was that cool with you?

761
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,120
or do you like?

762
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,620
Yeah, what?

763
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,380
Be like them now.

764
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,860
Fucking whatever.

765
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,520

And I guess he wants his credit - yeah, I'm sure somebody gets him a president

821
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,240

This year the nice list this year, you know who's on the naughty list is Oliver twist. Maybe you should stop stealing kid

825
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,040
That's right. That's right. I'm asking for more all the time. You're so greedy orphans wanting more gruel

Mm-hmm. I'm also seeing here. The nice list is is Oliver twists or Oliver twists assassin is on here

831
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,760
Oh, oh man is planning to assassinate Oliver twist and it's going well. He was presents

832
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,360
He was like the third boss in the last Assassin's Creed

833
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,240
You just walk up you walk into the back of his little head and he dies.

834
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
He was a templar.

835
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,240
He hit him with a stick and he goes flying.

836
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
He splats against the wall.

837
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
The game totally glitches out.

838
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,240
He falls into a pot of gruel and it's like poetic.

839
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,240
There's your more gruel.

840
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,240
And he does the Terminator thumb.

841
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,240
They call him Oliver Twist because somebody needs to straighten his ass out.

842
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Yeah, they figured out that he was going to be the next Hitler, even though Hitler didn't exist yet.

843
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,280
to be the first Hitler.

844
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,080
So someone had to kill him before he became Hitler.

845
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,160
Hitler was going to be the next Oliver Twist.

846
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
Yeah, exactly.

847
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,400

He's been putting in the work. Yeah.

862
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,640
I'm not really sure who that is, but I just read it.

863
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,560
He has a funny name.

864
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,440
I think he's responsible for some stuff that was pretty good,

865
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,560
but I'm not an expert, but I am willing to say that without taking any repercussions.

866
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,680
I don't want to speak on the issue until I've done more reading, but I'm strongly in favor

867
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,080
of a lot of stuff that he did. I don't know the details, so I'm not calling.

868
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,120
Bob Marley, that's a no-brainer, drug addict.

869
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,320
Yep. Naughty.

870
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,120
Total junkie. Very naughty, Bobby.

871
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,600
Naughty list. Rodney Dangerfield's wife.

872
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,200
All right, boys, watch this, watch this. How about you respect your husband for once

873
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,040
in your fucking life? You fucking ingrate. What are you doing? This man's famous.

874
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,440
He had dealt Rodney Dangerfield dealt with so much trauma.

875
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,840
Yeah, when you know, the doctor asked him for a stool sample,

876
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,740
a urine sample in a blood sample and he was so stupid.

877
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,340
He brought in his whole underwear and just gave it to the guy.

878
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,740
That's disgusting.

879
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,540
Disgusting Rodney Dangerfield on the naughty list to mean is why

880
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,640
should I clearly had a mental disability?

881
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,340
Yeah, all of America just laughed at him.

882
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,240
Yeah.

883
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,100
When he handed his underwear to his doctor, his doctor was Patrick,

884
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,500
and Patrick said, I like to eat all these things that are on.

885
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,180
No, I was not his doctor.

886
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,420
I said, sorry, I've already eaten.

887
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,820
I just had lunch.

888
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,980
Thank you, though.

889
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,820
It was it was a poop burger.

890
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,660
He was a pooper with a bun, but I'm CA only.

891
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,620
And then he said, I'm I'm so dumb.

892
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,220
I thought it was a regular burger.

893
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,460
Yeah, that's what he said.

894
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,460
I think I said that.

895
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,700
Did you really?

896
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,940
I heard it was an evening burger.

897
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,540
So you got scared?

898
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,740
Yeah.

899
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,820
And you ate it out of fear?

900
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,060
Oh, my God, I saw that shit burger and I got so scared.

901
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,540
I ate it out of pure fear.

902
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,940
I thought it was going to come at me.

903
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,940
I had to get rid of it immediately.

904
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,580
I couldn't stand looking at it.

905
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,780
So I throw it in the trash.

906
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,700
It's still in there.

907
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,220
You know, it's waiting.

908
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,340
Could jump out of the trash.

909
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,620
It's basically the trash is what pirates used to use as a fridge.

910
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,240
Yeah, I mean, I don't have the facts to doubt that.

911
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,240
I think that's true.

912
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,280
The naughty list here,

913
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,620
it says Anton Yelchin.

914
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,780
I mean, whoa, why?

915
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,980
It seems a little why?

916
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,180
Why put that?

917
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,820
It's kind of that's really a sin.

918
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,320
I mean, he's not alive anymore.

919
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,660
There's no it's crazy.

920
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,560
Has a photo of his dead body and his his jeep's license plates

921
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,600
imprinted on his forehead like the Punisher's.

922
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,400
Well, what a Santa.

923
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,200
This is the Punisher at a ring.

924
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,100
Yeah, I remember the classroom that he always wore.

925
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,600
Yeah, oh, kind of rude.

926
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,700
He's like, I used to play football.

927
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,080
Yeah. And then on the other hand, he had a ring.

928
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,040
He actually had

929
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,340
to get angry.

930
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,940
And also he had a lot of different.

931
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,640
He had the one ring on it to his photo.

932
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,600
The Punisher's photo of the rings, actually.

933
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,040
Come on. Punishers muttering.

934
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,400
What color you think that was?

935
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,500
black jet black and red.

936
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,900
Yeah, with a skull in it too.

937
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,100
Yeah, yeah, it's moving a bullet.

938
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,400
Bright bullets came out of it.

939
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,200
Probably the color of it's probably a gun.

940
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,600
It's probably a black gun.

941
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,100
Yeah, bullets.

942
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,200
It probably killed a guy with it by making a meat it.

943
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,200
Yeah, probably.

944
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,400
Yeah, it was covered in bacteria or something.

945
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm not sure though.

946
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,600
It says here he is on the nice list because he was avenging

947
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
his family when he killed all that makes any ways.

948
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,500
So that's another antihero.

949
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,400
It's why he says nice.

950
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,660
He says I punish the bad people.

951
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,740
The class of 1984 will be avenged.

952
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,300
I'm basically like all cops.

953
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,180
That's why they like me.

954
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,100
He was actually a sick guy though.

955
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,340
It was really, I actually saw, it was a very embarrassing moment for him.

956
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,660
He was trying to kill me and I pointed at his mood ring and said he was silly.

957
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,940
And he turned red and he walked out the door.

958
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,620
Well I wasn't trying to kill you, did you kill one of his family?

959
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,780
Well, I mean, if you look on the audio, you are going to see I'm on here for

960
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,080
stealing candy.

961
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,380
Yeah, he pointed a gun at me on at the at the women's March.

962
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,380
Really?

963
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,860
Yeah, he was there making sure he was there.

964
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,700
He was thinking, you know, there's gonna be riots.

965
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,260
These people, they don't know what they want.

966
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,260
Really?

967
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,680
I'm gonna make sure and he put the gun in his in my mouth and it says I'm about avocado

968
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,820
toast and they just let me keep walking down the street.

969
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,380
I'm like, this guy's crazy.

970
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,100
Well, you freaked him out because he just started sucking on his gun.

971
00:45:54,100 --> 00:46:04,980
the

972
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:19,740
this

973
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:33,660
that

974
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:49,340
a

975
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,340
jump big.

976
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,940
Well, yeah, I remember that a dirt bike.

977
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,940
They were jumping them.

978
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,940
Oh, that's sick.

979
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,940
He was already dead.

980
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,940
It was pretty sick.

981
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,540
I was so fucked up on soju.

982
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,060
I don't remember a single second and at the end of a limp biscuits set when they were

983
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,940
doing nookie and those cops showed up and arrested Fred Durst for rocking too hard.

984
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:12,780
Yeah, well, there was one group of cops that came in and arrested him for rocking too hard

985
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,260
and then it's completely separate group came in and arrested him for rapping too hard.

986
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,260
It was crazy.

987
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:21,340
He went free because it was double jeopardy.

988
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,700
You can't get caught up on two cops trying to arrest you at

989
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,100
the same time you get to go free.

990
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,820
That's one part of it.

991
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,060
Do you remember the crazy commercials before the movement

992
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,980
searches like Saturday, Saturday, Saturday in Washington

993
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,900
D.C. Like I didn't even want to go to it, but honestly, I

994
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,700
just got hooked by the commercials going on.

995
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,980
I felt like it was huge.

996
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,820
If you don't come down, you're a bitch.

997
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:51,460
And like Grave Digger was supposed to be there you guys remember that it was oh, I mean it got shut down so early

998
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,940
So I like I mean, oh, yeah

999
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:01,200
Almost riots, but they had after parties that they had we're fucking sick. Yeah, I mean, yeah

1000
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,780
I'm a juice world there before you know before I be

1001
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,540
He died

1002
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:13,200
Yeah, but you guys realize the reason Grave Digger didn't perform is because they had a woman driving the damn car

1003
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,000
I gave juice for all the bag of a bag of poison.

1004
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I thought the car was a woman.

1005
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That's what it was.

1006
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,800
Yeah, I gave him a bag of poison before.

1007
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,840
Damn, I gave him a bag of poison.

1008
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,280
I said, don't take this.

1009
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,280
This will kill you.

1010
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,600
And he was like, I know what you mean.

1011
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,280
And then I never saw him alive again.

1012
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,520
But I saw him dead 400 more times.

1013
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,080
Took him a long time to bury.

1014
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,080
Yeah, it's like a weekend at Bernie's situation where you just hanging out for did you just

1015
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,080
blink really fast? Yeah.

1016
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,980
Well, they kept trying to bury him, but then they just would

1017
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,280
hit something hit another person's coffin.

1018
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:52,880
They go.

1019
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,380
Fuck.

1020
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,780
We got to retry now.

1021
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,580
They were trying to give it.

1022
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,380
Yeah, they're trying to give him a burial on the plane.

1023
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,180
That was the problem.

1024
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,080
Yeah.

1025
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,480
Yeah, they're trying to bury him in a trampoline graveyard

1026
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,280
where they buried all these.

1027
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,480
Like an elephant grave.

1028
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,300
of two-year-old trampolines that don't fit in the new backyard when you do.

1029
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,060
They're lower in the property value. Yeah, the thing's missing about 30 springs.

1030
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,740
It's no good. Lost its bounce.

1031
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,660
Gonna take 10% off. Gonna take more to repair it than the

1032
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:30,020
thing's even worth in the first place. That's where the gunfight scene takes

1033
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,740
place in Con Air, isn't it? That field full of abandoned trampolines.

1034
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,020
They're jumping, doing flips at each other. It was pretty sick, honestly.

1035
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:45,140
I really like Malcolm Gladwell's essay about that called The Death of Fun.

1036
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,420
Oh yeah.

1037
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,140
True.

1038
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,100
It hits hard.

1039
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,220
Speaking of nice lists.

1040
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,340
Malcolm Gladwell's naughty list.

1041
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,060
What?

1042
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,460
Yeah.

1043
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,180
What'd he do?

1044
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:52,660
Of course.

1045
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,340
Looked like a weird freak.

1046
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,100
He does look like a Muppet.

1047
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,900
Yeah, but also the Dalai Lama made the naughty list too.

1048
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,140
Yeah, well that's true.

1049
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,940
He looks like he's been hooked up to an IV for like two years.

1050
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,740
Malcolm Gladwell looks like an auntie.

1051
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,180
Yeah.

1052
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,680
Yeah, the Dalai Lama is on the naughty list.

1053
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,180
Because I mean, you go to fucking you.

1054
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,120
I saw I saw a picture of him at Berghain, which you're not supposed to have

1055
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,780
pictures of the Dalai Lama with his stupid rules.

1056
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,020
He's some guy. He's some giggly weirdo that laughs all the time.

1057
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,980
Yeah, relax. Great.

1058
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,220
Hanging out with Bill Clinton.

1059
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,580
It's important to laugh. Shut up.

1060
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,020
Yeah, you know, he laughs because he knows all their secrets about fucking.

1061
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,540
I fucking hate the Dalai Lama.

1062
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,580
What a well, you know, he was that astro world.

1063
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,120
Oh, was he?

1064
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,760
Yeah, why do you think it went so wrong?

1065
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,960
I know he told all those kids to rush the stage.

1066
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,160
He's doing Titanic prayers for them, too.

1067
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,260
He said he stood up and he said, Hey, life's too short.

1068
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,560
Yeah, I fuck it.

1069
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,620
It says I mean, it's here also speaking to us.

1070
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,960
Does Travis Scott nice list?

1071
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,620
Not his fault. He had nothing to do with it.

1072
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,780
It was the crowd's fault.

1073
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,260
Oh, yeah, the crowd is on.

1074
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,220
No, never claims the crowd.

1075
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:07,020
And like there's some bad crowds or some crowds, you know, that that, you know,

1076
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:25,740
the

1077
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,260
*laughter*

1078
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,260
Yeah, I don't get it.

1079
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,260
We are all on the naughty list.

1080
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:32,760
Yeah.

1081
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,260
Except me.

1082
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,260
Who's like the Hitlerialge podcast?

1083
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,760
*laughter*

1084
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,260
Actually, we're a good podcast. We don't have one.

1085
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,760
I'll just say Paul-mub.

1086
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,260
Yeah, yeah, that's true actually.

1087
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,760
Yeah.

1088
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,760
Safe bet.

1089
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,760
Yeah.

1090
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,760
You know, I see Satan here is on the nice list though, actually.

1091
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,260
I don't think he was responsible for everything.

1092
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,760
Well, you realize he used to be an angel.

1093
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,260
Yeah, that's true.

1094
00:51:53,260 --> 00:52:08,240
to

1095
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,360
a fallen angel. Yeah, and nobody prayed when he needed it the most. And people don't share

1096
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:20,400
photos when it says like, "Like for Jesus, ignore for Satan." Yeah. People don't share enough of

1097
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,960
those. He had like one wing, right? And like that big sword. Yeah. I think, yeah, that's him. And

1098
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:33,760
like white hair. Yeah, yeah. And he was the main villain in Final Fantasy VII. Yeah. What are you

1099
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:42,000
talking about? Huh? Chilling you. Not much. I'm just hanging out. Me too. Are we recording?

1100
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,120
Not yet. Not yet. I think we're gonna start soon. Yeah. Alright. Alright, welcome to the

1101
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:56,160
second annual Riffsmith. Wait, it's a Robin Williams Riffsmith. Oh, right. I forgot about

1102
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,240
that. Oh, oh. Let's see. Robin Williams, naughty list. He stole his talent from the world.

1103
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,940

00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,180

1106
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,380
selfishly went to live in heaven

1107
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:15,240
how long i'm robin williams and stuck in a room with five gay men all

1108
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,480
uh... no i have not one of them i'm not one of them all you have to do to be

1109
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,220
good improv is just abuse cocaine for thirty straight years

1110
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,920
yeah like a and big surprise it caught up with them

1111
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,760
I don't think it did.

1112
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,920
Hey, right?

1113
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,280
Yeah, I think it was the movies.

1114
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,200
He started his bicentennial man.

1115
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,160
He started doing all those depressing movies.

1116
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,360
No more Mork and Mindy or whatever.

1117
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,200
No more Flubber.

1118
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,360
Maybe if you did Flubber too.

1119
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,000
He did Hooseline like once every four years.

1120
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,560
That's not enough to keep you alive.

1121
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,360
That's true.

1122
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,160
If you have the access to be on Hooseline

1123
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,880
and you're not using it every year, you're fucked up.

1124
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,160
You are fucking up.

1125
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,000
Like Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles

1126
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,500
are going to live to be 200 years old.

1127
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,100
Yeah,

1128
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,300
Robin Williams.

1129
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,500
He actually killed himself the day when he was recording the

1130
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,600
voice lines for Aladdin.

1131
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,700
He got to the scene where Jafar turns into the giant evil

1132
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,000
genie went home and he killed himself right after that.

1133
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,200
John, he did.

1134
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,000
They had to get a voice.

1135
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,600
I said you said you said the J word, you know, you don't like

1136
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,200
the J word pet which one Jafar or giant or gene.

1137
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,800
Oh, it's all of them.

1138
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,100
Just not J.

1139
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,700
It's not J.

1140
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,100
It's not trying to the G.

1141
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,100
No.

1142
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,000
We gotta stop.

1143
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,200
He's getting really he's physically getting hurt now.

1144
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,000
He's holding up that blanket and his hands are just

1145
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,500
trembling sucking his thumb through the blanket.

1146
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Oh my God, that's really gross.

1147
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,100
Sucking it through the blanket.

1148
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,700
You don't do that.

1149
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:44,900
Matt.

1150
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,100
Do you have a do you have a glory hole in your door that

1151
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,400
you suck your own thumb through?

1152
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,100
What is that?

1153
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,200
Well, I don't want to suck my own thumb.

1154
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,400
And if I put the if I put it through the hole, it's somebody else's thumb.

1155
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,480
Yeah, because I forget where it went.

1156
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,440
It's called your scorey hole.

1157
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,400
Yeah, it's what I use when I get scored.

1158
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,120
I just imagine like a rapper bragging me like she's through the blanket.

1159
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:15,560
Damn, that's sick.

1160
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,280
Isn't that a like a Hasidic Jew thing?

1161
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,400
Don't they throw a hole in a blanket?

1162
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,800
Now, is that a stereotype or is it true?

1163
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,360
I don't I don't think that could be.

1164
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,260
Does it matter?

1165
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,160
Get a little friend.

1166
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,820
Yeah, you know what?

1167
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,060
I don't mean to be stereotypical, but I think Jews go to the synagogue on Saturday.

1168
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:39,620
I'll say I want to be honest, but, you know, I think I get a lot of trouble

1169
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,420
if I was ever in a situation where I was allowed to ask a Jewish man

1170
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,920
a lot of questions about Judaism.

1171
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,120
I don't think I'm overwhelmed.

1172
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,260
No, I don't think they'd like a lot of my sincere earnest questions.

1173
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,340
Might be a Frost Nixon.

1174
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,440
I mean, that's it.

1175
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,340
It might be a movie because my life is true.

1176
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,660
Yeah, I guess there's life is a movie, dude.

1177
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,960
Basically true every single day.

1178
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,160
Just you just hang around all day, sit in your big computer chair

1179
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,860
and get sweaty and get used to it.

1180
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,040
And then you go to bed.

1181
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,960
You guys think about like, man, I get to do like my dream job

1182
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,060
with my friends like every week and I'm practically a god.

1183
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:29,680
the

1184
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,720
equipment manager for like the end of the toilers and do a little bit of heroin.

1185
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,520
That's my I think I want to be in a Lego set, dude.

1186
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,480
I'm moving to a Lego set. Yeah, really?

1187
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,960
Like I'm going to be like one inch tall like pie.

1188
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,440
That'd be cool.

1189
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,640
Rock Raiders or some shit old school.

1190
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,880
You get big lost in a big Tupperware forever.

1191
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,440
Yeah, with all my home. Yeah, you just have like 12

1192
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,080
is a homies like some some kid that looks like me or Patrick is just gonna eat your ass.

1193
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:08,320
Only thing to play with is like a part of a of a control board for a Star Wars ship.

1194
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,640
Yeah, it's a flat piece. Yo dude, this one kid left me some playdoh. That's what's up.

1195
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:21,280
Dude, I'm stuck here with a girl with a ponytail and Jar Jar Binks. I'm doing pretty good.

1196
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
My life a Lego set.

1197
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
(laughing)

1198
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
(laughing)

1199
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,400
My life a Lego set for real.

1200
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
Direction's been lost though.

1201
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,400
Damn.

1202
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Sorry, did I get too personal?

1203
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Yeah, I might be missing a few pieces.

1204
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Yo, my wife

1205
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
be like a Lego set cause she's got

1206
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
a mini figure. She's petite as hell.

1207
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
Oh.

1208
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
Is that good? Okay.

1209
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
And she got a cylindrical head.

1210
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
With the round edges.

1211
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,000
My girl so yellow she looks like a Simpsons.

1212
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,200
Her boobs are drawn onto her flat body.

1213
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Frowny face.

1214
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,200
Yeah, my girl got four holes in the back.

1215
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,000
And holes in her feet too.

1216
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
How else is she supposed to sit down?

1217
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,400
It'd be cool to be a Lego man.

1218
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
I would hate it.

1219
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,200
It's an air on my damn head.

1220
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,200
Come on.

1221
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,080
Now you don't have elbows so you can't scratch your nuts.

1222
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,240
That's right.

1223
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,120
That's what I need to scratch my nuts.

1224
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,360
You got to clip your beer into your hand.

1225
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,600
Like fuck like every time I got to scratch my nuts.

1226
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,640
That'd be great though.

1227
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,880
Clipping your beer into hand in your hand.

1228
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,920
You're like, Oh no, you guys already, you guys already had to do that for Patrick.

1229
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,600
Or I'll see what you guys will be able to drink a beer.

1230
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:43,640
We do Ed, we do Edward water hands with Patrick every day so that he actually

1231
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,840
It's just easier to clip beer into your hands.

1232
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Duck taping water.

1233
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,600
It just snaps into place Patrick, you can do it.

1234
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,840
We did Edward Water, we tried to do Edward Water hands, he didn't understand it so we

1235
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,240
had to change it to Patrick Water hands.

1236
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,080
Yeah, because it's my middle name, I don't know why you guys were calling me Patrick,

1237
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,080
or Edward.

1238
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,080
Oh you forgot your name!

1239
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,400
You just forgot your name Patrick.

1240
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,040
Well yeah, you were saying my middle name and then I thought it was my first name.

1241
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,480
Quick, Patrick, what's your social security number?

1242
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
023...

1243
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,680
There's no way he's gonna get it right.

1244
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,960
He doesn't even know it!

1245
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,960
I almost said the real one.

1246
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,880
I almost said the real one and I had to stop.

1247
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,120
We got at least two real digits there, maybe three.

1248
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,480
Cameron had to hit the shock ankle bracelet.

1249
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:38,660
I'll probably forget, if you guys ask him again, we could probably get the middle numbers

1250
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:52,540
is

1251
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,700
The first. It's easy.

1252
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,340
That's one one one one.

1253
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,740
So the first number.

1254
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,240
All right. Well, OK, well, watch this.

1255
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,580
Branson Spell, Mississippi.

1256
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,140
In my SSI SSI PPI.

1257
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,880
Well, did you do it wrong on purpose?

1258
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,400
I thought it was pretty good.

1259
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,100
That was a decent that was a decent.

1260
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,580
Three S's in a row.

1261
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,940
I know. That's just how I know.

1262
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,540
I just thought I should.

1263
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,540
MSPSISPI.

1264
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,540
You added an extra S in there.

1265
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,540
You said it wrong.

1266
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,540
I can type it.

1267
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,540
Hold on.

1268
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,540
Patrick's laughing really hard and then he goes MIPI.

1269
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,540
See, that's typing.

1270
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,540
Right?

1271
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,540
Well, now you've got it because you had like a minute to type it up.

1272

1273

M-I-P-P-I-D-T-I.

1276
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,540
No, make him spell something different.

1277
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,540
You've got T's in there.

1278
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:39,540
Well, now you've got it, because you had like a minute to type that.

1279
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,540
Mipapissy.

1280
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,540
Whatever.

01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,540
I-P-P-I-T-T-I.

1284
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,540
No, make him spell something different.

1285
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,540
You've got cheese in there.

1286
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,540
OK, Pat, spell or pronounce E-W-O.

Every list all naughty, all naughty, all night.

Yeah. So kind of we're still possibly naughtiest.

Yeah. I didn't think you guys were going to go there.

I hope you all get to did to prop your your feet up.

That's right.

Seriously, don't forget to do that, Branson.

No, if you get a puppy in there, it's gonna die if you don't unwrap it.

1351
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,580
You have to wrap the puppy?
