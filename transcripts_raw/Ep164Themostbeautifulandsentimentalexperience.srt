93
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,460
Can you imagine being born... there's a lot of people in Quebec. Imagine being born in Canada and you

94
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,220
have to speak French. Well there's a lot of people who are like from Quebec who

95
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,820
like didn't have parents that spoke French they're like from some other

96
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,540
learning French in school well exactly you grow up until you're like five or

97
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,580
six just speaking English all sudden you get to school it's like you're a

98
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,700
fucking France also you're gonna get hit in the head so you know how to speak

99
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,020
French exactly yeah yeah yeah I think that's a it's a truly evil part of the

100
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,900
world yeah every I mean every place should just be one language plus Spanish

101
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,420
that's how I feel yeah right absolutely be the main language and then they also

102
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,380
to speak Spanish there because it's funded. I don't know why as a kid I

103
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:23,460
thought that they spoke French in Canada because it was colder up there. Like

104
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,300
France. Yeah cold like France. I don't know why I thought that was the reason

105
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,980
and then I learned about freaking colonialism. Oh wait it was. Yeah I'm

106
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,300
going there. I'm fucking going there. Do you have anything else about the

107
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,660
thought process there about what you mean by it was cold so they spoke French?

108
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,940
I kind of know what you mean. Okay, Caleb kind of knows what I mean so you're the

I thought it said your strength, your intelligence, your charisma and shit.

169
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
And also I thought you could rotate yourself.

170
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
And maybe if you're lucky, you can move the camera and look up your own dress.

171
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,040
dress yeah your own dress should okay okay they should just make all passports

172
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,720
digital at this point okay and you can do that and it's a full-body 3d scan so

173
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm saying mm-hmm they should scan your brain give you different stats that you

174
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,960
have scan your muscles and your fibers as well maybe it's your bones and see

175
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,160
what kind of shape you're doing the vats on you should be able to change your

176
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,880
appearance with sliders and give yourself big pointy cheeks but you have

177
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,840
to spend special coins you have to spend a bunch of money become a lizard but only

178
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,980
in your passport yeah you can't change a real but you can change your passport yeah

179
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,640
yeah or you can become a big mochi just like a just like an IMVU style passport

180
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,520
yeah that's not a bad idea no you see I'm on the top of my game today I don't

181
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,680
know what I think it was cuz I ate some pretzel M&Ms before I think I really

182
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,200
Caleb's idea though what eating pretzel M&Ms no with this passport thing what

183
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,440
fucking stealing my idea. You're on the top of your game? I'm on the top of my game I'm back in my

184
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,720
invention swag. Caleb was the one that said that he said you should be able to rotate yourself and

185
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
stuff. Well I said we should have the digital, I think me and Caleb collaborated on this. I'm

186
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,400
fine it split 50/50 all the money. Yeah. When all the different countries invest except Quebec which

187
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,480
can't invest in our new idea. Yeah that's right. It's also not valid in Quebec you got to use a

188
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
regular passport. That's right, yeah you gotta use probably like I don't know a piece of

189
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,800
paper. A dog turd in your hand with your name on it. Fucking stupid ass part of one country.

190
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,880
I'm sure I go to Quebec I love it. I think we need to start making, where do you? I'm

191
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,440
sure I'm gonna go up there and be like I regret all the things I just said. You know what

192
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,400
we already took down Hawaii a couple weeks ago which everyone loved it by the way. Everyone

193
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,540
loved it. Huge fans. I think I'm still on the side of Hawaii. We should be doing this

194
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,140
every week drop that motherfucking beat let's take down that's right all right

195

224
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,820
guy there's a guy taking a shit on the ground right next to it and then he he

225
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,780
shit into his like blanket that he was using and then just kept rocking the

226
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,740
blanket dude damn I was like that is an advanced cocoon move that my friend has

227
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,660
just invented I guess I guess that's where that guy there and then I put the

228
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,660
balls on my face I guess it deters people from stealing his blanket yeah

229
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,940
that's okay here's if you can't afford like ADT or Brinks or any of these home

230
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,300
security companies take a doo-doo on you put poop on your stuff yeah yeah I'm

231
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,220
I'm a criminal. Yeah, you can just put poop on the doorknob. Put poop on your

232
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,140
doorknob. I'm not gonna do anything with it. Or also like take a shit in the

233
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,300
like the underside of your car door handle so that when people like

234
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,540
you know they walk down the street just lifting every handle they hit one

235
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,580
doo-doo on their hand. Yeah, although that might be they might go for a revenge

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,300
robbery. Yeah, they might just break your window at that point. Yeah, well get this in

237
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,640
between the two panes of glass in your window. More dookie. Lots of poop. Okay, yeah

238
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,200
plus fill your car with dookie and all the crap in it it also has dookie on it

239
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,040
that's right if you don't have the time to do a dookie just a tootsie roll will

240
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,840
do here's another trick if you don't if you're worried that your stuff's gonna

241
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,440
get ruined from putting poop on it you take your stuff out of your house you

242
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,040
put in a different house and you just have one house that's filled with poop

243
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,600
that you live in yeah we're gonna try to rob that house because you live there

244
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,840
yeah turns out all the furniture is made of poop everything's made of poop it's

245
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,340
sculpted they walk in they say they say it smells crazy in here yeah exactly say

246
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,700
oh that's just my scented candle I hope you don't pick up anything yeah I'm

247
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,380
gonna go slip into something a little more comfortable you spend an hour while

248
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,500
they pick up all the stuff you come out and poop lingerie right they start

249
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:32,500
fucking you you know fall in love with a robber then you cut you mold him to your

254
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,680

Joe Poo. You know, British names like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

263
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,720
Yeah, but Quebec really needs a... Honestly, I'm fine with them. I love

264
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm literally fine with them.

265
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
They need to clean up their hand to wean out them after them.

266
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,520
But my problem is they got to get real at some point.

267
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,400
Yeah, I mean pick a lane to them.

268
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,520
Yeah, are you fucking American or are you a French?

269
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,840
Or are you a frog freak?

270
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,160
Are you a frog eating fucker?

271
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Yeah.

272
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Right?

273
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
That's a question.

274
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Yeah.

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,360
What are you fucking, are you going to sesh burgies with your boys down in the beautiful

276
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,280
USA, where it's white and blue?

Are you going to eat a plate of armpit hair like spaghetti?

278
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Yeah.

279
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Did you say sesh burgies?

280
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Sesh some burgies.

281
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280

284
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,460
you can buy it's just another reason why Quebec is fucking sucks a bunch of

285
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,500
stone or pedophiles undercover as Canadians I had fucking dog shit ass

286
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,900
province yeah I hate provinces I'm gonna be real with you

287
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,780
But states though, states go crazy. States kinda smash, but the provinces...

288
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,220
No way, no way Jose. You want me to get into a province?

289
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,180
Get me out of this damn province. That's what I'd be saying when I'm in one.

290
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,380
Yeah. I'm like, I don't need this. I'm not trying to be provincial.

291
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,580
This is not what Sir John A. Macdonald had in mind.

292
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,140
What am I, what am I, king in a castle? Am I gonna be in a province? Straight Borat up?

293
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,900
King in the castle? No.

294
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,580
Um, they should bring back like baronies and like fiefdoms and stuff.

295
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,940
A fiefdom? I might be good with a fiefdom.

296
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,660
How long was Canada a territory of England?

297
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
Probably like a thousand hundred years.

298
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,300
Didn't it like stop being a territory of England like pretty recently?

299
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,420
I feel like there's some-

300
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,740
They still got mad respect for the Queen.

301
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,380
Yeah, aren't they like kind of loyal? Like there's some loyalists in Canada or some shit?

302
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,780
I don't really know what their deal is.

303
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,500
Uh-huh.

304
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,460
It seems very confusing. They have a parliament, I learned.

305
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,940
They have a chip made out of ketchup.

306
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,540
which is like the second most confusing part about it.

307
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,540
Yeah, they have a prime minister, they have a premier.

308
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,060
- Uh-huh, of what movie?

309
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,900
- Yeah, what?

310
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,060
- Yeah, what a prime minister, what is this, Transformers?

311
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,140
- Yeah, a premier, what is this, Transformers?

312
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,780
We're gonna see the premier of it?

313
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,220
You know, that's how I feel, right?

314
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,460
- Yeah, they got, what, they have fire trucks there?

315
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,300
What is this?

316
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,140
- What is this, a fucking Transformers?

317
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,960
- What is this, what is this,

318
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,980
gonna transform into a fire truck?

319
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,020
- Yeah, that's how I'm feeling.

320
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,860

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,940
If we have any Indian listeners, we get cold you fucking doofus. I'll reheat it in what okay?

Send me the ingredients of the mcpaneer. I'll assemble it at home

342
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,040
That doesn't you just gonna suck. No. It's not it's gotta be hot

343
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,820
They should have a McDonald's exchange program. We're like they like

344
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:59,740
Shit that is so smart. That would be so literally all fucking 50 employees. Yeah

345
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,660
the building you yeah everything they literally the entire thing take it up

346
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,980
with a crane with everybody still in it plumbing falling out of the bottom

347
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,340
customers who are still eating that's the experience and then you put it on a

348
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,340
shipping container you fucking send it over here we say you guys were

349
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,820
essentially an embassy yeah yeah yeah yeah it's foreign soil uh-huh yeah

350
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,420
that's where the customers are yeah I get to live there in McDonald's mm-hmm I

351
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,420
I mean, one was the play place preferably.

352
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
That would be so good. That is so smart, dude.

353
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:36,420
They do do that sometimes where they'll put menu items from like, remember like 20...

354
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
Yeah, but I'm not talking about the menu.

355
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,420
18. I know, I know, I'm just saying. I want to see what the Chinese Ronald McDonald statue on the bench looks like.

356
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,420
That's right.

357
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Good point.

358
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,420
He's probably sitting silently. He's not so fucking uppity like the American one.

359
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
That's right.

360
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,180
more respectful. You know, that's what I would say. I would hope so at least.

361
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,860
I don't think that they don't have... they have China McDonald's?

362
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,700
Yeah. In China? They got China McDonald's. Not Hong Kong. China? Yeah. Straight up Chinese

363
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:13,700
McDonald's. I think they have it. I don't know about that. I know that they have KFC over there.

364
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,660
Oh really? In Beijing, I think. That sounds pretty fucking good actually.

365
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:23,720
I think it's uh because the the my my high school band went to the Beijing the

366
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:31,860
the Olympics in Beijing. They must have been pretty talented. I guess. Yeah I guess I guess you

367
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,640
could say that. Must have been the fastest band in the world. They were they were so

368
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,060
fast at marching but yeah they went to they went to China and like all of them

369
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:49,060
came back and we're just like yeah we tried McDonald's over there. They were all nervous to eat Chinese food.

370
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Really? They didn't want to eat Chinese food?

371
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
I don't remember.

372
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
What? You don't remember now?

373
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
That was the best setup I've ever heard for a story.

374
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
And the worst ending of all time.

375
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Like kids would come over. I heard all these stories second hand because I was in like fucking sixth grade.

376
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:11,060
I didn't really know anyone in high school. So like my cousins, friends were saying like oh like the menus are different over there.

377
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,180
You guys heard Joe talk about his trip to China? No. Where he went to a like

378
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,460
a school trip to China and went to a school and arm-wrestled the

379
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,540
entire school. What? All the kids were like, he's big, he's like fucking huge. Oh

380
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:38,020
yeah. We want to arm wrestle you and just arm wrestled everybody in the school. Why? I don't know dude. What? Yeah, because Joe's like 6'5"

381
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,620
six six or something yeah which he was just like how tall is what age was he

382
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,460

384
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:00,380
he dominated a province of China yeah it's crazy that like I mean I've heard

385
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,340
stories of like black people going to China and then just getting photos taken

386
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:11,780
yeah yeah I like people yeah my yeah I'm I'm my mom that happened to Joe - maybe I

389
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,660
in Japan for a year and she said that sometimes like little Japanese children

390
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,780
would see her and start crying because they were scared because they saw a white

391
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:38,700
person yeah it's because she's white that's why yeah your mama's big sharp

392
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,700
teeth though yeah yeah like it looks like a red demon eyes yeah I saw a dog it

393
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,780
looked exactly like an anglerfish two days ago really literally at the

394
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:52,340
aquarium yeah yeah he's always in water they had to keep the dog alive but it

395
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,220
wasn't water he's in a blue room like an idiot wasn't why would a dog be under

396
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:05,100
water. He was a bulldog that his face was completely just like on top of his head.

397
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,420
Yeah. He's like final evolution just like you can't push. He was reaching the

398
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:15,820
boundaries of the dog physiognomy. You could not do anything else to this dog.

399
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,380
Yeah he was like he was like like like the complexity hit maximum in sport.

400
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,740
Exactly yeah. He looked exactly like an anglerfish. He could he was rolling his

401
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,800
his eyes like like he had to look down his eyes his like pupils are at the very

402
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,820
bottom of his like eyelid the entire time because that's the only way he could

403
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,600
see in front of him yeah his eyes were just like if you didn't do that you'd

404
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,760
be looking directly at the Sun all day both like Bulldogs and like pugs like

405
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,000
when they get real old they always look like they're like on the brink of death

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,320
they are yeah and they're a bomb and God punishes them by making them live so long

407
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,840
Yeah, like a lab lab will live like nine years and then die because of a firework a fucking bulldog

408
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,240
We'll just it lives until like nothing wants to kill it. Yeah, cuz like why would you want?

409
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,780
Why that's why they're so prone to dangerous things like skateboarding. Yeah

410
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:17,680
Exactly. Yeah, cuz they feel invincible like a dachshund dachshund is a delicious bird food

411
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,720
Like you know, I mean they get picked up all the time. Yeah by a hawk

412
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,360
Can you imagine a pitbull or not a pitbull a fucking people getting picked up by a hawk?

413
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,640
I would love to see that'd be really scary. Yeah. Yeah. No

414
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,960
Tag team. Well, it's like a dog or a pug. I'm not touching exactly

415
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,080
Yeah

416
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,120
It's like it's like if you're like going to a farm to like like pick out which like chicken you want to eat or something

417
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,560
You see there's like a normal chicken and there's one that's just like upside down. Yeah

418
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,640
It's beat

419
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:50,440
No, yeah, can you imagine what a hawk fucking thinks when they see a bulldog like that's a rock? Yeah

420
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
That is not a living thing.

421
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Why is a stone walking around?

422
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
This is a golem. I don't want anything to do with that.

423
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Also, I couldn't pick him up.

424
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Too hefty.

425
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Imagine a hawk

426
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
picking up a pit bull

427
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
and then it swoops down because it wants to eat

428
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,440
your fucking ice cream cone or something

429
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
but it still has the pit bull in its hand.

430
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
So it drops the pit bull in front of you. Pit bull gets scared and starts fucking

431
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
biting your leg or whatever and then the hawk

432
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
starts attacking you because it wants your ice cream.

433
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Wow.

434
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,080
this we could harness this power to real battle the Titans and send this shit

435
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,520
over to fucking fight Isis what do you think that did they breed was a pit was a

436
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,400

437
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:41,080
this is gonna be the best dog ever yeah yeah it's a fucked up dog that was I

438
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,160
mean pitbulls or bulldogs were originally bred to none of us could say the word

439
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,080
bulldog that's a pitbull. I don't know why that is. Pitbulls just have big-ass

440
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,800
heads. Yeah. The wider a pitbull's head is the more... Scary it is. No, the kinder

441
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,080

and it's like, now I just have trash.

540
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,820
- Why not just buy, why don't they just sell the liquid?

541
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,020
- Sell me the liquid.

542
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,860
What are you doing?

543
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,060
Hey, here's an idea, sell me the liquid, carbonate it.

544
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
Maybe add a little water.

545
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,500
- Maybe you could, yeah, just sell them separately.

546
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,260
Some people like the wax more.

547
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,780
They can just buy the wax, a big block of wax.

548
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
That'll be really good for some people.

549
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,840
- You guys ever eat wax lips?

550
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,340
- I never ate them, but I--

551
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,220
- I thought you were supposed to eat 'em when I was a kid.

552
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,620
- I'm sure you did. - I mean, eat your wax lips.

553
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,300
- I mean, they don't tell,

554
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,820
when you get that in your Halloween basket,

555
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,860
they don't tell you that it's not candy.

556
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,940
- That's right, but if you got something

557
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,720
in your Halloween basket that was called,

558
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,560
that was called like, like, plastic ball,

559
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,460
would you eat that?

560
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,440
- Yeah. - They have a fucking--

561
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
- I used to eat the toothpaste.

562
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,020
- They have candies that are called like--

563
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,860
- I thought it was like a sour--

564
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,260
- Fucking squirt. - Snowballs.

565
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
You're not supposed to eat snow.

566
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,460
- You can eat snow.

567
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,300
- No.

568
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,760
- You don't eat snow? - You can eat snow.

569
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,600
- That's why you eat clothes all the time.

570
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,780
- They have a candy called crows.

571
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,620
- You can stick out your tongue in the snow.

572
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,100
- Would you eat a crow?

573
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,600
- I've never heard of that candy.

574
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,440
- Crows?

575
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,660
- They're like, they're dots, but they're black licorice.

576
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,420
a candy called the three musketeers. Oh no, why are they called crows? Yeah. Oh God. Scary.

577
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,180
Yeah. I'm saying is if it has the word wax in it you should know not to eat it.

578
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,140
I thought it was like a euphemism. Also, you said you ate it right? Well cotton candy.

579
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:32,820
Yep. Says candy. Says candy but if it was just called cotton. Then you, it wouldn't

580
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,700
be the same thing. But it's clearly not made of cotton. Because cotton is already

581
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:42,300
cotton yeah there's a there's one candy okay yeah I'm thinking of what is it but

582
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,500
it's on the tip of my tongue but I can't think of it you're probably gonna say Oh

583
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,780
candy corn you're not supposed to eat corn no that's probably what you're

584
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,420
about to say eat a lot of corn you don't eat a lot of I eat so much you don't eat

595
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:51,100

639
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,960
I eat so much fucking, no don't eat my toenails.

640
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Those are mine.

641
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,080
I'm hungry for them.

642
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,680
But I used to eat my toenails and my mom hit me on the head and said you're gonna get a

643
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,560
worm and did it again.

644
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,600
Yeah, corporal punishment works.

645
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
What else did you eat?

646
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
You ate coins, too.

647
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah.

648
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Did you eat dust?

649
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
No.

650
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:59,520
I think sometimes a mustache hair will fall off into my mouth and instead of spitting

651
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,920
it out I just swallow it.

652
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,360
Sometimes it's easier to swallow something that falls into your mouth.

653
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,680
Yeah, if it's not nasty.

654
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
Yeah.

655
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,480
Yeah, no, that's pretty okay.

656
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,400
It's picking something up and eating it.

657
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,520
If something ends up in your mouth, you know, so be it.

658
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,440
I knew a kid who ate the dead skin off his hands.

659
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Yeah.

660
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,640
Yeah, he would like, swam all the time and get these like real wrinkly hands and rub

661
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,320
them a bunch, get a bunch of dead skin, eat the skin off it.

662
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,800
And then his mom was like, "My son's a genius."

663
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,520
And he got put in all these like accelerated programs and shit.

664
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Yeah, they were trying to accelerate his life so it would be over sooner.

665
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Yeah, so he kills himself earlier.

666
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Like a freak.

667
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Yeah.

668
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
He was awesome.

669
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,240
If someone's put into like accelerated classes, usually they got some weird quirk.

670
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,180
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, I knew this kid. There's this kid like a rolling backpack or something or

671
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,960
Dude, there was just there's these two Ethiopian kids at my school

672
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,220
Who were like always talking mad shit about me because I wasn't Ethiopian

673
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,380
They were like not even I was white. They were just like you like if you're not Ethiopian you're gay

674
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,800
Nice, that was the first of many times I experienced racism. Yeah

675
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,840
Yeah, yeah, but those kids skipped like 10 grades because I came from Ethiopia and I guess Ethiopia has like the best schools in the

676
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,920
World or some shit Wow and they were like this. I was in like fifth grade these kids were like

677
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:27,200
Seven yeah, and they were like so much smarter than me. They're dominating me and then letting me know that it was

678
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,740
Ethiopia yeah, I got dominated by two Ethiopians in fifth grade

679
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,040
That's what happened

680
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,420
All right, it's crazy dude number three full moon at night

681
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,700
I wish I was a wolf so I can howl at the full moon at nighttime with the beautiful stars and cool dark blue sky

682
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,520
That would be amazing

683
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,660
Do you guys wish that I would I I wish I was a werewolf

684
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,500
Just so I could scratch that damage behind my ear. You can't reach. No, would you use your leg?

685
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,160
Well, I want to use my leg. Can you imagine though if you were a werewolf you'd have almost you have an infinite

686
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,360
Amount of itches all the time. That's true. Yeah covered in fucking hair. You have tufts. You don't have tufts right now

687
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,860
Here's a really insightful comment from Oliver Skye

688
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,260
That's kind of about what you're talking about

689
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,460
werewolf a - in turn will you but Wow

690
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:27,060
Words out of my damn mouth where it's all H love word is capitalized - did you get

691
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,740
Did you wear a little bit - is all over sky Oliver Skye?

692
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:38,700
Oh, it's a pun. All over the sky. Yeah, 27 years old. You ever seen a, you ever seen a Lykoi cat?

693
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:45,060
No, I don't know what that is. That's a cat that looks like a werewolf. How do you spell it? L-Y-K-O-I.

694
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,340
Let's see here. I'll be the judge of this.

695
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:56,060
This doesn't really look that much like a werewolf. That looks like a werewolf? It has yellow eyes. Yeah. It looks like a rat.

696
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,060
Oh, it looks like a big werewolf.

697
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,100
It looks more like a beast to me.

698
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,020
Yeah, it's like a beast cat.

699
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,060
I'm thinking maybe, maybe I get an army of them.

700
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,700
Have you guys seen werewolf?

701
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
How many is an army?

702
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,340
This is an animal that looks like a werewolf.

703
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,980
Whoa, look at this.

704
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,420
A vampire bit a werewolf.

705
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,340
Do you guys believe in werewolves?

706
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,020
I hope they're not real, but I don't want to rule it out.

707
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:23,580
I feel like, okay, so I like cryptids and shit, and I generally think that they don't

708
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:28,280
exist but I feel like one of them has to be the one I have my money on the like

709
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,700
the monster that I think is real as I think water monsters are real me yeah

710
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,300
yeah that's the one is like anything that anyone has seen in a water any like

711
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,440
the kraken like that has to be yeah right just a generic water monster

712
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,320
there's too much water I think the look could be real who could do Lou what you

713
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:53,400
speak up Kokomo Cthulhu could be real who could Cthulhu who could do who but

714
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,920
nobody was late from the network oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I want to dies all the

715
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,560
time yeah yeah be real can be real but yeah I'm with you like any big monster

716
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,160
in the water not big or even like this small no it's actually small it's the

717
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:14,120
smallest well also like there's so many things like the giant squid they find I'm

718
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,040
I'm like if I saw that 200 years ago and it was alive,

719
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,200
I would think it was a monster.

720
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,960
- Well, I literally, I spend most of my free time nowadays,

721
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,740
I watch shark and crocodile videos.

722
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,160
I've been doing that for like a few months now.

723
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,680
And some of those sharks,

724
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,320
those are just straight up water monsters.

725
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,560
- Dude, that 600 year old fucking shark.

726
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,640
- Yeah, the Greenland shark.

727
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,960
So there's some deep sea sharks where their eyes

728
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,320
literally look like a cartoon character's eyes.

729
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,160
- Really?

730
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,200
- Like I was watching this footage of like these people

731
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,560
in a, you look so scared.

732
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,400
- You mean, you mean.

733
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,840
- I lost my train of thought.

734
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,400
- It looks like Toon World is real.

735
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,840
- Looks like Judge Doom.

736
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,680
- What?

737
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,500
- Yeah.

738
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,600
- You can't tell me that there's Toons in real life.

739
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,720
- There's this footage of like people in like a submarine,

740
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,340
like in the deep sea and they're like filming

741
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,000
and like this shark comes over and it's like poking around

742
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,840
and then it's eye like opens and it literally looks,

743
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,880
it looks like a Calvin and Hobbes eye or something.

744
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,720
- Really?

745
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,800
- Like it's like a, just a perfect like circle

746
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,320
with a dot in it.

747
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,720
- Yeah, that would scare me a lot.

748
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,860
So a shark shouldn't have an eye like that.

749
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,160
It's supposed to be black.

750
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,040
- You know what would scare me a lot also?

751
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,800
This is like a similar story.

752
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,760
If you were, like I was saying about this,

753
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,160
if you were swimming down to the bottom of the ocean

754
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,040
and then you hit the ocean floor

755
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,480
and you're like, well, here's the ocean floor.

756
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,680
Yeah, there it is.

757
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,000
And then you're on a giant eye and it opens.

758
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,840
- Yeah.

759
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,660
- That's also pretty scary.

760
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,880
- That is pretty scary.

761
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,080
- What would you even do?

762
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,120
- Probably poke the eye.

763
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,940
- Yeah.

764
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,980
- Poke the eye and make it, flip it off,

765
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,820
then poke it with the middle finger.

766
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,660
- Well, it probably wouldn't be able to see me, actually,

767
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,820
if the whole ocean floor is an eye.

768
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,940
Like, if a speck of dust was on my eye,

769
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,460
like right here, right now, I probably would barely

770
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,300
be able to see it very well.

771
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,120
- Here's a scary thought.

772
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,960
What if the world was an egg?

773
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,740
- Yeah.

774
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,300
- Yeah, what if, and we're all sitting on it?

775
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,780
- Yeah, hey, don't worry about it, buddy.

776
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,380
The world's just an egg, and we're all sitting on it.

777
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,260
- I think Shakespeare said that.

778
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,080
- Yeah, Shakespeare said that.

779
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,020
- Shakespeare did, yeah.

780
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,060
- Shakespeare and Bill Hicks,

781
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,060
but I think he was quoting Shakespeare.

782
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,060
I think Shakespeare was Bill Hicks.

783
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
Yeah.

784
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,060
Whoa.

785
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,060
Fuck.

786
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,060
Number four, Aurora Borealis.

787
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,060
Yeah.

788
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,060
I don't care, ugly.

789
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,060
I mean, don't get me started on Alaska.

790
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,060
What's wrong with Alaska?

791
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:31,060
Earlier today I had a hororobolbowlyalis out of my...

792
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,060
I had a fucked up shit.

793
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,060
Yeah?

794
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,060
Yeah.

795
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,060
Looked like all the colors.

796
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,060
I had one too.

797
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,060
That's because I was drinking beer last night.

798
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,260
I was drinking a bunch of colors.

799
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,660
I can't drink beer anymore.

800
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,460
I broke into a Baskin Robbins Dunkin Donuts mix, just started eating all the cake dye.

801
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,660
Oh, this is what we're talking about.

802
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,860
Here we go, number five, the ocean.

803
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,060
This is what we're talking about.

804
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,060
Here's the top comment.

805
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,060
This is something that this Markiplier would freak out if he saw some pictures of the ocean.

806
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,060
He hates it.

807
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,460
Watch him play Subnautica, Drowning Simulator, and Raft if you want to know why.

808
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,460
Drowning Simulator?

809
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,460
That's a game?

810
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,460
Oh my God.

811
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,460
These games are going too far now.

812
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,460
I know.

813
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,460
Drowning Simulator?

814
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,900
Why would you ever want to simulate drowning?

815
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:13,440
like drowning drowning and getting crushed or we all know like no Russian

816
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,360
great fucking level of modern warfare mm-hmm but if my kid walks up to the

817
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,960
GameStop counter when I'm bringing him there and he's trying to buy drowning

818
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,880
simulator no way I'm calling I'm calling I might call the police

819
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,680
something very wrong horribly this kid must have some kind of diet issue that

820
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,560
that is causing him to be weird.

821
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,200
- He's eating, the 5G has made my son weird.

822
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,180
- I've been feeding my kid ginseng and creatine

823
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,160
every single day since he was one years old.

824
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,000
- Yeah.

825
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,920
- And now he's-- - He's not even strong yet.

826
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,880
- He's not strong and he's way too weird about drowning.

827
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,720
- Yeah.

828
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,880
- Yeah, I get freaked out.

829
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,040
- It's not, it doesn't sound like a fun game either.

830
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,080
- No, what do you do?

831
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,600
Press, what, you can't even win.

832
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,440
- Yeah.

833
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,260
- You lose.

834
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,520
Do you win when you drown?

835
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,280
- Well, maybe you lose when you drown

836
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,640
but you win if you don't.

837
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,920
That's not much of a drowning simulator.

838
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,760
I saw - dude, I saw this thing the other day. It's like some article about virtual reality

839
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,240
because you know I'm into that, other worlds and stuff. Like I'm - it's pretty much my

840
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
thing.

841
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
You're into exploring the planes of -

842
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,640
Yeah, pretty much the different planes and realities. And this guy has been for like

843
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:25,160
twenty years doing this therapy for people with arachnophobia where they put on a virtual

844
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,080
reality headset and they're in a room and there is just like a giant spider in front

845
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:37,080
And I just got, I like was scrolling through like every link that they linked

846
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,080
to see if I could just find a video of the person.

847
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,080
Just like freaking out.

848
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,080
Yeah, just like, just like, and because the guy, the whole thing is the guy's

849
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,080
like, yeah, we don't tell them what's going to happen.

850
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,080
So we like lock this VR headset on them and then they just are in a room with

851
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,080
like the biggest spider in the world.

852
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,080
I thought I was so cool, dude.

853
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,080
That's sick, yeah.

854
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,080
I just wanted, I would do anything to see that.

855
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,920
pretending to be like severely arachnophobic yeah and then just like

856
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,960
going in just seeing the spider and just immediately just being like whoa I'll

857
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,680
take any excuse to piss my pants yeah yeah right any any because that one's

858
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,520
justified right mm-hmm that's why I love theme park I we got to go to Canobie

00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:39,360
Here's the top comment. We were just talking about seeing an animal exactly animals are such wonderful organisms in my opinion

862
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:46,160
The most beautiful animals on earth is the tiger scarlet macaw and Siamese fighting fish the blood one of the Siamese fighting fish

863

That's what they said. I

864
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,360
Would pick a different animal I'd pick maybe I think most of the animals I'd pick are different types of cats

865
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,960

882
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,040
background.

883
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,080

884
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080

889
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,960

890
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,600
procedure to you know reading the Miranda rights and all that mm-hmm yeah I would

909
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:26,360
most sentimental episode of all that's just poor yeah another porn star was that

00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,200

in the world. I mean Helen Keller. No, don't you ever say Franklin.

912
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,760
Aretha Franklin's alive. She's dead. Oh shit. Number 18 lunar eclipses. Not as

913
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,400
beautiful as solar eclipses, but there's still a sight caused by Earth casting

914
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,000
the shadow on its moon during alignment. It's way more beautiful. You can't even

915
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,360
see a fucking solar eclipse without special glasses. Yeah, you gotta look like

916
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,280
a nerd, which I'm not wearing that bullshit. That's right. Yeah, nothing's

917
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,120
stopping my day at the beach. Yeah. Number 19 is fjords. Is Aretha Franklin dead? I

918
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,120
I don't like fjords.

919
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,120
Number 20's fire.

920
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,120
Only comment is arsonist here, so it's very pretty.

921

922
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Dude, I do, you know...

Yeah, of course.

926
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,120
You look into a fire, something is calling.

927
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah. The devil.

928
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,120
I don't think it's the devil.

929
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,120
How come every time I look into a fire,

930
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,120
I hear a voice in my head that says, "Put your hand in it."

931
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:34,460
that's me oh really yeah oh it's me when we go camping oh yeah I like to scare

932
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,680
you I thought it was the devil no I have a big of a big horn that I talk into it

933
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,000
blows directly into your ear and I just whisper in it yeah I said I thought it

934
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,840
was an earring there you go the fire is the best part of this morning you say I

935
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,080
think I'm having the most awesome thoughts today for some reason something

00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,720
something cool is happening in my mind Caleb's you have your skateboard you

937
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,760
You should teach Caleb how to skateboard.

938
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,600
- No.

939
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,340
- I think the devil is telling me awesome crap again.

940
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,560
- You don't wanna learn.

941
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,300
- I don't wanna learn anything.

942
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,440
I'm done learning.

943
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,280
- Yeah.

944
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,840
- There's no way that I'm learning to skateboard

945
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,000
or like snowboard or play an instrument anymore.

946
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,840
I'm done learning.

947
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,920
I had until I was 17, I whiffed it.

948
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,960
I biffed it, I buffed it.

949
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,240
I'm not doing it again.

950
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,080
- Yeah.

951
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,080
- Done learning.

952
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,200
- Here's another really beautiful comment.

953
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,520
Number 22, family.

954
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,360
- Whoa.

955
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,440
- The world could die for all I care.

956
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,080
If I see a genuine family,

957
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,840
a community that's more beautiful to see than anything,

958
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,560
love, a man and a woman doing everything they can

959
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,760
for the kids, the next generation.

960
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,800
Family doesn't mean blood related.

961
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,160
- So true.

962
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,240
- Wait, wait, guys, can your friends be your family?

963
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,920
- I think your friends could be your family.

964
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,920
- I think homies is family too.

965
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,760
- No.

966
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,960
- I think it could be.

967
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,800
- Are you serious?

968
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,620
- I think homies is family too.

969
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,040

concert he told me I had to get on my shoulder so you could see the stage

1086
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,280
I was six years old.

1087
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,280
He used me like a stool.

1088
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,280
You stood on him?

1089
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,280
He sat his beer on my head.

1090
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,280
Yeah, I tried to do that last night.

1091
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,280
When I was growing up,

1092
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,280
he used to put a big metal plate

1093
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,280
on my head so it would get real flat

1094
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,280
so he could put beer on it.

1095
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,280
My dad used to put out his cigarettes on my head.

1096
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,280
He didn't even smoke. He would ask people

1097
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,280
walking by if they wanted to put their cigarettes

1098
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,280
out on my head.

1099
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,280
He said, "My kid's name is Ashtray."

1100
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,780
(laughing)

1101
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,520
My dad burrowed a hole in my leg, right?

1102
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,580
With a little gardening shovel.

1103
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,420
- Yeah.

1104
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,260
- And he would just like work at it

1105
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,820
kinda every year for Christmas.

1106
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,300
That was my gift somehow.

1107
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,860
And then he started using it as a dip spit cup.

1108
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,180
He would just spit on my legs.

1109
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,020
- My dad, my dad, he--

1110
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,840
- And he would always miss.

1111
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,100
I would just get it all over my shorts.

1112
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,860
- My dad would use to, he used to sleep inside me

1113
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,140
like a tauntaun.

1114
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:41,980
(laughing)

1115
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,140
It took like years and years for that to heal.

1116
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:44,980
- Yeah.

1117
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,780
My, there's been a few times where I've gone

1118
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:50,520
to go drink a soda at a barbecue and my dad has,

1119
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,460
my dad or my uncle has put dip spit in it,

1120
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,160
so I know exactly.

1121
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,180
- Really, my dad used to use me like a wrench.

1122
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,360
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1123
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,960
My dad would use me as the can recycling machine

1124
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,280
at the grocery store, he'd put cans in my mouth.

1125
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,180
- Yeah, I was a can opener for a bit.

1126
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,240
- Yeah. - That's why this tooth

1127
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,280
right here, you see that?

1128
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,240
- Yeah. - Yeah, that's my

1129
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,880
can opening teeth. - Wow.

1130
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,720
- My dad used me as a lawn mower to eat

1131
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,280
thousands of pounds of grass.

1132
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,560
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1133
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,240
because he was like, "I ain't cleaning up the grass after.

1134
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,840
"Just swallow it, you homo."

1135
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,440
- Before. - I'd say, "What, Dad?"

1136
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,480
- Yeah, my dad, he used to use me,

1137
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,240
he was getting really into sous vide,

1138
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,320
so he'd make me swallow all the raw ingredients

1139
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,920
and sous vide them in my stomach.

1140
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,760

1141
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,360
- I'd have to puke them back up.

1142
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,160
And I'd have to puke them back up.

1143
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,440
- Do you ever, in the summer,

1144
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,540

1145
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,380
for your house?

1146
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,040
- Oh yeah, when you get too sleepy?

1147
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:43,880
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah.

1150
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:05,120
Yeah, my dad used to use my teeth as a comb. A lice comb actually because it's so the gaffer

1151
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,120
to my teeth.

1152
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,120

Yeah.

1155
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120

1161
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,960
16th century woman in a tight corset. He also used to make me wear corsets.

1162
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,960
Yeah. He just thought it was funny.

1163
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,960
Going on vacation, going to like the Disney World or something and you have to be the backpack.

1164
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,960
Oh my god.

1165
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,960
And then on the drive home, 11 hour drive back home, dad used me as a car.

1166
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,960
Yep.

1167
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:00,960
I had to turn into a car. My dad was so mean to me.

1168
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,960
Oh dude.

1169
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,960
Used me like a fucking car.

1170
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Dude.

1171
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,180
can only tell me and what i was well as his wallet at the red sox game that was

1172
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,340
the worst

1173
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,660
you know i'm picking me up the swing in the senate the vendor at the hot dog

1174
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:16,980
when i can see that he was the bible a hot dog got and i'm glad to report

1175
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,040
that i have a lot of it would be every time you'd make me use my hands as the

1176
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,020
bone for the hot dog

1177
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:23,760
torn

1178
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,120
so i said i did so many burns in

1179
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,500
he's embarrassing me to any time i saw a buffalo soldier came on

1180
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,880
he pointed me say it's about him

1181
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,720
It's like, "No it's not, Dad. I'm not a buffalo soldier, I'm your son. You know my name."

1182
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,160
He'd listen to Buffalo Soldier and then use me as a joint.

1183
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,240
Yeah, yeah. It's true.

1184
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,360
Use me as a shoe. One shoe. He said that's all he wanted.

1185
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,480
A single shoe.

1186
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,600
The worse in the winter when you become the snowshoe.

1187
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,120
I have other brothers. He could have been two shoes. Of course, I'm the one who gets to be one single shoe.

1188
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:55,880
The other shoe?

1189
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,800
Fucking Nike Cortez.

1190
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,120
But I have to be... Why would you even want that? Doesn't make any sense. He'd duct tape me to his fucking foot.

1191
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,240
I had to work as a ceiling fan for two summers too.

1192
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,840
I had to spin around as fast as I could.

1193
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,560
My dad, he used to use me as a telephone.

1194
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:15,040
I'd have to make up the other end of the conversation and if it didn't make sense or if I said something

1195
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,320
that the other person wouldn't say, he'd make me stand outside for like a month.

1196
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,320
My dad did that too.

1197
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:24,520
Yeah, he was telling me, he was like saying names I'd never, he's like, "I want to call

1198
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,520
Dean Martin."

1199
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
I was six years old.

1200
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,520
I said, "I don't know, who the fuck is Dean Martin?

1201
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,760
I don't know who the fuck that is."

1202
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,680
like he put me on the phone with Rodney

1203
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:44,120
that's all I knew yeah well he was like no Rodney not Rocky I'd be sitting around

1204
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:48,920
and he would go ring ring ring ring ring and and and he'd pick me up and and he

1205
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,720
would say hello who is this and I would be like oh is your friend he'd be like

1206
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,720
no it's not I'd have to figure out who was calling exactly the worst the worst

1207
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,560
is when he finally made me a cell phone I had to be brick breaker

1208
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,560
Oh, oh, fuck. Awful.

1209
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:07,260
Put Brick Breaker, playing it with the burgeoning chest hairs that you had as a prepubescent man.

1210
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,060
As bricks?

1211
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:08,560
Yeah.

1212
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,060
I want to have hair in the locker room.

1213
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:15,060
Yeah, why is my dad, my dad's fucking removing lines of my chest hair like Tetris.

1214
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,360
It's like, come on dad.

1215
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,360
Yeah, what are we playing, Brick Breaker or Tetris?

1216
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:22,060
Yeah, exactly. You're mixing up your phone games, you fucking old moron.

1217
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,560
Oh man, the worst was Snake.

1218
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,060
Ugh.

1219
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,060
You think I can, you think I can squirm that?

1220
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,060
You don't want to know what, yeah.

1221
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:32,380
All right, the last thing on the list was beautiful eyes.

1222
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,380
Oh, okay.

1223
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,900
