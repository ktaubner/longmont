Okay, put the voice back on.

Mmm.

00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,000

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,980
Oh.

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,980
Oh, it's good.

28
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,480
[LAUGHTER]

29
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,980
Mmm.

30
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,480
Mmm.

00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,980
Mmm.

00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,480
Mmm.

33
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,980
Mmm.

34
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,980
I actually like it.

35
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,480
Mmm.

36
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Sandwich.

37
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,980
[LAUGHTER]

38
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,480
A nice smell.

39
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
[LAUGHTER]

40
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,480
[LAUGHTER]

41
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,940
and that's how you start the episode.

42
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:49,240
Yeah, yeah, it's Pierce week, Pio sweet. Oh yeah, that's right, two episodes in a

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,240
- I hope you're-- - Two episodes in a row.

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,080
That's how I do it.

45
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,800
I do a normal one and a premium one no matter where I go.

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,440
- This feels so weird being on this side of the table,

47
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,260
honestly.

48
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,100
- Do you wanna switch?

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,200
It was very generous of you to give me the seat

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,720
with the GoPro close up.

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,680
- Oh, I put the GoPro.

52
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,540
The GoPro's, actually it could be centered

53
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,520
and I don't know.

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,600
- Yeah, we can't see the video at all.

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,940
- I don't know.

56
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,840
I don't know anymore.

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,320
The setup is all, we have to change the setup.

58
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,980
We changed the camera angles.

59
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,800
- Yeah, we had-- - After we got our feedback.

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,960
Uh-huh. Useful feedback. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, you're helping facilitate that.

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
Man.

62
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,720
Are you guys gonna make a overhaul to the set? We will soon. Yeah. It's just a

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
matter of doing it. Yeah. Right. That's the only obstacle. That's really the

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
only thing on the to do list.

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,440
The problem with doing it is once you do it, the podcast is over because there's

66
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,800
nothing left on the to do list. There's not much else to do after that is there.

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
it gives you it gives us like something to look forward to and then once the set

68
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,040
is made, it's just like okay. Now it's just a fucking job new office after that

69
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,520
yeah, right, yeah, I have to get another new office. Yeah, it'll be nice to have

70
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,960
two offices at once. We did for a little bit. No, we didn't yeah. We did no. I

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,600
had two apartments at once.

72
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,320
That's no, I had two bathrooms actually way that goes. I always had no way. I

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,380
there's two pillows on my bed. When we were thinking of when we were moving

74
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,260
out of the first office, no, when I was moving into my apartment, I still had

75
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,020
like a month where I like I could move into my new place early and then like

76
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,620
where I could have to go off winds. If I wanted to, I had two apartments. It was

77
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,980
cool yeah. That is always cool. I had to apartment. I mean that's kind of the way

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,500
to do it, because if you go from one apartment to the other, then there's

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,340
that tricky period with no apartment, yeah, or almost even the scary period

80
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,300
where one day you have one and the next day you also have one, but it's

81
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,980
different yeah yeah. That is a scary moment. I don't like that when things

82
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,080
I guess I technically had to a man's too, but they were in different cities,

83
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,680
so I couldn't even go between them. He's a

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,420
damn

85
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,740
camera and I had that for twelve months.

86
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,060
Yeah, I had three years of having two apartments yeah in different cities.

87
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,620
Yeah, a summer apartment in Boston. That's really wag yeah. No, it's not

88
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,760
true to holidays. Yeah, it's true. You do get to fourth of July's to

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,660
Christmases. No, because there's a tree at both houses. That's actually okay.

90
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,780
There is two trees, two turkeys in both ovens. Oh my God, and it's

91
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,420
two turkeys in each oven, y'all, because you have to drive back and forth,

92
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,480
and it does take four hours each way.

93
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,340
Yeah.

94
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,420
sitting outside of the sitting outside of a restaurant and smelling that they

95
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,880
have turkey and like walking in like a dog, like a blood out my son waking up

96
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,740
my wife would be like mom. I hear Santa Claus, that's me out there.

97
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:01,240
Pleas

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
wrapped up to her.

99
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Here's me walking around sniffing the ground

100
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:19,880
mystery pine needles. I wonder how many kids just smelled the smelled the cookie

101
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,200
plate was like this was like Dad's fingers.

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,120
The heck

103
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,080
yeah, the smartest kid in the world yeah, but the best knows really yeah. I mean

104
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,120
honestly the best part of the brain. No, the better your nose, the absolute

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,660
Jupiter you are. I think yeah, I guess that's probably true. Yeah, that means

106
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,440
you have like bloodhound characteristics, you have big floppy ears. My old

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,560
landlord, my old landlord with one tooth and long, greasy hair and a pot belly

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,920
that was like sixty pounds. Nanny McPhee. Yeah, Nanny McPhee vibes.

109
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,600
Former 300 pound heroin addict, this guy, legendary Pokemon type guy. He

110
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,960
would smell dead animals in the backyard because he would attract them. He would

111
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,480
feed pigeons with a big pigeon feeder every day, and then rats would die back

112
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,800
there all the time, because they try to get the pigeon feed and then they like

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,940
can't get out of the backyard or whatever, and so when you weren't, didn't

114
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,160
you have like a basement apartment that like had the backyard, so you were just

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,220
dealing with pigeons every single fucking day? Yeah, and he would go out

116
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,640
there and try to find rats, and he would literally just go,

117
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,800
"Where is that fucking rat? I smell it." And then he would knock on our door

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,520
and be like, "Hey, you wanna see how I find a rat?" He was like, "Watch me

119
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,000
find it.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,160
It's over here somewhere.

121
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,800
I can't fucking find it."

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,940
I mean that that is smart, because what that is is that's a beautiful

123
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,000
deception where he's looking around, but he's acting like he's smelling.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just looking to see if you can see a rat while also going

125
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,600
yeah,

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,940
it's like it's he's like trying to like make it look like he has like

127
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,760
heightened senses. Yeah, just like the like he's like oh my nose is so good

128
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,000
watch that is like a very easy bit to do if you're at home and you're not

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,860
funny. You can't make your relatives or your girlfriend laugh if you're looking

130
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,000
to the remote just like sniff while you're looking for it yeah. That's

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,560
it's easy laugh yeah echo location is funny to yeah. If you can click or

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm making the sound the remote makes yeah, that's good. I'm acting like a

133
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,800
TV. I'm trying to learn the remote to me

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,560
just start reciting the office quote yeah, yeah, this is the same. This is

135
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,080
the same landlord that would make you

136
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,640
give give him your car yeah. He would borrow my car

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,680
you'd borrow my car in exchange for a hundred dollars off the right, he would

138
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,600
just go to the beach and shit. Well, he would just go to Manhattan to like

139
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,000
process his compost and then it would take him like a

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,400
composting

141
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,520
the back seat that he's driving like like what like in the past thirty

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
minutes yeah,

143
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,640
and then he would he would not pay for gas. He would come back with an empty

144
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,360
tank and then I would just be like. Can you please fill up the tank if you're

145
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
I drive the car and he was like that was never part of the air.

146
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,160
But yeah, he would drive my car all day and then he would come back and then he

147
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,740
would bring my car key up to his apartment. He lived on the top floor and

148
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,760
then I would message him. Could you please bring my keys to me and he would

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,100
say you'll come up and get him

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,080
and then one time I did go up to get him in the inside of his apartment was so

151
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,040
horrifying. He just had plastic bags filled of like rotting fruit that was

152
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,280
ready to go to the compost just nailed to the wall. Oh my God, just filthy

153
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,780
clothes all over the floor. Yeah, this guy definitely has a strong sense of

154
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,680
smell. He really does yeah, he's training, he's training his nose. That's

155
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,580
why he has the bags on the wall right. There's no better way to train your

156
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,400
nose than to completely obliterate it. Yeah, I would run your if you're a

157
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,800
hungry junkie so much sense around you that when you go outside and there's

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,480
like no gross smells, it's like yeah, it's a hundred percent drop in the

159
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,900
weights. You're talking about this on monster crazy. How I think it's so

160
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,880
ridiculous that human beings just can't turn themselves into dogs by

161
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,460
concentrating, but I think if you're a hair a fat heroin addict, that means

162
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,500
that you have transformed into a dog. You just walk around and you eat

163
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,660
everything all the time, just smelling around, just smelling around like a

164
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,220
junkyard dog. Yeah, yeah, I remember you like

165
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,980
this guy is so I'm so fascinated by this old landlord. I just remember this one

166
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,700
time you were telling me that like he

167
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,060
they like arguing with them news like you hurt my feel.

168
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,140
Oh yeah, I told him hey man you're kind of hurting my feel because our place

169
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,580
flooded and then he starts yelling at me that I'm weird and I was like look man

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,180

171
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,660
hurt my feelings, tell me that the apartment flooded when it never has

172
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,060
this is the first time it's flooded. So you you hurt my feelings.

173
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,420
That's the go to tag.

174
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:50,920
yeah

175
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:59,100
because I told him that the place

176
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,460
just anybody pulling that oh yeah. Well, you're hurting my

177
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,260
you're hurting my you're asking him like hey man like yeah, there's like like I

178
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,020
lost like my x box or whatever, like there's so much water in my apartment.

179
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,460
It's like

180
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,080
you would always cry. It was so or if I man you just talk to me and just like

181
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,040
oh, I got an annulment for my wife, which is good. Listen to me. You want an

182
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,680
annulment, but oh my God, her mother, her mother made the best spaghetti. I

183
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,240
miss it so much. That is the

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:44,560
keystone phrase for a guy like that is, but oh my God, my God, God yeah talking

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,840
about your ex wife's mother's spaghetti.

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,540
Man, yeah,

187
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,920
well,

188
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,560
so I'm fleeing the country. You're fleeing the country, yeah. Oh yeah,

189
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,580
you're going to Ireland. Yeah, I'm fleeing the country and leaving. Maybe

190
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,240
the most jealous I've ever been of you. Yeah, you've drawn his iron. Iron,

191
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,600
yeah. Ironically, when I land there, he'll be filled with iron. Yeah, when

192
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,000
you land there, St. Patrick's gonna chase you out. No, dude. Fucking snake.

193
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,560
no, no, no, don't land in Ireland at four AM or what you want to get stuck in

194
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,060
that you stuck in a wepacon

195
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,360
stuck in a pot of wepacon gold,

196
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,880
which actually sounds kind of good. I visited Ireland at three AM and became a

197
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,620
saint. Wow, that is so slick, a camera there, a saint Cameron, probably Google

198
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,700
it. Maybe there may be a saint Cameron. That sounds like that seems like there

199
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,920
probably would be yeah. That seems like I wonder. I wonder if there's saints for

200
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,960
all of us there at there is a Cameron or camera Cameronis. Oh was murdered in

201
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,320
three or three under three or three three or three. Is he Roman? What's

202
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,080
going on? Does it say anything about the Saint? Can you click who was Saint

203
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,960
Cameron there on the info box? He was a Scottish nobleman, so this is a

204
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,560
nobleman. No, that's a musician.

205
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Well, he sings the Hussie. This is pretty uninteresting. Unfortunately,

206
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,780
yeah, yeah, even a single quality given to the same. He has no animal

207
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,980
super power. He was Scottish. Yeah, he didn't even chase any snakes away or

208
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,640
anything.

209
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,680
Oh well, yeah, but that's okay. I'll just become the new Saint Cameron. I'll

210
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,600
come up with a good thing to be a sense of well, then what's your what's going

211
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,440
to be your thing when you go over there and you Saint of intelligence? Yeah,

212
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,620
yeah, that's good. Saint of concentration,

213
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,680
the saint of sitting still. You see you're sitting on one of those like

214
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,040
cobblestone fences they have over there, just doing this with your mind.

215
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
You're the same. I'm going to get a painting done of me when I'm there.

216
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,520
Yeah, nice. I think I'll get a painting done every day, like an oil painting

217
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,160
every day. Yeah, I'm thinking I'm going to do that because there must be

218
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,680
people around to do that. You can probably just walk into a pub and get

219
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,520
somebody to do a painting of you and you can get a pie if you're American

220
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,640
enough things and paintings. I bet that's what they have instead of the

221
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,680
wine night, the wine paint by numbers nights they do for moms.

222
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,180
It's the same thing but with beer and men.

223
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,680
Yeah.

224
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,180
Yeah, and you're painting boobs.

225
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,680
With ale.

226
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
You're painting boobs.

227
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,180
You're painting big old tits.

228
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
And rugby balls.

229
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,680
And portraits of landed gentry.

230
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,180
Yeah.

231
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,680
[Laughter]

232
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
The two best things.

233
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Landed gentry, that's like,

234
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
that's like,

235
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,180
like how Christopher Guest is like a member of the royal family.

236
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,680
Landed gentry means you're the upper class and you own land.

237
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,180
Oh, okay.

238
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
That's, I didn't know that.

239
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,680
Yeah, well it's landed, I think, I mean, I think so.

240
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,300
it's what they call. Well, he technically is technically a landed gentry. It

241
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,740
means to be Irish, because there's so much less land over there, and if you

242
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,100
own any land at all, you're considered a billionaire. Yeah, everyone there is

243
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,220
basically Elon Musk, who owns land totally so many so many of the Irish

244
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,260
working class are getting pushed off the cliffs because there's literally

245
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,140
they're running out of way. You can't walk here. That's my land. Yeah, it's an

246
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:03,600
Irish accent. You can't walk. You can't touch my land. You can't touch my land.

247
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,060
yeah, you've got to five feet on my line.

248
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,060
That's pretty good. How's that you sound like Liam Neeson and I was doing the

249
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,940
demo man voice right yeah. There's no Irish team Fortress to mercenary. There

250
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,940
will be soon. They're going to add it to the expansion bag yeah. They already

251
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,820
added. They added a Chinese Irish guy. You've heard of a black Scottish guy.

252
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,380
Wow right yeah, this and what would his ability be? What is his weapon? What's

253
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,180
is a skill. What's a skill class, the only member of the TF two team with

254
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,320
melee weapons. Wow, besides only melee weapons, nope he's they're going to

255
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,820
remove the frying pan, the fists and he's going to be able to use them all.

256
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,600
Wow, I heard that he's going to be the only one that when you kill when you get

257
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,880
killed by him, it forces you to log out of the game. That's his ability. He has

258
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,160
no weapons, but if he does kill you, it deletes your account. You lose all your

259
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,300
hats. Oh my God, he steals your hats. I used to be so obsessed with the there

260
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,700
was like a

261
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,560
community made tenth

262
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,740
fighter that was going to be the guard dog. Do you guys ever look at this? The

263
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,460
guard dog up? I was definitely obsessed with this type of thing. Yeah, me too.

264
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,520
He he had ninety five HP and he would run around and he had two big galling

265
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,520
turrets on his back. Was he a dog? He was a literal dog and he could bite you and

266
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,560
he could shoot you with the galling guns and he could piss on you, which was the

267
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,020
time attack is the Gerati attack that sniper has, but he could fill up the

268
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,200
Gerati sniper attack with his piss. Nice pretty cool yeah, that's not a bad. I

269
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,860
would add that he was small. I don't know how that would work in the source

270
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,140
and

271
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:43,600
he can't he can't jump over any. Let he can't go upstairs or anything yeah, I

272
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,140
don't think it would maybe there's a mechanic where he gets too scared. If he

273
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,960
goes too far away, oh my God, yeah, because they got fireworks and stuff

274
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,160
true yeah and all the explosions, the explosions force your character to run

275
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,580
away

276
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,840
the coward. That's the

277
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,640
scary coward. I was talking to Brian last night about how scaredy cat is not

278
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,680
it's like a misnomer. A scared cat will just leave the room and not fuck with

279
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,440
you, but a scared dog like this is what a scared dog does.

280
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,560
a complete scared. That's like you're freaking out you're going to kill

281
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,680
some they show their teeth at you. They go like yeah.

282
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,200
They also just they run in circles and stuff yeah.

283
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,880
It's so weird. Why wouldn't you just like leave? That is so funny yeah.

284
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,120
Their eyes are really wide and they stick all day

285
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,280
and then also I'm going to bite you is such a strange fury action yeah yeah

286
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,120
what what stupid animal. I mean if right, because if if some kind of if

287
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,320
okay, say that an alien is coming to me right and I wouldn't want the alien.

288
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,240
No, I was scared right. Do they know fear? Yeah, aliens, yeah, yeah, they

289
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,860
know they know fear. They have well, they know fear. If I go like this,

290
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,920
what do they think that's like? What if they think that's a greeting or like a

291
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,520
mating? These are aliens from earth, okay, so they know all the same.

292
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,740
All right, the ones from under the ocean, so the they actually know all

293
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,260
the stuff that animals do the atlantis actually. They would even know that when

294
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,740
the chimpanzee shows its teeth. It's not smiling. They would know that too okay,

295
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,860
because they made they made them that see that's another stupid fear reaction.

296
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:26,700
My smile yep yeah jing jing smiling supposed to be happy when you smile yeah

297
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,280
chuckle scared animals, no happiness. I think every animal is more happiness

298
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,620
than as the other animal. See that some of these monkeys do look scared. I

299
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,580
don't know why doing that because it's scared.

300
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,600
they're scared of being a stock photo when they're really angry. They do

301
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,020
kind of

302
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:56,040
so weird. I try to look up things like this sometimes, like monkey with

303
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,500
painted nails. Yeah, this is one of the first clip art things that I've ever

304
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,960
seen of a monkey with painted nails. I feel like it's a pretty rare

305
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,920
monkey with tattoos monkey with piercings and monkey with painted nails.

306
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,580
Sometimes I look those up, but there's a really good picture of a monkey with

307
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,960
facial piercings in a Mohawk. Whoa,

308
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,660
that's

309
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,560
yeah, but this is going to be

310
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,060
to use of monkey. That first one is kind of dope. Yeah,

311
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,460
actually, what's cool? Look at monkey finds peace after a

312
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,760
lifetime of suffering monkey piercings Mohawk. That's such a

313
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,360
crazy headline. Yeah, it's a chimp with Mohawk, but it's so

314
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,760
good. I bet it'll come up. Yeah, that guy.

315
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,360
It's so swag. So it's got gauges to

316
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,700
It looks like it works a damn hot topic monkey see monkey do get pierced today

317
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:48,600
We don't have a Facebook account. That's too bad. We should get a Facebook account for the podcast

318
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,700
It should be named to Caleb Cameron Patrick

319
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,860
That's a good idea and everyone can write on our wall and say happy birthday to us

320
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,600
And poke us. Do they still do poke?

321
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,400
Poke to every other social network. Yeah. Yeah, you didn't a poke war. Yeah

322
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,520
I thought that there was something recently that was like you can shake some

323
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,220
someone

324
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,400
you can grip or shake someone or so that's what they should now. Once we get

325
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,760
once we get all the implants and whatever all our chips in our fiber

326
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,160
optic contact, yeah, or whatever you know it's got an X chip yeah, the

327
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,080
vaccine fuck me with Elon Musk and but that's that that's what they should

328
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,800
bring back poking and they should make it have haptic feedback. So when someone

329
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,360
pokes you, it shakes your entire body. Yeah, you can feel it physically when

330
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,040
someone pokes you

331
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,440
right in your belly, but yeah, I like in your belly, but

332
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,600
that's your you're at work. You're like a barista or something yeah. You just

333
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:43,740
say

334
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,980
you're pretty, whatever, whatever I was the guy. I would love to be able to

335
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,720
poke a barista from far away

336
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,380
and then you're trying to voice message to whisper into their ear and say I

337
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,420
need more coffee.

338
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,960
You're my girlfriend.

339
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,500
You could yeah. You could put in a series of pokes on the back of their

340
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,480
older and then a whisper sound yeah. I would love to change my relationship

341
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,300
status with a barista yeah using have to

342
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:19,560
imagine how horrifying it would be to see if you're working as a barista and

343
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,120
you had your your ex contact lenses, glasses in and you and you just see a

344
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,180
little on your hud. You see a little notification that pops up and it says

345
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,780
anonymous has changed his relationship status to include you and as a picture

346
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,280
your face and then you look over and you're saying across the room, you

347
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,480
just wave and then there's a bunch of pokes that happen after a bunch of

348
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,720
pokes. Hey, then the whispers are like you're my girlfriend, my girlfriend,

349
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,900
then the periscope like start yeah, yeah, everyone in the everyone in the

350
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,260
coffee shop is approving

351
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,780
all their love. It would be so funny. If you get the X contacts lenses, it's

352
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,340
just crap with people like

353
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,220
instead of cat calling just beautiful women can't see because there's to

354
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,760
another accident today. I walked in a traffic was blinded by like it by too

355
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,700
many likes. It would be so incredible if you could set your if you could set it

356
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,460
like your status to be like a bit moji type thing, but it's like when someone

357
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,400
looks at you like on the street or something and you have the thing and it

358
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,900
just shows over your face the expression of the status. You want to walk down

359
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,460
the street, you're looking everyone and most people have like a smile on some

360
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,760
people have like doing a funny face. Yeah, some people are sad yeah, some

361
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,200
people have their heads blown or like a text status that comes up above their

362
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
head. That would be incredible to be able to do. Yeah, it's happening sooner

363
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,120
than you think it probably happened right now. Yeah, it's already in trials.

364
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,800
It's dark future that's ahead of us. Google glass was supposed to be like

365
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,360
that, right? Google s was supposed to be like that. And then it was. I mean,

366
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,200
nobody, I don't think anyone has one. I think it was mostly for taking videos

367
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,120
and pictures without using your hands. Yeah. What everyone always says is that

368
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,120
all these things that yeah they failed because they look ugly yeah, but I feel

369
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,260
like that can't be true because I

370
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,920
have to be there has to be a line that you cross where it's like okay. This is

371
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,800
this technology is insane enough that I'll wear it even it's ugly, but Google

372
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,840
Glass wasn't even like that. It was just like a like a bar with a little thing.

373
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,820
I think yeah there was a promo where it was like if you focus on something for

374
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,240
three seconds, then it does that it's like clicking on it. So, like if you

375
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,840
wanted to take a picture, you would go like this and then the camera would be

376
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,140
like today, and then if you wanted to look at a calculator app, you would go

377
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,380
like this and then you would pick each number

378
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,560
to a genius. So wait, I can figure this out. Let me think about this one

379
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,740
hundred yeah

380
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,500
one hundred that's one zero

381
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:50,740
equals.

382
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,980
do you think you think like you could maybe buy a Google glass on ebane like

383
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,860
now right they think they don't ever made it. I don't think they ever made a

384
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,660
prayer eyes. Also, I thought they had them because I think people were getting

385
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,260
like bullied for where I think they remember reading a news story that

386
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,840
people were getting bullied in the streets of San Francisco for wearing

387
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,900
Google glass. I feel see I think that that I'm saying that has to be the

388
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,820
thing where that can't be true. That has to be a thing that people like to say

389
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,780
you only feature of these is that they automatically dial nine one one when

390
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,320
your head is dipped into a toilet.

391
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,060
Oh yeah, you could actually well. So what I'm thinking right is like because

392
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,340
your eyes moved all the time all over the place. Unconsciously, you have the

393
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,060
cicadas or whatever, we're looking back and forth constantly. So what you I

394
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,260
mean, I guess you have to focus on something for a certain amount of, but

395
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,460
I'm imagining like it's constantly imagine you're opening up a pedia

396
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,860
version of the the Google glass version of the DJ academics computer glitch

397
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,700
where everything all the programs are opening and the screen readers going to

398
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,040
stuff. Just that happening in your real life world. You have to blink to close

399
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,280
yeah. You actually looked at something for too long and your entire world

400
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,820
starts going to

401
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,260
what's the DJ academics computer. You haven't seen that video. Pull it up. I

402
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,420
actually I need to see this really. This is the best video of all time.

403
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,300
He got like a got a virus or no. He spilled something on his keyboard. Oh

404
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,420
Jesus. Well, Pierce's Secret Service call came up on podcast about this

405
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,860
highlights. I don't even know what that is. That's when I talked about getting

406
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,140
call right now.

407
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,820
Mike, come on, you got this.

408
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,100
Oh, my.

409
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,940
I love how he has no idea that it's

410
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,900
it's so incredible.

411
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,940
Just wait.

412
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,300
What the fuck?

413
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,500
*laughter*

414
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck this is.

415
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
*laughter*

416
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Holy shit!

417
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
What happened? He spilled something on his computer?

418
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
He said...

419
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
How the fuck does that happen?

420
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
What the fuck?

421
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
*laughter*

422
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Exiting Nereus.

423
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
*laughter*

424
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
*laughter*

425
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
*laughter*

426
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,000
like

427
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,020
imagine this this happening to your to your real world,

428
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,160
yeah,

429
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,660
it's so fucking just in because you know, because you know, holy you, they have to

430
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,460
have a zoom function on the Google glass or else, yeah, that's the point of

431
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,400
having something like that yeah, so it could do that yeah, just accidentally

432
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
clicking so many click bait things, because you go out in the rain and yeah

433
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,220
the rain hits your glasses and that's our gun. Yeah, everything I think maybe

434
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,900
maybe one of the ideas was to click by blinking, but then you blink on

435
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,260
no way to actually verify that you want to advance. There's no way, because if

436
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,220
you look at something too long, then you're just your human attention is just

437
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,740
a click, and if you blink, then your brain is a click. They had those

438
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,180
snapchat glasses.

439
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:05,460
No, they just Google glasses. No, they were just like glasses that were they

440
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,820
like Ray-Bans, like Wayfarers that had like little cameras on each side.

441
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,380
And I think they were like 360 cameras, but that was like a whole thing.

442
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,580
It was like snap lens or something. And you could, uh, like tap,

443
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,740
like the side of it. If you wanted to like show your POV,

444
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,380
it would automatically like add it to your snap story.

445
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,500
But like the whole,

446
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,060
I think the whole problem with the snap glasses was that every single person was

447
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,700
was using them for like up skirting or just like going to the be definitely

448
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,260
just like

449
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:43,100
doing that. The thing is that there's no there's literally zero function at all

450
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,260
that that you need glasses like that for because you have a phone already yeah.

451
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,340
The only reason yeah, the only reason you would get them is if you're up to

452
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,580
something nefarious yeah yeah. I mean what are you doing on the app for

453
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,500
children?

454
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:02,180
What are you doing on the africa? I mean even on the like new like the apple

455
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,620
ones that they're making or whatever the vision. What are you going to do?

456
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,360
You're going to put a dragon on the train that

457
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,080
you're going to watch a video that's overlaid over a guy's face yeah. What

458
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,020
that is possibly needs to be a dragon on the train right now

459
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:25,940
talking to fuck

460
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,880
aren't the apple vision, though those can't leave the home right. They have

461
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,960
stay plugged in the know they can't they they don't need to stay plugged into the

462
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,320
wall, but what they do need to stay plugged into your pocket. They have a

463
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,240
battery pack that you like clip really about that as a cable that runs that

464
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,200
show for a big ass battery. A big cancer emitter that goes right on your test.

465
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,080
It's so crazy, it's whack yeah, well that's another vision of the dark

466
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,720
future yeah, but speaking of this, speaking of the dark future and the

467
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,040
dystopia, we have a dark. Yeah, do you want to introduce what this is so okay?

468
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,040
How do I introduce this? Because it is part of the shareholders meeting.

469
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Today we're joining the Illuminati. I just wanted to tell you about this guy you found.

470
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,040
So yesterday for the shareholders meeting, I didn't know what to do.

471
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,040
And I was on Facebook. I was messaging all these different groups that I'm already in.

472
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,520
And you know how they like Cameron talked about the new feature that they have that every

473
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,320
single like community on Facebook now has its own group.

474
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Right.

475
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,520
And I mean how it should have always been.

476
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Yeah.

477
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm in all these groups, you know, like the Ascension Fifth Dimension.

478
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:45,720
I mean, it's like like I found one that was like buy and sell underwear retail or something.

479
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm trying to get information out of them.

480
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,400
I was going to the big the big thing, though, the big news drop I want to get before we

481
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,860
you. Oh yeah, that's right. There's some that well there's yeah, but there's some

482
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,540
huge news about what's going on on Facebook groups right now and all the

483
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,000
community chats and stuff right now. I'm really sorry to say that anybody who's

484
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,500
fan a fan of this group, the exo politics Israel Facebook group has been

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,640
completely, which is about that's about that means UFO politics Israel. It's

486
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,020
been completely taken over by by bots selling shoes, so I get a notification

487
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,380
every day. There's ten new posts. They're like these shoes are so comfortable, and

488
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,620
really scroll through is just all shoe like videos of shoes and then there's

489
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,100
like one guy mixed in that's right, just posting videos of aliens and stuff.

490
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,860
Yeah, the kidney stone understanding and supporting group got completely

491
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,620
overhauled by Snoopy shirts, but it was about Snoopy being a stone former. Oh

492
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,500
wow, that's crazy. Yeah, it says you can't hurt me. I'm a stone for

493
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,820
but then I found this one group and I didn't think that they were going to

494
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,940
reply. I honest

495
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:53,580
it was a group on Facebook called Illuminati Dark Brotherhood, and I got a

496
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,220
response almost immediately

497
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,660
from

498
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:03,180
I guess one of I mean the master can only contact you on whatsapp yeah, the

499
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,820
master rodney. So yeah, rodney, the leader of the Illuminati is named

500
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,620
rodney bruce

501
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:14,420
and he only communicates through whatsapp. You can't speak to him over

502
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Facebook. No, I tried to I tried to really hard. I was I was saying only

503
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,540
contact you over. I was saying I have a problem with WhatsApp. I was just banned

504
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,020
because of the really not so voice number. No, he's not sympathetic at all.

505
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,500
He's you if you want to talk to the Illuminati master, you need to talk to

506
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,260
him on WhatsApp, right? Which so me and Patrick already have done so we've

507
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,580
already done. We've already entered the Illuminati. We're already in the

508
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,300
Illuminati. Now it's time for Pierce to join. I know Pat showed some of his

509
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,060
his conversation in the shareholders meeting. If you want to see that, you can

510
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,300
upgrade your tier and look at that. But I have some screenshots of just so you

511
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,940
know what to expect. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we pull these up right now?

512
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,540
So this is me. So first I just tried to call him out right before I sent a text.

513
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,540
He wouldn't pick up. I said, "Sir, pick up. You joined my friend, Patrick Caleb

514
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,420
Fetter." That's what Patrick said his name was. Nice. "Into your organization."

515
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,660
He said, "How are you?" I said, "I'm good, my friend." He said, "Yada yada." I said,

516
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,940
"Does the health care plan cover prion diseases such as Kuru?" He said, "Yes,

517
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,380
my son. I said, "Thank you, Master." He said, "You're welcome."

518
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,140
Oh, yeah. I was trying to join the Illuminati for the healthcare.

519
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,860
Yeah, we were talking a lot about healthcare with Tim.

520
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,020
Because SAG is on strike.

521
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,900
So then I tried to ask him, "Is Barbie or Oppenheimer better, Master?" And he just responded

522
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,540
by sending the form I have to fill out, which I did eventually fill out. But basically,

523
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,780
the point here is that I just kept asking him over and over, "Master, do you know

524
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,820
Barbenheimer? Master, are you familiar with Barbenheimer?" He completely refused to respond.

525
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,000
he would just ignore me. He would send dot dots until I filled all the form, so I

526
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,060
filled it out and I was able to actually get an answer about Barbenheimer

527
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,220
eventually. Oh yeah, I asked if I could fill out the form over the phone,

528
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,100
because my phone was running low and he said no,

529
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:59,400
so he was still refusing to pick up here. I filled out the form here,

530
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,100
twenty one years old, male writer, you know, etcetera, etcetera. There's my

531
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,900
self, my initiation self, so that I said interesting thing.

532
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:15,380
and I had to take I had to take a video as well. That was like pledging my

533
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,300
allegiance to the Illuminati. Did he give you a script? Yeah, what was do you

534
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,020
remember what it was something like like the light or so I don't remember it

535
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,980
yeah, the light I'm going to go forward and backward into it or something or

536
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,420
out of the

537
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:35,060
I'm going to go backward and forward and like that yeah. So now Cameron, but he

538
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,740
never asked me to send videos. He only wanted me to send the selfies, which I

539
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,700
think I stunned. I think I think I served. I think you slayed. I think I

540
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,140
slayed

541
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,340
those are my and he said they were great. He said okay, my son, that's great. I

542
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,740
can I send that's he asked me if I was sure I said thank you, master. He also

543
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,620
asked me to send him a video of me writing down my desires. Well,

544
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,100
over a candle light, well, he didn't ask Cameron to do any of this. No, he

545
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,780
didn't, but I got some answers from well, I guess, because you probably

546
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,880
released the wheel for Cameron. He was like yeah, I did everything. I was also

547
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
kind of misdirecting him by asking about Barbenheimer a bunch of times. I think

548
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,600
he was kind of didn't was maybe a little annoyed with me yeah, you're just

549
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,920
trying to get you over with yeah

550
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,480
you know. He also eventually told me I asked which is better barbier

551
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,960
Oppenheimer and he said son. I can't reveal to you information. I can't

552
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,780
reveal this information until you join and then so I asked

553
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,040
past. Are you familiar with barb and I were master? He said yes, my son, why

554
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,160
are you so concerned about barb and Imer? I said Master, I need guidance on

555
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,760
which is better and he immediately said Barbie is better. It's so fucking

556
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,000
awesome and that was where I left the conversation great. So you got what you

557
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,720
needed from him yeah exactly. I got the guidance information yeah, the guidance

558
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,400
the Illuminati is on the side of Barbie team Barbie yeah, yes, you would think it

559
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,160
would be team up and I was expected, but it shows that the the nuclear bombs that

560
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,140
they want to drop or bad. Yeah true. All right, so let's pull up what's up here

561
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,680
and let's get

562
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,420
let's get this new account all signed up. Let's get Pierce into the Illuminati.

563
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,080
Do I have to do anything? No, no, I think we can do it up. We can we have

564
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,860
it all up on screen. I can just type here. Yeah, here we go. So okay, so

565
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,140
Pierce already started the conversation here. Yeah. What did you say here? Pierce?

566
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,960
You said, sir. Hello. I am hoping to join up. He says, how are you? He says,

567
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,900
I am calm, but alert. How are you? So now we have to fill out the form. Yeah,

568
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,900
So go ahead and copy and paste this into the text box for me, Julio, and then we can just

569
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
fill it out.

570
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Yeah, we'll fill it out together.

571
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,460
All right, so number one, we gotta go full name.

572
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,380
And I'll control it from here, Julio, I got it.

573
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,340
All right, full name, we'll say maybe...

574
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Pierce?

575
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,100
That's great.

576
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,180
Yeah, and then maybe we'll say maybe Pierce Pitts.

577
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,140
Yeah, Pierce Pitts is good.

578
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Age?

579
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,420
What do you want to be?

580
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,060
Can I be 14?

581
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:04,820
I think maybe you have to go at least 21. Okay, let's do 64 then. Yeah, I'm just

582
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,500
worried that he won't he won't accept you. Okay, do do 26. Okay. Yeah, do

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:24,860
Come on. Please. J. K. Mail. Okay, dot dot mail. Nice period. Okay. Occupation.

585
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,540
I guess I would love to be a locksmith. Maybe he can use me in that way. That's

586
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,740
a good yeah. That is true state

587
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,240
Ohio, Ohio,

588
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,040
most normal locksmith in Ohio.

589
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,940
Most normal locksmith marital status.

590
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Let's say single. Okay.

591
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,340
That's funny.

592
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,540
Monthly income.

593
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,800
I think a locksmith is going to make about three thousand a month. Yeah

594
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,060
depends on the law. I said eighteen thousand. He did not bad and I

595
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,200
purpose of joining

596
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,260
need purpose

597
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,080
and answers.

598
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,340
There we go, okay, then we got plans after achieving which I don't really

599
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,380
know what that means plans after achieving that membership joining yeah

600
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,400
maybe a public suicide.

601
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,900
you

602
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:31,420
this one country will like to settle when you become a member.

603
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:38,120
Yeah, where do you want to go? Once you remember of these, I mean, I go

604
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,120
anyway, I conquer, I guess I said China yeah.

605
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,820
I don't know. I don't know.

606
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,800
What do you guys think? Maybe just say I don't know, and then just like a like a

607
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:55,520
drug suggestions question mark. Yeah, so you have a successor. Will you like to

608
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,880
be rewarded with a position in the organization? I skipped ahead. I would

609
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,640
like to be awarded. Yes, yes. Do you have a successor?

610
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,520
Maybe say yes. I don't know. Yes, I said soon

611
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,360
explain a little about you.

612
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,520
So can you just say yes? I know a child

613
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,680
I know a child who will be strong.

614
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:29,080
Okay, explain a little about you the same thing. I know a child who will be I

615
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,420
know

616
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:36,220
all right, let's send in the form all right and now we're just going to wait

617
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,000
for Rodney Bruce. So yeah message us back

618
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,460
it's a very prompt reply. Oh yeah, I think I think that

619
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,620
yes, please, J K does not fit with anything else that we've. It's kind of

620
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:59,760
strange that he is like the master of the Illuminati and he also oversees like

621
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,100
all the forms. Yeah, yeah,

622
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:08,920
you think maybe he'd have like an intern or some kind of yeah, definitely like I

623
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,800
mean, I guess the Illuminati, I guess, I'm kind of servant. The Illuminati is

624
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
more about like

625
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,540
violating norms right and it's not exactly normal for a master to look at

626
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,100
the form. Is it no it's almost like the order of the world is turned on its

627
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,040
head. I don't know if the

628
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,280
with violating norms. I would have thought that there, I guess they are

629
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,240
in charge of norms. Yeah, now that I think about it, you're right right, but

630
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,440
the once you're once you break through that membrane, once you're through the

631
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,580
rabbit hole, everything is topsy turvy yeah. Can you just put I would be

632
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,980
willing to process these applications in the future. Yeah,

633
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,820
that's good. That's good. Yeah, maybe maybe like okay. I can

634
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,920
master master. I will fill I will be willing to I will be

635
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,640
willing to initiative master if I am accepted.

636
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,240
I will help you out. I will help you out.

637
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,640
And then send maybe just a smile. Why not?

638
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,440
that might get the ball rolling yeah

639
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,040
okay, all right, so it looks like maybe

640
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,180
so we'll just wait for him to respond here and in the meantime we will just

641
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,480
we'll just gab yeah. We should have got actually got started on this

642
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,640
completely silent.

643
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,580
Well, he responded instantly to us every other time, so maybe he's just

644
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,380
rising up busy. I what could he be possibly be busy with? I don't know

645
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,640
he's I mean he's the leader. He's the master. Maybe he's getting a massage

646
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,580
yeah. I mean he responded to you instantly with the other stuff right.

647
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,140
Yeah, I think I kind of left him on right a little bit. Maybe he doesn't

648
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,860
take me so seriously anymore. That's true. Well, that's okay. Oh, can we

649
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,900
pull up the the Illuminati's website? I don't remember the link. Does he

650
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,580
don't want to click that link? There's a line that the guy sent over Facebook

651
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,340
that was like dot online dot. I click it. I clicked it to get the phone

652
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,500
number. It was safe.

653
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,700
Why not click it? Why not click the pick?

00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,160

676
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,140
went ahead and I think the gmail. I went ahead and I just I just texted him.

677
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,440
Good afternoon, master, just to see if he'd respond to me. Maybe you went to

678
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,640
sleep. Yeah, maybe he's just not too keen on this application. Yeah, maybe

679
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,740
we filled it out wrong. You know what's crazy is that guys hours. Look, what's

680
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,380
their business hours. They okay, maybe that's oh no, because it says they're

681
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,380
open twenty four hours. Every single yeah, it's not worth putting it on and

682
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,820
it says open twenty four hours looking at the pictures. It's like the guys

683
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,300
decided that they wanted to be pedophiles, even though they don't have

684
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,220
any sexual attraction to children.

685
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,220
They want all the glory of

686
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:24,100
yeah, there's really only three sections of the website. They're like the guys

687
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,300
they're like the guys in a band who don't play the who just are the hype

688
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,800
men. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're like bez from happy Monday run sound for the

689
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,340
yeah.

690
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,440
They're the guys who drum on kegs for slipknot yeah for sure.

691
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,500
Well, I don't know. I guess I didn't. I guess I didn't hit him with a nice

692
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,140
song. Maybe he went to sleep or something. I didn't respond to me

693
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,060
either. I mean you like to just keep sending him messages say master, please

694
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,380
so disappointing. He was responding instantly all yesterday. He's caught on.

695
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,140
I don't know.

696
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,540
Yeah, let's send him.

697
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:05,560
Okay, well you know if he never responds, that's okay, yeah yeah. I

698
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,200
guess that is okay right yeah. It doesn't even bother me. It is a bummer.

699
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,800
I thought that we were going to buy one. It doesn't bother me that yeah peers

700
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,360
won't get to join the Illuminati and be with me and Patrick in it yeah. It

701
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,420
doesn't make me sad at all. I am in the yeah now thanks for allowing me to even

702
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,600
try to be friends with you guys in a new context, but this is something Caleb

703
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,720
will never get right yeah yeah unless yeah, you guys are doing this again

704
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,400
unless we try this out one more time. I don't know well. What else yeah? What

705
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,500
else is going on? Did you hear there's five men currently trapped in a

706
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,920
submersible? Oh underwater yeah yeah, I heard they were in the air. I heard

707
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,320
they were high in the atmosphere in a satellite. I've gotten bad information

708
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,280
had been trapped in a satellite. I heard they went on an expedition to find the

709
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,980
titanic and they went far up into the like too far in the air. It goes to show

710
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,460
that some of these billionaires are dim witted yeah, yep, that they actually

711
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:06,300
think that the titanic is up there. No, no, my friend, that is a ship that sank.

712
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,360
It did not float yeah and if it did float, it would only float to the top of

713
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,900
the water.

714
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,580
Go any higher than that that's as high as something can float yeah. It just goes

715
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,640
the show that people like Elon Musk will always you can count on them to do the

716
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,160
exact wrong thing in any context, and I heard that he's now calling his website

717
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,340
X videos or X hamster or X X and X God. He had a good idea of putting chips

718
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,540
into monkey brains and now he's going to completely fuck it up by removing the

719
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,480
chips from the monkey

720
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,680
buddy. They don't work after you take them out, but there's no money in that

721
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,580
people don't want you to do that. They want you to keep them in yeah.

722
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,340
wonder how far along did he get into those monkey brain chips. I think every

723
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,420
week he says okay, we're finally going to do it for yeah. We're finally going

724
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,820
to do this with a human baby. Yeah, they're going to start with a baby

725
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,320
imagine like being the person who like like

726
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,740
options off their baby to do that. He probably will start with a baby.

727
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,060
That's the yeah options off. I know that's like a auction off auction off

728
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,220
yes option office is with it. I don't even think they say option off. I think

729
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,780
first option, but I think yeah you would have to

730
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,660
that's interesting. I think you have to start with a baby fresh out the womb.

731
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,500
It's crying because then you get the clearest results like it's crying and

732
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,940
it goes to plus two. You know like it works. It's a miracle. Is that what the

733
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,900
chips are supposed to do? I think they're supposed to make you. I think

734
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:39,060
they let you go online. Yeah, I think they enhance you huh actually so I'm

735
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,940
actually I'm actually pretty sure that Rodney went to sleep because right now

736
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,860
I'm calling him and it's just ringing, ringing and usually declines my calls

737
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,140
after one ring. Yeah, so I think that he's maybe he thinks his phone was

738
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:52,040
compromised. Yeah, that's a good maybe a drop. Maybe we should or something

739
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,240
yeah hit. Okay, well we'll try to call him right now. Yeah, I think it's just

740
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,140
going to ring. Unfortunately, I look at this camera.

741
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,940
This is definitely going to turn him off. Yeah, it's just my computer. He's

742
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,560
looking at it. So he didn't get turned off at all when I called him like five

743
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,220
times. Yeah, he kept talking to me. I do think I truly do think he's probably

744
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,740
asleep and we probably just have to wake him up yeah by texting yeah. I think we

745
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,380
are going to keep

746
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:21,180
just call him on his normal cell, maybe if you want to yeah, that's not such a

747
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,320
bad idea yeah. Rodney definitely fell asleep yeah or I think the Illuminati

748
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,140
number is compromised. Maybe he knows what if I got a being surveilled right

749
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,900
now yeah. I think they're listening in and that's why hang that up hang that up.

750
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,600
They're not only listening in oh fuck. What have we got ourselves in that's

751
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,620
okay? I'm just going to call my

752
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,620
phone.

753
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,500
Google Voice

754
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,180
Illuminati.

755
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:50,020
OK, OK, so when did that become a Google

756
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,020
voice number?

757
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,700
OK, so when did that be?

758
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,540
What's that?

759
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,740
Oh, he's probably got a Google phone.

760
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,740
I mean, this guy.

761
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,860
No, it's still winging.

762
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,820
Yeah, I think he I think he put his phone

763
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,000
under his bed yeah

764
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,700
god that's so disappointing. It's horrible all right. Well, I'll leave a

765
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,940
voicemail if I can does Google voice even let you do

766
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,700
here we go.

767
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,460
You've made a huge mistake.

768
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:34,140
Okay, so here's that is what the number one thing you don't want to say the

769
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,820
Illuminati

770
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,760
you said you threatened them. I don't care the Illuminati and we're here with

771
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,020
you. I

772
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:47,060
guessed on the episode and you do this. This is my care. I don't care. I don't

773
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,880
even care. This is completely messed up. I'm not scared of them. I think

774
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,420
they're stupid. I honestly don't even think this guy's all you already.

775
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:01,840
We honestly I was watching this video yesterday about like deep ocean stuff

776
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,000
yeah and there's this part where it was about this guy who went down in a bath

777
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,920
Bathysphere and like I want to say the twenties or the thirties. What's a

778
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,760
Bathysphere? It's like

779
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:16,240
it's like a metal sphere that has like a glass window. It's like a really early

780
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,640
submarine that they just yeah, it's like that. They just like drop it down. You

781
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,960
always see it in movies and stuff. He's co opted this for the diving helmet.

782
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,360
Yeah, that's a bathyscaphe, I think,

783
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:31,880
but we should do trivia. Yeah, we should do trivia. This guy, what he would they

784
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,860
lower him down on like a cable and he would just be in there and just looking

785
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,260
at the window and he would just write down and draw whatever fish he saw and

786
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,300
then he'd come back up and be like guys. You won't believe what kind of weird

787
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,860
fish I saw down there and there's one instance where he saw he went down there

788
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,080
and he said that he saw a fish that straight up doesn't exist and that no

789
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,700
one's ever seen since so it clearly was that he just wanted like they were like

790
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,300
they were like yeah. I guess it could have existed and then somehow gone

791
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,980
extinct since then, but what's more likely is he doesn't like wanted more

792
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,780
attention, so he made up a six foot long fish that had two tentacles.

793
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:11,380
I bet he saw a colossal squid or so yeah, it's just like, but he drew a very

794
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,180
but he was like it was a six foot long fish. It had a glowing light, it has

795
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,140
glowing light. I saw two of them. It had glowing lights along the side and they

796
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,420
each had like two tentacles that also had glowing lights like it was something

797
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,000
that yeah doesn't sound so ridiculous. No, I mean, but the funny thing is

798
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,540
that no one has ever seen it since and there was no one else in the or no. You

799
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,500
so I think it was that there was two guys in there and one of them wasn't

800
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,380
paying attention. What

801
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:39,020
like oh my God, wait, look at this. Oh, you missed it.

802
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,200
Luckily, I just drew it glue

803
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,420
that's like most of oh my God, we get I think I just heard a noise. I heard

804
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,420
a what's that notification. Can you click

805
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,040
I okay my son that's great okay click back in the in the field. What question

806
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,680
do we want to ask?

807
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,140
Let's ask a question about the fish. Is there any fish living in the deep ocean?

808
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,780
Yeah, that's a good question. Is there any hello master? Is there any fish

809
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,140
living in the deep ocean?

810
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,540
Yeah, same master master. Is there any fish living in the deep ocean that is

811
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,360
six foot long with two tentacles

812
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,280
in the

813
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,940
deep ocean that is six feet long with two tentacles?

814
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:32,820
Can you say the national the real NASA and then in parentheses aquatic is

815
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,300
lying about fish again?

816
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,340
The real NASA

817
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,100
aquatic

818
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:46,980
is lying about fish again dot dot dot question mark

819
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:53,180
all right. Let's see what Rodney says back because I personally don't believe

820
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:57,120
in this fish yeah. I don't either part of the Illuminati says that this fish

821
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,060
exists. I will believe in it. I will totally believe in this fish, long with

822
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,960
not specific

823
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,700
oh my God. He just responded to me saying a mistake. How

824
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:16,860
oh he's typing right now. I just saw the typing. I love this guy. This guy's so

825
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,620
knowledgeable. He's truly my master is the master of the Illuminati. Also, when

826
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,620
I texted him knowledgeable good afternoon master. He said greetings my

827
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,560
son. Oh my God, great. I wonder if he knows that it's the same person that

828
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:27,780
is

829
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:33,180
maybe he's freaked out right now. Maybe he doesn't want to answer anything.

830
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,220
No, he said, are you sure you're ready to take this great step in life and

831
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:41,580
achieve all your dreams and heart desires? Yeah answer about the fish.

832
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,860
I'll say yes, yes, but I need an answer about the fish.

833
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:52,920
okay, we'll say yes dot dot dot, but I need an answer about the fish yeah

834
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,840
that's good. Okay, I just really I

835
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:00,820
was feeling crazy about it, though I'm at that. Can you just a fish that's

836
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,120
only one person ever saw

837
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,020
ever yeah, he definitely made that fish up sometimes that happens, but that can

838
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:12,660
happen in the deep underwaters yeah wow. What if it was an eel? I guess it was a

839
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,340
strange deal. What if it was an eel with an alien tentacles a strange

840
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,660
glowing eel that was maybe two of them swimming together. Maybe yeah, yeah,

841
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,800
I think so hard to believe school of eels, but you'll still live deep

842
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,780
underwater. Do they there are some maybe eels live in I don't know. I

843
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,100
think there's some meals that live. The eels live in mud. There are

844
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,260
definitely some meals that live in mud. I think worms live in dirt. You

845
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,740
know who loves eating eels is the fucking British people. You've seen

846
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,780
that video or it's like the oldest fast food restaurant in the world and

847
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,740
it's like they like jelly deals, a jellied eels in the in the pie bar or

848
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,160
whatever

849
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,820
really jelly,

850
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:52,240
jelly, jelly. I went to I went to I mean I sent it to you guys immediately, but I

851
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,900
went to a restaurant earlier today. Jelly J. I got the guy behind the counter

852
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:03,640
was named Jelly J. That is such a good name. A or it was like a are jelly J. A

853
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,660
are jelly J.

854
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,160
okay. Now that I'm thinking about it, maybe a jelly as a nickname in between

855
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,160
the R and the J yeah, but his are a are jelly jelly j

856
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:21,200
jelly jam, jelly, jelly, jam, jelly, j that's such a good name. What do you

857
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,120
say? There's jelly. Yes, I know we're just going to hit him with no worries

858
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,720
wrong number. No worries. That was I thought yeah. I thought you were

859
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,400
I'm really so curious about this guy. Yeah, I want to know like well. First of

860
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,820
all, he's not answering about the fish. Yeah, he will he will he will. I hope

861
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:47,260
maybe he's maybe he's too concerned about this mistake. Yeah, he'll answer

862
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,760
about the ash. Are you sure you're going to take this great step in life and

863
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,460
achieve all your dreams and hearts desires? Yes,

864
00:53:53,460 --> 00:54:01,520
but I need to know about the fish. My friends and I are don't believe that I

865
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:07,320
What's the first change in the world you guys would make if you were the master

866
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,220
if I was the master first change I would make

867
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,720
fix Apple pay on my phone is broken right now.

868
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,020
I can't tap the subway.

869
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,520
It's hard.

870
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,420
Oh my God.

871
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,620
I can't tap to get into the subway.

872
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,520
It used to be so easy.

873
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,020
Now I got to take my whole card out.

874
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,320
I'd just fix stuff probably.

875
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,220
Fix all the problems.

876
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,720
I would do stuff for good.

877
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,620
You should be able to Apple sell.

878
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,120
You should just be able to put your phone up to something and get money.

879
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,820
Can't you do that?

880
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,920
Can't you put two phones together?

881
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,560
here. That's kind of that's always my fear when I'm using. I mean it can't be

882
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,480
so hard for some genius.

883
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,320
Hacker is the smartest in the world. Yeah, to when I'm reaching out to tap my

884
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,160
phone on the turnstile that they can just pull the money out of the air.

885
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,200
Yeah, can't they do that with the the the dolphin thing? Have you seen those

886
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,160
little yellow or orange? No, I don't know what that is. It's this this RFID like

887
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:58,040
spoofer that you can get. It was like you can like there's like a frequency

888
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,400
sooner thing. I know you can use it to like open up other people's garage

889
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,440
doors yeah unless unless I or or or or copy library books labels.

890
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,680
We're just talking on text instead of on

891
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,140
his

892
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:21,980
let's get to it. Let's get to it master.

893
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,680
Maybe I was just following I also I of it, but it like it was showing videos

894
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,760
people. I mean, you can do that. You can use it to spoof amiibos. You can put

895
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,080
amiibos into your you can get all of them put. I used to be. I used to be so

896
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,960
obsessed with that in like middle school and high school. The idea of of yeah,

897
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,280
copying or erasing RFIDs and stuff and that you but not that I ever was able to

898
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,760
do any of that stuff, but it's so crazy that that's something you can do. I knew

899
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,320
somebody who had like a DRM stripper or something and they knew how to like

900
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,160
remove the DRM off of iTunes gift cards and that's how they got all their me.

901
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,860
that's so swag. I used to crack the DRM on e books from the library. Oh yeah,

902
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,660
that's the that's the most fun thing. What I used to do is I had a you would

903
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,760
do that in the Illuminati yeah. What I was before I joined the Illuminati

904
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,800
that's why they want me yeah. They reached out to me first. Actually, they

905
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,160
said I saw what you did with library

906
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:20,500
the most returning institution yeah. I had to pull over hoodie and then with

907
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,160
the big pocket and you can fit a nerds rope in there.

908
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:32,120
not so hard. It's the hardest thing to steal, but not with a pull over hoodie.

909
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,560
Yeah,

910
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,180
what was that? Can you focus the what's up again? I just want to ping him yeah

911
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:41,480
well. No, he's talking to get back to me on what's at my son as if he's not

912
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,820
okay. Yeah, I'll get him yeah master the fish.

913
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:51,280
I just wrote yeah, let's get to it master. I am ready for abilities and he

914
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:58,360
Okay, get back to me on what's okay. I said no, my son knows I knew it. Am I

915
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:03,020
say am I not ready yet? No, because I'm ready. Well, I know, but I know, but

916
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:06,820
maybe he has to do like I think he's answering your question about the fish.

917
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,640
Oh, that's a good point. I think he's saying there is no fish like that. Well,

918
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,760
he's typing. Well, then maybe this will clarify. Let me know I'm ready. Yeah,

919
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,260
see I told you I told you he I told you it was going to be the question of being

920
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,080
ready. I'm

921
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:27,400
Is that not his name? He changed it right? No, that's what we said at the

922
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,800
top. I thought it was Alan something now Rodney Bruce. I want to run an

923
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,760
Allen. Alan is the guy from the focus group. It was on it was on the set of

924
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,600
the non union production that we did not scab stop calling us scabs. It was

925
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,760
scabless. It was completely scabless. You scabbed hard. I've been scabbing

926
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,160
recently. Oh yeah, yeah, I've been just writing all the movies that have been

927
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,400
of coming up. That's

928
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,800
any movie they need made. I just he said I'm not here to be asked a relevant

929
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,940
questions, which is out of the organization. You are on the wrong foot

930
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,160
with him. Okay, sorry, okay,

931
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,400
okay, sorry. I thought you knew everything.

932
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,080
I thought you would know about the fish.

933
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,800
I will ask someone else.

934
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:16,240
I'll ask someone else about the fish, but for now I need to join.

935
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:25,040
but I'm ready dot dot for Illuminati. I love you.

936
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:32,260
Oh man, well, how are we ever going to find it? Who are the else? Are we going

937
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,600
to ask about this fucking fish? Do we know? I honestly don't even give a fuck

938
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,440
about this fish. You know what you're totally right. I don't give a fuck about

939
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,300
the fish. I'm over it. I'm over that yeah on it. We should say honestly I'm

940
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,920
I'm honestly I don't care about the fish.

941
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:54,280
Honestly, I'm over the fish and don't care about always typing. I only care

942
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,520
about puppeteering.

943
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:06,780
He's typing again. Okay, I think right now he's going to tell you to send the

944
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,020
selfies or the video. Yeah,

945
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,840
So we have those ready, right? You have all the photos. I have the photos.

946
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,940
All right. Okay, good. All right. I think the organization is not a place for

947
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,940
jokes or relevant questions. My son, damn, he's really cracking down. Yeah,

948
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,740
I know. What the hell should I tell him? You just made a huge mistake.

949
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:32,740
No, not yet. No, say, say, master. I am ready.

950
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:38,140
I am ready to become a member. I am brimming with excitement and

951
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,700
trying to make a good impression. These are not jokes and I'm sorry that I made

952
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,060
a bad first impression.

953
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,220
I'm not funny in real life.

954
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:59,980
He's going to like that yeah. This is going to win him over. I hopefully

955
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,060
Rodney Bruce

956
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,200
yeah

957
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,940
I'm called

958
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,940
the master

959
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:11,300
I'm called Master Rodney Bruce

960
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:17,740
the master of the Illuminati being do you think he's lying on his bed right

961
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:22,100
now with his feet up against the wall? No, I think he's lying on his back. I

962
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,540
think he's just he's holding his phone right now. I want to know about him

963
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,240
every detail of his life. Okay, my son. Now we got to send the selfies. Let's

964
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,860
go. Okay, let's go. I'll forward you these

965
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:37,780
forward you these selfies. I'm going to type to him while I do that. Okay. Say,

966
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,940
do you want them in HD?

967
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,740
Do you want the...

968
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:52,540
Excellent. I knew this moment was coming.

969
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,700
Do you want the photos in high definition?

970
01:00:54,700 --> 01:01:00,980
All right, Julio, I just forwarded the selfies to you on discord so we can throw

971
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,080
with them in here and get Pierce all signed up. Yeah,

972
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,360
now the hand signs, you might have to take the video with the way that this

973
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,180
has been going.

974
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:14,260
I think that might be a little extra from you. He might notice the CIA

975
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,460
that's embroidered on the

976
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:24,180
well, that's okay, because the Illuminati probably controls the CIA.

977
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,740
Yeah, I mean, so you're probably already probably in a good position.

978
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,900
Yeah, yeah,

979
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,980
Okay, great, then the photos are high definition. Yeah,

980
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,660
these are good photos.

981
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,000
So huge,

982
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,740
but that's okay. I love the hand signs that Rodney Bruce makes you do to join

983
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:51,080
the Illuminati. He does a it's a rock on sign, a spider man sign and a and a

984
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,640
high five.

985
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,180
Please forgive my cuticles,

986
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,260
my heart harassers have

987
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,700
augmenting

988
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:09,000
fingers at night. He said okay, my son, that's great.

989
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,020
I'm brimming

990
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:20,660
and yeah, I buy every everybody who's watching or listening to this. You

991
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,980
should join the Illuminati. We get all hang out and I think we should all join

992
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,860
it. Yeah, I should all join together. We should all join because this is a yeah

993
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,060
it's only fun. If all your friends are in it, yeah, if we all troll this guy, if

994
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,440
we have a discord, we figure out exactly how we're going to call him. I wonder

995
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,000
going me going to the Illuminati meeting texting first me like yo who all is

996
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,520
there yeah wait. I really do understand.

997
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:48,120
I really wonder what his end game with this is though, because it's definitely

998
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,040
like some kind of credit card scam right like I think we're going to have to

999
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,060
send gift cards soon. Yeah, I can't that's cool. I do think that he might

1000
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:59,840
just be cos playing. I think he might be having fun yeah. It's a really good. I

1001
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:05,120
don't know which is that like what's worse is it's worse that he's just doing

1002
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,840
this for fun or is it like I would do this for fun. We're already doing it.

1003
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,760
Yeah, it's true.

1004
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,240
You are the point of my life

1005
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:21,120
because there's no way that there's like an Illuminati

1006
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,480
thing like this and it doesn't end with like you need to send me

1007
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,480
to join. You need to send me five hundred dollars in Amazon, but he said

1008
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,980
that we're joined yeah and now he's texting me. I said he said greetings my

1009
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,980
son. How are you? I'm just going to tell him now go and get a good handle of the

1010
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,780
videos coming. Yeah, that's okay. We'll tell him I say I already had one. I

1011
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,800
already have one yeah. Okay, say I have a candle and then we'll just we'll just

1012
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,440
bait him here.

1013
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,440
(Laughter)

1014
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Because we don't already have one in my hand.

1015
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,440
I use it to channel.

1016
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,440
Oh jeez.

1017
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,440
I use it to channel purposes.

1018
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,440
Okay.

1019
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,440
Yeah.

1020
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,440
Is there a candle?

1021
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,440
We might have candles. Yeah.

1022
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
Oh okay. Do we have a lighter?

1023
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,440
Yeah we have a lighter over there.

1024
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,440
My son don't rush. Okay.

1025
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,440
Okay.

1026
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,400
No rush here.

1027
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:26,000
I have mastered patience due to gastric bubbles.

1028
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,640
We do have a million patients.

1029
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,920
Where's the lighters over there?

1030
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,160
Lighters over there next to that pack of cigarettes.

1031
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,160
These smell amazing.

1032
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,720
They smell like apples and they last for four hours.

1033
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:49,760
What do I do with these candies?

1034
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,120
What do I do with these candies?

1035
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,880
You must be aware of the path you have chosen in life.

1036
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,160
That's so true.

1037
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,880
Honestly, that is a good mantra to have.

1038
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,880
Yeah, I am aware of the path I have chosen in life.

1039
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:15,440
I am so certain

1040
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,200
take a clean piece of paper, a piece of paper that's a night. Okay, now I gotta

1041
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,000
get a clean piece of paper. Yeah, hold on. Okay, the candle is lit

1042
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,160
and there's three wicks on this candle, which represents the three of us

1043
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,120
currently in the room.

1044
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,660
perfect. I told him I am lighting the candy. I am grasping my sheet right all

1045
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,540
what you seek

1046
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:45,400
desire from the organization on okay. What are we? What are we seeking desire?

1047
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,600
We're seeking answers about the fish yeah, but we gave that up yeah. No, I

1048
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,400
say no longer seeking answers about the fish. I'm just right different amounts

1049
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,720
of money. I said don't like the can't oh

1050
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,760
blew it

1051
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:07,060
don't get the candle is so funny. I'm going to write dinosaur

1052
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,140
okay,

1053
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,820
just that

1054
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,280
okay,

1055
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,260
yeah, that's good. What else okay,

1056
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:22,460
I'll say I wrote I wrote down my desire.

1057
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:26,900
When do I like the candle master white? I'll say it right now

1058
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,180
dinosaur sciences,

1059
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:36,700
anything else international money

1060
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:41,820
internet. He said no. Okay, say okay.

1061
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:51,220
When are we going to like yeah? When do you when do I when are we being

1062
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,620
informed? I'm just going to write bubble girl,

1063
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:57,580
bubble girl, girl with a girl with a bubble body

1064
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,300
at the bubble girl and bubble realm. Yeah, okay,

1065
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:07,600
now what now what that's good.

1066
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:15,860
Yeah, I can't he's just taking his sweet. I know come on man. You're leaving us

1067
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,540
hanging here. Okay, he's typing now.

1068
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:25,100
Okay, now what let's go Rodney Brews. He's probably gonna tell us to what did

1069
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,340
he he asked you to do this right Patrick? Yeah, but I told him I had to

1070
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:32,180
ago. Okay, so we're getting pretty where we've gotten. I wonder if he's gonna ask

1071
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:36,180
us to burn it. That will be oh yeah wag. Have you ever tried becoming a member

1072
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,100
before? No,

1073
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,660
he wants new members.

1074
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:46,240
Okay, so if if we had said yes there, I wonder what he would have said. Don't

1075
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,740
like the candle Patrick. You didn't inform us. I just like the smell. These

1076
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:54,160
candles are so fly. I love the way they make me smell. They make you smell

1077
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:59,300
Wow, these are making me smell. I can't help but smell

1078
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:07,700
bro. He's being so annoying. He is master. You're being a no master. I'm

1079
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,100
annoyed with your actions.

1080
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,660
Master, what's

1081
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,060
what shit?

1082
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:18,020
What's the next step? Master? What's the next step? Yeah, I can hear garage

1083
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,260
door.

1084
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,020
It's coming. Okay, my son, okay,

1085
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:28,820
okay, kind of stalling their master, making it up all on the spot. Now he's

1086
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,420
typing a here. We go okay. I hope it doesn't say to kill somebody.

1087
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,560
Please tell me to burn the paper to take a nude picture. Yeah, I don't want to

1088
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,100
do anything. If he tells us for the paper, we all just scream like I said,

1089
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:46,580
be patient, no rushing my son. Okay, I'm on a time constraint.

1090
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,820
I mean I'm at work.

1091
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:55,580
I'm on a job right now. I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be fixing a lock.

1092
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:02,940
I'm in the bathroom pretending

1093
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:09,540
no that's too jokey yeah he's going to catch wind. No he doesn't he doesn't

1094
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,300
know what we're doing. The Illuminati doesn't know anything about us yeah,

1095
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:17,540
except for what we tell them. We got to get a closer. We are kind of well. I'm

1096
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,380
like the Illuminati's friend yeah

1097
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:25,180
Yeah, I think we should need to think of one really good final question to ask

1098
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,480
him if he's not going to go. I just want to send in this video. I feel like

1099
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,200
that's the swaggiest thing is for him to go. Well, we wrote down. We wrote down

1100
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,440
all the desires right okay, okay, at what

1101
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,980
I'm home. It's my lock.

1102
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,700
I'm home yeah.

1103
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:48,480
He's completely stringing us along here. Yeah, I'm just going to be, but I'll

1104
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:53,840
back and forth. Okay, Rodney needs to to really, really, really. Do you think

1105
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,240
that Rodney Bruce is a code name? Maybe it's an anagram for something. Julio,

1106
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,200
can you look up anagram for Rodney Bruce?

1107
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:06,020
I bet that it broad broad news broad

1108
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:10,820
broad news it free anagrams.

1109
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:18,140
Okay, this isn't right at all. I think there's an anagram name getter. Let me

1110
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,460
if I can find it on my phone.

1111
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,500
Anagram solver.

1112
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,600
He just responded, though.

1113
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,640
If you have any questions or doubts

1114
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,440
about the organization, you can ask

1115
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,600
before I proceed.

1116
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,180

Lord Bruce.

Oh my God, Lord. So I bet he joined this community because

1168
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:14,300
he's obsessed with societies and then he was awarded the title of Bruce

1169
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,440

The ring fell down.

01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,020
gift cards or something.

1210
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:28,720
Let the candle place the paper beside let the writings be visible on it and

1211
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,960
a short video and send it to me while saying all hails to the light.

1212
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,960
Okay.

1213
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,480
Here, let me take the video so that, take it on my phone so I can send it directly to

01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,480
Julio.

1215
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,600
Okay, and we can't get any of the mic cables or anything in the shot, right?

1216
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,600
Yeah.

1217
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,600
Here, you can hold it and take the video.

1218
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,600
Okay.

1219
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,600
You're putting it right above the candle.

1220
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,600
I should just accidentally light it up.

1221
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,600
No, you should not.

1222
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,600
Here, wait, bring it closer here because I don't want the cords in the shot.

1223
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,600
Okay.

1224
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,360
All right, this is it, guys.

1225
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
This is it.

1226
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,360
We're about to get-

1227
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,320

Yeah.

1229
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,760
Make a short video and send it to me while saying all hails to the light.

1230
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,160
I don't think you need to show your face.

1231
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,360
All hails to the light.

1232
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,080
All hails to the light.

1233
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,680
All hails to the light.

1234
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,100
All hails to the light.

1235
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,960
All hails to the light.

1236
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:32,440
OK, now let me send this over to Julio, he'll send it over and we're good.

1237
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,880
I think we're in guys.

1238
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,840
Yeah, I think you think we'll be next in line to be masters.

1239
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,440
I hope so.

1240
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,760
Wait, do you guys think we could be I think Rodney Bruce would let us become

1241
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,720
master. I can't believe the videos that he sent.

1242
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,960
They are so awesome.

1243
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:52,040
I think here this is the most exciting time before before you send.

1244
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,040
I'm just going to text him.

1245
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,060
Yeah, go ahead.

1246
01:16:54,060 --> 01:17:00,160
Just say like I just shared the video with you Julio to once he

1247
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,460
once he types this delicious.

1248
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,260
These videos are deliciously horrifying not horrifying.

1249
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,860
You can't you can't say that you're scared are deliciously

1250
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:13,560
not frightening deliciously cryptic.

1251
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,460
I think they are scary.

1252
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,460
I think that's the point.

1253
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,860
No, no, no.

1254
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:18,360
Okay.

1255
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,260
Yeah, powerful is a good word deliciously powerful.

1256
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:28,360
I cannot wait to have how these would scare children or layman yeah and then

1257
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,360
send that and then Julio can send your video right after that, because I send

1258
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:31,860
it to him.

1259
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:41,480
Okay, you have to stop typing to do it, I D, I D, I D.

1260
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,780
This is going to be kind of go down in history as investigative journalism.

1261
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,200
Yes, I think. Here comes my video.

1262
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,800
Okay, here comes a video Rodney.

1263
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,200

1264
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,000
Okay,

1265
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,500
Dinosaur Sciences, International Money,

1266
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,900
Bubble Girl, Bubble Realm.

1267
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:05,600
All hails to the light.

01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,200
All hails to the light.

1269
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,800
All hails to the light.

1270
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,900
This is a good video.

1271
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:15,400
Yeah.

1272
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:24,200
ID. It still says ID. That's fine. Yeah, it seems cryptic and okay. Yeah, I guess

1273
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,760
Rodney's going to watch the whole thing. So we have to fill 20 seconds here. Yeah,

1274
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:35,600
maybe we talk about our favorite foods. I like shrimp. Yeah, I love swim. I can't

1275
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,840
wait to eat lunch after this. I am hungry lunch hungry. I'm ready to you

1276
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,920
guys want to get no. I already had Burger City. Where's Burger City? That's

1277
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,920
where Jelly J is.

1278
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,420
Oh

1279
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:49,600
it's where jelly day works. That's where it is for our daily day works.

1280
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,000
We're silly J

1281
01:18:51,000 --> 01:19:01,440
Rodney all hails to the light. I'll need you Rodney. Do you think that maybe all

1282
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,080
hills to the light is a phrase that's picked so that he can he can cut it up

1283
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:09,460
and rearrange it and it can get into a voice password system? Maybe and it's

1284
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:13,240
like you saying like I am me yeah

1285
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:19,640
I think that that's definitely maybe message him right now and say no. I'm

1286
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:24,040
on a time crunch. He's watching the video. He's busy. Maybe he's pounding

1287
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:29,840
