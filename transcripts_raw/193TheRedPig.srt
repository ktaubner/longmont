1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So explain what you did to your body and the reason why and give us one reason,

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,360
but you can't get three good reasons. Give it yeah. Okay. There's one more.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,660
There's one reason and I can't really talk about it just yet,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,460
but

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,160
I give us two other reasons because I know that you wouldn't do such a

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,960
drastic for only this one reason. I did it for just this one

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,200
No, you wouldn't. You're not that dedicated.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,640
No, I'm more dedicated than ever now.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,320
I'd put too much effort into something the other day.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,600
I screamed so loud on set of a movie.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Whoa! Oh my God!

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,920
Why are you buzzing it?

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,440
Because you just humble bragged.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,120
That's the humble brag buzzer.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,400
I was not humble bragging.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,200
I was getting...

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,800
I screamed so much on the set of a movie.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm actually giving it. I gave it my all on the set of a movie. I was too

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,200
dedicated.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,280
I got to

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,120
generating hype for the movie right. So let me guess you weren't even so he was

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,960
a man, a scene with the extra. You did go on a date with you. It's nice. I

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,160
wanted to get his info before we left, but they they hustle. He left

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,600
immediately. I wanted to use. I wanted to use him as an extra and something

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,680
was his name. I don't even remember. Damn, that's what I wanted to use him

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920
an extra where you film him and you watching TV at your house.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Yeah, that's fine.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
That's what I'm just saying.

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,480
You guys would have liked him. You guys would have liked him a lot.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,920
I liked him. I talked to him the least out of all of us.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,720
I don't care about extras, man. They don't matter to me.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,040
Me neither, but he proved himself. He showed something. He showed he had what was necessary

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
to be a star.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,880
He's got star power. I have a photo of them on a date if you want to see it.

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,280
Yeah, but we don't have the GoPro today, so you're going to have to go.

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Damn it.

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,440
I'll show it. I'll go. I'll walk. Yeah, you'll walk. It's pretty important to

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,920
see. I would say. Yeah. He was a really nice guy. They genuinely look like

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,320
they're in love. And you had such a connection with this guy that you were

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,080
surrounded by people that you knew, and every time I looked over, you were just

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,880
talking to this guy. I was, but they told me to sit there. I could, what am

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,880
I supposed to do? Just saying, man. Get out of my seat? He's an extra, bro.

43
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,620
Ignore him. Look at those two. Holy fuck, they're in love. I made such a

44
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,100
connection with him. You guys would not get it. That's the thing.

45
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,720
Immediate on on screen chemistry. You would on screen. Can I show you the

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,740
type of thing we were doing in our scene? Yes,

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,500
wow, and this is what he was doing.

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:44,880
He was miming. He was miming too much. One of the extras was had to sign had

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,120
to

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,580
had to sign a check or had like a restaurant check in his part, and I saw

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,820
in between takes. He was taking out like a note and practicing

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,820
and so he had this like it was like it wasn't a note. It was like an old

53
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,100
receipt that he had in his wallet and he practiced signing it like a hundred

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,900
times. It was just covered in his signature over and over and over again.

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,860
That's so funny. Wait, who had to who had to sign stuff? I thought it was

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,780
just him and the other guy. This voice. Dude, it's so bad. It's because I was

57
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,380
doing fine yesterday and then I had to scream at you for the scene. But why are

58
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,340
you also it's not just light on my voice. I'm trying not to like raise it at all

59
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,100
like even laughing hurt. You weren't doing this ten minutes ago when we were

60
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,260
setting up. You sounded normal. I I you're playing it up fine. I don't know. I

61
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,900
just need some water honestly. Okay you want this. Yeah. This one. Yeah it'll fix

62
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,100
it.

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,900
You better now? Yeah, I'm completely better now. I'm so much better now.

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,260
But yeah, I...

65
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,540
I never wanna see another extra again. I'm sick of them. I was running into

66
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,100
them, I was bumping into them. They're rude people. You fell into a woman. I

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,500
fell onto a woman. You fell onto a woman who almost broke her clavicle. She

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,860
acted like it was a big deal.

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,500
It was. You broke a plate.

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,660
I broke a plate on the other side of the room and then I ran into

71
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,500
we're very, very fastly. That's true. That's not a crime. We're describing too

72
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,300
much of the plot. We can't. We signed an NDA. No, we didn't. Yeah, we didn't. No,

73
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,660
we didn't. I'm not. The movie is about I'll tell everything I don't give a

74
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,440
fuck. They didn't pay me. It was Barbie. It's Barbie. Oh my God. Did you hear?

This is not CGI.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,480
I've seen the memes on Instagram that people are buying.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:58,280
They're buying a ticket to Barbie in the morning, and then they sit in the lobby of the theater for an hour to listen to this episode, and then they bought a ticket for whatever the other one is.

95
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,160
And you know what? Here's the best part.

96
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360

129
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,340
What are you doing?

130
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,560
Jimmy is watching. Are you playing watching old? Are you playing an old

131
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,880
episode? Why are you playing an old episode? He's doing his thing. He's

132
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,140
making an alias for this because we move to the Mac.

133
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:27,480
You know, why don't you play? Why don't you play the episode while we're while

134
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,540
we're talking play the previous episode while we're talking because it will

135
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,700
sync up. We'll talk about the same thing at one point. Last night when we were,

136
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,340
there's something about having to be doing something for so long it makes you

137
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,780
go so, so crazy, but. Maybe that's why I did this. Me and Patrick and Alex did

138
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,580
come up with a movie idea. Oh, I heard about this already. Mr. Toilet, yeah,

139
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,740
you were there, you were listening. It was on, it's Toilet Man. Toilet Man. Yeah.

140
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,980
And he's a superhero.

141
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,600
so we were we were we were pitching an idea and no one on set was listening to

142
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,460
us, not the director Joe sound the sound. Let me tell you because what you what

143
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,660
you what you're thinking here is I hear what you're saying. Can I tell you the

144
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,880
truth? Tell me the truth. The truth is that the room was completely and

145
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
utterly silent.

146
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,000
All the extras are sitting, boiling alive, miserable, sitting silent, waiting

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,480
the forty five minutes for them to set up the cameras and every everybody in

148
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,920
the entire room hard. You go toilet man's like oh yeah

149
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,680
and you guys are giggling on the ground. I was lying on his back on the ground.

150
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,860
Alex and Patrick were crouched over him. We couldn't see so it sounded like

151
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,400
they were tickling you because they were laughing so hard that you did not

152
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,160
actually hear the actually what happened, because I tell you what man

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,260
doesn't say. Oh yeah, toilet man is a superhero where something's going on.

154
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,060
Say there's a new kind of nine eleven or something. The bridge is on fire

155
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,400
bridges on fire

156
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,880
I'll save you, but I gotta go really really quickly here. I'll be right back

157
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,600
and then he goes to the bathroom and he gets

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,140
oh wait, wait. I thought that the toilet was the one and he doesn't say oh yeah,

159
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,280
no, the toilet, the toilet says oh

160
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,780
so yeah, that's a

161
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,240
super hero is a guy who any time that they call on him. He says okay, I'm

162
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm going to go handle it and then he runs the nearest bathroom in the

163
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:30,400
you don't like this idea. I like it. I'm telling you what I'm telling you how

164
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,180
everybody in the room felt about it. They liked it even more. There was a

165
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,400
lot really dead. So

166
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,900
quite a firm I've ever heard in my life

167
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:45,680
they're hearing is good. You hear a say with joan and johnny everybody were so

168
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,840
stressed out like trying to set up all the shot. They were like moving all the

169
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,720
around the white people were moving everything. That's why I don't hear

170
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,200
anything like this. Did you guys hear that? So did you guys hear about when

171
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,080
toilet man saves the guy and what he does? No, he says

172
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,420
hold on here. I got to bring you somewhere and then he brings his other.

173
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,140
He brings that guy to the toilet, the bathroom and the toilet says, Oh, you

174
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,120
bought a friend

175
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,240
and then he toilet. I don't even know how the toilet. I didn't we didn't get

176
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,720
Our brains were fucking boiling alive in that restaurant.

177
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
There was no AC in there.

178
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,400
It was just like shut down.

179
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,520
This restaurant's been closed since COVID.

180
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,100
There's just like, like, I was, dude, I was looking around at that place.

181
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,700
They had like things up that like I haven't seen since like, it was like.

182
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,660
Explain what you mean by things you haven't seen.

183
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
Yeah, what are you talking about?

184
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,660
I was looking around this restaurant and there were things I haven't seen.

185
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,000
Such as?

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,500
It was just a, it was a program for March of 2020 and they had so many jams.

187
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,860
the year twenty twenty

188
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,560
something. I haven't seen since twenty twenty, which is a date that says

189
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,520
twenty twenty on yeah and then a bunch of bottles of Aperol.

190
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,300
I haven't seen that since twenty twenty. No, that's all I've seen.

191
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,540
I've seen that often, often, very early and often yeah. We need to make a

192
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,860
movie now. Yeah, we need to make do I know we don't need to make a movie at

193
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,340
all. That was so stressful. Shut up bitch. It seems easy thing in the world.

194
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,300
that seems it's a way to

195
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,700
would say that the extra would say it was easy. The guys who have to run into

196
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,300
women really, really fast. The guy had to roller skate all day. The guy had to

197
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,900
scream

198
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,100
had to scream.

199
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,700
And what you have to do count on your fingers silently. No, that was what the

200
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,200
other guys ideas from the floor. No, I got to hang out with my best friend.

201
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Yeah, exactly. You would think it's easy. Yeah, when your your job was hanging

202
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,560
out with your best friend. Our job was to pretend that we hate each other,

203
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,280
yeah, which is hard and to go on the floor. He had to spit in my face fifty

204
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,360
times. I spit I do. There's so much spit on your face. I know yeah, so sorry.

205
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,640
He did something where he screamed at me and I was I was drenched in spit. By

206
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,040
the end of it, he was completely filled with so you guys feel on the strike

207
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,280
then. Well,

208
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,800
as we were saying yesterday as future SAG, after a future SAG, WGA and

209
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,080
directors, guild members, as future triple threats and future Oscars,

210
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,360
Oscars pending, Oscars pending kind of style guys. Yeah man, this strike is

211
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,420
killing me. This strike is I explain the whole strike to the my extra friend. He

212
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,340
was like so what's going on? You don't explain it. He would have walked out.

213
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,880
Yeah, well he didn't because he loved his company. Oh you're right. If it was

214
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,020
anybody but you, he would have walked out. Yeah, he was also the only person at

215
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,240
our table group who got paid.

216
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,180
no, you get paid thirty nope, didn't get paid anything.

217
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,140
They walked over, they handed him a lot of money and then they walked away a

218
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,820
lot for yeah. I mean I couldn't see how much it was. I just saw him hand of

219
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,600
money. It was four of us. What would you call it? Two bills? I couldn't see how

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,120
many it was. It wasn't it was a five on the outside, so I knew it was a small

221
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,840
amount because they wouldn't have a five in it, but it was it was out. It was a

222
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,660
it look like it was. It was a put to they put put three tens in a rubber band,

223
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,680
but no, I did not get paid at all. So well, think about that whenever you're

224
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,260
watching that thing, you have drops on Vimeo. Do you have any interest in

225
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,040
watching or in

226
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,900
pursuing the extra life from now on? Honestly, do you think you could be an

227
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,180
extra? I think I'm going to career. I think I'm going to lead an extra strike

228
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,620
just for the extras. Yeah, that makes sense of the injustice. I face a silent

229
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,500
strike yep to show you're also because we're we just stand in the background of

230
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,340
the actors strike

231
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,440
we hold signs and we go.

232
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,260
This is an amazing idea of my die. You guys can add the whole the whole sag

233
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,500
straight. You guys can sit in the back, but no, I would never do that again. I

234
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,320
wish I didn't do it. It's so well. It sucked. It was that bad. I was there

235
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,820
sitting for five hours. I didn't get paid. Of course it sucked. You got

236
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,720
like being around my friend. I didn't eat any of pizza. I ate before. I

237
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,180
you have the option to eat. I'm going to eat there's a hot room for five hours.

238
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,820
There's pizza, there's chips, I ate some rose, got paid in trail, my

239
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:12,080
trail mix and you made your money back. You made your money back and you got

240
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,980
trail mix. They didn't even compensate for me for my train fair. Can you

241
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,160
believe that? No, they compensated you with cookies and pizza and trail mix and

242
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,720
you everything the money was on the table and you just decided not to take

243
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,220
the money was on the table in front of a different guy. I didn't get it. The

244
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,400
pizza was on the table and you said no, no, no, no, no. I'm already so full of probably

245
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
peanut butter and jelly.

246
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,980
Well, there's only it was four people that we knew and then a bunch of Craigslist extras

247
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,820
so that it didn't look like it was a restaurant full of young people.

248
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,140
Which what's the problem with that? Why can't you have a restaurant filled with young? Well,

249
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,060
you got to have old people in a restaurant. I haven't seen an old person at a restaurant

250
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,060
in years.

251
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Yeah, that's true. They don't go out much anymore because of COVID and the current pandemic.

252
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,300
I need to stop going to restaurants and eating. I'm getting as fat as a balloon.

253
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,820
You think you're getting fat? Look at me. I look disgusting.

254
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,460
That's your own choice because of your hair, your head shave.

255
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,260
I look like a complete cow.

256
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,760
No, you do look like an animal though. I've been trying to figure out what animal you look like with no beard.

257
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,660
I've never had a beard. I've always just had the mustache.

258
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,160
You had a beard.

259
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,860
I did have a beard. There was that time.

260
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,500
I was, I grew, I forgot that I had like a huge beard when I first met you guys.

261
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,700
Yeah, your beard turns orange.

262
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
It wasn't so huge.

263
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
No, a big Santa Claus beard, I remember.

264
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,500
No, there is, yeah, I had like, like young Santa from like year without a Santa Claus.

265
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,740
It's what I looked like for a little bit.

266
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
I would say a beard.

267
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
I wouldn't say huge beard.

268
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,540
It was, no, there's a photo I have where it was poking out the sides.

269
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,620
It's a type of sriracha out of sriracha ramen.

270
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,620
That's what I think of when I think of huge beard.

271
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
Yeah, that's true.

272
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Yeah, I guess you're right.

273
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
Yeah.

274
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,740
You just have...

275
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,260
I mean you guys met... when you guys met me I either had like a beard or just was clean-shaven.

276
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,380
I didn't have a mustache for...

277
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,260
Either an air on your face or you didn't, straight up.

278
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,500
No, beard is different from mustache.

279
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,020
But the beard got a mustache.

280
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,740
The beard is 75... or mustache is like 25%.

281
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Mutton chops is 25.

282
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,020
And then if you do some weird goatee, that's 50.

283
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,420
But then a beard is 100.

284
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:27,960
beard, mustache, and mutton chops, that's 50. One mutton chop and then that's 33.

285
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
That's 33.

286
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,440
You're the only one of us who can grow like a really full, thick beard. Have you done

287
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,680
all the different combinations? Have you done... Has anyone ever tried just this?

288
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
I had chin strap.

289
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Just the cheeks?

290
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
No.

291
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
No, that's a good idea.

292
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Right? That's a good idea.

293
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Maybe I'll grow that out.

294
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
That is a good idea.

295
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Just the cheeks. No sideburns.

296
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
No sideburns. Yeah, exactly.

297
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,840
no side, no side burns. Yeah, exactly make it just two circles, beards, just

298
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,980
the cheeks beard. That's a good idea.

299
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,240
You see nobody nobody's done this. You can't even find this shit exist on

300
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,000
Google. Yeah, this is a new style that I just came up with. It's just the

301
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,760
cheeks beard.

302
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,080
Yeah, but you could try that. I think it could be called. It could be here's a

303
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,400
new style. I bet somebody locks. I bet somebody has done this style before

304
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,880
Maybe so it's like you grow a really thick mustache and then you shave a

305
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,480
bunch of lines into it. Yeah. So it's like a bunch of I'm not I'll say Charlie

306
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,200
Chaplin, a bunch of Charlie Chaplin mustaches next to each other.

307
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,560
Mini Hitlers. Well I wasn't going to say that but yeah.

308
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,960
You could get that. Like five for a little bit. Five Hitlers stacked back to back to back.

309
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Back to back to back. Five Hitlers stacked and then back to back to back. I did have the

310
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,680
wharf for a little like when I had shaved it. The wharf? I did keep the wharf. I think

311
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,180
I think the whole thing's a war between the beard and the mustache.

312
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
That's how I understand it.

313
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,180
But I had just right here, like how Worf has his fish.

314
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,180
I don't know who Worf is.

315
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Worf from Star Trek.

316
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,180
He's a Klingon.

317
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,180
You had scars on your face?

318
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,180
No.

319
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,180
Like a seal?

320
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Is he a Klingon?

321
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,180
Pfft.

322
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,180
You cannot say that.

323
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
Why?

324
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
He's got all this stuff on his face.

325
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
The scars.

326
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Klingons don't have scars.

327
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
They just have a ridged head.

328
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,180
They have gills or something.

329
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
They don't have gills.

330
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
Oh.

331
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Excuse you.

332
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,580
have gills. They're fishes. They are not fishes. They look like they have gills

333
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:13,980
to me.

334
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,460
What? I don't know anything about Star Trek. I have no interest in Star Trek.

335
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,300
Me neither. Yeah. I watched Star Trek and I was like, "Oh, I guess I could

336
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,340
probably get into this, but I'm not going to." It's all of the worst parts

337
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,140
of sci-fi of like, you have to... What? You're supposed to recycle? That's why

338
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,620
you watch this show? I just like any show where it's a hundred episodes and

339
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,020
it's from the 70s. I think that's the best, always the best TV show. But you

340
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,340
gotta watch Deep Space Nine. I feel like you could get into that. I'm not

341
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:43,340
watch any of it. I'm sure I would like it but it's not going to happen. It could have happened

342
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,420
years ago. You've got to get into it when you're like 6 years old. I just don't have

343
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,060
the mental gumption anymore to watch that many episodes of anything. It's too much man.

344
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,620
When it was on Netflix I tried to do a Deep Space Nine rewatch and I think I got to like

345
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:04,900
halfway through season 3 and I was like Jesus Christ this is a slog. This is just so hard

346
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,460
to get through this. They didn't even get, Worf wasn't even there yet.

347
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,580
They used to make 50 episodes every fucking season of every show.

348
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,860
Now it's like, oh, we can make 8 piece of shit episodes.

349
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,460
Uh huh. But it used to be 25 bangers.

350
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
25 huge bangers.

351
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
25 almost bangers.

352
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,020
25 of the best episodes you've ever seen.

353
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
I remember watching X-Files.

354
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
Really?

355
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
That show was so fire.

356
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,340
There's a lot of episodes. I've never watched the whole thing.

357
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,420
I've only seen the movie.

358
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,300
The nice thing about X-Files, that's one of the nice things about a show where there's

359
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,180
a million episodes is there's usually...

360
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,920
of the movie a point where it gets really, really bad. Yeah, everyone says

361
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,140
you're allowed to stop and you know you can stop twin peaks like episode one

362
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,920
never seen twin peaks either. I mean even like the the Simpsons, it's like

363
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,900
there's a lot of good stuff, but I know that there's an end in sight. Yeah, I

364
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,220
know that there's a point where I just want to make it will make me want to

365
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,000
stop. Yeah, it's not even like I'm gonna be like okay. I have to tear myself

366
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,880
away. It's like I'll keep watching. I'm really like this. I can't do this.

367
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,780
This is really sneaks up on you too, because like yeah, it's not there's not

368
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,560
say consensus. This is where you should stop watching some people. I feel like

369
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,240
people say it's season nine. Some people stop it like season twelve or whatever it

370
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,340
really is. So it somewhere in there you go. Oh yeah, I'm done. I'm going to go

371
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,320
to the first season ten and you watch like a season four episode and you're

372
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,560
like oh my God yeah. I didn't even notice this was happening. Yeah, there

373
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,040
really is a great that occurs with that show when you're watching a creep side

374
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,300
show Bob he's far from a creep. He's a complete yeah. I would say Mo is the

375
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,020
creep of the Simpsons man.

376
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,020
He is a creep.

377
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,520
Moe is the one who's always trying to look at Marge's panties.

378
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Moe is not suicidal.

379
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,720
If Moe was suicidal, there's no such thing as suicidal.

380
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
There's no such thing?

381
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,460
No, if you were suicidal you would kill yourself.

382
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,200
And Moe's still alive.

383
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
For now.

384
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,520
Doesn't he try to kill himself every episode?

385
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
No.

386
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Yeah, that's the Easter egg isn't it?

387
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,240
No, that's not the movie detail.

388
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,040
The Easter egg is they have one big scar right there on Moe's wrists.

389
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,760
Oh, it's very sad. What would a Simpson scar even look like

390
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,160
Harry Potter?

391
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,540
That's actually a good that's the that's the exact way to find it. Did he leave?

392
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,820
I think maybe he left. Oh, that's okay. He left and he left just the cheeks

393
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,440
beard up.

394
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,780
Oh, he's here. He's alive. Oh, can you search Simpson's Harry Potter and see

395
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,220
just what color the scar is?

396
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,520
Simpson's Harry Potter. I mean it'll be red, but I just want to see what it

397
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,160
looks like. Oh, it's well on the pig. Well, that's not he's not yellow.

398
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,860
I need to see a yellow fell like a Simpson right here. The second, but

399
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,660
yeah, so there you go. That's basically not even anything that look like

400
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,660
little easy words. That's a it does catch up. Yeah, that is a catch up scar.

401
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,620
That's that's there is what is it? Simpsons do better with the guy, the guy,

402
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,920
the what Nelson's dad snake or was that his name? Is it snake? It is snake is the criminal

403
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,480
guy. Yeah, he is. Yeah, I think he's Nelson's dad. I didn't know that. I didn't know that

404
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,680
an Easter egg. Isn't it like an implied thing that he's Nelson's dad? I have no idea. I

405
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,880
don't follow the Easter eggs on most shows. Yeah. I'm going to say here's what we need

406
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,680
to make a movie. Guys, hop you don't follow the Easter eggs in hop. Don't even know what

407
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,680
you're talking about. It's the Russell Brand movie where he's a rabbit.

408
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Peter Rabbit. Here's what we need to make a movie guys. It's about Easter.

409
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,680
We need to make a movie so that we can add movie details

410
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,680
to the movie. Yes. We need to do that. I've been trying. I've been working

411
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,680
on the movie details for the podcast, adding all sorts of background

412
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,680
stuff. Like what? For instance, in this episode people may

413
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,680
not have noticed the entire run time I'm holding a gun.

414
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,180
That is actually a movie detail. Here's an Easter egg. I set this up for Cameron's

415
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,280
birthday present. And it stayed up. And it stayed up. And we haven't touched it

416
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,960
for some reason. I think that that's probably why, you know, between Barbie and

417
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,860
Oppenheimer, me, I'm gonna go for the movie detail movie. I'm gonna go see

418
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,680
Oppenheimer. Yeah. Because there are going to be so many details in that fucking

419
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,200
movie, you won't even believe it. It's historical. They're gonna hide.

420
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,840
died. Do you think that they're going to put Hitler in the movie straight? Yes,

421
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,240
who plays him? I don't think they will. That person right now should be

422
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
blackballed from Hollywood for playing him in 2023.

423
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,960
If he's in it, I do you think that is Hitler? Hitler's kind of the same role

424
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,640
as Santa in movies. Do you know what I mean? Where like you just have to look

425
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,720
fifty percent like him yeah and then you don't really say much yeah. It's

426
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,960
what it's it's yeah. You have the very recognizable costume. Yeah, you don't

427
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,720
even really have to look like him. It's just like the Santa impersonators to

428
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,720
where it's like half a year. You're not working. Taiko, a tt barely. I mean

429
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,800
probably he's again. Well, I guess he is at the probably the fifty percent he's

430
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,320
fifty percent yeah. He looked fifty percent like he's halfway between

431
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,120
looking like Hitler and not looking like Hitler. Yeah, he's a man at the time.

432
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,160
So it was pretty much most men look like Adolf Hitler. You could definitely be young Indiana

433
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:20,760
Jones versus young Hitler right now. And it yeah is not good for me. Why? That's a role.

434
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,740
Yeah, that is a role. What was that? What was the song we were making up about acting?

435
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,620
You can tone out. Oh, you can tone out extra. Oh, even though I was the one who was making

436
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,580
up this song in the first place? I ain't afraid to no roll. Was that you made that up? We were

437
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,460
all singing that together. Yeah, it was Ghostbusters. I came up with I ain't afraid to no roll.

438
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,500
Acting makes me feel good. Acting makes me feel good. But then I came up with I ain't

439
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,460
afraid to no roll. I ain't afraid to no roll. Being an actor has got to be the blessing

440
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,740
of my entire life at this point. It has changed a lot about me. It's hard. Change your voice,

441
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,140
change your face. When I go home, when I go home, can you get me a coffee right now? Change

442
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,640
I open my door.

443
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Well, that's empty.

444
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
I open my door.

445
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
That's what I think of actors.

446
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
I get them empty coffees.

447
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
I want to be an actor so much.

448
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
That's exactly what I wanted.

449
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
That I want to live in a trailer.

450
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Yeah.

451
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
I would want to live in a trailer.

452
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,640
I want to live with all the actors and with all the trailers.

453
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Brendan Fraser is one of them.

454
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Yeah, he's in a trailer.

455
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
He's in a trailer.

456
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,640
If you're a real actor, you're sitting in a trailer park.

457
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Your home is your trailer.

458
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,640
You guys are going to think it's all fun and games being an actor until I Me Too you.

459
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,020
you will. I hate as an actor,

460
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,480
me too. I do not like me to

461
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,360
or I don't like the stuff. How do you even say that I don't like the I don't

462
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,120
like that comes before I don't like the movement happen. No, not the movement. I

463
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,520
don't like I like that. No, you're supposed to you like the movement. I

464
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,280
love the movement before it. I hate I love the players hate the game,

465
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,580
which which team or maybe reverse. I don't know. I just don't scratch that

466
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,640
okay. I don't like speaking. Okay, I don't like the scratching that goes on

467
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,520
in me too and the what's on changing what is me to I don't know. Are you

468
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,780
talking about? I don't know what that is man. I'm a new actor. I missed all

469
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,820
this shit. I just started acting yesterday.

470
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,400
I don't know anything about any of that. I know TMZ Entertainment Weekly.

471
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,120
That's kind of Mario Lopez, Mario Lopez tonight, Lopez tonight,

472
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,600
These are the only things that I know. Okay. I don't know anything about anything that happened

473
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,600
in 2017. I do know one thing happened in 2017. What's that? Dunkirk. Exactly. Christopher

474
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,320
Nolan. I have a movie mind. I never saw that movie. Me neither. You know what I forgot?

475
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,280
Let's watch it right now. We were talking about the Christopher Nolan movies. A movie

476
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,280
I just remembered this morning that he made was Insomnia. Have you seen that? You mean

477
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,640
Inception? No, we were just talking about this, but I don't remember. Insomnie's Al Pacino

478
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,880
and Robin Williams is a serial killer? I had never heard of it. Pierce told me about it

479
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,960
for the first time like two days before you talked about it. It's so good. It's an amazing

480
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,360
movie. I gotta check it out. It's like 50 or 60 hours long. It's very, very long, which

481
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,160
is I think good. I like long ones. Robin Williams? Yeah, Robin Williams is a bad guy. He's a

482
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,980
great bad guy. Yeah. Yeah, he was a pretty bad guy. No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm

483
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,280
I'm saying that he was a good actor when he acted as a bad fella.

484
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,780
Uh-huh.

485
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,280
You know.

486
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,780
Not so much anymore.

487
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
I think he was great.

488
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Mrs. Doubtfire, that's a villain role.

489
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
That's an easy role.

490
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Anyone can play that.

491
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
Have you ever...

492
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,780
That's a layup.

493
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,780
Have you ever considered that he would go to fucking jail if he did that in real life?

494
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,280
Those are the actions of a psychotic man.

495
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
If he did what?

496
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,780
If he did all that Mr. Doubtfire.

497
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
Somebody should...

498
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:50,780
And if it was called Mr. Doubtfire, there would be a changing scene where the sun walks in

499
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,600
in. Wow. Wait, why? If it was called Mr. Doubtfire? If it was called Mr. Doubtfire and the roles

500
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:06,000
were reversed, it would be ultimately so sexualized. They probably do want to do a gender-swapped

501
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,060
Mrs. Doubtfire. Honestly, they're probably going to have a new Doubtfire movie where

502
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:17,540
it's a they/them parent turning into a they/them man. Wow! And it's called just Doubtfire.

503
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,900
Wow. That's the stupidest way to figure out your name for your fake maid.

504
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,220
Mrs. Doubtfire. He saw the word Doubtfire on a newspaper.

505
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:34,620
What? That's not where is that surname even come from? Doubtfire? I've never

506
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,420
seen that movie on either. Yeah, that's how he gets the last name. Doubtfire. He

507
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,460
just reads it somewhere. He read. That's how everybody came up with names. He

508
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,020
he sees the word doubt fire in the eighties and nineties, the

509
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:51,820
people named Michael went up like seven thousand percent because of Michael

510
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,800
Jackson, Michael Jordan and Michael Tyson, Michael Bublé and Michael Bublé

511
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,420
later on in the decade, but there's no everybody just steals and speaking of

512
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,940
gender swaps, unless you make a Michael Bublé, Santa buddy, the way to

513
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,680
the way to get out of this name cycle where everyone just takes all the

514
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,100
copies all the names. You just got to come up with a brand new name that no

515
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,440
one's ever been named before. Yeah, exactly. Let's put a bunch of letters

516
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,760
down. Hebe. Yeah. I can name my kid that.

517
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,880
Craig. Pay LeBron. Name your kid Pay LeBron.

518
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,500
Pay Patrick, Caleb, Cameron. Oh, okay. Pay LeBron. Pay LeBron. Pay LeBron. Pay

519
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,720
LeBron no money to name your kid.

520
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,920
and he's not getting a red cent for your that kid's name. You're going to have

521
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,180
the people are like, oh, pay LeBron. Was that like a like what you combined

522
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:51,980
like Patrick and LeBron? No, it's for three guys. Actually, instead of oh

523
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,720
wait, that's our names combined is pay LeBron. Whoa. Yeah, I just realized that

524
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,680
you and me could be LeBron. If you mixed our names together. Yeah, I don't care

525
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,140
about the first part, but you and me being LeBron is actually so it's the

526
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,100
the last the letters of three of both spells LeBron, but what's the first

527
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,860
came care

528
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,260
came to

529
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,660
LeBron comecca LeBron comecca. This is an amazing revelation yeah.

530
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,480
Okay, we could definitely do a name of a name. Combine

531
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:32,040
LeBron comecca is a perfect name yeah, and if we added Patrick, I mean Rick is

532
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,680
already in there. Yeah, but I just be the middle name LeBron comecca LeBron

533
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,800
Patrick comecca

534
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,240
If you add all of our names together, we already have that.

535
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
You are getting so many phone calls today.

536
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,520
It's my credit card company.

537
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,880
Well, answer them.

538
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,160
They're trying to give you a new line of credit.

539
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,320
They're trying to give me more credit?

540
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
You think that's why?

541
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
I think so.

542
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Not because I didn't pay?

543
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,940
I want to have a...

544
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,480
Everybody I know has a credit card has like a $15,000 limit.

545
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I have a $2,000 limit.

546
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
I have a $1,500 limit.

547
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
I think mine is $6,000.

548
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
$6,000?

549
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
How do you get up there, man?

550
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Mine was a student credit card.

551
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,440
get up there man. Mine was a student credit card. You have to pay your credit card? Yeah.

552
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,440
What? That sucks man. That sucks. I fucking hate it. In college I just maxed out two credit

553
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,240
cards and I still haven't paid them. I just left them alone. Yeah. But my credit is not

554
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,080
that bad. It's like $680 or something. Oh that's good. Yeah it's okay. I don't know

555
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,160
how that happened. Mine is $597. Really? Yeah. I'm honestly surprised it's that high. Yeah.

556
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,080
I thought that you'd be in the 400. No, no, no, no. I have 10,000 credit. You don't have

557
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:43,760
10,000 credit. 10,000. Your FICO is 10,000. I don't believe you. I looked it up. You can't

558
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,600
look it up. I googled it. You can't google your own. I googled Cameron's credit score.

559
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,560
And the info box popped up and it said 10,000. Hey FICO, throw me a damn bone, you dog. Because

560
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,260
so it sounds like leave me alone. Oh, because it sounds like Fido bones

561
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,900
throw me a freaking bone.

562
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,360
It's because it's one letter off from Fido and dogs throw bones. That's why

563
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,520
saying that if you had two dogs with each other, Fico and Fido, well, it

564
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,600
doesn't matter what their names are. If you had two dogs with each other, if

565
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,040
they what does that mean if they were in the same area? Okay, they

566
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:23,300
hypothetically fetch each other forever. No, no, that's called Fido's paradox and

567
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,000
you've proven it to be false. Really? But if you had a cat and a dog, the cat could put

568
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,320
a ball on the counter top and the cat would swat it off and it was a bouncy ball so it

569
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,040
could go down like maybe you got a railway style apartment, you go down the hallway,

570
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,040
the dog could bring it back to the, well then the dog would have to put the ball back on

571
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,280
the counter top. Well then you put peanut butter on the counter, easy. Yeah. I've been

572
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,080
watching. Peanut butter is the name of the cat though. Oh well that doesn't change too

573
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,180
much. Yeah, it's kind of the same. It doesn't affect anything. I've been

574
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,980
watching a bunch of videos of people having pet. What am I doing?

575
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,820
Now you, sorry, hold on. Let me think about. You've been watching videos? I've

576
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,980
been watching videos. Let me try this one more time. You just chill on me. I've

577
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,580
been watching videos of people who have pet raccoons. Oh yeah, me too. Really?

578
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,220
Yeah. The, well, there's the people with the pet raccoons, the pet raccoons

579
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,740
like open up like the bathrooms and the bathroom door and stuff. Because they're

580
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,780
they open the sink and then yeah. They have monkey hands. They have opposable thumbs.

581
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,580
And then there's the guy who feeds like, what is he fed 200 hot dogs to a bunch of raccoons

582
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,740
that live in his backyard. I didn't see that one. That one's good. He sits in a chair and

583
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:39,900
is holding like a Kirkland signature thing of hot dogs. Here you go. It made me wonder

584
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,060
why we. That raccoon on the Instagram account called raccoon Obama. Why have we not fully

585
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,220
domesticated the raccoon. People are trying to it's like the skunk where it's

586
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,100
too much of a hassle, but a rat, but it's not because a skunk has a bomb,

587
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,900
but we're going to make ten hundred different dogs that can look like

588
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,300
raccoons are like smarter than dogs. They're like somewhere between a dog

589
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,060
and a cat. Kind of they can be. I don't think you want a smarter one. What

590
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,580
like part like our raccoons like a type of like I want to play. Are they part

591
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,340
of the canid family? Are they part of like the feline? I think if I had to

592
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,340
guess I would say they're a mustelid.

593
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
A mustelid?

594
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,860
But that's a complete guess. Those are weasels and that type of thing.

595
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,500
Oh that makes sense. Yeah but you could have a weasel and a ferret as a pet. I heard that

596
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,060
ferrets are disgusting to own.

597
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,580
Ferrets are mean and horrible and disgusting and they kill themselves.

598
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
And they jump.

599
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Yeah.

600
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
I hate jumpers.

601
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,260
They're snakes. They're part of the snake family.

602
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,860
I want to pet a mongoose.

603
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
No you don't.

604
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
I don't really even know what a mongoose is.

605
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,460
Mongoose are snake eaters.

606
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,780
I know, I've seen videos of mongoose do stuff.

607
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,300
know what kind of mongoose I want? The bicycle that I had as a kid.

608
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,340
It's a terrible bike. It is. It's the worst. Yeah, those are not good. Yeah.

609
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,180
But a raccoon you can like, they really are just like little monkeys, but they're

610
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,460
cheaper than monkeys. And they're not as dangerous because they can be, I don't

611
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,780
even think they have claws. I think they just have hands. I saw this video of this

612
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,500
guy. He's got a pet raccoon and it's somebody filming him. He's like at a

613
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Dollar General or something. And he's holding onto the raccoon by its scruff.

614
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,860
and then he goes, "Watch this," puts it down

615
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,340
and then runs away and the raccoon runs towards him.

616
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,620
Then he walks back to the car and the raccoon

617
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,540
is like right behind him, like his companion,

618
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,620
like his follower.

619
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,380
- Are raccoons more like predisposed to rabies

620
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,900
or is it just 'cause they're a wild animal?

621
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,620
- I think it's just 'cause they're a wild animal.

622
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,460
- Yeah. - Yeah.

623
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,660
I don't think they can just get it from chilling out.

624
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,500
- Yeah.

625
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,060
How does an animal get, it's only if you just get bitten

626
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,860
by something with rabies still?

627
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,420
Or what's the original source?

628
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,220
Yeah, I don't know, but I think I think it's just you got to be bitten. Yeah, I

629
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,100
am scratched or whatever some shit like that. I found out yesterday that mad cow

630
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,780
disease. It comes from

631
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,380
they were feeding cows. Yeah, yeah, pre on disease. Oh, it's the same thing as

632
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,740
like as Kuru. Yeah, yeah, it's cow Kuru and you love. You didn't know that you

633
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,300
talk. I didn't know that's how they I knew it was a pre on disease, but I

634
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,340
thought that it was I thought it was a pre on disease in humans. He's a

635
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,740
obsessed with eating it, but it's originally when's the last time I said

636
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,620
the word Kuru. I only know I only know about it because of you one okay, and I

637
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,660
think we've talked about it multiple times and that makes me obsessed great

638
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:27,120
okay. So he wants now is so bad now it's completely abnormal for a doctor to know

639
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,700
about diseases. You didn't scared now you're talking about getting given

640
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,920
people Kuru and talk about giving you dry firing this gun. Yeah, I'm not

641
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,980
shooting at his gun at anybody dry firing a revolver at me and talking about

642
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,340
who don't know what you're. I think he's a mad doctor. I think that your new

643
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,580
name is big iron.

644
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:52,580
That's what I'll call you from now on big iron yeah. That'd be cool. What if

645
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,900
he puts the gun away? He's still but he still had it yeah. That's true. Yeah,

646
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,420
you know just because Batman takes the mask off doesn't well yeah. I become

647
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,740
the first one. Okay, well

648
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,340
there could have been a better example. I just not that smart just a nickname

649
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,720
just basically just because Michael Phelps gets out of the pool. Don't make

650
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,640
him not Michael Phelps. Don't make him a swimmer or he is. Don't not make him a

651
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,600
swimmer. Don't yeah,

652
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,220
yeah,

653
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,940
that's a good one. That's a good

654
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,820
turn. Crazy that any any mad chef could sprinkle brain into your food and give

655
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,980
you a day is crazy. If you do die, if you eat brain, well, if you're a human

656
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,820
brain, you could get a pre on disease. It's very unsafe. That's why it's not

657
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,260
safe to eat human flesh is because all the diseases in human flesh or human

658
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,820
disease. Yeah, because most humans eat like Twizzlers and stuff and I've been

659
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,120
saying it's more because I've been saying it. Y'all the same shit. Wash

660
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,380
your brain. Yeah, wash your brain before you wash the brain and these these

661
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,580
people take not seasoning. If you're eating brain, you need to wash that shit

662
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,660
you know, wash soap with soap. Get the get the Kuru out of that scrub. You get

663
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,980
the scrub brush. Didn't somebody do the temple of doom monkey brain thing in

664
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,840
real life. No, I was watching a movie. Never mind the temple of doom. Yeah, he

665
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,820
was watching temple of doom debunked. No, it's from that movie faces of death.

666
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,920
Oh yeah, I don't I have no interest in eating a brain. Yeah, I don't think

667
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,860
brain looks like the worst thing to eat.

668
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,180
It can't be good. I mean, it looks like it looks like anything that grows in a

669
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,520
body and looks like a vegetable. I don't want to eat that. You think a brain

670
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,580
looks like cauliflower. It looks like cauliflower. I don't want that. I

671
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,740
especially when you cut it. I feel like the texture is probably just gross.

672
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,820
Yeah, probably jello-ish. Yeah, I feel like it's... No, because I feel like... I

673
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,880
was going to say it's probably like eating an eel, but I feel like... I mean,

674
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,920
British people eat eels all the time. I've eaten... Is a nerve microscopic?

675
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,200
Yes. I don't know. 'Cause a brain is just a bunch of nerves, right? So would

676
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,080
it be like stringy? I don't think it's stringy. A brain is just a bunch of

677
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,940
nerds, the smartest part of the body. A nerd is a bunch of brains. Yep, you

678
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,740
I mean, that's what I meant. Oh, a brief history of people eating brain that

679
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,420
actually looks kind of good, though, because it's got fried KFC seasoning on

680
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,980
yeah. I guess I would eat. I guess I would eat a fried eat that brain

681
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,540
nuggets. Yeah, I mean, I'd eat anything in a nugget. Yeah, they're probably

682
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,740
probably you probably do eat. My God, thinking about eating it out of

683
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,460
somebody's head. That doesn't sound very good. That is the scariest thing I've

684
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,980
ever seen in my life. A brain eating a burger. Yes. Why

685
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:39,700
think

686
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,800
look up what I want to buy this in it like it's called 16 by 20 printed it's

687
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,860

00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,340

691
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,060
not even it doesn't matter to see his portfolio oh yeah oh it is a lot of

692
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:13,700
got fast food stuff. Oh, fast food consumption. Oh God, that burger looks

693
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,180
too juicy. Is this fetish material? The burger, the seeds are flying off the

694
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,180
sesame bun. What are you doing? Eating a burger so vigorously that the seeds fly

695
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,620
off. God damn, that's insane. The seeds go everywhere. Oh my God, this one is

696
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,380
supposed to be Trump. A massive man in a suit and red tie screams. That's

697
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,060
definitely Trump. Guys, DeSantis is finished. Yeah, is he done? Is that Hungry

698
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,740
video. We already talked about it on the very last episode. Yeah, so we talked

699
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:45,000
about it and then, but since then, his approval rating has plummeted. It's

700
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,380
plummeted. It's been plummeting, man. It's sad because I thought we were about

701
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,260
to see, well, it's not that sad because... I thought politics was above this,

702
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,560
to be honest. Above, above, like, just the most base,

703
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,420
pointless ad hominem, just dragging people down for videos that aren't even

704
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,480
hate your dragging people through the mud. I hate that you're saying you

705
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,280
mean campaigns. You know we move past this as a civilization. You're saying

706
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,440
you think people are opposed to things that are base. Meanwhile, everyone is

707
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,340
calling people like De Santis and Trump. They're saying based when nobody is

708
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,660
anymore. The no one's talking about it anymore, but they're using the word

709
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,440
crazy cringe. I now it is cringe nowadays. Nowadays base is good.

710
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:37,360
I tried listening to an interview with RFK Jr. I'd never heard him really talk that much

711
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,560
before. Does he talk like a Kennedy? No. Really? No. He has some fucked up voice. He's like

712
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,880
"I'm a J.D." He's got the worst voice I've ever heard in my life. I don't care. I don't

713
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,960
know anything about his policies. I don't know what he believes. He truly cannot be

714
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,920
the president. There's no way that anybody would ever take anyone seriously who's like

715
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,120
happy. I don't think there's any risk of anyone taking him seriously. Even

716
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,620
he doesn't even have that fucked up stupid Kennedy voice that everyone

717
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,520
loves. He stole Cheryl Hines from Larry David

718
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,960
in

719
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:16,840
is going to be so remember that Cheryl Hines was rightfully Larry David's wife

720
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,440
based on the TV show. They should have been married in real life. He owned her.

721
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,820
he only you're like you are doing a job as a wife. The man gets first right of

722
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,980
first refusal and absolutely to anybody you want to marry and that's keep

723
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,840
talking about this and keep pointing the gun at the camp and if you are playing a

724
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,900
wife in a movie during the day, you can't divorce him when you go home at

725
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,440
night. You're still the wife. Yep, yep, yep, yep, until that movie wraps, you're

726
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,840
so I and if you're playing a husband,

727
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,720
you can have a second job where you're not the husband and turn that shit

728
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,520
sideways and that job can be sitting on the couch and watching your shows.

729
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,680
Yep, and if I'm ever as a new actor, if I am ever in some kind of role where

730
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,040
I have a wife, she is making me all sorts of delicious meals. You are making

731
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,200
me crème brûlée and when I need an Epsom salt bath, guess who's drawing

732
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,600
huh my wife. If you're my wife and when I need an Epson printer ink cartridge

733
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,240
type sixty seven guess who's retrieving that is going to staples because I

734
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,480
don't want to talk to the lady who works at the weird ink kiosk. I think

735
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,960
she has a crush on me yeah and I don't want to see her again and you're my

736
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,840
wife you and you know you know I am easily tempted. You don't know how I

737
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,440
know. I have a temptation. You know how I am. You know that that if the

738
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,420
the staple, the ink lady at staples. If she looks at me and says I'm going to

739
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,500
fold, I'm going to make an ink down here and I need you to clean it up. I'm

740
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,620
going to go to the back room of staples. You got to get you got to be not even

741
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:58,260
see a girl and a reflection of glass. I have to kill myself. Yeah, I'll fuck a

742
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:07,420
man again. I'll fuck a man again again. No yeah, I will. I'll fuck him. I don't

743
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,160
please me. If you don't go back to being gay, that's so funny. That's that's an

744
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,640
ultimatum in the in the sixties. That was a definitely an ultimatum or threat in

745
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,200
the sixties for show is if you don't if you if you don't be my good wife, then

746
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm going to I'm going back to the old me. I'm going back to the old me. I'm

747
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,040
switching it up on him. I'm going to show the world. I'm reversing all of that

748
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,560
conversion therapy. Yeah, I'm converting the conversion. Should we make a

749
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,900
documentary where we all go through conversion therapy and see what happens

750
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,640
to us? Yeah, like yeah, just for fun. I mean for for a document, journalism,

751
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,180
yeah, but if you think journalism is fun now, then you've obviously never been a

752
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,640
journalist. But that that would just be that would just be a documentary of us

753
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,020
where we like go into the clockwork orange room where they're showing us

754
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,420
porn. They don't show you porn in conversion. There they show you God.

755
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,100
yeah, they show you God yeah. The whole thing is that you with electrical

756
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,620
impulse. Oh, they show you gay porn and then zap you. I think yeah, they show

757
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,420
I think that's probably what it is.

758
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:21,100
That's how I would design it. If I was the guy, you know, I'm realizing now that

759
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,260
I genuinely did believe that that was I think that I don't know you gave that

760
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,460
was part of conversion. I think I don't think they zap you as a punishment. I

761
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,420
think they try to zap your brain. I think they do like the electroshock

762
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,460
shock therapy type of thing. It is terrible. Oh, I thought that's what

763
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,460
electroshock therapy was. Was they show you gays to affect your brain chemical?

764
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,460
They do that for people with like severe depression and stuff. They use magnets

765
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,460
and electricity. It's like a type of... Oh wait, magnets isn't... Magnets is

766
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,460
electroshock therapy? No, it's... I've heard about the magnets before. I think

767
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,460
it's two different things. But it could... But magnetism, get this, science, blow

768
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,460
your mind, magnetism is electricity. I said that too. Oh God. It's the same thing.

769
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,000
It's the same. That's technical. So when you people say electro shock therapy,

770
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,760
they're kind of I don't know. I have no idea. Okay. I know that. I would imagine

771
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,600
I would imagine a big deal. I would imagine it's not magnet because they say

772
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,540
shock. Big iron is saying it's really, it's really not a point. He's pointing

773
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,800
it at himself. What's wrong with that? He's been talking about conversion

774
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,080
therapy and pointing the gun at himself. I'm excited. Right. It doesn't make you

775
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:30,080
want to die hearing about what they do to these fucking people. I don't. I was

776
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,480
I was just focused on you pointing that right. You can't even think about it.

777
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,760
No, no, I need to get converted to you need to let a big iron worry about big

778
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,800
iron. You need to be big

779
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,440
headphones right now. Okay, and you need to listen because I'm telling you I'm

780
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,160
giving you some

781
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,320
yo big

782
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,640
we I've definitely caught so many big headphones before. It was a walking

783
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,320
around with those big head. Get some ear plugs or ear buds.

784
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,580
you got these big headphones walking around with these big headphones? I know

785
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:05,440
Lou Reed got shock therapy because he was a little gay. Just a little bit?

786
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,920
That's what it said on his Wikipedia. It said he was a little bit gay? Honestly, he probably

787
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,080
he probably did that on purpose to himself to seem more rock and roll.

788
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,840
That's true. What's more rock and roll than getting electrified? Yeah. Yeah.

789
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,540
Getting electrified by your guitar. That's cool. Getting electrified by the

790
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,240
mic stand. I have shown you the video of Frankie Palmieri from Amir getting

791
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,200
been electrocuted by the you can get a oh I've been a

792
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,440
like

793
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,520
well, not to death. He's playing this dog and there it's like right before

794
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,880
break down and he goes like he's like screaming into the mic and then he goes

795
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,280
like this

796
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:45,960
goes completely stiff, like shake a die. No he was fine, but he fainted like and

797
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,080
then he like completely like wooden board falls over and the band keeps

798
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,160
like thirty seconds. Have you guys? I thought last night I first every time

799
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:03,180
we've you've corrected me on this before did Wayne static from static X die from

800
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,300
touching a microphone and it electrocuted him. No, he died from a

801
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,580
horrible life of drugs and sadness. Okay in

802
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,580
first you're thinking of his hair, but just sticks up

803
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,260
and his electric theme to be

804
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,760
you

805
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:26,200
you to correct me on it before, and I know that you did, but then we started

806
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,740
talking about this. I mean you look at him. You have to imagine he's yeah. Of

807
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,640
course, every time I touch yeah every time he touches that Mike stand his

808
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,740
hair. Let me yeah you you got you. You look at him from the from the forehead

809
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,640
up. You think oh my God, this guy he was a like you and he does and then you

810
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,720
look at the rest of his body. You're like oh no, it was he over to it was

811
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,760
producing on drugs.

812
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,260
Then they replaced him with a robot.

813
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,760
Have you all ever been electrified?

814
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Yes.

815
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Yeah, a little bit.

816
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:00,040
I, my science teacher in sixth grade taught us how to make a hot dog cooker, which was

817
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,520
a wooden plank, like a two by four, two carpenter screws, electrical tape, and then a frayed

818
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,040
wire.

819
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:14,060
And it was like, you just put the hot dog on the two, like, nails.

820
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,860
that is not a safe experiment to be doing with kids.

821
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,340
No, but then I touched it and I

822
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,540
shocked my fucking hand.

823
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,980
He told me not to touch it too. I touched plugs coming out of an

824
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,260
outlet before and that type of thing. Yeah. I once heard... Put your finger in the light bulb.

825
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,620
We had one. My dad had... I didn't do that. No, that's an actual way to

826
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,100
kill yourself in a cartoon. I did that by accident when I was younger.

827
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,580
Really? I was plugged in. Put your finger in the light bulb socket? That can't be

828
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,620
an accident. No, it wasn't an accident. That's not an accident at all. It was an

829
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,980
accident. Don't lie. I put my finger in to see what would happen like in the

830
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,980
cartoons when I was a young boy. That doesn't count as an accident. No. To see

831
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,820
what would happen is not an accident. Getting electrocuted, I will say,

832
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,300
getting electrocuted does feel kind of good to me. It doesn't feel like pain.

833
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,620
Yeah. It's this weird thing where you're shaking and you can't move. Yeah. But

834
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,220
until... It would feel nice if you could do it in a controlled way. Yeah, I do

835
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,260
kind of like it, like maybe you're watching some sort of porn. Yeah,

836
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,420
exactly. What's better than watching porn and getting electrocuted while you

837
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,420
do it? Damn, that actually sounds sick, but I did it. What my dad had a

838
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,820
outlet that was out of the it like had no cover on it, and it was just hanging

839
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:28,020
loose out of the wall, and it never really was a problem, but we never put

840
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,740
the three dollar cover on it, and then one time I was plugging in a laptop and

841
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,140
I didn't understand how it worked at all, and I grabbed the back of it.

842
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,140
Oh my God.

843
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,140
And plugged it.

844
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,540
And I just sat there like, "No!"

845
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,140
Like looking at it, and my brother was like, "Are you okay?"

846
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,860
And then I just let go and took a deep breath.

847
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,620
And I think that it changed me forever.

848
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:53,420
I almost, I'm pretty sure I almost started an electrical fire at our college, because

849
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,740
I remember I had that big gaming laptop.

850
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,540
I would lug everywhere, but I bought an aftermarket.

851
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,540
Wait, what?

852
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,540
Yeah, I had like that.

853
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,540
You lugged it everywhere?

854
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,540
Yeah, it was heavy.

855
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,540
It was really heavy. I remember this laptop. It was like this thick.

856
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,540
For a second, when you said laptop, my brain heard desktop.

857
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,540
Oh, no, no, no. But now I understand.

858
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,540
I had this aftermarket, like, because the charger,

859
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,540
I was like a broke college kid and I broke my charger somehow.

860
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:26,540
I bought this same charger off of like

861
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,540
fucking Panda Buy or something. It was like this

862
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:37,480
market like charger and every single time that I would plug it in, I would see like, I looked

863
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,060
at the plug one time and it was just all like chipped and I was like, "Oh, that's weird."

864
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:46,260
And I plugged it into the outlet at the library and I just heard like a "pfff."

865
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,900
I was like, "Oh, fuck."

866
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,900
You popped the outlet.

867
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,900
I popped the outlet, yeah.

868
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,900
Holy shit.

869
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,200
I would pop the outlet probably every other time that I plugged it in.

870
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,660
It was so fucked.

871
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,940
I don't like, I could have burned the whole library down.

872
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,460
shoot out of all my outlets all the time and shoot into my house and fly around.

873
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,140
Yeah. Wouldn't it suck if you go-- They shoot into my water that's on the ground.

874
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,780
You plug-- It's like, "Hey, buddy, that's my water."

875
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,300
You go to plug something in.

876
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:17,260
Knock that off. That's all my water on the ground. Stop putting your sparks in it.

877
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,740
You're not allowed to touch-- Don't touch my puddle, buddy.

878
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,340
That's my tons of puddles all around right at my feet where I sit at the couch.

879
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,700
That's my little oasis I made. That is the dream setup. Oh, my God.

880
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,500
Water on the floor.

881
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,460
a ripped up lazy boy with a giant puddle

882
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,760
all around it.

883
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,700
With a spring coming out the back.

884
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,100
Yeah, and a wire that's hanging from the ceiling

885
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,540
and just like one inch away from just touching the water.

886
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,920
I love leaving water on the floor.

887
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,280
Yeah, me too.

888
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,780
I spilled some water on the floor.

889
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,180
Oh, watch out, I spilled some water on the floor right there.

890
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,620
I've never ever wiped up water.

891
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,280
It goes away.

892
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,360
You don't wipe up anything.

893
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,520
You don't wipe up anything.

894
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,680
You don't wipe up coffee or soda or anything.

895
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,040
There's stains everywhere here.

896
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,960
all the stains on this table are from you. Yeah, that's because I didn't do

897
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,700
that. It was about to be a stain. I wiped it during an episode, but that's

898
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,500
because our old table was covered in sugar. Yeah, sugar, as you drink your

899
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,960
sugary drinks. I don't have any. I was always zero sugar coffee. Okay, you're

900
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,960
synthetic. We should be destroyed big iron. It's time for you to turn in your

901
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,620
gun. I don't think so. Imagine you go to plug something into an outlet, though.

902
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:24,120
It sparks up right. You're plugging your computer and I'm like, damn, I light a

903
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:31,160
one

904
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,160
Water guy comes out of the outlet and he has all the data from your computer.

905
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Wait, why?

906
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,580
Because you plug your computer in the outlet, it's sparked up, hit the puddle, it comes

907
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,580
up.

908
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,260
And the reason that water guy comes out of the outlet is because I have a bunch of data

909
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,600
about water guy from my old group chats in my computer?

910
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,600
Yes.

911
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,600
And that comes to life?

912
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,600
Uh huh.

913
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,320
What if you talked shit about water guy?

914
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,560
I never have talked shit about water guy.

915
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,320
No, but your boy talks shit about water guy.

916
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,440
Nobody talked, I promise you, nobody talked shit about water guy.

917
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,280
you guys have a group chat where you guys just talk shit about me all the time.

918
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,580
No, we touch it about water guy. He doesn't know, but there's I'm not

919
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,840
entertaining anything, any lies about the water guy situation.

920
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:20,440
No, see I'm not. I'm why I don't water guy is a code for somebody here. It's

921
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,760
not even true. That's not true. I would not be water guy. I would be the red

922
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,200
pig.

923
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,260
you text each other when you're lit. It was like the red pig is landing at the

924
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:33,700
nest

925
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,820
is in the for

926
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:46,440
the red pig is thirty minutes late to the barn. I don't know why I say you

927
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,540
look like a pig all the

928
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:54,780
really right now I'm red because I have sat in a blood that's blue rushing

929
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,440
blood is said blood is rushing to my head to block the tears.

930
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:07,720
I don't look like a pig and I'm not that right. You're a to have a to have a more

931
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,360
pig ish pig ish to have a

932
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:17,200
you can't be mad when I say pig pig ish pigly. It's so funny to have a have a

933
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,520
code name for one person be like yeah yeah, we're we're going to hang up

934
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,880
hang out with Alex and Joe and the red pig.

935
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,380
no,

936
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,640
I'm not the

937
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,420
we're all getting new nicknames today, big iron red,

938
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:37,280
I okay if it's a nickname, I'll take it because I do like having a nickname.

939
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,780
I don't know if I like the red pig that much I'd rather go by a Mike. It's so

940
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,200
funny. We can't do middle. I know we can't do middle names because we have

941
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,240
the same middle name yeah, but I can be Mike, though. No, you can't. We can't.

942
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,340
what if I did what if I did a late twenties shift from where I do the

943
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,460
little kid thing and I start going by my middle name? Yes,

944
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:03,000
I can't tell I can't. That's a good that's good. Yeah, see Michael Pit.

945
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,440
That is pretty good. Thomas Howell, though, I don't know who that's

946
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,460
completely copy Thomas Howell is I can't. I can't fully tell this, but I

947
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,260
was thinking of you'll understand when I say this, but I was thinking of

948
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,160
changing my last name when I get married and you think about what my

949
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,080
name would be and that would be pretty funny. Wouldn't it? I would be funny

950
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,960
yeah, wouldn't that be a pretty funny thing to have that name?

951
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:31,440
Actually, yeah, I did. I don't think that I think that you're I don't want to

952
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,360
say it, but I did text your fiancee. Well, a photo of you on said last night.

953
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,580
How did I find out about it?

954
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,080
She told

955
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:45,020
after I told her, I was going to her. She confronted you, huh? She confronted

956
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,960
you about your date with. She said, What the fuck is this? She did. She asked

957
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,260
I was there was it and then I said it was fun. She said, well, I know what you're

958
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:51,820
really doing.

959
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:56,660
I told her yeah, I like

960
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,580
I liked him.

961
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:04,540
You liked him. Did you like it was nothing? It was not nothing and I'm

962
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,380
ready to admit that

963
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:10,340
not going to lie to myself or to others. I think you might be taking this guy's

964
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,540
last name. What was his last name? You remember? I don't even remember his

965
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,940
first name. Yeah, oh shit. I'm going to guess his name just because he was on

966
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,380
set.

967
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:27,460
Mr. Movies. I really, maybe I might get, I might get, find, I might try and find his

968
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:32,500
name. You could ask, yeah, I might ask the AD. I'm probably gonna do that because I

969
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,460
think we should give him some work. Yeah, maybe he could just sit in as an extra

970
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,700
on the episodes. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah, I mean he would be a good

971
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:47,020
guest. We're chopping it up. He would not be a good guest, man. He would not be a good guest.

972
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,120
I think a pad are going to have a mom on your vacation. Yeah, that would be

973
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:56,360
that I was actually a good idea. You guys are both gone at the same time

974
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,320
right. You guys are both going to be leaving me alone. You're going to

975
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,080
abandon me soon at the same time. You're both abandoning. We're not

976
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,560
abandoning you. You're bending me, making me feel like shit. I don't know

977
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,880
if we're going to make I mean that's on you. I was I was thinking of doing an

978
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,120
episode where it's just me and two people from craigslist that I don't know,

979
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,600
but I don't know how to work the roadcaster.

980
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
I think I just don't.

981
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,600
Pretty easy to work.

982
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,920
I don't trust you as security to protect our equipment.

983
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
Yeah, that's true actually.

984
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,080
If random people come in.

985
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,880
I could get the two construction guys who helped the...

986
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,560
You want them to sit in the front?

987
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,560
That helped put the wall up.

988
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,560
Helps do their job?

989
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,400
You want them to be security or you want them to be on the show?

990
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,120
It's going to be me and those two guys on the show.

991
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,120
Oh, those guys are cool.

992
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,120
That's fine.

993
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,120
They're nice, yeah.

994
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,240
One of those guys told me he did a misty flip at Brooklyn Banks.

995
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,200
Oh yeah, one of them was a skater.

996
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,700
I remember he's a rollerblader. He said he did a misty. Holy. I don't know what a

997
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,760
misty misty flip is a five forty back when you turn into mist.

998
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:57,240
That constricts you guys that he did a five forty back flip on roller blade.

999
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:02,800
That is fucking awesome.

1000
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,600
I was waiting for you guys to to come here one day and I was playing. What do

1001
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,200
you even say that you just go like, oh, I did. Yeah, I was just like, oh, really?

1002
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,820
Wow. What's he going to like, you know, I'm not going to challenge him on that.

1003
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:20,220
That's the coolest thing I've ever heard. I really hope it's true. But I was

1004
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,980
just playing session on the computer. I was waiting for you guys to come in here

1005
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:29,100
one day when we like first had the whole place set up and he recognized the

1006
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:35,660
Brooklyn Banks in the game and he was like, I did a misty flip there. That's so crazy.

1007
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:43,260
It's so it's like I was like yeah. No you did man. I but I honestly I fully 100

1008
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,060

1009
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,160

1012
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,160

1015
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,220

Don't do that man. That's like me touching your headphones or me touching your curly tail

01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,360
Okay, bye.
