1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,880
Avast ye landlubbers!

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,960
Blackbeard the Patch is here to tell you the story of three hearty lads, lords of the sea,

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,840
hailing all the way from Trebuchet village.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,040
voyage. Brim with Darren Do's and Darren Don'ts. Wondrous woos and wobbly whoa whoa

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,560
whoa did you think I was done with you? Oh for that I should have you

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:44,000
crip walk the plank. That's right we're talking gangster pirates. Not the actual

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,120
setting or characters although that sounds cool now that I'm writing it but

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,600
an attitude because these three salty sea dogs have found themselves face to face

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
with their nemesis, Weirdbeard the pirate.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
And they'll show him no quarter.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,600
They'll blow the fiend down to dance with Jackie Ketch

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,600
seven nights a week at Davy Jones' Locker.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
And Davy Jones' Locker has a three-drink minimum.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
And all the drinks are poopy.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Trebuchet Village, Tales from the Seabomb,

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Sinbad, Virtue Good, Ladybetter.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Roll for initiative!

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Oh my fucking god, we're in here, huh?

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
I got a 17.

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
That was honestly a very high energy intro.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
That was so high energy.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
This is so cool.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I got a 6.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Do I add to the initiative score?

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Oh, then I got a 20.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600

94
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,260

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,400
Okay, yes. I have names for some of them. So, most of them are just sort of like nameless

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,640
crew who you got with the ship, who you've accumulated over your months of sailing in

100
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
the sea. Are they slaves?

101
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,240
No, none of them are slaves. They're not slaves.

102
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Are you putting slaves-- How can we possibly afford to pay them? They

103
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,880
must be-- I mean-- You guys are very successful privateers.

104
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,400
That's true. And you have the theme park money that's been rolling in.

105
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,880
That's true, but I mean, I haven't been paying any of these guys. Have you guys been paying any of these guys?

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,380
Hell nah. I haven't paid a single person.

107
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,380
So they're slaves. Okay, well I'm about to become a hero. Slaves, you are all free.

108
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,880
They're literally fighting with another crew right now.

109
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
You're all free and you can go into the ocean.

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,280
Or you can stay.

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
Or you can stay but we cannot pay you.

112
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,480
One of them just starts to walk away and he just gets stabbed.

113
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
He just stops fighting.

114
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
Nah, crap, he shouldn't have listened to us.

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,920
One slave down. I mean, there's no slaves here.

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,280
One free man down.

233
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,560
Steaming from pain and he flies down he lands in the cannon and his hot butt sets off the fuse and it gets launched into

234
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
The ocean white flag

235
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:13,040
Star good in the sky like tinny rocket. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How are the waters right now salty salty and

236
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,800
Choppy, but not too choppy. You're out to sea. Oh and a shark gets up him and gets him

237
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,640
I was gonna say is there like a big big like kraken?

238
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,920
I could a shark a shark he's flies in the air and he's about you can tell he's about to do the star thing like team

239
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,060
rocket but before he can a shark gets up and eats him and then a sea serpent eats

240
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:37,340
the shark a funny thing you should say that oh really did I do that a little

241
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,400
bit as you see him fly up and you see the shark eat him and we say we think

242
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,720
he's about to do the star thing oh he's about to do the star thing exists in

243
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,080
this timeline. Yeah right, Team Rocket are a bandit gang. And Pokemon are real.

244
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,920
Pokemon are real, yeah. But we won't see them because we're in the sea. Yeah, they're on another continent. Can there be a continent that's Pokemon?

245
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,680
There's stuff, there's lore. I just saw a Tangela. There's too much lore here. I just saw a Tangela.

246
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,840
Well you are about to see, you're about to see Tentacruel,

247
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,120
Tentacruel I guess maybe, because as you see the shark eat him, you see a

248
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,040
tentacle fly up, grab the shark down, and then flop onto the boat.

249
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,560
Oh my god, it's a Pokemon.

250
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Wait, is the shark on the boat now?

251
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
No, the shark is gone.

252
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
As long as it's not a damn shark.

253
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
It's Kyogre.

254
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm really scared of sharks.

255
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,120
You can't see the rest of the beast at all, you can only see this one tentacle flop onto the boat.

256
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
I kiss it.

257
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
It is your turn.

258
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Do you want to kiss it?

259
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Okay. I kiss it and I say, "I love you, baby."

260
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Sometimes it's like you just do things to do them.

261
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
"I miss you so much, baby."

262
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Yeah, I mean that's your action. Is there anything else you want to do?

263
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,960
It doesn't like react. That didn't hurt it. You're too small to have really affected it.

264
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
This is my wife I'm talking to.

265
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Is there any other action you want to do with your wife?

266
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,320
renew our vows. Only you do that next turd. You're up, Evil Stiebel. Me? Yeah.

267
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,640
I'm not sure that this Octa thing is a threat yet.

268
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,720
Yeah, it's a Pokemon. Just because you have tentacles doesn't mean you're so bad.

269
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,920
Yeah, it's my wife. You just rescued that shark from flying into the Sun. Yeah, we

270
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,920
could tell the shark was about to do the star thing. Yeah, and you saved it. So I

271
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,880
I would I like to also if you would let me Patrick mm-hmm kiss your wife

272
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
Just on the cheek you son of a bitch

273
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:54,700
Shit I'm doing it. Oh my god. What the hell reaction you could try to stop him

274
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,740
I push him I push him away from a contest. Okay, you rolls strength. You're sort of prompting this Pat

275
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm gonna have you do a reaction to stop a kiss. It's not exactly how that works, but it looks pretty low

276
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Yeah, it was a three.

277
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Man, how I do this bullshit.

278
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Let's roll a d20 and we'll add your flat strength value.

279
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
This isn't something you would really do.

280
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
I got a four.

281
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
What did you get?

282
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
You got a three.

283
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,480
You guys very weakly push past him and plant those lanes.

284
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
They just walk into each other.

285
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,480
I take off my white gloves from my admiral's outfit.

286
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm kissing no girl. You are a bastard. Oh, I have a hook hand. Okay

287
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Right now just what I thought of it. I'm dressed up like I'm in a full admiral's outfit. You don't have to hook

288
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,680
Okay, I have a peg head

289
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,320
You have a peg head my head's just a block of wood

290
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, I

291
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Have my head replaced with a book. It doesn't really change anything for me. I don't think no, so it's just looks cool

292
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,120
All right, hold on so I got a role for this tent this tentacle

293
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,980
Yeah

294
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,680
Man, is there any way that I can be married to a giant squid in this camp giant squid?

295
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,440
What are you talking about? There's just one tentacle here. That doesn't mean there's any other ones it

296
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,600
Flings its tentacle around and knocks out some of weirdbeards crew and your crew

297
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,360
But you all are able to dodge out of the way that is not my wife

298
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,120
Andrew, your wife's hitting the slaves. Control your woman!

299
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,000
That's not my wife. Control your bitch right now!

300
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,520
I wish it was. Do something.

301
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,280
I don't remember. I put a big ring on her tentacle. That wouldn't be...

302
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,120
That would not be her. There's a big ring on the tentacle.

303
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,240
There's a big ring on the tentacle? There's an iron ring on the tentacle.

304
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,720
You know what, first of all, let me say I'm sorry.

305
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,400
Control her! She's had a few...

306
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,120
I'm pretty sure she's had a few to drink. Hit her right now.

307
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,160
You can like hear her nagging from way underneath the water.

308
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,920
I'm not gonna hit my wife.

309
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,420
Why not?

310
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,260
'Cause she just, she just gets like this, okay?

311
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,020
She's, she's hitting all these other guys.

312
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,800
Hold on, hold on.

313
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,240
[Muffled]

314
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,400
I stubbed my toe. Hold on.

315
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,540
[Laughter]

316
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,380
You can't be hitting my crew.

317
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,680
I mean, there's no, there's no response.

318
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,560
You can't be doing this.

319
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,740
It's just a tentacle.

320
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,500
I think you need to go make love to her.

321
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,760
A white mist in the deep, it is just from the deep.

I just grabbed the tentacle. Well it's it's Dogen's turn. Okay well I grab it.

324
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,720

329
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
I don't want to have to do this.

330
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I look at him and I go...

331
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
I give him a big wink and I hide it.

332
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
I hide the side that I'm winking from.

333
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Please hit my wife.

334
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Please hit my wife really hard.

Okay, I think that's a 7.

337
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
What's your squid wife?

338
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Yeah, that's a 7.

339
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Total?

340
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Yeah.

341
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Okay, no, it doesn't hit.

342
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Yeah.

343
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,480
Basses off of the damn the tentacle you're up now Patrick do I hit the ring and it goes?

344
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,080
Yes, I I

345
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,640
Man someone must be flying into the sky somewhere. I

346
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,440
Crawl up the tentacle and I try to pull the ring off

347
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Okay, roll a strength check

348
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
So just real strength

349
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,980
Yeah, I mean you just sort of like you just really scrape your fingers on it

350
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,200
It kind of hurts you can't win, but I'm holding the tentacle still what I mean you're still on the tentacle

351
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,500
It hasn't shook you off yet. You have successfully mounted the tentacle. I whisper into one of the suction cups

352
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,460
Knock it off. It smells bad knock it off. This is getting pretty

353
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,820
Domestic okay, you're up. Yeah, I think we should just leave and let them sort it out

354
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,200
I feel like I'm watching an episode of Gerard of Spinger

355
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
(laughter)

356
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,880
- What am I doing?

357
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,580
- It's your turn, you can do what you want.

358
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,020
I mean it is on Weird Beard's boat, not yours.

359
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,860
- Oh.

360
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,700
- Oh shit.

361
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,800
- Oh, wait, I thought we were on our boat the whole time.

362
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,120
- No, you guys boarded Weird Beard.

363
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,420
- Oh, wait, I look back at the boat and I go,

364
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,740

365
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,580
(laughter)

366
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,880
I've had too much grog.

367
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
Okay.

368
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,560
- All right, you guys tell your crew to go?

369
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,400
- Yep, all right.

370
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
- Yeah, I'm gonna try.

371
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,680
- Everyone, come on.

372
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,560
- Quit fighting's over, just quit fighting.

373
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,640
- Wait, hold on, hold on, get all the,

374
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,240
get their loot and then we'll bring it over to our boat.

375
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,560
- Make sure you win the fight.

376
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,400
- Make sure you forget.

377
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,240
- We won the fight.

378
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,060
- We already killed the guy.

379
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,080
- We just killed the captain.

380
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,220
- Oh, what, we gotta kill everybody?

381
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,800
All right, boom, dead, dead, dead, dead.

382
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
Everybody's dead, come on, let's go.

383
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,240
- Everybody's dead but our crew.

384
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,240
- No, I don't care if you guys die, honestly.

385
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,000
We don't even need that much loot.

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,720
- We need two or three of you to carry a treasure chest.

387
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,880
- Everybody who has a name,

388
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,080
to the boat with us yeah if you don't have a name stay here and fight. Steve Wayne and the

389
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,880
other fuckers just get the treasure chests and walk over. Also we don't really need any

390
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,640
more treasure I'm gonna be real. I'm good I kinda want it. Weirdbeard was your rival but you were also like

391
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,560
hired by the government the governor of port I just remembered something a port

392
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,880
virtue good so you might not yeah I should have said this to you so you guys

393
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
might not have to it's like there's not this wasn't necessarily like a treasure

394
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,960
like adventure oh you're just hitting the guy is there a big oh we're just

395
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,040
assassinating him your privateers you get hired to this guy's what does he

396
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,520
have on his boat he does have treasure on his boat what do we get hired to do to

397
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,440
kill him what if we get back to port if we get back to port and that damn shark

398
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,960
just take care of Ward I'm quitting pirating forever if the shark has if the

399
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,360
shark is that's why we got a shaking fins with the mayor except why we gotta get

400
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,080
all the crap off the boat. You're right we at least need his ID. Yeah. Okay we can get

401
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,520
his ID. We need his boating license. Yeah. Okay wait wait the deed to the boat. You

402
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,520
could go to his captain's quarters. Yeah. Not that one. And you could try to see if

403
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,580
you can get some sort of proof. Yeah his driver's scroll. His driver's scroll. I will go

404
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,420
down there and I'll. Okay so you're gonna have to. I'm still on the tentacle. Use your turn. I'm

405
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,640
trying to say all this to you guys and all you nears like. So you just have to get by the

406
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,520
the tentacle it doesn't seem to be able to send you though so like you probably

407
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,520
could just make the captain's quarters yeah you're in there you see it's got

408
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,760
pictures of his wife and kids yeah good and yeah you sort of rummage through the

409
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,480
drawers and you are able to find more a deed to his ship that it's his ship the

410
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,360
Chris now belongs to him okay and so that would be basically proof enough

411
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,040
that you guys like at the very like common do we get a little bit of candy

412
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,440
if we if we show there's a little bit of candy and there is 17 gold pieces also

413
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,160
okay if we show anything with that if we show like the the ship insurance agency

414
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,120
that we owned the Chris when we get reimbursed for everything on the Chris

415
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,360
there is no ship insurance agency that I know of in the damn olden times let's

416
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,400
well let's found a ship insurance agency and then claim it yeah yeah that's not a

417
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
- That's a bad idea.

418
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,980
- That's our new move is we, every ship that we board,

419
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
we find the deed.

420
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,660
- Don't tell us to the god.

421
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,600
- We find the deed and then break the ship

422
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,440
and then reimburse ourselves.

423
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,720
- I head up from the captain's quarters

424
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
and I just start walking over to our boat.

425
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,560
- You can just book it, yeah.

426
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,380
- All right.

427
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,220
- You can put it over there.

428
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,060
- Bye everybody.

429
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,380
But like kinda slowly like I'm leaving a party.

430
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,220
- Yeah.

431
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,720
- All right, good to see you.

432
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,560
- Yeah.

433
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,620
- Yep, the tentacle's still here.

434
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,100
Yo tentacle, yo.

435
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,720
Forever man, we'll always have this night.

436
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,100
- Where would the treasure be?

437
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,540
treasure would probably be in the hole like further down the hole maybe in the

438
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,500
probably in the you know the treasure be well there we go

439
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,940
lower deck don't need treasure bro we literally said we have enough money what

440
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,740
okay patches what's what would the treasure be I mean the treasure would

441
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,540
just be a sizable amount of gold pieces I mean this is not gonna have like a

442
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,180
magic item he doesn't have like a magic sword not that you have a job not that I

443
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,880
I would know so this is weird.

444
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,280
No, it's weird beard, dude.

445
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,780
What are you probably like a freaking a freaking beard oil?

446
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,280
What if he had a candy cane sword?

447
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Oh, he doesn't like the like the like that's in the candy cane

448
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,680
mountains.

449
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,880
What about sweet beard from kids next door to be has something

450
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,280
like that.

451
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,180
He's not sweet beard.

452
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,080
He's weird beard.

453
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,480
That's in that's not even like that's not even his name.

454
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
I think sweet beard.

455
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,180
Anyway, how do I know he doesn't have like a crazy good sword

456
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,880

459
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,960

like weird beard who is sort of like a mid-tier pirate okay anything dope all

461
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,520

462
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,360
only understands we will say things are made or based yeah yeah so yeah you guys

463
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,440
are able to escape you see the tentacle as you guys leave slink back into the

464
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:26,140
water and you see like a huge form does it go here out of it no Bob into the

465
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,160
white mist and you see the white mist disperse and see the huge form

469
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,200
her to the to port to port virtue good so and while you're sailing back I will

470
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,560
inform people of what's what's what's going on the sea bomb long before it

471
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,560
became an uninhabitable uninhabitable hostile milky alabaster was a rich and

472
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,080
vibrant part of the planet it connected the stray islands off the terrifier

473
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,140
kingdoms continent held mysteries beyond the reach of the kingdom. Only the

474
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,820
bravest of explorers were dare to venture to these waters. Those who first did were

475
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,860
rewarded with whatever land they could find where they'd act as a lord. No land

476
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,020
was more rich in the sea balm than the Virtue Good archipelago.

477
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,980
Pirate King Virtue Good sailed under the Terrifier flag hundreds of years ago and

478
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,940
made his way westward until he stumbled upon this rich chain of islands that you

479
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,780
guys are at now and they took his namesake. He ruled over the

480
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,220
Archipelago as a king for decades. Some say the height of his power he could

481
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,140
have challenged a terrified kingdom itself. But the call to the adventure

482
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,340
stirred in his heart once again and he vanished without a trace. In his absence

483
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,180
the Archipelago was ravaged by war over the spoils until the kingdom at the

484
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,100
time led by a young King Nardwar in his first landmark diplomatic act put an end

485
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,980
to the fighting and create an uneasy truce among the warring micronations.

486
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,140
Virtue Good Archipelago is now ruled over by governors and lords all strictly

487
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,260
under the Terrifier banner. Peace is maintained in a flimsy arrangement. So it

488
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,740
has been six months since you guys saved the kingdom from a mad sect within the

489
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,040
Terrifier Church that tried to bring back a villainous god. You know him as the

490
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,660
Terrifier. Since then you've been privateers on behalf of the easternmost

491
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,580
part of the archipelago in the capital city of Port Virtue Good where the

492
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,620
eponymous pirate King first landed you've been sailing your ship on the Royal

493
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,840
Caribbean which you got from trunchbull who is Patrick's Yoda ours beloved uncle

494
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,700
who passed away shortly after the previous campaign and oh yeah yeah yeah

495
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,340
he died yeah didn't he turn into dust not necessarily no turn into worms

496
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,900
incursions the worm does so much he turned to a force ghost though he turned

497
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:03,660
went to what a force ghost only for you yeah fart ghost nice green it's so

498
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,540
captain weird beard what had sworn himself to no governor or Lord and

499
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,980
attacks indiscriminately instead of being a proxy war you know properly

500
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,340
doing it through proxy wars which is how the there's a bunch of competing

501
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
Oh great, here come the politics.

502
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Um, no. I'm tuning out.

- Yes, so, I have one other task to ask of you.

565
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,900
You have been amazing privateer since you came here.

566
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,300
- Gracias. - Six months ago.

567
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,140
- Yes.

568
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,380
(laughing)

569
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,180
- I didn't receive this at all.

570
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,420
(laughing)

571
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:46,260
And he says to you guys, "There has been a strange series of banditries, robberies, in

572
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,540
Isle de Kool.

573
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,340
This is an island that is a bit off of Port Virtue Good.

574
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
You'll see.

575
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,820
And don't, this is a private, yes?

576
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,660
We keep this between the four of us?"

577
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
Between me amigo.

578
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,260

582
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,540
You'll see

583
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,960
My city has a very rigid trading relationship with the kingdom

584
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,220
But we're trying to adventure out. Okay. I know it is boring by making it

585
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,060
- Oh, my God.

586
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,300
(laughing)

587
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,460
- In Isle de Cool, we have struck up something

588
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,300
a little bit more adventurous,

589
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,320
but it seems that they have been plagued by,

590
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,500
well, people have been robbing

591
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,980
and causing supply chain issues.

592
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,380
- They're robbing each other? - Are you saying rubbing?

593
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,980
- Rubbing? - They've been robbing?

594
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,300
- People have been rubbing?

595
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,500
- People have been robbing.

596
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,700
- Oh, hell no. - They've been robbing

597
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,540
each other? - People have been

598
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,460
getting robbed. - Each other or selves?

599
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,060
- They have been getting robbed themselves.

600
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,020
- Oh! - Oh, jeez.

601
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,140
- No, no, no. - Stay over there

602
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
rubbing themselves. - Wait, wait.

603
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,980
Where were they getting rubbed on?

604
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,580
- I don't wanna go there.

605
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,940
- Themselves, he said.

606
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,220
- Where, where?

607
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,540
- I will dig CK. - Downtown.

608
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,940
- Oh! - Oh, God.

609
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,100
- In downtown, behind us.

610
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,980
- They rubbing themselves downtown?

611
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,500
Oh, God. - Gracias, me pico.

612
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,820
- No, man, no. - Do not, no.

613
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,020
- I don't wanna even, I don't even wanna do this anymore.

614
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,180
(retches)

615
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,220
- I throw up on the ground

616
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,420
'cause I've been drinking so much salt water.

617
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,100
(laughing)

618
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,940
- You're just doing the same shit.

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,700
Hey, for the information, gracias mi amigo.

Councilman Granada Weintraut,

638
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,780

and I can't send any of my official forces over,

640
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,800
or again I'm going to let the kingdom know of my my business on the side so if I

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,240
They'll rub themselves. You want me to go over there and start rubbing people? No, no, not rub. Rub.

Yes, you have to travel by sea to get there.

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
So we're supposed to rub the sea.

658
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,120
No, no, no, don't rub anybody.

659
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
The sea is a buddy.

660
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Okay, but see, because they're already rubbing themselves.

661
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,980
That's a buddy of damn water.

662
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
So we don't have to rub them because they're rubbing themselves.

663
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,020
They're not rubbing themselves, they are getting rubbed.

664
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,400
Rub me amigo till he says gracias.

665
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,560
No, don't rub me.

666
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
You want me to rub you?

667
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
No, no, no.

668
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Huh?

669
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Who should we rub?

670
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,820
(laughing)

671
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,760
- No one, do not derub anyone.

672
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,600
- Now I'm damn confused.

673
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,680
- I'm gonna have a role wisdom saving throw.

674
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,880
- Okay, he did okay, he got a 16,

675
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,640
he's still sane as this is going on.

676
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,640
- Okay, just be discreet about it.

677
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,400
- Can you just say this, just say it bluntly

678
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,700
because it's not gonna make any goddamn sense if you don't.

679
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,540
- Say what?

680
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,040
- What are we going over there to do?

681
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,520
- We're rubbing, we got it, all right?

682
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,560
- We're rubbing him when we get back.

683
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,400
- When we, okay.

684
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,760
- We're gonna go and then come back

685
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,920
and we're gonna rub him.

686
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,840
- We go on the sea to see mi amigo, see?

687
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,280
And then we will see what we rub.

688
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,240
- And then we rub gracias when we get back.

689
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,760
- We rub mi amigo.

690
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,040
And he says gracias.

691
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,240
- No, do not rub me.

692
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,680
- And then he says gracias and we go in the sea.

693
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,160
- Is there any way you could have this conversation

694
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,400
away from a person?

695
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,940
- Gracias rubs me.

696
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,880
- And mi amigos are there watching?

697
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,280
- Hold on, wait, let me try to--

698
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,040
- Mi amigo says gracias for the ref.

699
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,240
- You three are going to go to over the sea.

700
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,680
- Okay. - Sea.

701
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,840
- Yes. - Sea.

702
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,560
- To Isle de Culo. - Yes, sea.

703
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,840
- Sea. - Isle de Culo.

704
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,120
- Where people, no.

705
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,880
Where people are being rubbed.

706
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
- We're gonna rub it.

707
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,280
(laughing)

708
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,120
We're going to the isle.

709
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,200
- So people are being rubbed across the sea, see?

710
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,000
- Yes. - And you want us to stop it.

711
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,840
- Yace.

712
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,400
- Okay, so we gotta go-- - Yace or C.

713
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,080
- We gotta go rub some Kulos on an aisle.

714
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,920
- Yeah.

715
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,760
(laughing)

716
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,200
All right, let's hop to it, boys.

717
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,040
- All right. - Wheels up.

718
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,640
- You don't have to tell me twice, let's go.

719
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,480
- I start rubbing.

720
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
(laughing)

721
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
- That's one down.

722
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,320
(laughing)

723
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,200
- And you leave immediately.

724
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,280
He writes in his notebook,

725
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,800
"Another conversation knocking out of the park."

726
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,760
(laughing)

727
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,600
Perfectly.

728
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,960
No one was confused.

729
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,240
- While we're walking. - Tear diary.

730
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,360
No one was confused by my name today.

731
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,580

741
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,220
sail across the sea and across to Isle de

742
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,100
Coole which is sort of a it's basically

743
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,580
like where Port Virtue Good is like an

744
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,460
actual like port you know it's like an

745
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,540
actual city this is clearly just

746
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,380
supposed to be a trading outpost that is

747
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,940
kind of masquerading as a just a regular

748
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,160
settlement it just it doesn't want to

749
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,620
draw any attention to itself again it's

750
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,460
trying to trade with colonies that

751
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,380
aren't associated with the the Terrifier

752
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,820
Kingdom. What makes what why is an isle

753
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,300
different from an island I actually wish I could tell you that I've read a lot

754
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,460
about islands before this but I didn't read about that it's a circle and I

755
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:54,900
think it's literally just like an island is an island so it's when there's an

756
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:03,700
aisle and something else sorry I can't I don't answer cuz I'm I'm looking in my

757
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,340
my my spyglass yeah I'm scanning the shores for rubbings I'm looking in also

758
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,660
spyglass but not backwards just sideways I'm looking into the side yeah mm-hmm

759
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,780
I'm just I'm just so anxious to get rubbed yeah I I am like fully I left

760
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,100
that exchange fully believing that we are going here to stop people from being

761
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,900
rubbed I think that we have to he thinks that he's he thinks you have to stop

762
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,940
them from being robbed and I think that we're going there to rub people I mean

763
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,740
- That sounds exactly in character, yeah.

764
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,500
Okay, so you guys show up at the dock

765
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,980
and Councilman Granada Weintraut is already waiting for you.

766
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,820
- Gracias.

767
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,700
- Are you mi amigo?

768
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,740
- No, my name is Granada.

769
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,260
- And Granada to you as well.

770
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,700
Are you mi amigo?

771
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,340
- No, mi amigo is the governor.

772
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,220
I'm Councilman Granada Weintraut.

773
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,540
- Gracias. - De nada.

774
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,700
- De nada.

775
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,740
- De nada.

776
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,980
- Granada.

777
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,140
- De nada. - Bless you.

778
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,380
(laughter)

779
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,460
- They nodded to you as well.

780
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,900
Now listen, would you--

781
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,380
- Where do I get rubbed?

782
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,140
- Yeah, and who am I supposed to rub?

783
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,500
Good plan guys, we'll fool them into thinking we're robbers.

784
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,980
- I see what happened here.

785
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,020
- Yeah, we'll fool them into it.

786
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,740
- I'm very familiar with when the governor

787
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,180
tries to talk to anybody.

788
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,660
No, so there are robberies going on here.

789
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,500
- Robberies?

790
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,340
- No, not robberies.

791
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,300
- What the hell's a robbery?

792
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,200
Isn't that when something's all jiggly?

793
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,800
It feels kinda rubbery sometimes if it's an Audi.

794
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,580
You're close. It's when people have goods that are stolen from them.

795
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,380
God damn it.

796
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,180
Okay.

797
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,480
Um, like maybe the dead skin on their arm 'cause it got rubbed off?

798
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,800
Um, not, not, not as related.

799
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Oh, so everyone on this island has eczema.

800
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
And that's why they're here, 'cause they're exiled.

801
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,440
That's pretty good, but no. I'm afraid not.

802
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,360
I'm going to... I'm not gonna not write that down.

803
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,080
Though.

804
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,280
I'm rubbing you basically no do not rub stop stop stop stop. I tackle him

805
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:10,720
Right we want 3,000 coins, okay, no no first

806
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,120
Give me your car. Give me those coins. I'm taking them if you don't give it to me. This is a robbery. I'm robbery

807
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,000
No, we already did that

808
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
so I'll introduce you to

809
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,760
one of our one of our

810
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,720
sailors

811
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,040
Yeah, and you see a guy who's a

812
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,860
sort of a just a regular-looking guy who

813
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,840
Who looks a little shaken up and he has described to them what you saw last night

814
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:44,920
Well, well I was by the docks and um, I was just shipping some cargo over and um

815
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,360
what we saw looked like up these guys riding on top of dolphins and

816
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,200
And then the guys and the dolphins were just... they attacked us and took our goods and...

817
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,700
I mean, they rode away. It looked like they were working together. I'd never seen anything like it.

818
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,200
The guys with the dolphins? Did they rub you or no?

819
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,700
I don't know. I don't know. I can't... Please, please, relax.

820
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
You don't know. Just whatever you can say.

821
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,700
I mean, they robbed me. I don't think they robbed me, though.

822
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,200
They didn't. So why are we talking to this guy? He didn't get rubbed.

823
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Yeah, this guy just got robbed.

824
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,680
You see, wait, Secretado leads over to the guy, he goes,

825
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,940
"Tell them, they talked to Gracias,

826
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,520
"tell them that you were, oh, okay.

827
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,280
"Yeah, I was rubbed too."

828
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,880
Oh my God, we need to kill him.

829
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,200
- Wait, okay, so he's done already, so we can skip him.

830
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,040
- Yeah, we don't have to talk to him.

831
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,360
- So you're gonna rub me.

832
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,840
- But it's the dolphin guys who are doing the rubberies.

833
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,120
- Okay, so we need to find the dolphins.

834
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,000
- 'Cause dolphins are rubbery, that makes sense.

835
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,040
- Oh my God. - Oh yeah.

836
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,920
Yeah, and dolphins love sex.

837
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,760
- Yeah.

838
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,920
(laughing)

839
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,200
Alright, so any clue as to where these dolphin men might be?

840
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,000
Do I have to put it in the blowhole?

841
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,120
What do you think rubbing is?

842
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
Sex?

843
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,760
I actually don't know.

844
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,760
I don't know.

845
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,680
Um, well, I don't know.

846
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,880
It seemed like they just came from under the dock.

847
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
It didn't make any sense.

848
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,680
I'm gonna get rubbed under my dock.

849
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,960
Alright, under the dock seems like a nice seedy place to get rubbed.

850
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
Yeah.

851
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,320
Or to stop someone from getting rubbed.

852
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,000
Or to rub somebody.

853
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,840
(laughter)

854
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,560
- All right, let's go check it out.

855
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,800
- To interface with rubbing in some form.

856
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
- Can we head to the dock?

857
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,360
- Yeah, yeah, I mean you guys are at the dock.

858
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,240
- Okay, I pop my head under to see.

859
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,080
Can I investigate a little bit?

860
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,600
- Yeah, yeah, do an investigation check.

861
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,920
- I'm gonna also investigate.

862
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,120
- You can give him advantage.

863
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,960
- Okay, I'll give him advantage.

864
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,320
- Roll again, roll again.

865
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,680
- Roll again, oh I have advantage.

866
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
- Oh my God, my beautiful life.

867
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
- What, I don't get to roll a thing?

868
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
- Oh, did you both get 17?

869
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,080
Well, just 'cause you--

870
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,920
- I got an 18.

871
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,160
- Well, that's 17 plus--

872
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,880
- Your investigation's pretty high.

873
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,120
Yeah, let me look.

874
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,560
Oh, my passive investigation is 11.

875
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,280
Oh, my password.

876
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,360
My password to my--

877
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,400
I thought your district was higher.

878
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,520
--7, 6, 8, 9.

879
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,400
But anyway, so yeah, yeah, yeah.

880
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,280
So you're both actually at 18 for this.

881
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,240
Hold on, hold on.

882
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,520
So--

883
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,020
Oh, yeah.

884
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,060
Yeah, you're both at 18.

885
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,400
Yeah, I'm at 18.

886
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,720
I mean, looking under the dock and sorting through,

887
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,040
with that 18, you can see that there

888
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,480
is a grate that looks like it's a bit askance.

889
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,920
open open sorry grass yes and prego and you can see that it doesn't look like it

890
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,440
would be big enough for for most people to fit through but it does look like you

891
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,560
could sort of squirm your way through it but it is also like you know filled with

892
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,800
water I'm small I'm filled with water I love water way my things water now oh no

893
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,200
wait I'm not small anymore I'm tall yeah you're not long now and he's he's small

894
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,160
- I'm small and wide, I'm small and little.

895
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,760
- How tall am I again, I'm like six, five or something?

896
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,600
- Foie?

897
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,440
- Six foie.

898
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,260
(laughing)

899
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,320
- I'm so tall I can't even say it.

900
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,280
- Oh yeah, Pat, Pat, you have a, wait,

901
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,480
I made sure to write down what you have,

902
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,520
'cause I realized I didn't write it down

903
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
when we first did it.

904
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,740
You have a giant eyeball on the back of your head.

905
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,480
(laughing)

906
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,360
- Man, it's been a while.

907
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,160
- You're kinda regular size now, like five nine.

908
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,000
- Regular size, so like six two, right?

909
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,640
- No, I mean, well, five seven,

910
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,440
would say is regular size. I don't know if people would say that. I just read about

911
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,600
this how people have been saying that actually. Really? On oppositeday.com? No

912
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,360
it's actually on Cameronstinky.web. Okay so yeah that was a subdomain of

913
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:34,480
oppositeday.com. That's why it's called that. Yeah. Anyway. Okay so I'm gonna put my big

914
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,560
eyeball in the crack. Also your hair is silver. I'm going in the crack. Also your

915
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,840
face now you have like a Michael Jackson nose. Do I really? I don't remember that.

916
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,480
I thought I looked like Alan Alda. No that's what happened part of your

917
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,280
puberty made your face look no longer as much like Alan Alda. You could still

918
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,800
sound like Alan Alda. I start I come to the realization. You're like warhead Alan

919
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,320
Alda is what we said. Okay so I come to the realization. Like what you said and I'm

920
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,560
like all right I'm just gonna put my eyeball under here. I'm crawling into the

921
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,320
crack because I I'm water now so you could it's like a Tourette's tick now

922
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,640
I know what's your what's your Constitution I can't wait for this

925
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,800
For modifier rather.

926
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,040
It is plus one.

927
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay so you can hold your breath for one minute underwater.

928
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,160
Okay but my God is a water God.

929
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,560
Do you think that gives me anything?

930
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
You might have to pray or something.

931
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,120
Yeah I mean I don't mind praying.

932
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,640
I mean I love praying.

933
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,560
I mean can't get enough of this stuff.

934
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:58,440
So we'll have you pray to your new water God and if you get above a ten when you pray you'll

941
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,280
your water God what is your who is your water by the way the reason I switched

942
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,920
to um to the water god is because i was eating a lot of oreos for my oreo god

943
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,640
and i was dipping them in milk and i was like oh the milk is kind of better than

944
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,280
the oreo and there's no milk god so i just chose the water god instead

945
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,720
right of course water's an oreo

946
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,720

I know that voice.

955
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
Wait a second.

956
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Uh oh.

957
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
My god, I love him so much.

958
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,600
Who is that?

959
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
I wish he was here right now.

960
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
I wish he existed at this time.

961
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,600
I wish he was born already. Oh my god.

962
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
Is there a penguin around here?

963
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
We all have a collective vision of thousands and thousands of years in the future.

964
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
That was amazing.

965
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Of that dude.

966
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
Of this mysterious dude.

967
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:26,600
I hope he's in this campaign so badly.

968
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,600
There's love when you say oh yeah.

969
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Oh yeah.

970
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:39,320
So you guys have two minutes of breathing that you can go through and that is enough to - I

971
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,960
thought your concentration was higher but so it's good that you did that.

972
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,080
You're good that you made me do that.

973
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,200
That's enough for you to kind of come up with like a little bit of air and have a little

974
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,120
bit of a cove in front of you like an underwater cave.

975
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,120
Sure.

976
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,120
Yeah.

977
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,840
And you could see that there is, it's dark, dank, and you could see that there is a way

978
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,840
forward.

979
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
It's very hard to see in here though.

980
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,840
I think you have dark vision though.

981
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
Is it dank in here?

982
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Yeah, it's dank.

983
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,840
We're recording on 420.

984
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,840
Oh wee!

985
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,880
People are not going to hear this for like four months, I feel like.

986
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,880
Not true.

987
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,880
Yeah, so.

988
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
It's not true.

989
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,880
So.

990
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,880
He's just making shit up.

991
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
So yeah, what do you want to do?

992
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
You're here for a while.

993
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,300
You're here alone. It's just a cave. There's nothing as it is. It just like is there it goes on forward. Oh, okay

994
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,140
It's like a tunnel. Yeah, I feel sorry. Yes. Yeah, and in turn with shallow water

995
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,920
And yes, you can feel a bit of air do have any way I can communicate with them

996
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,560
From in here. I guess I'll just can you guys hear me? Yeah, okay

997
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:43,420
Perfect. Okay, you know I hear you they can't hear you. Okay. Can I do I have like a messenger fish?

998
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,680
(laughter)

999
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,240
- Well, let's see--

1000
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,080
- A messenger mackerel.

1001
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,280
(laughter)

1002
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,800
- Let's see what you have as far as spells and abilities.

1003
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,160
- Oh wait, no, I can make my voice really loud.

1004
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,000
That's one of my abilities.

1005
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,840
- Do you have thaumaturgy?

1006
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,680
- Yeah, I have thaumaturgy.

1007
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,440
- Can it go through water?

1008
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,280
- Yes.

1009
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,100
- Duh.

1010
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,940
- How loud is that?

1011
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,780
(laughter)

1012
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,600
- Duh.

1013
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,080
- It can be three times as loud,

1014
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,640
and you can also make harmless tremors

1015
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,240
on the ground for one minute.

1016
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,480
So you have things you can do with that as well.

1017
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,720
- Oh, I didn't even prepare my spells,

1018
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,760
but I feel like I could prepare do I have create in a spring water or do you

1019
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,740
have that I do you want me to destroy the whole ocean? Yeah, can you just

1020
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:26,420
yeah, I'll do that. No, I guess I'll just use the amateur g and see how loud I

1021
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,820
can get see if I can get them to hear me. I'll stick my head underwater and

1022
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,840
then I'll talk like a booming thunderclap. Yeah, it sounds good. You

1023
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,160

1024
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,560

1025
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
*gibberish*

1026
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Me too.

1027
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Four.

1028
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Hold on.

1029
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Just hold on.

1030
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,560
Just hold on.

1031
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Uh, I got sixteen.

1032
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
That's pretty good. You can hear a faint

1033
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,560
sounds like Dogen. You can hear that.

1034
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,560
I put my head in the water and go

1035
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,560
*gibberish*

1036
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,560
You're talking at normal volume.

1037
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,560
*gibberish*

1038
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
*gibberish*

1039
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,060
(gurgling)

1040
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,360
- Dogen must be thirsty.

1041
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,600
(gurgling)

1042
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:20,400
- I stop, I take my head out of the water.

1043
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,020
- He wants me to do the moonwalk.

1044
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,860
(laughing)

1045
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,960
- Well hey, give the man what he wants.

1046
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,000
- Alright, I try to do the moonwalk.

1047
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,320
- Roll performance check.

1048
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,840
What's 14 plus seven?

1049
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,680
- Very good.

1050
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,800
- You crushed the moonwalk.

1051
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,080
- Wait, wait, so if he's down there,

1052
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,360
that means that there's something down there.

1053
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:42,120
yeah so I I I'm gonna quick save and then walk down the tunnel yeah sure I feel

1054
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,120
like we should go and try to join him yeah yeah I mean you can look at the fact

1055
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:57,000
that he's like oh he's still I thought he was dead I thought he killed himself

1056
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,200
that's such good news that he wants you to do the moon wait maybe that's his

1057
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:06,040
dying wish hold on I got a moonwalk down there I'm gonna try and do a moonwalk

1058
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,400
into the way um he how tall is he it's not about the height it's about like like

1059
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,920
well how tall is he and how long is the tunnel I mean the tunnel is like what are

1060
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,240
you planning you think you're tall enough to just it's not about being tall

1061
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,760
it's about being like swam for two minutes you think it's get there yeah

1062
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,340
okay maybe I don't know okay you're not tall enough to just get there okay how

1063
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,480
long we we can both hold our breath for a minute each you what's your what's your

1064
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,020
Constitution my constitution basing it off of your modifier for that my constitution

1065
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:47,540
You guys probably both have higher than him, I don't know where to see you don't it's your my constitution is

1066
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:53,980
13 minus plus plus 2 plus 1 and you have plus 2 okay, so I can get down to the cave you can get down

1067
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,980
There's a cave, but you can you destroy the water in there so that we can go into the cave easy create and destroy water

1068
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,980
I think only allows you to destroy like

1069
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:12,160
feet. Just use it a bunch. How much water is down there? 30 cubic feet, right? 31 feet

1070
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,640
of water. Could I really quickly - What you could do is you could use - Could he jump

1071
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,920
down and it could just destroy 30 feet of water? You could use multiple spell slots

1072
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,000
and if you do it twice, I'll say that you can destroy enough that he can make it through

1073
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,520
too. Alright, I'll do that. It's not a bad idea. I don't know if I have over - Destroying

1074
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
- Creating water is such a funny spell.

1075
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,360
- I love, I just want to picture it.

1076
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,200
- Destroy water.

1077
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,520
- It's so many times it's coming in handy.

1078
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,560
- You're skipping over some stuff that's pretty tough,

1079
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,840
so it's not a bad idea to be honest.

1080
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,320
- I don't, I actually don't think I have two.

1081
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,160
- You do have two spell slots.

1082
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,240
- But I already used one.

1083
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,400
- You used one, you have four for first level spells.

1084
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,700
You can actually create, oh my God,

1085
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,560
what happens if you upcast, create or destroy water?

1086
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,480
- You can create or destroy.

1087
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,600
- You can create or destroy an additional 10 gallons

1088
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,280
if you do that, or the size of the cube increases

1089
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,200
by five feet.

1090
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,740
What does upcast mean?

1091
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,940
Upcast means when you cast something,

1092
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,620
a spell that you get at like say level one,

1093
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,140
and like a level one, you cast it as a level two spell slot.

1094
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,620
So usually like spells like that,

1095
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,060
you end up doing multiple,

1096
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,280
so if something would be doing 1d6 damage,

1097
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,060
you upcast it, it does 2d6 damage.

1098
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,260
All right, I cast--

1099
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,620
Certain spells you can do that, others you can't.

1100
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,460
I destroy 60 feet of water.

1101
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,300
Yeah, you do that.

1102
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,540
And all life forms that are in,

1103
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,460
that happen to be sadly in that 60 feet.

1104
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,300
Yeah, I mean--

1105
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,120
Are vaporized.

1106
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,560

00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,280
because they're always that's the only one I'm wondering he's a guy he's a

1116
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,960
goblin type deal which I would think it would mean he would yeah can I do

1117
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,500
something real quick yeah you can do it before we walk into this dark cave can I

1118
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:37,880
use detect magic not a bad idea yes you can okay I cast detect magic okay first

1119
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:44,740
of all yeah Pat you have limited telepathy but you might I lift up my

1120
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:55,020
pants cuz they're sagging that's that's telekinesis you talk to you I just use

1121
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:00,940
telepathy to lift up my pants okay telekine okay they telepathically hears

1122
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,780
me in my head go thank god I was sick of that bullcrap I hear that and then I'm

1123
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:13,340
gonna try and then I'm like oh my god I have telepathy and then just realized

1124
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,900
yeah seems like Verdans don't have dark vision which is weird so I'm gonna

1125
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:24,500
listen for some crazy it's fine you can just follow us anyway so you you use

1126
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:33,380
detect magic yeah okay cool so when you do that you do to detect some kind of

1127
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:39,500
enchantment magic that is we make sure I make sure I'm accounting for everything

1128
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,660
to tech magic is able to there's a lot of stuff in there that means there's a

1129
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:49,980
lot of stuff in there we see that means this tunnel ain't empty do I can I have

1130
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,360
a spell called detect bullshit?

1131
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,980
Yeah. Um, no. Okay. I mean, I'll maybe later we'll figure that out. Uh,

1132
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,260
yeah, you, you are able to tell it's enchantment magic. Um,

1133
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,860
you could tell that it's just sort of generally aligning the walls of the

1134
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,260
tunnel, um, upwards of 30 feet. Um,

1135
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,220
but there's nothing else around like there's no other schools of magic you sort

1136
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,340
of sense. And it's only like faint traces around that. Um,

1137
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,100
but you don't see any creatures who are radiating magic,

1138
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,340
just sort of a general like vibe of that.

1139
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,880
Okay, so there's some kind of thing on this on these walls. There's a thing here. There's stuff on the walls

1140
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,320
Oh, no, I just detected it

1141
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:33,260
Well, I did it only one way to walk down the tunnel. Mm-hmm. I walked very carefully down the tunnel

1142
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,260
He is walked down the tunnel

1143
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,580
And when you get to the very end of it

1144
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:43,720
You see you're sort of rounding a corner so you haven't been seen by this group yet

1145
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,900
but you see a group of people who all have the skin of

1146
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,380
Dolphins and you also see

1147
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:59,260
Robberies and you see them just sort of with the goods that they must have stolen just to enjoy the goods

1148
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:05,020
You see a couple of them who are dolphins and you see them talking to the people who have the skin of dolphins

1149
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,280
You guys will recognize these as were dolphins

1150
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,780
Okay. Yeah, here's a dolphin sound

1151
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:27,300
it's

1152
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,180
actually spent time with dolphins. Yeah, I've watched plenty of videos. I haven't.

1153
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,460
I've actually looked at a lot of pictures. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I imagined what they

1154
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,060
would sound like when I looked at the pictures. Yep. Okay. Nevermind. Keep going.

1155
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:43,580
And it's not like that. Okay. It's nothing like that. Okay, that's fine. So yeah, you

1156
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:50,100
guys see that there. You also see a kind of an effigy to, in the shape of some

1157
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:57,020
kind of like, looks like some sort of like robed woman, but like... A rubbed woman?

1158
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,220
- There's a rubbed woman up there.

1159
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,820
- Wait a second. - A rubbed woman.

1160
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,380

00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,460
- This must be the rubbing. - That woman's wearing a rub.

1163
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,940
- This must be the rubbing room.

1164
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,780
- It's an effigy. - These guys are rubbery.

1165
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,220
- They're rubbery. - In the shape of.

1166
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,020

- Don't worry, I brought rubbers.

1171
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,460
- You rub them and I'll stop you.

1172
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,780

1181
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:34,900
See look, I'm the only one in the whole room. He's the only one in the room. See I'm talking to my damn self.

1183
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:49,940
Okay, okay. Okay, what do I have to roll? Deception, yeah. You're the only one in the room.

1186
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,140
and you see the man I hope nobody stops me

1187
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:15,340
you see one of them like one of them it looks like he's he started the leader of

1188
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:25,060
the group. He says okay now give me your arm. He holds out his arm. I here I go.

1189
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:33,580
I'm gonna go. Thaumaturgy, booming echoing voice. Stop! Oh God!

1190
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:42,580
Thaumaturgy, I alter the appearance of my eyes for one minute. To what? Cat eyes.

1191
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,420
- Oh!

1192
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,260
- Cool.

1193
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,820
- Ah, someone spooky's here!

1194
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,700
- You will not rub him.

1195
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,460
- Okay, well.

1196
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,020
- And then I dust my hands off and I turn around.

1197
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,500
- I think that's what we had to do.

1198
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,580
- Well, I had to rub him.

1199
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,180
- Yeah, but I stopped you, so.

1200
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,660
- I don't really care.

1201
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,060
- I use my limited telepathy and I say to

1202
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:08,060
both of them, I say,

1203
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,500
okay, figuring how to get me in here.

1204
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,100
(laughing)

1205
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,580
I think, okay, also that there's,

1206
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,980
so there's one more guy.

1207
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,420
(laughing)

1208
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,500
And he has something that he bet.

1209
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,700
- I'm moonwalking.

1210
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,780
- So this is our friend, so basically--

1211
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,900
- Roll performance.

1212
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:33,740
15 plus, what's seven, 22?

1213
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,620
God, yeah, you do another great moonwalk.

1214
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,740
- This is our friend, he's very talented, obviously.

1215
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,460
And he, I think, I believe he is looking to get rubbed.

1216
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,460
Yeah, I think that's the...

1217
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,460
So if one of you guys could rub him...

1218
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,460
'Cause you're rubbers. I heard you guys were rubbing.

1219
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:46,960
Shimona!

1220
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,460
And obviously that's the rub, girl!

1221
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,960
You were committing rubberies.

1222
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,460
No, no.

1223
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,460
Shimona!

1224
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:51,960
Well...

1225
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,960
Hee hee!

1226
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,960
The people here reject us. We're were-dolphins.

1227
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,460
It's so much worse than being a werewolf.

1228
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,460
Have you tried not, like, going around rubbing people and shit?

1229
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,960
Yeah, seems rude.

1230
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,960
How else are we supposed to eat?

1231
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,460
Wait, no, they should rub one guy here.

1232
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,960
Eat? Wait, what the hell you eating?

1233
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,760
CUM!

1234
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,960
Nasty ass!

1235
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,960
*laughs*

1236
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,260
Why do you think we're eating-

1237
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,460
'Cause you're rubbing people so you can eat-

1238
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:16,960
-what? -No.

1239
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Their cum!

1240
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,360
-Aww, goddamn, that's nasty as hell. -Nah.

1241
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,060
-Nah. -And it is-

1242
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:21,960
I would hate-

1243
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,060
I would hate if I got rubbed until someone ate my cum.

1244
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,660
-No! -I don't wanna eat no damn cum on a plate-

1245
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,360
We're not eating cum!

1246
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,960
Well, what the hell comes out of these

1247
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,860
damn dicks and cocks?

1248
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,260
That you're rubbing.

1249
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,660
-Well- -Hold up, let-

1250
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,360
-Just- let's start over- -CUM!

1251
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,960
-Listen, listen. -That's right!

1252
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:43,800
You just tell us your whole deal and we'll be quiet and then we'll say all our stuff at the end.

1253
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,240
But just say your deal or whatever.

1254
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,920
Why don't you roll deception on me and just see if...

1255
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,920
See if...

1256
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,920
Anyway, so yeah, they say...

1257
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,920
Oh, I can't?

1258
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,480
No, I'll just try to talk and see what happens.

1259
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:07,080
So, they say, "We were chased down here and the good witch, the good sandwich, she..."

1260
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,640
Okay, I mean come on who's covering my mouth

1261
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:19,880
It is my fault right I guess right yeah, uh, they say uh, she she gave us an opportunity to

1262
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,280
Well, she she she helped us organize and find a way to

1263
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:30,920
To take back some of the the goods that that should belong to us. We get it. You were on chapel

1264
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,640
No, no, no, no, don't that was not. No. No, I was not on chapel trap house

1265
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,800
he says. Don't listen to the word organize and think that automatically. Sometimes people just say the

1266
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:49,320
word organize and they mean - Get in you rubber! - getting together and he says, so we meant no

1267
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:54,680
harm. We didn't think anyone would - we would just try to - we would never try to hurt anybody. We

1268
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:00,520
just took the goods and brought them down here. Just rubbed them. Robbed them. Rubbed them.

1269
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,980
- Rub. - Rubbed them.

1270
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,540
I'm doing a Jedi mind trick hand.

1271
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,140
You rubbed them.

1272
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,860
- Okay, rubbed them.

1273
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,040
- You need to die.

1274
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,700
- You gonna attack them?

1275
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,700
- No. - Okay.

1276
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,060
- What are the goods that, can we see what the goods are?

1277
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,420

1279
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,020

- It's rum. - Rum.

1281
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,060

01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,740
- Some fruit as well. - Okay, what kind of fruit?

1283
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:35,100

01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,420
She's a rub girl.

1338
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,420
She's a rub girl.

1339
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,420
She's a rub girl.

1340
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,420
She's a rub girl.

1341
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,420
She's a rub girl.

1342
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,420
She's a rub girl.

1343
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:22,980
So wait, who is she? She's an effigy? She's just an effigy to our... I mean, she is the

1344
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:27,220
Sand Witch who... Oh, that's her, okay. Yes, well that's her symbol. You don't have to say

1345
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:32,340
anymore. Yeah, okay, yeah, that's fine. Which witch? The Sand Witch. Sand Witch. Which, right.

1346
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:38,060
Alright. Which Sand is it? Which Sand? So here's... Wait, say what you were gonna say.

1347
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:47,420
lipstick on your face okay here's your sign you might be a rubber if you're

1348
01:08:47,420 --> 01:09:02,060
wearing this sign get her rubbed so you all tater salad wait I forgot that they've

1349
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:16,380
tried to make him just like a normal stand yeah they call me tater salad yeah

1350
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:21,820
so yeah I mean you guys all go I mean the lipstick and the sign which was must

1351
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:25,300
have been drawn in like I guess like lipstick like lipstick also it all just

1352
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:30,220
washes off like I mean you're swimming through it like a tunnel that takes two

1353
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:36,660
two minutes to swim out of and they all come out. How does he get out because

1354
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,480
I'm tall I'm out of slots.

1355
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,620
We already did the water doesn't come back. He destroyed it. Yeah, it's not

1356
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:45,740
it's not temporarily destroy water. What are you doing? Yeah, I mean I guess

1357
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,460
are you could just stay in there, though actually

1358
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:54,740
what do you want to do man? I was tall enough to get out. It's not about

1359
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,780
height. I don't know why you keep referring to if you put a tall person on

1360
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,760
side they're going to be very long. You're not that much taller though. Yeah you're

1361
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,880
like a regular height. Also like the thing about traveling for two minutes.

1362
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:16,720
You subtract 30 seconds from it. No way. 30 seconds from me? It takes you 30

1363
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,040
seconds to walk? You guys are like three feet tall. You're two feet

1364
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,520
taller than us. Yeah. So it takes you guys two minutes so you'd subtract

1365
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,920
30 seconds, 30 seconds, and now I only take one minute to travel through this tunnel.

1366
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,880
That's pretty sound math actually. I'm actually a mathologist. I take it all back.

1367
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,800
Caleb, you do have two more spell slots by the way. You have three actually

1368
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,040
additional level, second level spell slots you can soak in. Well how is the water

1369
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:45,800
came back though? How did the water come back? Well I have to say, here's the thing, I have to say.

1370
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,840
Well if you got rid of water, wouldn't the water just fall into the place where the water went?

1371
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,440
Eventually more water would come in. Well then, no, no, it's destroyed. That means the

1372
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,960
the water. If he was destroyed then how would he have gotten in the first place?

1373
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,520
I imagine he would destroy the water and then in that moment of gap like he could

1374
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,880
swim he could sort of move through. There's no moment of gap the water's gone forever.

1375
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,360
Well no I mean like it would fill in though from the ocean. How is it a tunnel then so we were

1376
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,760
just in the ocean? Well you're coming from the ocean that's where the grate is

1377
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,560
and then you destroyed some of the water in front of you while you were swimming

1378
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,920
through I guess I could have illustrated that a little bit more. Yeah you did.

1379
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,920
I think the water's gone permanently.

1380
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,920
It's fine.

1381
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,920
Either way, it's fine.

1382
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,920
You're through.

1383
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:24,920
I don't want to do that.

1384
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,520
So you're through.

1385
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,280
And yeah, I mean, he sees you, obviously, the councilman.

1386
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,960
And he's like, he turns to the guy, "Are these them?"

1387
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,960
Wait, who are you talking about?

1388
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,640
You've got to wait ten seconds.

1389
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,640
You told them to come.

1390
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,640
They would be able to go out at the same time as you if they wore lipstick and signs.

1391
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,040
Who are these freaks?

1392
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,040
I don't know them.

1393
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,040
Oh my god.

1394
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,040
I don't know.

1395
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,040
We should just get them out of here.

1396
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:53,760
like it once said I have no friends good I see you've captured them yeah yeah no

1441
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,980
I didn't need any water destroyed.

1442
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,140
I mean, I'm better than you guys.

1443
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,580
I just went right through it. Who destroyed the water then?

1444
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,060
Do you need me to rub somebody?

1445
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,260
Yeah. Yeah, rub me.

1446

Oh yeah!

1455
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:14,760
What?

1456
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:19,260
Listen, I had to destroy water so that this fucking guy wouldn't get chlorine in his back eye.

1457
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,260
You, you, you barely, you destroyed the water and it came back right away.

1458
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,260
And who's the one who stepped out of the darkness the first?

1459
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,260
He stepped in the water.

1460
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,260
And I'm the least-

1461
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:27,760
I swam in the water.

1462
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,260
I stepped out of the darkness because I'm the least shy, because you two are too shy to hang out with.

1463
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,260
You stepped out of the darkness because you're so fat your stomach stepped out of the darkness on its own?

1464
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:40,880
on its own yeah your mom is so fat she has her own area code you're dead uncle

1472
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:10,460
it's the middle number, the middle number

1473
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,460
with the plus next to it, I think, for you.

1474
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,340
- Okay, so 14 plus five, I got a 19.

1475
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,780
- Yeah, that does hit you.

1476
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,500
So you do start crapping yourself,

1477
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,980
or you're about to crap yourself.

01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,180
He just shot a normal arrow at me?

1481
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,580
- That was not a normal arrow,

1482
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,280
that was the arrow that makes you crap yourself.

1483
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,260
- No, that was a normal arrow,

1484
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,380
and he's just crapping himself.

1485
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,700
- No, I'm not, it was the crap arrow,

1486
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:35,580
I have defeated it with my mind. I've overcome it. Why are you running to the bathroom? I'm not running

1487
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:40,140
I'm just running to the bathroom. Yeah, right. Let's follow him into the bathroom. Let's go. Let's go follow him into the bathroom

1488
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,020
Lock my phone. I smashed down the door

1489
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:46,020
No, you did. It's splinters. I'm

1490
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,660
Here's Johnny

1491
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:53,040
Can I just have please one second alone from you? No, you want to see you shit?

1492
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:58,900
Yeah, we want to see we want to see the fact that I made you poop yourself with an arrow. I'm casting

1493
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,100
I'm going to cast

1494
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:09,100
Which it does no damage because I just wanted to make a deafness to them right now, okay?

1495
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:13,340
Yeah, what he has that yep. He's gonna not if I cast something first

1496
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:21,580
Casting that I'm using telepathy to listen into his thoughts. We'll have to roll for initiative at this okay, okay?

1497
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:25,460
I'm listening in to see whether or not he's saying I pooped myself

1498
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:31,060
All you guys roll for initiative this is kind of 16. This is okay. All right six

1499
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:34,000
Jeez, even this is the second six you got

1500
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,860
Yes, okay who is higher deck you definitely have our decks yeah, he listens to me say I poop myself

1501
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:46,640
So he listens you listen to him say about sweet. Okay, we're gonna be initiative or that's all we need

1502
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,360
I heard you you said you pooped yourself. I'm still create making them blind and

1503
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:56,920
Okay, so let me see what that spell with blindness and deafness it is

1504
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,740
But also use them super smelling so they smell like

1505
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,840
Yeah

1506
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,760
It's super so we have one yeah

1507
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:09,580
And you could use one creature you can see within range to make a decision saving throw if it fails the target is either blinded

1508
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,160
Or deaf in your choice, okay?

1509
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:16,120
I know and you can't upcast this is this is the the level but you also to choose one of us

1510
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:23,680
to be either blind or deaf. I think next spell level you can choose both of them but this one you have to pick one.

1511
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,880
I pick both.

1512
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,780
So how about this, let's play with the spell. One of them can be blind and one of them can be deaf.

1513
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:34,980
What? No, that's not fair. This is like see no evil.

1514
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,680
Why are you siding with him? The Gene Wilder movie. That's funny.

1515
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,800
Why don't you guys just let me poop in peace please.

1516
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,480
No way. No we're not going to let you poop in peace. Pick one of them.

1517
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,480
I choose Patrick because he has more eyes. Absolutely, he does have more eyes.

1518
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,480
Alright, so Pat, roll a Constitution Saving Throw.

1519
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:53,480
I'm going to add one to whatever that is.

1520
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,480
Yep, that's an eight.

1521
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,480
Yeah, okay, you are blind.

1522
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,480
I'm blind, but I heard him say he pooped himself in his mind.

1523
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,480
You're blind for one minute.

1524
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,480
He pooped himself. I'm not blind and I'm looking at it.

1525
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,480
Your third eye is blind too.

1526
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,480
Yeah, the third eye in the back of your head is blind.

1527
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,480
Third eye is blind.

1528
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,600
(both singing)

1529
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,840
- That's what I'm singing while I watch Evil Steve-O poop.

1530
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,680
- All right, I--

1531
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,480
♪ Steve-O pooped, Steve-O pooped, yeah ♪

1532
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,480
- That's what I'm singing now that--

1533
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,880
♪ He just crapped his pants ♪

1534
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,720
♪ I heard Steve-O poop ♪

1535
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,560
- Okay, so I pull my pants down

1536
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,720
and I take the log of crap out of my pants,

1537
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,440
which is a perfect log,

1538
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,400
and I apply it to the toilet seat like lipstick.

1539
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,960
- Okay, yeah.

1540
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,200
The toilet seat looks vaguely fami--

1541
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,280
As you're doing that, the toilet seat looks vaguely familiar.

1542
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,320
Can you roll a history roll?

1543
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,560
Something about putting shit on the lips of this is making me think it's something else.

1544
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,600
Roll a history check.

1545
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,100
Okay.

1546
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:57,560
History...

1547
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,520
I'm looking for history...

1548
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,200
Here I go...

1549
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,240
I think it's pretty bad.

1550
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,120
Here I go...

1551
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:04,840
You got four.

1552
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,340
Four?

1553
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,920
Yeah, you're just sort of rubbing shit on what looks like some sort of...

1554
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:13,800
Looks like an amphibian of some kind. We don't have any recollections to what it is.

1555
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,800
I don't know what this is, but I'm sure having fun doing it.

1556
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,220
Put some on the... put some on the... it's the inside of the bowl.

1557
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:24,360
I'm watching. I'm like, what if I'm watching through the keyhole?

1558
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,600
You want me to put shit on the inside of the toilet bowl?

1559
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,100
What are you, an animal? Or just all over it, maybe.

1560
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,000
Alright, that's... I'm more familiar with that.

1561
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,800
I walk... I'm so blind, I walk through the door.

1562
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,440
I start doing bathroom graffiti with the shit log on different parts of the toilet.

1563
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:40,940
Okay.

1564
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:45,080
Just writing like, "Stevel was here for a good time, call Patrick."

1565
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,380
Yeah.

1566
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:51,480
Both of you, actually, yeah, you roll a religion check.

1567
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,800
You roll a history check.

1568
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,280
Okay.

1569
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,880
What history? What? He can't see shit.

1570
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:00,120
History of the shape he's feeling.

1571
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,120
He's feeling it with all the purple.

1572
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,160
Okay, I got a three.

1573
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,120
- Or wait, no, I got a five.

1574
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:08,960
- Okay, yeah.

1575
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,140
You guys don't really, you guys are just sort of

1576
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,240
hanging out in this bathroom, just treating this toilet

1577
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,680
like shit, that's all.

1578
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,600
But it's starting to probably make you feel a little good.

1579
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,800
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1580
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,860
- I feel a lot better treating this toilet like shit

1581
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,100
than when I was being mean to my friends a few minutes ago.

1582
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,800
- And I broke the door down somehow.

1583
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,440
- I'm sorry for making-- - 'Cause I felt like

1584
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:36,440
I had a magnetic attraction to treating this toilet like shit.

1585
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:40,440
Listen, I'm sorry that I made you blind and that I made you stupid.

1586
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,440
Okay?

1587
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,440
That's... that was wrong of me.

1588
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,440
You're well gracias, mi amigo.

1589
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,440

Rubbing.

Oh, I'm rubbing shit on this toilet.

Yeah, eat the poop. Yeah, you kick it, you keep kicking it, you're shoving the poop in its mouth.

1608
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:17,460
My pants are still down and covered in shit, by the way. I'm flushing the handle a million times.

1609
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:23,300
Yeah, I'm so blind and like I'm trying to kick and I keep kicking the poop out of his hand.

1610
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,300
Come on. Yeah

1611
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:31,940
You hear you hear when a bit of the poop slips slips out of your hand you hear it hit the sides of the boat

01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:34,980
You know, so this the chute that goes down the rest of the boat you

With a missing element. It's like kind of turning into other and my third and my third

1625
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:59,460
We have to get a normal toilet installed instead of this weird thing.

1626
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,460
This is a dead body and there's poop piling up on it.

1627
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,460
