1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,120
- Okay, the bass versus cringe.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,160
- Let's go through what we went through this morning.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,240
- So I texted Cameron this morning.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,080
- Should we just--

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,360
- Let's just go, okay, so first things first.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,480
- I wanna hear it beginning to end.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,360
- Let's read each our sides of it.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,360
- Okay, so I texted Cameron at 10.59 a.m.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,760
I said, "Is SpongeBob based or SpongeBob cringe?"

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
- You didn't say, "Is SpongeBob based

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,080
"or SpongeBob cringe?"

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,960
That's gotta need to be turned up a little bit.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
- Is SpongeBob based or SpongeBob cringe?

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
I just turned the headphones down on my fucking shit.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,680
We need to buy new microphones.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,520
- No.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,340
- The fans don't pay us enough.

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,180
- No, we're gonna push through it.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,600
- We need to buy a new Cameron.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,440
It's Cameron's fault.

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,480
- No, hey.

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,320
- I'm sorry.

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,320
- He's mad because he didn't even want to like be in on the conversation at all.

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
- And his air fryer only goes up to 400.

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,320
- And he got a cold room in his house. - And I spilled my stuff and I picked the wrong shirt to wear.

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
- You look too strong. - I'm wearing a weird shirt.

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
- I didn't realize until the camera was on.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
- I look so strong. - And look at that lighting.

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,320
- Look at the lighting on that camera. - I look way too strong in this.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
- No, you have to look down there. - Oh, okay.

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
- That looks natural. - See, it's completely fine.

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
- Alright, let's get back to... - Let's make the lighting crazy today.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
- Let's get back to base versus ground. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,760
- So at 10.59, and he said exactly what he said.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,360
You read it out perfectly, so no argument for that.

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,280
- Cameron responds with a perfect response.

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,240
- Let him say his own piece here, man.

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
- We're doing it like a script.

40
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,280
- I'm T-ing you up.

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,120
- Okay. - I like that.

42
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,120
- And then Cameron responds with a perfect response.

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,640
If you're a kid who likes SpongeBob, it's cringe.

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
But if you're a member of Black Twitter,

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,400
it's based to like SpongeBob.

46
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,920
- Oh, okay.

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,680
- Yeah, now let's move on to the next topic.

48
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
- This is sort of a symposium on--

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,040
- These are basically, I'm getting, yeah,

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
base versus cringe, Cameron's perspective.

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,120
The next question I asked, are skinny jeans cringe?

52
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,320
- Simple answer for me, yes.

53
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,360
- Damn. - Facts.

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,200
- See, I didn't respond to that one.

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,020
- Don't have to say much.

56
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,080
- He didn't even respond, but he did respond

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
to the asking for a ride into the office.

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,200
- I mean, some of this stuff, the thing is,

59
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,360
it's easy to write a long-winded answer

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,280
where you're kind of thinking your own thoughts

61
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,080
out on the page, but to just get it down

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,920
to one single word-- - It's called brevity.

63
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,040
- Brevity, and it's the soul of--

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,880
- Wit.

65
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
- Which thing?

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,960
- Of wit. - Which it is.

67
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,320
- Wit is what it's the soul of.

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,160
- What?

69
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,320
- So, okay, so after that I asked Cameron,

70
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,620
another exercise in brevity from Cameron.

71
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,960
- Yet another exercise in brevity from Cameron.

72
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,280
- Is being a hipster, baster, cringe.

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
- This one-- - And I said,

74
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
this is a two message response from me,

75
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,920
so it's actually not brevity.

76
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,740
- Oh, okay.

77
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,240
- 'Cause I released a statement and then I--

78
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,720
- Legitimately had a follow up.

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,960
- I had an addendum.

80
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,160
- Okay, an addendum.

81
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,000
- Go ahead.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,200
- Cringe, being a hipster, cringe, second message.

83
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,840
But shaking yo hips is based.

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
- Yep.

85
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,000
- Does a hipster shake their hips?

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,880
- No, I just thought that, it's just an addendum.

87
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,800
It's just like, oh, just so you know, also.

88
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,640
- Okay.

89
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,760
- But then I had a,

90
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,440
then it turned into full on just like a debate.

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
- Yeah, this one we kind of, a debate.

92
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,200
- I asked Cameron, not a debate, but more like--

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
- It was more of a discussion.

94
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
- We were philosophizing.

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,880
- And openly, yeah.

96
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,040
- We were philosophizing.

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
- Yeah, exactly.

98
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,920
- And I said, I noticed that Nu Metal

99
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640
used to be something that chuds named Kyle listened to,

100
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,680
but now people think it's based.

101
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
- Oh.

102
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,320
- And what I said was, some of it still stayed cringe,

103
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,540
but according to my research, much of it is now based,

104
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,800
especially when done by artists like 100 Gecs.

105
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,880
- I said I saw that 100 Gecs is a boy and a girl.

106
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,960
'Cause I don't know too much about them.

107
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,200
- Yeah, yeah, I don't really have any interest

108
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,440
in that kind of tunes.

109
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,880
No, boys and girls shouldn't be making tunes together.

110
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,700
- I agree.

111
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,820
Captain Nintendillo what what the carpenters what about she and him she and

112
00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:00,540
him come on that shit was um oh if it was based that shit was based I'll admit

113
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,540
it was some based trad bullshit I loved it cuz she dressed up in skirts and he

114
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,480
- If a boy and girl--

115
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,860
- Nowadays it'd be him and she.

116
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,260
- It'd be she/he.

117
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,100
- Yeah.

118
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,060
(laughing)

119
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,900
One person.

120
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,580
(laughing)

121
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,820
- Remember that one?

122
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,660
Remember that one?

123
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,480
- He/she?

124
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,140
- Like yeah, that thing when you're like a kid

125
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,980
and you go to the movie.

126
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,800
- That's why I shaved my head.

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,140
People call me he/she all the time.

128
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,460
- People will call you a he/she?

129
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,300
- Look at me.

130
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,220
- Yeah.

131
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,040
- Look at you.

132
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,980
- Look at my feminine figure that is so highlighted

133
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,620
by my extremely 40 times too small shirt.

134
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,780
- That's the funniest one 'cause like a grandpa

135
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,720
could say that with such like--

136
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,420
- Grandpas can say anything.

137
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,660
What world do you live in?

138
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,580
- A grandpa would say he/she and it would sound like--

139
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,100
- With his chest. - With his chest.

140
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,640
- Mm, true. - Such vitriol.

141
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,480
- Yeah.

142
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,700
- See I'm so, I'm pretty much on like a new wave

143
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,900
of consciousness now. - Raw meat.

144
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,820
- Yep.

145
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,020
- Cringer based. - Yeah.

146
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,580
- I'm gonna say I've completely flipped around on this.

147
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,900
I used to think raw meat based.

148
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm starting to think that the only way

149
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,380
that anybody should ever eat any meat,

150
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,420
it doesn't matter, Wagyu A5, no.

151
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,620
Well done.

152
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,420
I want you to get a Wagyu.

153
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,300
- Lots of thinkers are jumping ship.

154
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,260
- Yeah, a lot of the people used to go,

155
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,380
it's cool to go to a store and order your steak

156
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,700
medium rare or even rare.

157
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,100
- This is coming from someone with an air fryer

158
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,380
that only goes to four.

159
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,140
- Well, but that's kind of where I learned

160
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,060
is that the best place to eat a steak,

161
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,940
you know what the best kind of steak you can have is?

162
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,600
You pop-- - You can't even reverse sear

163
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,580
in that air fryer.

164
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,940
- I can reverse sear in whatever I want.

165
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,060
Ass hat.

166
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,900
- What are you gonna do with that?

167
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,740
- You don't use an air fryer to reverse sear.

168
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,020
- You're gonna do that with your corn broom?

169
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,220
- You don't need a, you don't put the,

170
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,540
you think you put an air fryer on 400 degrees,

171
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,060
450 to reverse sear?

172
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,220
You have no idea what you're talking about.

173
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,060
You reverse sear at 250 degrees.

174
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,400
- I'm saying that I have the ability.

175
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,240
- Me too!

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,300
- I have the ability to--

177
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,260
- You don't have a single ability.

178
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,980
- Caleb takes a-- - I have toast.

179
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,860
I have bagel.

180
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,580
I have rehydrate, I have--

181
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,820
Do you think those are abilities?

182
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,660
These are abilities--

183
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,480
Those are modes!

184
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
These are abilities on my air fryer.

185
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,160
Those are modes on your utility.

186
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,740
And then it goes up, okay, okay, 400.

187
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,500
Mr. 400 himself.

188
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,380
When do I ever need to go past 450?

189
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,180
He said, the reason why we had this air fryer discussion

190
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,020
in the first place--

191
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,840
Corn broom owner says what?

192
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,020
The reason why we had this air fryer discussion

193
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,860
in the first place is because--

194
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,580
Corn broom owner says what?

195
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,100
What are you talking about?

196
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,540
Oh, oh God.

197
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,980
We had this discussion in the first place

198
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,760
because he ate, oh!

199
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I ate fries for lunch.

200
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,640
Here's the thing, you want to talk about cringe verse based.

201
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,200
You want to talk about cringe verse based.

202
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,320
This guy ate french fries for lunch.

203
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,160
And you might be thinking, oh well he went to the store and he got some french fries.

204
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,880
He made french fries for himself.

205
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Wait, okay.

206
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,680
Because I was experimenting with my air fryer that goes up to 450.

207
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,200
I was finding out, I said 450, too high, 400, too low, 425, just right.

208
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,600
I discovered it now, now I can make my girlfriend beautiful fries.

209
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,400
- Which is more based or more cringe,

210
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
fries for lunch, fries for dinner?

211
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,200
- I think if you eat fries for a meal, it's cringe.

212
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,040
- No, if they're loaded fries.

213
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,160
- What if it's out of necessity?

214
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
- Yeah, all I had was a potato in the kitchen.

215
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,400
- That's the same, you just did the hypothetical thing

216
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,160
where you say, but if you had to.

217
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
- Yeah.

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,820
- Well then it's fine.

219
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,800
- I'm not saying, can you do it?

220
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm saying, is it based or cringe if you have to do it?

221
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
- No, none of--

222
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,260
- It's based if you have to,

223
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,400
because you're actually facing a hardship.

224
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,480
- It's cringe to do anything out of necessity.

225
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,240
Anything out of necessity is cringe.

226
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,120
If you are like drinking your own pee

227
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,680
on the side of the street, I will not help you.

228
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,000
- That's based urine therapy, urine therapy, look it up.

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
It can actually, because you're recycling.

230
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,720
- Yeah, urine therapy.

231
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,360
- I was and then I stopped going

232
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,000
'cause I didn't wanna pay for it.

233
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,980
And then I found urine therapy.

234
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,280
I started recycling my body's own,

235
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I started the toxins co-out, I recycled the toxins,

236
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,600
I put the toxins back in.

237
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,820
Because you need to constantly need to be at battle

238
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,100
with yourself within, and that's not what they tell you

239
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,260
in therapy, they say you have to cure all that stuff

240
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,100
that's going wrong with you.

241
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,180
- Can I say something that might be a little controversial

242
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,780
right now, that's kind of on the cutting edge?

243
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,660
- But we're already way into controversy on this episode.

244
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,820
- This is gonna ruffle some feathers.

245
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,180
- What's his name right now?

246
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,340
- Urine therapy. - Steven Crowder.

247
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,700
- Steven Crowder versus Noam Chomsky.

248
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,620
- Urine therapy is cringe.

249
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,060
Urine therapy, thinking that urine therapy,

250
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,900
urine therapy is like when people discovered NoFap.

251
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,300
- Mate. - It's cringe.

252
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,580
you have lost a lot. NoFap works though. NoFap is based and urine therapy is based.

253
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,540
NoFap is based but posting screenshots of NoFap is cringe. I agree. And that's what I mean by

254
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:45,940
urine therapy is cringe. All men struggle with a NoFap journey, but the real samurais do it in

255
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,300
silence. I'm not coming on this. I don't want to talk to you guys about my urine therapy. If you

256
00:08:51,300 --> 00:09:00,660
need help to not fap, you're cringe. I agree. If you need a support system that's like,

257
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:07,860
bro, it's okay if you relapse. You saw a picture for Flash Dancers, it was an ad for Flash

258
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:15,060
Dancers on a taxi, and you're like, I needed to go in the Starbucks on West 14th. I had

259
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,440
- I had to jack off, I had to log into Mr. Skin,

260
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,540
and I had to jack off in the Starbucks bathroom.

261
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,240
- HBO, HBO. - HBO, cringe or based?

262
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,700
- I'm gonna say again.

263
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
- No, I'm gonna say used to be based.

264
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,180
- Now is kind of moving towards cringe.

265
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,820
- Mate, I've noticed something I've noticed

266
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,900
in working on this philosophy is that it seems

267
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,860
that a lot of things that were once based become cringe.

268
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,100
- Sopranos is cringe now because of meme lords.

269
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,960
- It might have a chance to come back if the memes die out.

270
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,460
Or if...

271
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,960
Facts.

272
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,460
Yeah.

273
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,460
[Laughter]

274
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
That's a really good point.

275
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Yeah, HBO I think is solidly in...

276
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
Succession is cringe.

277
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:52,960
But think about it though.

278
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Succession became cringe.

279
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,460
Think about it though.

280
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
But it used to be based.

281
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
But it's on this Sunday if you guys want to come over.

282
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,960
It is on this Sunday?

283
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,460
I'm down.

284
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,960
Yeah, it is on...

285
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Well, I'll be out of town.

286
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
We can all come to...

287
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh, he'll be out of town.

288
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
You can come to my new place.

289
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Or you can come to my new place.

290
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
You have an old place.

291
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
My place is brand new.

292
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
I don't know, we just switched it up.

293
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
But he has a better couch than you do.

294
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
You guys have a better couch.

295
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
- Okay, we bought the couch.

296
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,100
- Okay, we invite everyone over to our house,

297
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,880
whether you like it or not, there's nothing you can do.

298
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,400
- We bought the couch because it had a funny name.

299
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,880
- They bought a couch on Wayfair called the Dingler.

300
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,960
- And I went over.

301
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,000
- Oh, that's what it is.

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,360
You guys have been keeping it a secret.

303
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,300
- Noah looked at it and said, "The Dingler,"

304
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,960
and I said, "At that price, I will purchase it."

305
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,860
- How much was it?

306
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,120
- Like 300.

307
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,720
- That's not bad for a new couch.

308
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,800
- I think that you should, actually, that is good,

309
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,360
but it's my new theory that I've developed.

310
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,080
It's cringe to buy a couch without sitting on it first.

311
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,360
- Wow, that is definitely cringe.

312
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,120
If you buy a couch based on--

313
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,560
- And I can say that because it happened to me.

314
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,360
- Tell your story, tell your story right now.

315
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,680
- Bought a couch on some website, can't even remember.

316
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,400
It was a girlfriend's choice, and I said,

317
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,860
"Yeah, okay, we don't need to sit on it, that's fine."

318
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,720
And look, it folds out into a bed type thing,

319
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,780
So that's nice, that will be good, we'll buy it.

320
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,240
And it's not so expensive either.

321
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,420
Least comfortable couch ever has been sat on.

322
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,160
You guys remember that couch, it was Cringe.

323
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,000
- I remember how cringe that couch is.

324
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,120
- It was cringe, not comfortable to sit on,

325
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,180
not comfortable to sleep on.

326
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,920
- Speaking of cringe, somebody may have a little bit

327
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,400
too much headroom in their shot.

328
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,720
- That's important to talk about.

329
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,040
So, the way I became based is when it was time

330
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,760
to buy a new couch, we decided to sell the old one,

331
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,260
we go to a furniture showroom, okay?

332
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,820
And this, people take notes.

333
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,300
This is a base tactic.

334
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,200
You go to a furniture showroom, you walk around,

335
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,340
you sit on all the furnitures,

336
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,020
you go up to the lady who works there,

337
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,320
and she gives you her card 'cause she likes you.

338
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,980
And you say, "Which one is the best

339
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,940
"and also cheapest or most expensive?"

340
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,740
And you sit on all the couches, you find your favorite.

341
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,780
Then you go home, you Google the name of the couch,

342
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,920
you buy it used.

343
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,460
You have sat on the couch, but it is cheap.

344
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,300
- So this is what he should have done.

345
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,280
- I'm so glad that both of us put our mics down

346
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,280
so that we weren't even tempted to speak at all.

347
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,060
- But that is my personal journey from cringe to bass

348
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,620
when it comes to couch purchases.

349
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,480
- That is fucking phenomenal and I wish,

350
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,320
you know what?

351
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,420
- And do you know what I just remembered?

352
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,680
- If you had told me that before,

353
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,880
I would not have made the mistake of buying the Dingler

354
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,720
because it was online. - A lot of people

355
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,340
just don't know about this tactic.

356
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,700
- I bought my couch from a guy on Craigslist.

357
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,160
- Yep, and it's made out of corn

358
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,120
- No, it's an Ikea couch.

359
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,480
It's not very good, it's not all that good.

360
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
- Ikea's cringe.

361
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
- But the guy who sold it to me--

362
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,360
- Going to Ikea's based, but getting the stuff

363
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
from it is cringe.

364
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,920
- Well, that's why I got it used.

365
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,480
- His couch is made by the second little pig,

366
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,320
and his couch is made entirely out of sticks,

367
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,240
and the first pig came over too to help to stuff the pillows.

368
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,040
- Do you know that nobody who listens to the show

369
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,520
has ever been to my apartment?

370
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,840
- We've talked about it, though.

371
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,160
- That I live in a--

372
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,000
You live in like an--

373
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,880
- I live in a Colonial Williamsburg.

374
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
- You live in an apartment.

375
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,440
- One of the staged Colonial Williamsburg apartments

376
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,600
where I'm always in there and I'm spinning twine.

377
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,440
- Yep.

378
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,280
- You live next door, and I mean this like,

379
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,560
I actually met him.

380
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,680
You live next door to Rumpelstiltskin.

381
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,880
- No I don't.

382
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,440
Next door?

383
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,280
- You live next door to Rumpelstiltskin.

384
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,760
- Yeah, I remember the story.

385
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,480
I remember the story where he lives in an apartment

386
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,040
and not in a fucking field around--

387
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Rumpelstiltskin knocks on your door.

388
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Shut the fuck up.

389
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
He tries to trick you every week.

390
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Rumpelstiltskin's cringe.

391
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
He is cringe.

392
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
I agree.

393
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
He lives next door to Caleb.

394
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
He knocks on the door and Caleb opens it.

395
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
He says, "Hey, how's it going?"

396
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,040
He says, "Hey, do you have a firstborn son I can borrow?"

397
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Trying to trick him.

398
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Meanwhile, he doesn't know Caleb is not sterile.

399
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Not familiar.

400
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Sterile.

401
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm not sterile.

402
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Sterile.

403
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Or I'm clean, I guess.

404
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,220
- Yeah, you can put your hand in someone's body

405
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,480
and it's fine, they don't get sick.

406
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,080
- But I'm not, my cum is normal.

407
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,000
- Well you don't have a kid and Rumpelstiltskin's

408
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,480
just kinda camping out waiting.

409
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,920
- I am getting a little bit, I'm getting a little bit scared

410
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
that I might be sterile.

411
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,760
- Yeah?

412
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,580
- I might be infertile.

413
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,420
- I think we're all pretty sterile.

414
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,040
- I think we're getting to the, I'm getting to the point

415
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,680
where it's like, I've never had a scare.

416
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,520
- Me neither.

417
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,340
- And I'm like, wait.

418
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,320
- Well that's 'cause I don't nut.

419
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,160
- All the, yeah.

420
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,680
(laughing)

421
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,520
I can't nut.

422
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
- Nah, I fake it.

423
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,440
- I can't do it.

424
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,280
but yeah, show me how you fake it.

425
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,120
- Well I know I'm fine, 'cause I look down

426
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,640
and I see hundreds of Wigglers.

427
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,560
- You see the Wigglers?

428
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,160
- Yeah, I see them.

429
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,000
- Really?

430
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,240
- Swimming in clear jelly.

431
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,080
- Yeah.

432
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,900
- Yeah.

433
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,740
- I pretty much--

434
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,440
- Vaseline with little frogs hopping around.

435
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
- Every single time I've nutted, it's been fake.

436
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,680
Sorry, I'm glad you don't have a subscription to Patreon,

437
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,480
my girlfriend, not gonna say your name

438
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,360
for personal privacy reasons.

439
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
- Derek.

440
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,200
- Nope.

441
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
- I'll say it.

442
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,880
- Jim.

443
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,520
- Not Jim or Derek.

444
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,360
- It's Derek and Jim.

445
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,840
- But pretty much what happens is every single time--

446
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,680
- Beckett dating a girl named Jim.

447
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,520
- This is Jim.

448
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,340
- You guys have to come up with a name, Jim.

449
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,760
- I wouldn't be that surprised.

450
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,040
You could have gone one of two ways.

451
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
You definitely went the other direction,

452
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,680
but you could have shown up with somebody

453
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,480
who was three feet tall named Jim,

454
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,640
and been like, "This is my girlfriend."

455
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,920
(laughing)

456
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,760
- Jim is so funny.

457
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,520
- Yeah, but so what I do,

458
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,800
like die hard I tape a little baggie of crema mushroom

459
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,640
to my back.

460
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,480
- Oh nice.

461
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,920
- Oh, but then it's got those little black specks in it

462
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,760
of the mushrooms.

463
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,240
- Yeah, well, I mean I just say I have a problem.

464
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,600
- It's not healthy to have something perfect

465
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
that has no impurities in it.

466
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,640
- And then I shoot a load of crema mushroom.

467
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,720
- Impurities so you know it's real.

468
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,120
- I wanna get a fake penis.

469
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,960
- Yeah.

470
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,800
- I wanna get one of those big rubber penises.

471
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,200
- Hollowed out penises.

472
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,120
- Yeah, and trick my own wife.

473
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,840
- Thinking you got a new penis.

474
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
- Whoa!

475
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,500
- Whoa, what happened?

476
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah, it's about like the size of your arm.

477
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I walk in and I clearly have a giant...

478
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
It's the size of your arm but it can't get harder.

479
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I'm wearing brand new grey sweatpants with the tag on and I clearly have a giant fake penis in my sweatpants.

480
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I walk up to her and I'm like, "So what do you want to do tonight?"

481
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,500
And you're like, "Hmm, you got any plans?"

482
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Well no, you wait to put it on and then you go, "Oh, I think I'm getting a boner. I have to go into the bathroom really quick and get my boner."

483
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
And you have it taped.

484
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,060
get my yeah, it's you have it's taped under the sink like a

485
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,660
shotgun. Yeah, but then you have to walk out. You have to walk

486
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,540
out and you have like one of those little wooden dowels taped

487
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,780
to it. Like it's like a plant that needs help growing.

488
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:39,580
You have it in a splint. Yeah, I really do love those old like

489
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,700
feel like those porn videos don't exist anymore. What cameras

490
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,220
are too good now. Oh, the OG Mud Bones. Yeah, the ones with the

491
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,540
fake dig. Yeah, because the guys always have like, like, it's

492
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,860
like, it's like you're pretending it's an elephant

493
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,140
and they have to pretend to nut so they go like, "Ahhhh!"

494
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,580
- Yeah, yeah.

495
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,580
But it's completely like, it's just mushy rubber.

496
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,940
So it just, and it's all one tone.

497
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,140
- When they were shooting everything on VX1000s.

498
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,860
- Yeah, exactly, they could get away with that.

499
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,460
These days, dude, no way.

500
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,300
- And iPhone.

501
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,380
- It's gotta be, well, it's CGI now.

502
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,220
- Yeah.

503
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
- I remember it could be CGI.

504
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,620
- Popcorn should be putting ping pong balls all over it.

505
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,500
- That's a great idea.

506
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,180
That's how you solve this whole STD crisis.

507
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,020
- Yeah, yeah.

508
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,580
people are getting STDs back and forth.

509
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,860
- CGI them.

510
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
- Yeah, you just CGI their penises.

511
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,260
If you wanna be a porn star so bad,

512
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,500
okay, we chop everything off of you

513
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,820
and we replace it with ping pong balls.

514
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
- Just like Gallador.

515
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,660
- Yeah, and then we just put you guys in a room

516
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,500
and you're this close to each other.

517
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
- We can place new limbs on you like Gallador.

518
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,660
- Yeah.

519
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,260
- So when I was in high school,

520
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,980
there was like a dodgeball tournament

521
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,020
that they would have every year.

522
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,740
Like you could just sign up you and your friends on a team.

523
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,640
And my buddies named their team OG Mudbone.

524
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
- Yeah.

525
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,880
- And somebody else--

526
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,720
- That's a funny show.

527
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,520
- Somebody else, pretty funny,

528
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,480
somebody else had to like,

529
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,920
somebody else's team name got changed

530
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,760
and then they threw them under the bus like,

531
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,640
"Oh, we can't have this, but like,

532
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,300
"they can have OG Mudbone."

533
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,240
And they were in the assistant principal's office

534
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,340
and the assistant principal was like,

535
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,800
"Well, I don't know what that means."

536
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,560
And they were like, "Look it up right now."

537
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,400
- Wow.

538
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
- And they made the assistant principal--

539
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
- That's fucked, that's fucked.

540
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,200
- They made the assistant principal look up OG Mudbone

541
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
and everyone got called to the office.

542
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,660
- That guy's a tattletale. - I saw.

543
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,100
- Yeah, that kid's a tattletale.

544
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,020
But imagine the assistant principal

545
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,340
having to look at that fucking.

546
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,900
- Yeah, just having it just hit a woman's vagina,

547
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,180
go completely L-shaped instantly.

548
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,820
'Cause that's all those videos were.

549
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,780
'Cause it wouldn't go,

550
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,620
you couldn't put that thing in a donkey,

551
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,200
like let alone a five foot woman.

552
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,140
So those videos, the penis goes towards the woman

553
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,780
and then it hits her mouth or her ass.

554
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,620
- And then it just--

555
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,540
(laughing)

556
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,700
- Just get a kink in it like a hose.

557
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,380
- Do you, have you, and all the jizz in those videos

558
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,540
looks exactly like that soap that,

559
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,900
you've been to my house, you know that soap in my bathroom?

560
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,820
- He loves soap.

561
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,660
- What do you mean?

562
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,640
- That soap, that soap in my bathroom that Alex bought.

563
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,300
Next time you're at my house,

564
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,660
squirt it into your hand and really look at it,

565
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,220
'cause it looks like fake cum.

566
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,620
- You want me to squirt it in my hand and go--

567
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,100
- We can go to my house right now

568
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,880
and we can all look at this soap.

569
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,900
It's lavender scented and it looks like jizz.

570
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,740
- I don't even know what soap I have at my house.

571
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,260
- I have a new soap.

572
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,100
- I don't even wanna say.

573
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,940
- I have a new soap.

574
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,760
- He's gonna make fun of me.

575
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,600
- Say, say, it's a bar, isn't it?

576
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,440
- I have a tobacco scented soap.

577
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,860
- You have a bar with little leaves in it.

578
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,820
- Yes, I have a bar that has--

579
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
- You have a bar with mint leaves.

580
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
- I used to have one with leaves

581
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,100
and I complained because it didn't smell very good.

582
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,780
And so it got replaced with a bar,

583
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,980
with a yellow bar with little specks of orange in it.

584
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,120
So, is that the funniest thing you guys have ever heard?

585
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,820
And yeah, it's made out of some kind of fat animal fat.

586
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,660
- And that's, and you--

587
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,420
(laughing)

588
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,260
- Yeah, real quick.

589
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,740
- Yeah, I got it from Captain Ape Hab,

590
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,380
and you keep that next to your basin?

591
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,220
- No.

592
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,060
(laughing)

593
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,880
- No.

594
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,980
- To him, a bidet is just like a little clay cup

595
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,460
that he splashes up his butt.

596
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,300
- You know what, you're my bidet.

597
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,580
- There's a river that runs through his apartment.

598
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,420
- No, it's not, I don't have a room for it.

599
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,660
- He takes baths in and does his laundry.

600
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,780
(laughing)

601
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,480
- Do you know how hard it was this morning

602
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,860
for those little birds to get this shirt on my body?

603
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,420
- No, you're not a little bird.

604
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,260
- You don't have little birds.

605
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,540
- I go, don't try and get in on it.

606
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,660
(whistling)

607
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,500
- He's not, yeah.

608
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,020
- And the birds come in and they go,

609
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,860
Caleb, can we make you a soft scrambled egg?

610
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,060
- I hate going to his house

611
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,540
'cause I always sit on his fuckin' washboard.

612
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,740
- Yeah.

613
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,580
- He has a bunch of--

614
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,420
- I wish you'd sit on my washboard, you sticky bitch.

615
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,060
- He has a bunch of servants that work for him for no pay.

616
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,020
- Yeah.

617
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,900
but they are white.

618
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,740
- Irish.

619
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,580
- Yep.

620
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,400
- Yeah, they're Irish.

621
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,980
- Which that's up for debate, I guess.

622
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,700
- I think Irish people should still be slaves.

623
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,100
(imitates drumming)

624
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,380
- You wish you had your soundboard.

625
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,180
- I didn't know it was ironic leftoid Wednesday today.

626
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,400
- You left your soundboard in a wooden box at your house.

627
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,580
- I do have a little bit.

628
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,400
- That's a good one.

629
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,240
(laughing)

630
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,660
- They're getting worse and worse.

631
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,500
Every time.

632
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,980
- 'Cause I don't know too many, I know corn brew.

633
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,140
- You don't know that many old things.

634
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,860
- I was talking to somebody the other day

635
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,260
and they saw my apartment.

636
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,160
- By telegram.

637
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,180
- All right, that's okay.

638
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,540
My apartment does kinda look like a 60 year old lady

639
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,860
adopted like a 12 year old Korean boy who loves video games.

640
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,700
- Yeah.

641
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,820
- And just has like, 'cause I have one little section

642
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,660
of the house.

643
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,420
- You have that one big monitor that has that 3D background,

644
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,120
that it moves, it's like the anime woman.

645
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,960
- Oh yeah.

646
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,780
- You have your waifu background.

647
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,700
- Yeah, Noah got all mad 'cause he went to my house

648
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,300
and then he texted me, he went to go watch the dog,

649
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,700
and then texted me, "What the fuck is wrong with you?"

650
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,820
I was like, "What do you mean?"

651
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,100
- That was funny. - He sent me a picture.

652
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,900
It made me laugh, but he was acting like

653
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,380
I was being all crazy because I said that.

654
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,860
Well, because the background used to be a picture of Rex,

655
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,460
and then my wife complained.

656
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,700
(laughing)

657
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,300
So I changed it to being like a 3D hentai thing,

658
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,180
of like her pussy is like dripping nasty.

659
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,540
- Yeah, that was so gross.

660
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,380
- That was the grossest thing.

661
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,220
- The best thing is you can--

662
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,740
- It made me laugh so hard every time I saw it.

663
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,580
- If you move your cursor over to it,

664
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,420
you can like put your, it like moves her body.

665
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,820
- You got like a virus down like that.

666
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,940
- Yeah, it's gotta be.

667
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,700
No, I use wallpaper engine.

668
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,580
- Oh, okay.

669
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,380
- And I actually, for a while I had it changing.

670
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,120
Every single day would be a different--

671
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,960
- White goon?

672
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,300
- No, for a while it was just different,

673
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,780
like there's so much porn on there

674
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,440
that I found like 50 different ones of Mrs. Incredible

675
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,820
where she's like stretching her vagina.

676
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,060
(laughing)

677
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,840
like all this nasty shit.

678
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,640
And so every day when she would ask me to change it,

679
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,540
'cause she thought I would be like, "Oh yeah, no problem."

680
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,840
And then it would just be a different one

681
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,540
every single time.

682
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,380
It's pretty fun, but--

683
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,360
- Yeah, it's fun.

684
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,460
You gotta have little pranks like that for yourself.

685
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,580
- Yeah, and at some point I gotta upgrade my RAM

686
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,820
because I think it was really,

687
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,140
my computer started really chugging.

688
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,980
- Make sure you get the right one.

689
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,900
- You know what I did last night?

690
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,100
I was talking to 'em, like before I went to bed,

691
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,140
just for like a minute, had my girlfriend--

692
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,980
- Talking to the ceiling.

693
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,580
- Had my girlfriend convinced that

694
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,440
no one hears from Susan Boyle anymore

695
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,080
'cause she got me toot.

696
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,780
(laughing)

697
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,580
- A really brutal one too.

698
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,220
- I was like, yeah, no, she like, it was like bad.

699
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,180
- Yeah, like I don't even wanna say it.

700
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,220
- Yeah, no one talks about Susan Boyle anymore

701
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,300
'cause she straight up was like, it's like years.

702
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
- Yeah, it was like, she was attacking people.

703
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,140
(laughing)

704
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,980
- Jesus.

705
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,500
- Can you, I mean, honestly, like I would feel,

706
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,980
if I was on a train car, like late at night

707
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,780
and it was just me and then I looked over

708
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,940
and Susan Boyle was the only other person on the,

709
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,180
I'm switching cars.

710
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,020
- Yeah.

711
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,840
- That would be scary.

712
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,020
- I would not, I would start singing

713
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,180
so that we would do a beautiful duet.

714
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,020
- You wanna do La La Land with Susan Boyle?

715
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,700
- Wouldn't be La La Land, no, I'd be singing,

716
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,620
what's that song?

717
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,380
- La La Land.

718
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,380
- E-40 and--

719
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,220
- Let's Fuck.

720
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,660
- E-40 and Gangsta Boo.

721
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,560
- Yeah, me and Susan Boyle singing that on the train.

722
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,400
- Nice.

723
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,240
- Do people come on, she's like,

724
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,500
"You want that, I want that."

725
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,340
- Yeah, I want that.

726
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,900
- I was talking to--

727
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,780
- Yeah, I want that dick, yeah I want that dick.

728
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,340
- I was talking to Chad last night

729
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,360
about how when we were in middle school,

730
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,780
his mom was real strict about the music he would listen to,

731
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,200
the movies he would watch and stuff.

732
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,300
And me and him had a shared playlist

733
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,820
of just every song we liked on Spotify.

734
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,960
No sir.

735
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,540
And his mom came up and was like,

736
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,220
oh yeah, what kind of music do you listen to?

737
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,340
And put his headphones on and just clicked shuffle.

738
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,140
It's like a 5,000 song playlist.

739
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,940
and the one song that came up was "Let's Fuck"

740
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,540
before they made "Samoo."

741
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,740
(laughing)

742
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,940
It's pretty unlucky, man.

743
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,780
- Yeah.

744
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,780
- Yeah, who listens to that song?

745
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,740
- Who listens to that song? - Me!

746
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,140
- We listen to that song in the car

747
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,780
or boat or truck tour. - Yeah, but it's just funny--

748
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,460
- I liked it, I still like it.

749
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,300
I listen to that every once in a while.

750
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,100
- It's just funny to imagine someone just turning it on--

751
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,260
- It's like a twice a year song.

752
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
- Yeah.

753
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,060
- You either listen to it in the car

754
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,740
or it comes on in the club or something.

755
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,540
- That's what I'm saying, it's funny to imagine a guy

756
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,020
who's sitting down alone and he puts it on in his headphone.

757
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,680
- Or you put it on to eat pussy.

758
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,520
- Yeah.

759
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,260
- Like you're like, I need to use,

760
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,100
this is how I get in the zone.

761
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,500
- Put it on to amp yourself up.

762
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,340
- Yeah.

763
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,020
- You ever listen to like, you ever like have your--

764
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,900
- Or listen to it on the treadmill?

765
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,740
- Oh yeah.

766
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
- And you're doing the thing with your hands,

767
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,220
you're kind of doing the air drumming a little bit.

768
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,300
- I've seen something crazy since I moved to New York

769
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,540
and started going to the gyms here.

770
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,900
- Yeah.

771
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,140
- People go onto the treadmills and they--

772
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,380
- No.

773
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,260
- Buddy, it gets worse.

774
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,180
People go onto the treadmills and they dance.

775
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,020
- Yeah. - On long--

776
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,500
- People do some insane stuff on the treadmill.

777
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,200
I go, like, I feel like, not that I know that much

778
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,380
about exercising in general, but I see,

779
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,360
I feel like every time I go to the gym

780
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,380
and I see people on the treadmills,

781
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,600
there's always at least one person where I'm like,

782
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,020
that is not something that you are supposed to do.

783
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
- Well, you guys are going sideways and backwards

784
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,380
and lipping around and lifting their knees up to their chin

785
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,860
and stuff, like, what are you doing?

786
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,900
- Okay, go, Jim.

787
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,900
There's an amazing guy at the gym I used to go to

788
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,800
where he would get on the treadmill

789
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,300
and he'd crank the incline all the way up to the max

790
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,000
incline where he's like basically walking,

791
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,580
like facing the ceiling.

792
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,580
And he dresses exactly like Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man

793
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,460
when he's a wrestler,

794
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,460
like a full red and blue hoodie jumpsuit.

795
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,260
And he just walks just like this

796
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,080
and he holds onto the thing.

797
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,700
And this guy is sweating gallons of sweat

798
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,540
every single time.

799
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,580
It's the hardest workout I've ever seen.

800
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,980
- When I used to go to Planet Fitness,

801
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,500
there was a guy who sometimes would go,

802
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,420
he would run backwards at like,

803
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,100
like really fucking, like 10 speed,

804
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,820
and he was holding weights in his hands.

805
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,660
- I love that shit.

806
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,700
- It's so awesome.

807
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,540
- I wanna do that.

808
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,420
- You know what else I don't get?

809
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,940
People who go on the treadmill

810
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,540
and they just walk for 40 minutes

811
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,020
and they're not like watching the TV or anything,

812
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,180
they're just listening to music and walking for like--

813
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,260
- They need to let me bring my TV into the gym.

814
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,180
- They have plenty of TVs, and you do have a TV,

815
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,020
it's called a phone.

816
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
- I don't think so.

817
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,200
- Nowadays it's at your fingertips.

818
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,180
I am going to start bringing my iPad to the gym.

819
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,020
- No, I have a CRT TV.

820
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,860
- That's cool, I'm pretty excited to watch it.

821
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,680
- Speed drawing.

822
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,220
- I'm watching a million different kinds of pixel art videos,

823
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,780
like animated, like Neon Cat.

824
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,660
- You can do that on your phone.

825
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,300
- But it doesn't have the same glow as a CRT monitor, you fool.

826
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,180
- Get out, leave.

827
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,100
- He doesn't even get it.

828
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,260
Actually, he wouldn't get it.

829
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,180
His TV has a crank on it.

830
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,420
(laughing)

831
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,060
- A crank.

832
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,340
There's no TVs with cranks this doesn't exist

833
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,800
He's gonna say TVs wouldn't or something. Yeah, I said it had a crank I guess

834
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,820
Yeah, I guess I'm used

835
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:38,740
I do want to get a new TV

836
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:47,700
Like a 15 inch TV, well, I'm saying I want to get a TV on it

837
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,180
He is a zine it flopped it you're hitting your batting like good 400 crank was really good. It was good

838
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,420
Just leave it hit it again. You know you need to know when to go in to fold them a

839
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,300
TV with two cranks though

840
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,460
Damn, yo, so two people can watch it

841
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:12,620
Now I'm in this bad situation where I want to get a bigger TV, and she's saying no we have to get a projector

842
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,300
And I tell I literally I talked to like this

843
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,720
I was like if we're gonna get a projector. I would want to spend like six thousand dollars. Yeah

844
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,300
Yeah, are you ready to do this also? No live in a normal house?

845
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,860
There's no chance a projector will ever use it

846
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,860
They're all it like you have to have no windows in your house at all. Yeah, like a Alamo draft house, bitch

847
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,140
I want to watch fucking sports. I'm trying to get your Squidward. Yeah office though. I'm trying to see Squidward's own show

848
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,420
- Oh, there is a projector over there, I found one.

849
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,260
- What?

850
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,700
- There's a projector all the way over there.

851
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,860
- But it's one of these little like Pico ones.

852
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,700
- Yeah.

853
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,380
- I want like a, I would literally wanna get

854
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,020
- It only goes in 701D. - The same one they have

855
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,860
in a movie theater.

856
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,700
- Yeah, that's what you should,

857
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,220
if you're getting a projector - I don't have room in my house

858
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,060
- That's what you should be getting.

859
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,880
- Yeah.

860
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,720
- Yeah.

861
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,540
- 'Cause there's no, yeah. - $45,000.

862
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,380
- Yeah.

863
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,220
- I used to have like a - Yeah.

864
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,020
- Put IMAX reels into it.

865
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,060
- I used to have like a home theater projector

866
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,580
that had like a DVD player built into it.

867
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,420
- That's cool.

868
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,540
- At the time, it was one of those ones that in 2003

869
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,460
was like $5,000.

870
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,020
- Oh my God, how'd you afford that?

871
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,860
- It was my ex's dad's and he gave it to me.

872
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,060
- When you were 2003, you were six.

873
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,480
- It was my ex's dad's and he gave it to me.

874
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,320
So that was my--

875
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,180
- You had a girlfriend, you had an ex-girlfriend at six?

876
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,560
- No.

877
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,400
- Oh.

878
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,300
- It was when, it was in 2018.

879
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,260
- Is in the future, okay, I get it.

880
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,960
- Then I lost the remote so I could not watch like a single,

881
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,500
like we would put something in,

882
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,580
and it's just like damn, I can't even.

883
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,460
- You know what I wanna see make a comeback?

884
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,540
Something I haven't seen in a while.

885
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,900
A universal remote control.

886
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
They're still around.

887
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,980
I have not seen one at somebody's house in a decade.

888
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,020
If you have the Roku app and someone has a Roku TV

889
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,860
and they're on the same Wi-Fi--

890
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,980
I'm not talking about your bullshit iPhone shit.

891
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,820
Oh my God.

892
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,020
I wanna see a giant--

893
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,860
Yeah, he doesn't wanna talk about iPhones.

894
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,340
I'm not gonna get into why, though.

895
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,180
Tell me why.

896
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,020
Go ahead, why.

897
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,140
'Cause I have a wood phone?

898
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,700
Shut the fuck up.

899
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,220
Shut the fuck up.

900
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,540
You ate fries for lunch.

901
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,780
He contacts everyone on the Pony Express.

902
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,940
- Rose and iPhone, like I, like Roman numeral,

903
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,540
like one, like the first phone, like one,

904
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,220
like from the Roman times, iPhone.

905
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,060
- And it's made out of a rock.

906
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,880
- That was almost good.

907
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,100
- It's made out of a rock, and it's made out of a rock,

908
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,700
and a pillar, 'cause it's Roman.

909
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
- That doesn't make any sense, man.

910
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
A pillar?

911
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,660
A pillar is giant, there's no such thing as a small pillar.

912
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,700
- Hey man, a pillar's what you sleep on.

913
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,860
- Okay guys.

914
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,780
- Okay guys, let's move on.

915
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,620
- Yeah. - Come on.

916
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,780
- Is there anything, what else about my ancient life?

917
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,420
- You have to mention something else.

918
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,180
- So I was, I had, I made coffee this morning.

919
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,340
How do you guys think I made coffee?

920
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,220
- You bought it from a native.

921
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,520
- You were on the frontier.

922
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,620
You were on the frontier and you made it over a campfire.

923
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,460
Okay, next.

924
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,820
- Yeah, okay, and I got into a war today.

925
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,860
I did a whole war with a different warring tribe.

926
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,780
And how did I do that?

927
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,260
What was my weapons, how did I do it?

928
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,900
- Yeah, and the tribe was made out of wood.

929
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,740
- Yeah.

930
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,900
- Yeah. (laughing)

931
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,180
- The whole war with the wooden tribe.

932
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,020
- Yeah, I was in my cave.

933
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,860
- And the war had a crank on it.

934
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,220
- Yeah, wood war three.

935
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,220
- I woke, wood war three, that's good.

936
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,700
I woke up in my cave today.

937
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,860
What's my cave made out of?

938
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,220
- Metal. - Metal.

939
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,540
- It's from the future.

940
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,060
That's called a subversion of expectations.

941
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,100
- You were expecting something,

942
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,180
we come in with something else.

943
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,180
- Yep, and you're a cyborg.

944
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,380
- And I went to church today.

945
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,220
What kind of church do I go to, guys?

946
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,660
- You sit in the pew and they say P-U

947
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,740
when you get in there, 'cause you fucking stink like shit

948
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,580
with your little soap bar.

949
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,540
- I've heard you do that before.

950
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,380
- I've heard you say that one before.

951
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,860
- A little stinky little soap bar.

952
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,580
- You didn't say, you weren't gonna go like,

953
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,100
oh, you're-- - You are--

954
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,500
- It's Apollo, maybe. - You literally,

955
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,500
you bathe in Jess Pachuli, and you have one big dreadlock.

956
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,420
And I'm looking at you right now.

957
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,140
- I don't, I don't, you're--

958
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,980
- And you have one big dreadlock.

959
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,300
- Why do you have to specify you're looking at me?

960
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,220
I don't have any luck.

961
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,460
- I'm looking past you, and all I can see is a fly--

962
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,260
- I don't have any dreadlocks. - Who is high as hell,

963
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,820
and he lives in your dreadlock.

964
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,900
- A high fly? - And you have a,

965
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,900
- You have a white dreadlock, like the Matrix twin.

966
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,260
One though, one big one, and it stands straight up

967
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,540
and it looks like, honestly, I don't wanna be offensive

968
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,700
right now, but it looks like a white Cheeto.

969
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,980
- And I don't think I have that.

970
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,580
I don't think I've ever had that.

971
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,980
- You have one big white Cheeto dreadlock.

972
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,860
- Yeah, and it's got a crank on it.

973
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,300
Yeah, it's made of wood.

974
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,140
You realize how much of an asshole--

975
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,980
- Your shirt is made of wood.

976
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,380
- Can we not bring up the shirt?

977
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,580
I'm already feeling so bad about my shirt.

978
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,420
My shirt choice.

979
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,740
- Wait, your shirt looks good.

980
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,580
- Yeah, this is--

981
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,860
- Makes you look strong and cartoony.

982
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,700
- This is not--

983
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,860
(laughing)

984
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,200
This is not the kind of--

985
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,700
- This is from Montgomery Ward.

986
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,540
This is like a, this shirt from like 1960 something.

987
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,980
- This shirt from 1960 something.

988
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,760
Why are you talking like that?

989
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,300
- I turned urban.

990
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,500
- Of when you saw that I had an old shirt on?

991
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,220
No, I don't know--

992
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,700
- This, honestly, because this is like a Montgomery Ward

993
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,200
and it's fitting you like this,

994
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
this is actually a child's shirt.

995
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
- This is not a child, bro, you think any,

996
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,800
what kind of strong-ass, buff-ass child

997
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,700
are you hanging out with?

998
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,700
- This is supposed to be for a little fat kid.

999
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,200
- Rose, an expert on children's clothing.

1000
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,700
- Okay, wait, you know what, wait, wait,

1001
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,700
hold on, I would like you to get up

1002
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,200
and untuck your shirt and pull it down.

1003
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,700
- You are not making me do that.

1004
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
- No, no, no, if we're gonna talk goofy shirts,

1005
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,700
get up, get the fuck up.

1006
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Right now, show these people what happened.

1007
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,100
I'm only showing it because it's actually a new kind of style that okay. Yeah. Yeah. No no go ahead and show people

1008
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:40,740
Okay, so this is a shirt right now pull that thing all the way down low and it's not being stretched

1009
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,740
And that is not true

1010
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,500
Yeah, I bought a pack of t-shirts. Yeah, and I did it

1011

So yeah, so yeah, I bought a bag of t-shirts I bought them from

00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,220
From the store and it turns out

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,440
And it turns out that yes, they were tall

1015
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,500
I'd accidentally bought tall tees

1016
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,460
You look so crazy when you can't see your leg

1017

So I have that if you guys want to listen to that later

- So a statue.

1044
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,940
- Oh.

1045
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,040
That's not a celebrity sighting.

1046
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,640
- I'm sorry, wait, James Madison.

1047
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,560
- Yeah, James Adams.

1048
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,840
- And George Washington.

1049
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,640
- I just believe, I was like, oh yeah,

1050
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,720
that's probably a president, I don't know.

1051
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,560
- And I saw a lot of statues.

1052
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,400
- You didn't see George Washington.

1053
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,960
- I saw a George Washington statue in Faneuil Hall.

1054
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,800
- Okay.

1055
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,680
- Is that, no, that's not who that is.

1056
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,920
- No, I saw all sorts of people.

1057
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
- Nathaniel Hall.

1058
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,320
- I saw all sorts of people, all types.

1059
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
They're everywhere all the time.

1060
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,460
I think in this big ass melting pot of a side. I saw adults. I saw teenagers. I saw fathers

1061
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,120
and sons. I saw mothers and daughters. Damn. Well, they get professors. I saw students.

1062
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,240
I saw did not see any scientists. Damn. Was they getting it on though? I was out. I was

1063
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,120
out hunting for for the police officers who are going to do that thing to Trump. Mom and

1064
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,480
daughter. Mom and daughter porn is really, really hot until you start thinking about

1065
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
the situation.

1066
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,840
And you go, yeah, the fact that after

1067
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,480
the aftermath would be bad, the

1068
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
aftermath. You can think all day

1069
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,440
about, oh, it'd be so hot to fuck a

1070
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,280
mom and a daughter.

1071
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,320
That's a life ruined.

1072
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,000
But two lives.

1073
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,720
You should think about that before

1074
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,640
you like all of that

1075
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,480
stuff is disgusting.

1076
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,160
Incest.

1077
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,280
Patrick's on the anti it's

1078
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
way incest based or cringe.

1079
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,760
Just simple.

1080
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,360
There's a lot of different types.

1081
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,560
Yeah. Any two boys cringe.

1082
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,000
Any two girls.

1083
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
- What about boy girl?

1084
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,280
- Boy girl, if I'm one of the boys, it's based.

1085
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,020
- I guess it's basically legal.

1086
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,920
- That's wincest, my friend.

1087
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,480
Pound that out.

1088
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,280
You guys remember that?

1089
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,840
Pound that out.

1090
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,680
Yes sir.

1091
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,200
- I won't be pounding it out 'cause I remember it.

1092
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,040
- Yeah.

1093
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,320
- That's gross though.

1094
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,560
- You wish, you wish it was gross.

1095
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,280
- So pornography.

1096
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,240
- Pornography is cringe.

1097
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,440
- Actually, now that people have started hating it,

1098
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
- It's based again.

1099
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,480
- Okay, so what about--

1100
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,760
- Contrarianism is a yes.

1101
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,120
- Well, it's cringe if you say it, but we just do it.

1102
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,200
- Which is more based versus cringe, okay?

1103
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,040
- Japanese style things?

1104
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,320
- Porn is cringe or maybe based, that's not what I have--

1105
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,160
- Japanese stuff is based again.

1106
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,480
- It's based, it was cringe for a while,

1107
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,080
but it's coming back to base.

1108
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,120
Pornographical videos or not safe for work porn gifs.

1109
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,520
- If you are a guy who only jacks off to pictures still,

1110
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,600
that is the most based shit I've ever seen.

1111
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,720
solo pictures of naked women,

1112
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,600
I could see the most beautiful woman in the world

1113
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,080
completely naked and I literally,

1114
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,380
like it won't do anything for me.

1115
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,400
It's like looking at a fucking crossword.

1116
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,080
But if I, like it's that level of arousal.

1117
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,000
But if people still like that, that's based.

1118
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,840
GIFs?

1119
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,440
- Animated GIFs.

1120
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,280
- Animated GIFs?

1121
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,420
- GIF of a train coming to the station.

1122
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,920
- If you can jack off to that,

1123
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,080
then you are a train.

1124
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,280
- Okay, you might be a train.

1125
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,840
(laughing)

1126
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,000
If you see a train enter the station,

1127
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,640
- And that gets you hard!

1128
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,700
- Which is more-- - You might be a train.

1129
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,280
- Which is more based or cringe, apples or oranges?

1130
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
- Which is more based or cringe?

1131
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,120
(laughing)

1132
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,920
- I guess oranges are more for,

1133
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,000
coming from a personal standpoint, for me.

1134
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,320
- Yeah. - Not for most people.

1135
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,440
- That's not how based and cringe works, though.

1136
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,680
- Apples, unless they're cooked, are cringe.

1137
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,760
- That's crazy.

1138
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,600
- Yeah. - And oranges are based.

1139
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,840
- What you just said is cringe, Mike.

1140
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,760
- You have a dessert birthday party brain.

1141
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,160
- Oral allergy syndrome is actually fucking cringe.

1142
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,000
And it's actually-- - I agree.

1143
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,160
- It affects some people. - I agree, it's really,

1144
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,000
really crazy.

1145
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,720
- You have the kind of allergy where if you ate

1146
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,080
just a certain diet for two weeks, it'd be gone forever.

1147
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,920
- Maybe.

1148
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,760
- You have that kind of level of allergy.

1149
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,580
- Well no, 'cause it's like--

1150
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,140
- You have an autoimmune disorder.

1151
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,720
- Let's test my allergies on the podcast.

1152
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,560
- I'm down.

1153
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,680
- We'll get a bunch of fruit--

1154
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,520
- 'Cause you don't have any--

1155
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,360
- A bunch of burst of collagen.

1156
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,180
- That's if you're, it'll kill you.

1157
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,160
- Yeah, you never-- - It won't kill me.

1158
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,880
- Your throat never closed up, right?

1159
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,720
Then you're fine.

1160
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,560
- Well, I mean, if we have Zyrtec on hand,

1161
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,400
- We'll get an EpiPen and some Zyrtec.

1162
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,240
- So it's not a real allergy.

1163
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,760
- Yeah, and if you just, if you--

1164
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,920
- I'll eat a cherry, and then you'll see how bad it gets.

1165
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,760
- It's not that bad.

1166
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,800
- No, dude, there's like an old photo of me

1167
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,720
where my front lip is just like this,

1168
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,960
and I talked like that, and my eye was all red

1169
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,800
from itching it.

1170
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,880
- Your eye turned red from itching?

1171
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,240
- Yeah.

1172
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,920
I ate a bunch of cherries from my friend's farm.

1173
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,760
- No.

1174
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,200
Maybe you're just allergic to stuff from your friends.

1175
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,160
- Friends' cherries.

1176
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,600
- Maybe they were dosing me.

1177
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
- Maybe they were dosing me with allergens.

1178
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,640
- No, no, no, no, no, I mean like maybe your friend,

1179
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,880
like if you get a gift from a friend, that makes sense.

1180
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,960
You would maybe have an allergic reaction

1181
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,400
that could leave a cold mark.

1182
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,080
- So, cherries.

1183
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,720
So say whether you're allergic or not allergic.

1184
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,560
Okay, I'm gonna say some things here.

1185
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
- I love 'em when they're, I can eat it all.

1186
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,680
- I know, it's a one word.

1187
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,960
This is one word. - So you have to say raw.

1188
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,160
You have to say raw before it all.

1189
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,280
- Raw cherries.

1190
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,120
- Cringe.

1191
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,840
- No, say you're allergic or not allergic.

1192
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,600
- Allergic. - I wanna show something here.

1193
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,680
- Allergic.

1194
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
- Raw carrots.

1195
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
- Allergic.

1196
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,120
- Chocolate cake.

1197
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,480
- Not allergic.

1198
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,840
- Okay, that's all I needed to--

1199
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,280
- Well, chocolate cake with cooked cherries on top,

1200
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,760
like a Schwarzwald-Kirschdorfer.

1201
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,880
- You said cooked is fine.

1202
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,720
- Black Forest.

1203
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,560
- So, okay, see-- - So, still not allergic.

1204
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,760
- See, that's not-- - Schwarzwald-Kirschdorfer.

1205
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,520
- That is how you know it's a fake allergy,

1206
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,240
because God didn't design anybody to eat chocolate cake.

1207
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
- Yeah, he did. - No, he didn't.

1208
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,600
- Bruce Bogtrotter, or whatever--

1209
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,880
- Yeah, milkshakes.

1210
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
- Yeah, are you allergic to milkshakes?

1211
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,940
- Can you drink a milkshake?

1212
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,460
- Sometimes.

1213
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,520
I mean, in my old age now, I can't.

1214
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,300
All the sugar puts me to sleep.

1215
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,400
- But the milk is okay?

1216
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,380
- Milk is the best.

1217
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,500
- Milk, that must, yeah.

1218
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,340
- Yeah, you have a thing.

1219
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,500
If you are more allergic to raw carrots

1220
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,900
than you are to milk-- - Well, it's hazelnuts.

1221
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,300
I'm allergic to certain nuts, too.

1222
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,420
It all falls under the birch pollen thing.

1223
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,320
So I'm allergic to a pollen.

1224
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,380
We've talked about this ad nauseum.

1225
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,280
- I'm gonna paw you into the bathroom.

1226
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,320
Lock the door.

1227
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,780
You're not gonna Paul me in the...

1228
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Watch you poop.

1229
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
You're gonna George Michael me in the bathroom.

1230
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,780
I don't know what that is.

1231
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Pop that raw cherry.

1232
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,780
Yeah, that's one raw cherry I'm not allergic to.

1233
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,780
This is the one that's in your butt.

1234
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
I'm gonna cook it.

1235
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
I'm gonna make a prolapse.

1236
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,780
Do you guys have butt cherries?

1237
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
Can you pop it off? It doesn't bleed?

1238
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
That's what...

1239
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,780
Somebody explained that to me.

1240
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,780
That kid that showed me Three Guys One Hammer

1241
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,780
when I was a kid. He explained to me that that's

1242
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,980
what a cherry pop is.

1243
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,140
It's like, oh, you have sex with a virgin

1244
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,820
and then she bleeds everywhere.

1245
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,380
And I was like, sex is gross.

1246
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,940
Sex is gross and disgusting.

1247
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,780
- It is, the first time.

1248
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,980
- And then he showed me Two Girls, One Cup

1249
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,060
and I was like, sex is really gross.

1250
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,820
- So this is these girls' cherries

1251
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,980
that falls into the cup?

1252
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,980
- Ew!

1253
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,380
- They got their cherries popped?

1254
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,420
- That's the cherry pop from the butt?

1255
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,460
- Oh.

1256
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,300
- That's not right.

1257
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,140
- Ew.

1258
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,300
Weird sauce.

1259
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,140
- I'll soda pop the cherry.

1260
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,300
- I looked at that list, that lolshock.com list,

1261
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,700
every single video I clicked on,

1262
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,500
and then I said weird sauce, and it became normal.

1263
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,340
- It's normal.

1264
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,820
- When you say weird sauce, it turns something normal.

1265
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,980
- I do wish that I had, I do a little bit wish

1266
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,660
that I had a hymen, because there's no proof

1267
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,560
that I've never had anything in there.

1268
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,020
- Never, oh, your butt.

1269
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,140
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1270
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,980
- There's no, like, if there was a butt gynecologist--

1271
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,740
- I bet they could figure it out, though.

1272
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,100
- Well, but maybe not for me.

1273
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,460
- Yeah, there is a butt gynecologist.

1274
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,580
It's Cameron you're saying?

1275
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,900
That's kind of good actually.

1276
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,140
Yeah, he's got some kind of butt gynecology.

1277
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,940
Can we just get like a lower third?

1278
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,620
(laughing)

1279
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,100
Cameron Fetter, butt gynecology.

1280
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,220
- Put your feet in the stirrups.

1281
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,540
No, not that way, lay on your stomach.

1282
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,460
(laughing)

1283
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,660
- You gotta flip over.

1284
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,980
- Flip over, turn over.

1285
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,820
(laughing)

1286
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,180
I'm trying to look at it from the back.

1287
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,020
- Yeah.

1288
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,340
- 'Cause I'm your doctor.

1289
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,180
- I'm your doctor.

1290
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,020
- 'Cause I'm your doctor.

1291
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,060
- I'm your butt gynecologist.

1292
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,100
- I need to look at it.

1293
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,940
- You guys are laughing,

1294
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,580
that would actually be a really unprofessional way

1295
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,420
to go about it.

1296
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,020
- Not if you're a butt gynecologist.

1297
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:19,940
- No rules.

1298
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,140
- Butt gynecologist, the first,

1299
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,100
you take the doctor's oath

1300
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,620
and then you take the butt gynecologist oath

1301
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,260
and it's just have some fun.

1302
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,260
- And you listen to Down 1.50, Jeremiah.

1303
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,580
- I vow to have some fun.

1304
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,420
- Yeah.

1305
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,220
- And you put your hand on 101 Silly Billy Jokes.

1306
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,060
- Yeah.

1307
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,980
- And you swear to George Carlin.

1308
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,340
- And the waiting room music, I play--

1309
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,700
- You put your hand on the stinky cheese man.

1310
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,340
- I play a bunch of music that has a bunch of like

1311
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,000
slide whistles and stuff.

1312
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,100
They go like, whoop whoop whoop!

1313
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,820
Let's get it started, circus remix.

1314
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,100
You're playing Afro Circus from Madagascar.

1315
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,340
Let's get it started, Circa 2001 remix.

1316
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,620
Different lyric.

1317
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,920
If you guys were becoming the president,

1318
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,980
what are you swearing in on?

1319
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,500
Because I think I've spot one, two, three

1320
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,980
hardline atheists in this room.

1321
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,820
Yep.

1322
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,660
Oh, okay, wait.

1323
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,140
I'd be swearing in on Dianetics.

1324
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,540
I have an answer as an America hater.

1325
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,380
What?

1326
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,420
I will be swearing in on a landmine.

1327
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,140
- Damn. - Put my hand down on it,

1328
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,460
take 'em all out.

1329
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,540
- Damn. - Boom, boom, boom.

1330
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,660
- I'd swear in on Dianetics to become

1331
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,500
the official religion of the United States,

1332
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,760
and then I'd say, checkmate, atheist.

1333
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,460
- I would make the lady hold a piece of poop

1334
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,300
that I could swear on,

1335
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,380
'cause you know they have somebody hold the thing?

1336
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,180
So I'd walk up and I'd just squish the poo

1337
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,580
into her hand. - And you'd be wearing a glove.

1338
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,020
- Yeah, and I'd be like, ew!

1339
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,260
- I think it was like a plastic cup of diarrhea.

1340
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,860
- Then I just-- - And you crushed the cup.

1341
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,660
- That was pouring out. - Like a Danimal.

1342
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,740
Remember the Danimal drinker cups?

1343
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,580
- You crushed those?

1344
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,060
- Zach and Cody were in the commercial,

1345
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,340
and then you like, they were like,

1346
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,860
"There's a sweet steak, so you can go on a cruise with us."

1347
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,500
- I remember Zach and Cody having a sweet steak.

1348
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,380
- So I learned that it's not a sweet steak.

1349
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,260
- You literally ate a glue stick as a kid or something.

1350
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,780
- No, no, I used to huff it.

1351
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,300
- I was a huffer.

1352
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,260
I was a huffer in art class and I used to huff.

1353
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,700
- I tried to huff paint thinner.

1354
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,540
- You were a chewer?

1355
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,820
- I tried to huff paint thinner

1356
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,980
'cause I learned about it through this song,

1357
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,460
Lacquerhead by Primus.

1358
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,300
- Yeah.

1359
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,540
(scatting)

1360
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,780
- No, we're not doing Primus songs again.

1361
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,500
- But they're fun.

1362
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
- Every song is fun.

1363
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,340
If you guys get to do Primus,

1364
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,780
then I get to do Miley Cyrus.

1365
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,620
- Miley Primus?

1366
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,460
- Sometimes I'm hot and sometimes I'm not.

1367
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,280
- Miley, do Miley Primus.

1368
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,460
♪ This world turns slowly ♪

1369
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,220
♪ It cuts you deep and it leaves a scar ♪

1370
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,220
- You heard that song?

1371
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,820
- I'm gonna fucking cry, bro.

1372
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,900
- Yeah. - What song is it?

1373
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,580
- Nothing Breaks Like a Heart.

1374
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,740
With her and the guy who made

1375
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,660
Don't Believe Me Just Watch, that song.

1376
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,660
- Bruno Mars or Bart Bronson?

1377
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,980
- Bart Bronson. - Or Action Bronson.

1378
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,660
- Did you know that Bruno Mars gave Trinidad James--

1379
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,980
- I'm the one who told you that story!

1380
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,700
- You did tell me that and you told me on the podcast.

1381
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,140
- Yeah, and you're telling it back to me.

1382
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,460
- Okay, I have another fun fact about Bruno Mars.

1383
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,940
- You have a wooden brain!

1384
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,100
- Do you know that Bruno Mars is actually Filipino?

1385
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,940
- Your brain and body needs a cram.

1386
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,020
- I have a Bruno Mars fact.

1387
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,040
He has millions of fans worldwide.

1388
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,540
Even to this day.

1389
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,020
- Wow, yeah.

1390
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,340
That's a good, I didn't know that.

1391
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,340
I really didn't know that.

1392
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,460
- You'd think he'd fell off,

1393
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,140
or lots of people would think he's mad now.

1394
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,140
- I heard that his album 24 Karat Gold Magic is really good.

1395
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,220
Can you attest to this?

1396
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,060
Are you one of his fans?

1397
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,880
- I don't know, I've never listened

1398
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,720
to one of his song music.

1399
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,660
- He made some kind of duo album

1400
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,700
with Anderson .Paak called Starsky and Hutch or some shit.

1401
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,420
- He performed one time at Sports Bowl,

1402
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,020
which I don't watch, so I've never seen that performance.

1403
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,540
- Yeah, that's a no for me.

1404
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,740
- What is that?

1405
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,780
- That's a no from me, I don't wanna see all that bullshit.

1406
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,140
- I thought it was supposed to be a ball.

1407
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,420
It looks more like an egg.

1408
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,260
- They literally--

1409
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,100
- And that's also, that's a song.

1410
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,540
- It looks more like an almond to me.

1411
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,700
(laughing)

1412
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,460
- At the Sports Bowl Olympics.

1413
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,980
- So where's the ball?

1414
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,700
- We're tossing around an oversized almond.

1415
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,140
- I'm just seeing a bunch of morons throwing a nut.

1416
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,180
What the hell?

1417
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,140
- When they--

1418
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,900
- Oh, interesting, a bunch of morons in tights

1419
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,460
trying to get their nut.

1420
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,300
- They have literally--

1421
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,780
- Looks a little hobo-erotic.

1422
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,580
- Like all these mainstream artists at the Super Bowl

1423
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,780
and it pisses me off because--

1424
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,740
- That's the--

1425
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,580
- Sorry.

1426
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,820
- It's fucking mainstream, they have mainstream-ass

1427
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,860
bubblegum shit like Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber.

1428
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,980
- I don't want bubblegum shit, I want bubble guts shit.

1429
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,940
I want beer songs with Toby Keene.

1430
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,620
- Yep, beer.

1431
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,100
♪ Riding through the night ♪

1432
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,940
- That is such an awesome--

1433
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,460
- ♪ And the evil force is saying ♪

1434
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,860
- The old crappy standup bit is about how football

1435
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,820
is actually gay because you stand on your hand

1436
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,820
and a guy's ass. - Here's the sports ball guy,

1437
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,860
okay, he goes to the game and he's like,

1438
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,740
oh, a bunch of grown buff men

1439
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,580
wrestling each other in tights, seems pretty gay.

1440
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:50,020
Yeah, I'd rather have the cheerleaders dancing up on me

1441
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,700
and rubbing their butts on my penis.

1442
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,700
- Yes. - And he's sitting

1443
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,740
in the stands saying, where are the cheerleaders at?

1444
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,000
- But football is gay because they wear purple.

1445
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,260
- It's gay 'cause they have team names.

1446
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,100
- Yeah. - And the guys

1447
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:02,920
should not be wearing purple.

1448
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,260
- Oh, what, you wanna be a Bronco?

1449
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,780
(laughing)

1450
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,140
- Oh yeah, you wanna be a bronco?

1451
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,100
- Oh, you're a buccaneer?

1452
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,860
- Yeah, oh, you can play dress up.

1453
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,660
You got a friend who dresses up?

1454
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,660
You're gay, man.

1455
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,380
- It's like someone who names their apartment.

1456
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,360
- But they actually do a lot for,

1457
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,500
they actually do a lot for the armed forces.

1458
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,100
- Yeah, this place is actually called the mothership.

1459
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,540
- Yeah, that's what the apartment is.

1460
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,380
- That's what it means on a football team.

1461
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,220
- Pretty much.

1462
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,140
- Me and my friends need a name and a logo.

1463
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,380
- Or you go to somebody's house and they name a room.

1464
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,220
- Yeah.

1465
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,100
- They're like, yeah, this is called the command center.

1466
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,500
- Yeah, this is a living room.

1467
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,340
- Yeah.

1468
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,180
- Yeah.

1469
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,420
(laughing)

1470
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,820
- You know it ain't like that.

1471
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,320
You know it ain't like that.

1472
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,160
- Got it.

1473
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,980
- It ain't, it ain't.

1474
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,100
- No, that's a designation, that's not a name.

1475
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,940
- You have--

1476
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,820
- That's a legal designation.

1477
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,720
- You have the loom room in your house,

1478
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,020
and you spin straw.

1479
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,180
- You're the fruit of the loom room,

1480
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,180
where you eat underwear.

1481
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,020
- Yeah, I do.

1482
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,840
- Fuck you.

1483
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,020
- Women's underwear.

1484
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,860
- Gay.

1485
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,620
- How's that gay?

1486
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,940
- 'Cause you're eating it to absorb its powers.

1487
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,780
(laughing)

1488
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,700
- Yep, gay.

1489
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,140
- Yeah, you weren't gay before you ate it,

1490
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,980
but you became gay after.

1491
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,260
- I became gay after eating pink underwear.

1492
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,420
- Yeah, because you were eating it

1493
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,820
trying to get a lace power.

1494
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,820
- Here's a stand up, yeah,

1495
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,620
I'd love to know Victoria's secret.

1496
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,460
- Yeah.

1497
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,620
As long as it's the size and depth of her vagina

1498
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,900
and the length of her nipples when they're hard.

1499
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,860
- And rap lyrics have gotten weird.

1500
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,700
- Go ahead.

1501
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,780
- Have you noticed that maybe

1502
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,180
Stacey's mom is Jessie's girl?

1503
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,380
- Hey guys, I'd love to do a little bit of a joke here

1504
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,740
about rap lyrics and how strange their slang is,

1505
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,940
but unfortunately I can't understand the damn things.

1506
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,780
- Yeah.

1507
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,620
- Yeah, I tried to--

1508
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,740
- So here, I wrote down a lyric for me to kind of

1509
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,100
dissect and analyze for you guys.

1510
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,140
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1511
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,780
rap, rap, rap, blah, blah.

1512
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,700
- It's crap.

1513
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,100
(laughing)

1514
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,940
- Folks, it's crap.

1515
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,700
- Folks, this is crap.

1516
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,340
- And football is played with an almond.

1517
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,060
- And football is kind of for gay guys.

1518
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,500
(laughing)

1519
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,860
- And rap is crap and football is for gays

1520
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,140
- And blues music and wearing raw denim

1521
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,860
is for real straight guys.

1522
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,060
- Let's analyze the lyrics of opera.

1523
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,820
- Yeah, there's nothing straighter than raw denim.

1524
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,260
There's nothing straighter than raw denim.

1525
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,980
You pay $500 for a pair of pants

1526
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,740
and you have to sit in a bathtub with them.

1527
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,740
- You have to sit in a bathtub with them on.

1528
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,360
- And they, if you sit on your friend's white couch

1529
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,700
in a pair of raw denim.

1530
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,540
- Yeah.

1531
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,660
- Fucking cone denim shit.

1532
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,900
You sit on your friend's couch,

1533
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,260
you leave a big indigo stain.

1534
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,780
- Clothes shouldn't be raw.

1535
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,540
- You still have a big indigo stain

1536
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,940
on your friend's white couch

1537
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,580
because you are sweating bullets

1538
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,900
because the Cards Against Humanity game is getting heated.

1539
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,740
- It's getting a little too edgy for me.

1540
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,300
- It's getting too edgy.

1541
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,260
- Let's analyze some Cards Against Humanity cards, shall we?

1542
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,700
- You're like, I'm sitting here,

1543
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,260
I'm sweating fucking bullet sweat through my pants,

1544
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,620
and you are like, I'm gonna have to speak up soon

1545
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,340
because somebody just played Unborn Fetus,

1546
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,820
and I'm like, can we play another fucking game

1547
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,700
like Chutes and Ladders, 'cause this shit offends me.

1548
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,900
- Yeah, 'cause actually my aunt had a miscarriage,

1549
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,620
so can we maybe throw that in the trash?

1550
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,740
- And turn off this little Uzi vert.

1551
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,860
- He is actually a fucking predator, or something.

1552
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,700
I don't remember.

1553
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,900
- Or a satanist. - It's one of those two.

1554
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,740
- What did he do?

1555
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,580
- Satanical.

1556
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,380
- He threw a pregnant lady off a building?

1557
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,260
- Who cares?

1558
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,060
- I guess I kinda said that before I really realized

1559
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:21,980
what you said.

1560
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,620
I guess throwing a pregnant lady off a building,

1561
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,580
if he did that, I guess I care.

1562
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,220
- I'm not so sure he did that though.

1563
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,900
- I might have made that up,

1564
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,740
but someone was complaining about him.

1565
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,220
- It's okay to make up something

1566
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,460
about a guy who's satanic like that, though.

1567
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,580
- I think the more, he probably wants to do that.

1568
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,360
I think kind of the more evil and terrible a person is,

1569
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,700
the better their music is.

1570
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,740
Like that kind of holds pretty true.

1571
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,940
- Yeah. - The Beatles.

1572
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,780
- The Beatles.

1573
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,100
- John Ringo, George and Paul.

1574
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,740
- John Legend, The Devil.

1575
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,580
- The Devil on Spotify?

1576
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,220
- Yeah, see The Devil's on Spotify.

1577
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,400
I mean, I wouldn't say that this,

1578
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,900
he's done all that much bad stuff.

1579
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,260
He's more-- - He punishes the bad guys,

1580
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,100
so it's almost like he's good.

1581
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,180
- Whoa, Illuminati by The Devil?

1582
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,660
Who are these 257 monthly listeners?

1583
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,660
What is wrong with you?

1584
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,660
Do you realize who you're supporting?

1585
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,660
The Illuminati?

1586
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,660
Oh man.

1587
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,660
You're the devil.

1588
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,180
He's literally not even hiding it anymore.

1589
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:12,260
You have to imagine that this band, The Devil, or this guy, The Devil, has to be one guy

1590
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,780
who lives in the Midwest and is like, "I'm going to make black metal and my name, yeah,

1591
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,780
I'm going to be The Devil."

1592
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,780
Yeah.

1593
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780
Or it's like-

1594
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,780
I can't think of a name like Endless Winter or something like that.

1595
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,220
Yeah, I'm just going to go with The Devil.

1596
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,220
Straight to the point.

1597
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,860
- I'm a Mayan teenager who is like,

1598
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,280
this is the darkest fucking shit

1599
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,540
I've ever made in my fucking life.

1600
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,420
- It's just so funny to me, like,

1601
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,460
there's been so much, they've been trying

1602
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,320
to make evil names for so long now.

1603
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,160
- Yeah, yeah.

1604
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,980
- It's been-- - Now you're gonna

1605
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,820
beat the devil up.

1606
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,180
- Yeah, the devil, you just gotta go for it.

1607
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,140
- Yeah, the devil-- - The devil.

1608
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,280
- The devil. - The devil.

1609
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,260
(laughing)

1610
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,140
- That sucks 'cause then like,

1611
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,780
somebody takes the devil, right?

1612
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,420
Then you have to like throw numbers or something in there.

1613
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,100
- They don't care, there's probably a hundred guys

1614
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:59,660
Devilish than copying I bet there's a hundred guys who all made exactly the same another true bomb from Caleb another truth bomb. Yeah

1615
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,840
Truth bomb activated truth bombs over Brooklyn

1616
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,180
Holy shit, that's it falling Wow

1617
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,100
And that's it's blowing up and that's it's blowing up

1618
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:13,820
Yeah, and that's it's a blowing up. Are you guys getting increasingly a little bit scared of a nuclear detonation?

1619
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:19,580
No, if that shit happens, I literally I'm gonna just put my sunglasses on and watch the blast

1620
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:28,160
Do you ever I always think about like how horrible is that if like you if you when you imagine dying in the apocalypse

1621
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,140
It's always like you and you're the people closest to you and like you look at each other with one kind of I always think

1622
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,460
I'm gonna be at the grocery. Yeah, yeah

1623
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:40,080
And you just like look at some like like what if you look over the only person near you is like like a kid picking

1624
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,580
His nose. Yeah, it's like old me man

1625
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:47,940
I have to be like have my last moment of humanity making eye contact with a guy bagging groceries

1626
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,940
- I'm a smacker in the face.

1627
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,940
- That's the thing, you just go,

1628
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,940
"I always wanted to do this."

1629
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,940
(laughing)

1630
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,940
Just hit a lady in the face.

1631
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,940
- That's not what I always wanted.

1632
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,940
- And then the nuke doesn't drop.

1633
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,940
- One old lady flip off.

1634
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,940
- Movie idea.

1635
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,940
- I would hate to see him, last moment,

1636
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,940
stuck in a grocery store speaking of a kid

1637
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,940
with a pick in his booger nose, right?

1638
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,940
And he's like, "I've always wanted to do this."

1639
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,940
And then maybe you start, you go in for a kiss.

1640
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,940
- No.

1641
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,940
- Yeah, you would.

1642
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,940
- If I was in the grocery store--

1643
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,940
- You'd try to eat the booger off his face.

1644
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,940
- If I was in the grocery store,

1645
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,940
I've always wanted to try another person's booger.

1646
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:14,940
this

1647
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,940
I've always wanted to taste it.

1648
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,940
Another person's booger.

1649
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:21,340
If I was in the grocery store when the nuke is going off, and I'm about to be in the blast

1650
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:26,460
radius, I'm literally pulling out a liver from the thing.

1651
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,580
I'm eating raw liver one time.

1652
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,100
I'm finally going to try, what I'm going to do, I'm going to try a flat ground backflip

1653
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,100
right then and there.

1654
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,100
Yeah.

1655
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,100
That's a good one.

1656
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,100
Because even if I break my neck, it's like fucking...

1657
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,420
Are you going to wait until like, you know, there's like eight minutes before you die,

1658
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,420
right?

1659
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,020
For your flat ground backflip, are you doing it right when you find out, or are you waiting

1660
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,860
for maybe like 7.55 and you have five seconds before you're like, "Oh, I'm going to die."

1661
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,100
you're gonna die. - I don't know.

1662
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,700
- 'Cause then also if you don't land it,

1663
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,780
'cause if you try it right away and you don't land it,

1664
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,620
you maybe hurt yourself.

1665
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,020
- You're looking, everyone's looking at you just like,

1666
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:54,860
what the heck? - Not that it matters,

1667
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,800
I guess, but it would be pretty cool to time it

1668
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,340
with the flash of white light that kills everybody.

1669
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,060
- So it looks like you are like--

1670
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,580
- Yeah, you're silhouetted on the wall.

1671
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,740
- That's actually a great idea,

1672
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,920
'cause what if I end up doing the last backflip

1673
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,100
that anyone ever does?

1674
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,620
'Cause the world is gone.

1675
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,520
So what if that's like, I time it,

1676
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,300
so I'm like, well, at least I got to do my first backflip,

1677
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,140
and it was the last backflip anyone ever did in history.

1678
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,260
- And if you don't land it, nobody will be able to tell.

1679
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,400
- Yeah, or at least the last backflip for a little bit.

1680
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,700
Because even if, you know, 15 back--

1681
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,540
- Somebody's gonna--

1682
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,980
- But if they're all in underground bunkers,

1683
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,180
nobody's gonna be like, day two,

1684
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,980
like, oh, time to do a backflip.

1685
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,380
Like, there's no, it's gonna be a while

1686
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,820
until somebody backflips again.

1687
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,460
- Yeah. - You know, so at least have--

1688
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,300
- But I will say, it will be--

1689
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,140
- There's gonna be someone.

1690
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,840
- If nuclear energy irradiates corpses

1691
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,460
and creates a zombie apocalypse,

1692
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,220
I think a lot of people will be doing backflips

1693
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,780
shooting crossbows and stuff, so you might actually--

1694
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,980
- I don't think that people who store guns and crossbows

1695
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,300
and get prepared for shit like that

1696
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,140
are really in any kind of physical shape

1697
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,420
to be doing a back flip. - They have to do a back flip

1698
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,820
but they're gonna avoid getting bitten.

1699
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,840
- Every single, like when we would watch

1700
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,940
Doomsday Preppers, every single one of those guys

1701
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,740
is just like, just cell phone on the clip,

1702
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,420
right here into the khakis with the biggest gut

1703
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,700
in the world.

1704
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,940
- Well that's like a camel's hump,

1705
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,540
you survive for weeks like that.

1706
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,480
- Hey buddy, got a license to carry that Galaxy Note 2?

1707
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,140
- Yeah. - Right there?

1708
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,140
- You're worried that thing's gonna explode.

1709
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,980
- Yeah, 'cause that thing is--

1710
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,620
- 'Cause they famously have problems.

1711
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,180
- But that thing, they're ready to draw that

1712
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,420
at any point in time.

1713
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,580
- That's basically like-- - Hello?

1714
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,540
- Yeah. (laughing)

1715
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,420
- We have to go.

1716
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,380
- That's a-- - Flush it!

1717
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,200
- Hi mom.

1718
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,160
- You know who should be wearing those?

1719
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,620
I hate to say this, I'm not even gonna say it.

1720
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,460
I'm not even, I don't wanna say it.

1721
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,340
- Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it.

1722
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,220
- We said cowboys, now we got Karens

1723
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,220
walking around with the cell phone on their hip,

1724
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,340
ready to draw at any point in time. Start recording.

1725
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,020
Fuck.

1726
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,460
Yeah.

1727
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,740
No, needs a dunk. There we go.

1728
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,620
That one was a little softer. That's fine by me.

1729
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,940
I always do it right with him.

1730
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,220
That's because I'm a little timid

1731
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,020
because I know how much these microphones cost.

1732
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,820
Yeah, I don't really want to break these mics,

1733
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,060
so I kind of want to pull back on the loud dunks.

1734
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,460
I want to see if there ...

1735
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,160
No, there's no dent or anything on my microphone yet.

1736
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,780
I mean, that's not ... A dent doesn't matter.

1737
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,140
It's just going to break the inside of it.

1738
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,820
It won't break the inside.

1739
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,900
You know it'll break the inside.

1740
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,940
- Wait, let's try to...

1741
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,420
- No, this is not good radio.

1742
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,180
- I need a one donk.

1743
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,020
- I need a one donk.

1744
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,140
- Do it on my end.

1745
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,260
- That's a different flavor.

1746
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,220
- That's a different flavor.

1747
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,220
- No, I don't like that at all.

1748
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,060
- I guess if I was about to die from a nuke,

1749
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,100
I'd try every flavor I never have.

1750
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,220
(laughing)

1751
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,060
- Like what?

1752
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,420
- Your mic is off.

1753
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,380
You turned it off, turn it on.

1754
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,540
Not even funny, stupid, nobody can hear you.

1755
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,620
Bad, dumb, biggest flop ever!

1756
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,940
Biggest flop ever!

1757
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,100
I would be in the grocery store.

1758
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,260
I would say--

1759
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,220
No, there's a worse flop.

1760
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,460
I think Wood TV or whatever you said earlier

1761
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,300
was the biggest flop.

1762
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,100
The biggest flop was like two episodes ago.

1763
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,820
I think I'm on a come up.

1764
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,740
You're on the way back up?

1765
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,580
I'm on the way back up.

1766
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,400
You hit rock bottom two episodes ago?

1767
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,220
My credit score is going down.

1768
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,880
That means I'm going up.

1769
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,780
'Cause you know how you make good comedy?

1770
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,620
You have to struggle.

1771
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,440
Yeah.

1772
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,280
I'm struggling right now.

1773
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,280
They tried to charge me for like half of a month's rent.

1774
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,120
For what?

1775
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,300
For a place.

1776
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,340
But what did you do?

1777
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:11,980
They told me that I'm supposed to pay for half a month's rent and I was just like, "I'm not

1778
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,980
doing that."

1779
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,260
Aren't you supposed to pay your whole rent?

1780
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,260
Yeah.

1781
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,260
It's kind of a discount.

1782
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:21,180
They're saying that I moved in on the 15th of February and I did not.

1783
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,180
So did you tell them that?

1784
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,060
I did not respond.

1785
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:29,980
You might be the worst at explaining situations of anyone I've ever met in my life.

1786
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,980
I know.

1787
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,500
in such a difficult time talking to my roommates about it.

1788
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,220
- 'Cause you're just going, they wanted half of,

1789
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,720
and they go, "What are you talking about?"

1790
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,340
- No, I just take screenshots of every single thing

1791
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,340
that they say to me, and then I just send it.

1792
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,540
- 'Cause you are good at screenshots.

1793
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,820
- You are really good at screenshots.

1794
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,740
- You parse this for me, I can't understand it.

1795
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,780
- I'm bad at screenshots.

1796
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:50,620
I don't even know how it works on my phone.

1797
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,860
- I'm gonna go make french fries in the air fryer.

1798
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,140
That goes up to 450.

1799
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,640
- I always press the wrong buttons.

1800
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,060
Yesterday I tried to screenshot something,

1801
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,020
and I just clicked the power button twice.

1802
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,300
- I like to crop the screenshot and go (mimics screeching)

1803
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,100
and then you send it and then you delete it.

1804
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,940
- Oh wow.

1805
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,860
- That's what I do.

1806
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,140
- Yeah, it's so fun.

1807
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,000
- I have all of them saved.

1808
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,840
- Oh brother.

1809
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,380
- My phone is only screenshot photos.

1810
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,820
I don't take any photos of anything.

1811
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,380
- You have a screenshot of your phone.

1812
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,860
- Most of my photos is I see animals.

1813
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:22,340
- It's zoomed out, you're in incognito Google Chrome browser.

1814
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,180
- What am I looking up?

1815
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,020
Go ahead.

1816
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,940
- He's looking up POV.

1817
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:27,820
- POV.

1818
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,580
- Adam 22 solo videos. - Butt job.

1819
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,340
Butt job.

1820
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,180
- Butt job.

1821
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,540
- He's looking up women giving guys butt jobs.

1822
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,580
- What's a butt job?

1823
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,660
- When you fuck the butt cheeks.

1824
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,420
Don't go in, but you fuck the butt cheek.

1825
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,660
- I've never seen that.

1826
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,220
- I made it up.

1827
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,460
- No, that probably exists.

1828
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,940
- It probably exists. - Any permutation

1829
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,900
of people's bodies-- - It might be,

1830
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,460
we got like a one second left in the episode.

1831
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,900
- We got a one second. - Jubio,

1832
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,780
you're gonna pull up butt job videos.

1833
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,300
- No, you're not gonna do that.

1834
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,460
- Pull up, but there it is.

1835
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,420
- Wow.

1836
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,240
- This video is on Ellen dancing on a treadmill.

1837
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,140
- This is a guy dancing on a treadmill as he walks.

1838
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,820
So I see this basically every day when I go to the gym.

1839
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,660
I see this kind of thing.

1840
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,860
- This is what I see, yeah, no.

1841
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,420
This is exactly what people do.

1842
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,240
- Yeah.

1843
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,460
- They lift their legs really weird

1844
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,300
and they spin around. - And I'm like,

1845
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,700
what are you doing, man?

1846
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,660
Who's this for?

1847
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,660
I haven't seen that.

1848
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,580
Nobody's done a back flip.

1849
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,140
- Well, this is what a butt job looks like, everyone.

1850
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:22,980
- Wow.

1851
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,620
Yeah, no, I 100% people doing this.

1852
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,160
- This is all the sperms in my penis

1853
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,020
getting so excited that they're about to be shot on a butt.

1854
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,100
All right, that's enough for me.

1855
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:32,940
- Yep.

1856
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,760
- Bye guys.

1857
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,000
- You got anything to plug, Caleb?

1858
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,320
- Tonight, and no, yeah, tonight we have two more shows

1859
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,760
in Raleigh, North Carolina, opening for Adam Friedland.

Go check that out.

- And then me and Cameron are going to be making

1863
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,980
a pita pocket in my air fryer.

1864
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,920
- That goes up to?

1865
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,420
