1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,500
(laughing)

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,160
- Five pounds to the bottomless.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,200
- You're a crap monster.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,040
(laughing)

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
(explosion)

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,960
- It was a trip of a lifetime.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,800
- The trip.

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,080
- It was four friends and a car.

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,600
- It was a trip of a lifetime.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
- And we did go so far.

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,680
- It was a trip of a lifetime.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,680
We went to Los Angeles, the trip of a lifetime.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,080
And it was so much onions and there was so much fan onions

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,120
and we ate some onions, grand onions.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,360
(laughing)

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,400
We ate some grand onions.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,880
- What's up?

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,720
- We're back.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,800
- What the fuck is up?

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,640
- Can you believe it?

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,680
- Listeners.

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,720
- I can't believe it.

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,560
(laughing)

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,080
- You're off, you're done.

27
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,920
- What?

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
you're too excited to be doing this.

29
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,520
I could not believe that what I just heard.

30
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,040
What the fuck is up listeners?

31
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,640
That can't be allowed to happen.

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
What just talk like that?

33
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,920
Yeah he can't be allowed to do that.

34
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,880
And also to say listeners that was just way too much.

35
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,280
I couldn't handle that.

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,160
That took me out.

37
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
I thought it was cool.

38
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,040
Did you guys see the Mona Lisa became smeared by cream by the epic prankster of the century?

39
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
I didn't see.

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,280
I'm going to look this up real quick.

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,440
So this guy dressed up as an old lady in a wheelchair and then when he got near the Mona

42
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,980
He leaped out his chair and smeared it with cream. I'm just gonna search creamed on Lisa

43
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,460
uh-huh

44
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,460
Mona Lisa

45
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:42,740
From South China Morning Post Wow man in disguise attacks, Mona Lisa with cream an apparent climate protest

46
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,280
So literally the best news story. I'm so

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,600
Covered and got a got creamed with cream. Yeah, he became smeared by cream

48
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,320
old lady smears cream on Mona Lisa.

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
We were busy.

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,800
We were so busy we could have stopped this fucking prankster.

51
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,040
And we cancelled our show at the LRV.

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah we were supposed to do our show at the LRV.

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
The LRV.

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,880
Yo I LRV the Mona Lisa.

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,360
The painting reportedly unharmed.

56
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Okay that's bullshit.

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
Yeah it was on a protective layer over it I guess.

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
That's fucking bullshit.

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
They have a cream blocker.

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Yeah.

61
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,220
That's probably one of the main things that they install.

62
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,200
I think that's probably why he chose cream because that might be the one thing that they

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,600
don't have a blocker on the money. Yeah, clearly they did. Maybe he thought they

64
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,000
didn't. You know, it's like who the fuck would put smear cream. I mean, if it's a

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,640
climate protest, I might try to light it on fire. Yeah, cream. That's cut. That's

66
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,800
from a cow. Cows produce a lot of methane. Methane. This guy's an asshole. Yeah,

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,880
cream is supporting the cream industry. Sporting the cream industry is one of

68
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,000
the most harmful industries. It is really fucked up. Yeah. Have you guys ever read

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
that that Upton Sinclair book about the cream industry and how evil it is? Yeah,

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,200
sounds terrible. I read the downton

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,840
downton. Okay, yeah downton lair good lair yeah downton good lair video. I

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,360
watched his essay. The implications are terrifying. Epic sauce. The

73
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,080
implications are terrifying, I have to say. Was he I mean the thing about one of

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
the evilest parts of the cream industry is that I would say that I mean this is

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,680
in the book. Roughly 75% of the cream output in the world is being smeared on

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,240
priceless paintings. That's going to be an absolute bullshit of a stat. It's actually

77
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,800
a completely true stat. I'm going to fact check it. I mean you could go ahead but he's probably

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,240
one of the greatest writers and fact check writers. You know honestly I don't know how

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,280
to fact check stuff and I don't know how people do it so I'm just going to have to believe

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,080
him. What was he Upton Sinclair that called him a muck raker? Yeah. The hell is that?

81
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,840
That's basically it's the opposite of a cream maker. He fights the cream. If you spell cream

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,940
backwards and upside down. It says yeah, yeah, it's a little bit like a little

83
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,240
bit. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, but basically it's like kind of like what's

84
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,840
like in and Yang cream and muck. So he's like breaking up muck to fight is the

85
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,440
only way you can clean cream off a painting. If it doesn't have a cream

86
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,940
blocker is to add muck to it and it goes neutral acres. Yeah, I hate cream

87
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,440
rakers. I'm fucking sick cream rakers destroying our beautiful pain cream

88
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,140
rakers dressing up like old ladies and smearing if a cream raker came in and

89
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,740
tried to get that I would shoot him on

90
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,740
site. We try to put that on the breath

91
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,340
of the wild painting something that I'm

92
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,540
just realizing now that would something

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,340
I'm realizing now is Upton Sinclair is a

94
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,540
muckraker right he's digging up muck to

95
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,040
smear industries. Wow yep it's almost

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,540
like kind of even good and evil are the

97
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,340
same where even the muckrakers are

98
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,040
smearing the cream. What's he doing it

99
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,640
for money? Monet Lisa at the Monet Lisa

100
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,140
least leaks of Mona Monet you could you could at least give some Monet to the

101
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,920
cream man yeah exactly you that's the least that you could do Monet yeah it's

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,100
really telling I mean that people talk about there's a lot of talk about milk

103
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,160
men nobody ever talks about the cream man trip the cream man well that's

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,160
because they have half as well the milk man is enough to bring business true

105
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,800
yeah man dropped out needs all that no need six bottles of fucking cream the

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,880
the milk man dropped off some cream in in my grandma and that's what my uncle

107
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,000
looks like the milk man.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,200
What is that true? I don't know you milk man fucked your grandpa that was that

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,760
happened in my family, too, but the milk man dropped a bunch of muck

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,400
to my grandma and she she died.

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,900
Yeah, she filled her milk with muck.

112
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
Yep.

113
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, and she threw up pretty bad.

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Yeah, she threw up a bunch of muck.

115
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, she's skinny as a stick figure and in a grave now.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, she's bones.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's awful.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Bones, dirt, and some muck in the stomach area.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I've been playing a lot of--

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That stuff does not go away over time.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
I've been playing a lot of awesome iPhone games.

124
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Yeah.

125
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Still.

126
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
You have been, yeah.

127
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
You download it, it would tell people what you've been doing.

128
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,680
So, while we were driving in the car, I would download any game that showed up on an ad.

129
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,520
- Uh-huh.

130
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,040
- And I ended up using, I have 50 gigabytes of data

131
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
for my mobile plan.

132
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,080
- Ooh.

133
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,280
- And I used all 50 gigabytes.

134
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,600
(laughing)

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,440
- That's too much.

136
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,760
- On tour, downloading games like Fat Man Run.

137
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,760
- Games that also are the same game, just reskinned.

138
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Where instead of a guy, you're a hot dog.

139
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,960
- There's, what's the one, oh, Sword Maker.

140
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,800
(laughing)

141
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,640
- Yep.

142
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,880
What was the I downloaded I downloaded one I think it was called like 3d avatar

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,960
judge and that one was cool and yeah the first case that I got it was like you

144
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,640
can play you can do this case for gems and as a guy named George flowed and it

145
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,680
was a white guy I took a screenshot of it because I was like damn that is fucking

146
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
nuts that they made him white.

147
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,600
That's not a, that's not, you think that's the worst part?

148
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
A little bit.

149
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
No, except they messed his name up.

150
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,680
They made him white, but then they made the cop black in the story.

151
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Okay, so it was kind of a reimagining.

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,200
Yeah, it was a reimagining for gems.

153
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,360
It was like a Guillermo del Toro style, like kind of like, like fairy tale version.

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Yeah, retelling.

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Yeah.

156
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,200
And then I think the other one was someone named, like the first one I got, but I couldn't

157
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,400
do it because we were driving through Amarillo and there's like no service

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,800
there but it was like OJ Simpson. Oh yeah. But it was spelled wrong. I feel like

159
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,160
they're probably they are they so that that's it's not like randomly generated

160
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,960
they like do that they must do that on purpose. Yeah those are the stories.

161
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,120
Yeah. Yeah. I think those are the stories that you play for gems but that's the

162
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,480
thing the thing about that though they made both of those guys white. Yeah. To

163
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,640
avoid whitewashing history much. You're pretty much obsessed with race right now.

164
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Yeah, it is. I mean he's been getting really into thinking about race all the time. He has yeah, and just he walks into a room and he just

165
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,320
Says how many of every race there are in the room. It's a counting exercise. Yep. He's also working on math

166
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm working on counting. Yeah, I'm learning how what was your guys's favorite stop on the entire tour and Canyon or just most of Arizona?

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
It has to be a little place we did. Yeah

168
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,920
I forgot about Myrtle Beach. It was so

169
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,160
actually Myrtle Beach didn't feel like part of the tour. It felt like heaven.

170
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,640
It was a vacation from the tour is if anybody's listening and they have like a

174
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,040

175
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,600
or the forest near your house huh the or the forest near your house yeah yeah

176
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,240

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,960
you'll hit Myrtle Beach. Yeah, eventually. Or just go into the forest and lie down.

178
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,280
We went to the... Where did we go? We went go-kart racing. We went go-karting. We

179
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,360
went to the arcade. We went dinosaur mini golf. Dinosaur mini golf. Worst mini

180
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,000
golf course I ever played. Not fun. I hate mini golf. We went to the pool. We

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,840
went to the hot tub. We went to the lazy river. I went in the lazy river at night

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,040
and it was too cold.

183
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,480
- Mm-hmm. - It was too cold.

184
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,640
- I sure my penis shrank.

185
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,160
I got in the lazy river and my penis shrank.

186
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,920
- Don't you want, hey, when you're in the pool,

187
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,760
when you're in the pool,

188
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
you want your penis to shrink so nobody can see it.

189
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,440
- Nobody can see his penis in the pool, it's disgusting.

190
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,040
- I don't wanna see. - Exactly.

191
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,440
- My fucking bikini bottom showing my penis

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
hanging out of the bottom of it.

193
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,720
- Yeah, I don't want my thing,

194
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,200
I don't want my thing trying to bust out

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
like the Kool-Aid man.

196
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,400
- Yeah. - I honestly,

197
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm, as a grown man, - I'd say no.

198
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,800
I would prefer if I could wear a shirt in the pool and it was just from normal.

199
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, I would rather wear a shirt.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, I don't want to have all I don't want to be completely naked on.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,560
Oh, I mean you don't have to be completely naked.

202
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
You get to wear swim.

203
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
You're always like a like a like a girlfriend.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,200
I want like a big shirt that a big shirt and no pants.

205
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,560
Yeah, I want to use the jets for something.

206
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,200
I want to I want everyone to see my foes.

207
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,080
Do you guys like I still go put my wiener up against the jet like yeah, me too.

208
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,440
You have to. You have to. You gotta see if it's as good as you remembered it when you

209
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,040
were a kid. Yeah. And you feel so guilty when the jet turns off because you're too close.

210
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,960
Yeah, that shit is fucked up. Oops. It thinks my penis is a leaf. It's so embarrassing.

211
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,960
The public pool I went to as a kid, they made the jet stop going so fast because too many

212
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,680
kids were fucking nutting. Too many kids were going up to the thing. Including me. Tell

213
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,440
tell you what my fucking my aunt's hot tub did not get the memo yeah yeah that

214
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,000
thing yeah honestly that thing had to have been half imagine by the time that

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,840
I grew up and stop. I imagine being like a lifeguard at like a summer camp for

216
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,320
like little kids and like you're like you're like you're sitting up on the high

217
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,880
chair and you have to you're looking down at the at the pool from above and

218
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,920
you just see you're seeing the little the kids just cluster around certain

219
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,600
spots like iron filings on a magnet. It's like they're like ants. When they

220
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,740
you see like a caterpillar, you just see everyone yeah and you can't go. You

221
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,600
can't say anything you can't do it. You're a little fucking lose your job

222
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,440
instantly yeah yeah yeah the parents won't they won't understand it as a

223
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,240
lifeguard. You know what's up yeah yeah, the kid you were a kid once you love

224
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,300
the yeah, that's why you became a lifeguard. I pretend I was deep in

225
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,780
thought I heard they I think they put a jet in the seat of the lifeguard chair.

226
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Yeah, I should yeah, that's why I mean that's what the days feel so good. Yeah,

227
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
It's on the wall.

228
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Jet pumping water out.

229
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
I'm down in the air.

230
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
I think we should we should get a for the

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
backyard. We should get a little kiddie

232
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
pool. Yeah, that would be fucking nice. That

233
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
would be sweat in there. Oh my God, our

234
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
feet. Yes, we can do that thing where

235
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
you put a bunch of like minnow leaves.

236
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Oh yeah leaves

237
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
you don't want to leave the pool out overnight

238
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
and the leaves when you leave

239
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
the out in the in the

240
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
in the fall.

241
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
He fills his leaves.

242
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
You just leave it in your backyard.

243
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
I was saying you put like we put a bunch of fish in there.

244
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Oh mosquitoes.

245
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,520
And they eat the dead skin off our feet like in Vietnam.

246
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,360
I would actually love to have one of those fish do that to me.

247
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
I wouldn't like that.

248
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
I don't like.

249
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
I would put my thing in there.

250
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,680
I don't really like getting eaten by an animal.

251
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
Shave my foreskin off.

252
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
You're not getting eaten though.

253
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I mean it's the same as a dog licking you.

254
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
It's functionally the same.

255
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
My dog has a name.

256
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm not going to say your dog.

257
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,320
I just meant a dog.

258
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Every dog has a name.

259
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
No not all dogs have names.

260
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,620
- The other dogs didn't even pickles,

261
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,580
he had no teeth and he--

262
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,420
- He had no name.

263
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,840
- He tried to bite my hand over and over again.

264
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,720
- Yeah, you let him do that, right?

265
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
- No.

266
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,060
- Dogs in India don't have names.

267
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,900
- Yeah, none of them have names there.

268
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,740
- Yeah, they do.

269
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,580
- Some of them. - You may not know them.

270
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,900
- He's a race guy again.

271
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,820
- Oh yeah.

272
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,580
- Well, there's just a lot of stray dogs in India.

273
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,060
- He thinks that Indian people don't have names too.

274
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,000
- How'd you learn that?

275
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,300
- From an Indian guy.

276
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,140
- Okay.

277
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,160
And did he have a name?

278
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
- No.

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
- Oh wow.

280
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,820
- I did learn that there are a lot of evil stray dogs

281
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,320
India from following a bunch of Tom and Jerry mean pages yeah, because they all

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,660
post they all every other meme on there is a picture of like a of like a dog

283
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,080
that looks like it's from Bloodborne and it says and it says like final level of

284
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,780
walking home.

285
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,140
They think it's about it's Tom and Jerry versus spike. Yeah, I think that's

286
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,500
what the show it is sometimes some episodes some episodes. Yeah, hey, I

287
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,980
don't want to I don't want to sound like yeah, I don't want to nerd out, but I

288
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,340
have to I mean what when I hear some Tom and Jerry Miss info being spread. I

289
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,300
think that's not going to do you still have

290
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,860
yet i have to do you still have a

291
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,120
i thought you knew exactly what you're talking about still have do you have

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,220
i have to still have the proper yet to my house okay i don't have anything to

293
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,640

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,920
into you do you know you literally i bought you a scooby-doo popper you didn't

295
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,720
touch it once the entire trip so you do not have a guy who has a lot of that

296
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,420
drama and i think there is no drama until you know explain let me explain the

297
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,800
situation

298
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,520
I bought a Tom and Jerry popper at a gas station in Myrtle Beach.

299
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
What?

300
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Nobody knows what a popper is.

301
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I don't know what it's called.

302
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
A popper popper.

303
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Okay.

304
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Move on.

305
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,760
I bought one of those.

306
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,800
I showed Cameron and then he immediately took it out of my hands.

307
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
You held it up to me.

308
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
I held it up to you to show you.

309
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
You held it out to me.

310
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,640
To show you and then you took it and then I just decided it was yours after that.

311
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,200
There's no way I was getting that.

312
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,720
you went scary Bilbo and you attacked me for it.

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,880
No, I took it because I thought you were giving it to me because I thought you

314
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,920
knew how much I love Tom and Jerry and I realized and then when you brought it up

315
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
later I realized my mistake and I bought you a Scooby-Doo popper and you

316
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,640
basically threw it away.

317
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,200
It's not thrown away.

318
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Where is it?

319
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,080
It was attached to my bag that got lost.

320
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,760
It was in my bag that got lost.

321
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh the camera bag?

322
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,200
I lost my, I left my camera bag at a hotel in San Francisco.

323
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
But then you got that bag back didn't you?

324
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
So where is it?

325
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
So where is it?

326
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,000
house. Oh, I'm so grateful. I'm letting my try to make it right. I'll even I even

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,320
offered to give him the Tom and Jerry thing back and he's he wouldn't take it

328
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,600
back. So he's trying to make me out to be the bad guy here, but it's good. I

329
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,280
don't understand. He's the bad guy at all. I don't think I made an honest

330
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,680
mistake. I made an honest mistake fueled by my love of cartoon cat and mouse. I

331
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,880
will say I was there when you gave when you handed it over. It really seemed

332
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,040
like you got it for Cameron. I'll still give it back to you if you want it back.

333
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,080
Nope, I got a Scooby-Doo one now.

334
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,880
You're much more of a Scooby-Doo-er than you are a Tom Jerryman.

335
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Scooby-Doo-er.

336
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Yeah.

337
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
I guess that's true.

338
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Yeah, what would yours be?

339
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
We have to get you one.

340
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Probably something...

341
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Royce de Five Knives.

342
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,560
Yeah, bad meets evil, Popper.

343
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,060
I'll take that, dude.

344
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,880
Those things, they had like a hundred of those at every gas station.

345
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,800
I've never seen them in a store ever before.

346
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
It was weird.

347
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,280
It was like, see, I saw the first one at Myrtle Beach, the first one I've ever seen, I bought

348
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,100
it, and then they just kept...

349
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,580
Every single gas station had them.

350
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,260
Yeah, it was like I fucking installed some texture into the world.

351
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
I tuned out.

352
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,260
Are you talking about race again?

353
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,460
No, I'm talking about poppers.

354
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
I tried to.

355
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,300
I heard the first one I've ever seen.

356
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,860
I was so confused and curious about those things popping up, hey, I couldn't help it,

357
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,100
but that I did something crazy and I asked the person at one of the gas stations, "When

358
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,700
did you guys start stocking these?"

359
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
I remember that, yeah.

360
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,460
Because I wanted to know and he was like, "I don't know, like a long time ago."

361
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,880
- That was at Staples.

362
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,720
- Was it at Staples?

363
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,540
- Yeah. - Okay.

364
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,380
- Yes, I remember. - I go to Staples,

365
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,860
which is an even crazier one.

366
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,700
- Yeah.

367
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,520
- 'Cause it was weird they were there.

368
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,220
- I was just so curious, I feel like I've never seen them

369
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,380
before this trip. - It's a brand new toy, dude.

370
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,620
- Which Staples was it?

371
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,100
- It was the Staples in LA.

372
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,300
- No, it was in Texas.

373
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,860
- Oh, it was in Texas. - Texas, yeah.

374
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,020
- Okay.

375
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,140
- Texas, great state.

376
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,960
- Great state.

377
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,020
- One of the best states. - Big, big, big state.

378
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,420
- Big state. - Texas, one of the best states.

379
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,780
- One of the better states that I've been to.

380
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,740
- Texas, Richmond.

381
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,220
Richmond is my favorite state.

382
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,580
Yep, Atlanta and Richmond.

383
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,060
Okay, this guy's seriously a geography idiot.

384
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,140
(laughing)

385
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,060
Those are great cities and states.

386
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,020
I'm gonna put you on a US Geography crash course.

387
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,860
Okay.

388
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,680
Yep.

389
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,340
We should send him to the Geography Bee,

390
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,820
the eighth grade Geography Bee.

391
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,900
Love Atlanta.

392
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,260
They have a Geography Bee?

393
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,380
They did in eighth grade.

394
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,220
I remember-- That shit's easy.

395
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,900
I loved everything but basically DC and San Francisco.

396
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,300
I remember they gave us, it was a thing where--

397
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,740
Scary cities. We were class in eighth grade

398
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,980
and they gave us a sheet of paper

399
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,180
we had to fill out answers and if anyone got them all right they like were like

400
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,900
they were entered to be a contestant in the geography beers that shit has to

401
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,220
something like that something I mean all that shit's gotta be gotta be yeah I

402
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,660
think like two years after that you're at Langley and they're like quick what is

403
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:37,300
the capital what is yeah what is an archipelago yeah that's one of the

404
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,460
questions I remember man and I got that one wrong

405
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,460
yep archipelago it's where all I would I would hate to work for the CIA I would

406
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,860
actually like to and if they'd like to reach out that have to live in fucking

407
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,180
DC you know have anywhere you get to live in Thailand and do your whole thing

408
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,900
werewolf attack people yeah okay and you get that you have to learn I got scared

409
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,900
of the Lincoln Memorial you learn how to do it he thought it was gonna come alive

410
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,700
I thought it was gonna come along as that is evil there's an evil lurking

411
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,580
behind it same with San Francisco here's got attacked by a bunch of ducks

412
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,300
that was pretty funny ducks Pierce was walking on the street he saw a bunch of

413
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,260
the ducks on the street and they couldn't get on the curb or they thought they

414
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,540
thought there was no evidence, picking up all the ducklings and the mother bid

415
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,020
his arm. Yeah, I got a good clip. It was very funny because yeah, before that

416
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,220
like like cars stopped and like a guy was stopping traffic to let the ducks and

417
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,220
ducklings cross the street and everyone was like clapping for him and then

418
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,480
pierce walks over like oh, it looks like they can't get up on the curb and pick

419
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,100
them up and just everyone's completely silent yeah, and then he got attacked and

420
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,320
person was like oh yeah that's no claps for yeah no class for Pierce at all

421
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,920
because he doesn't like he was wearing like he's wearing like a fucking in

422
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,920
bright like a bedazzled CIA hat yeah yeah no ducklings on the street being

423
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:02,640
like oh I don't know it's cool dude yeah I started chucking them yeah see you got

424
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,440
a you got a you got to put a Banksy on that with Washington Monument yeah that

425
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,320
shit's boring as fuck. You gotta bring Spider-Man back to that like in the movie. Remember when

426
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,840
Spider-Man was there in the movie? I thought we were gonna see Spider-Man fighting the Vulture

427
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,120
there. You really honestly thought that? I 100% thought he was gonna be there. Your brain

428
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,360
is childish man. I seriously thought, I mean it's like, I thought maybe it would be like

429
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,200
in like you know Disneyland where you go and Kylo Ren comes out every once in a while.

430
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,560
I thought maybe Spider-Man and the Vulture would come out of the Washington Monument.

431
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,860
They should have a George Washington stand there and be like, "Looks like my penis."

432
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,200
Why would he say that? It doesn't look like his penis first of all. He didn't have a right

433
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:44,220
of all. Yeah. He did. If anything, if it was abnormal at all, it was wooden. He had a perfect

434
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,560
wooden penis that he stole from a slave. Yep. That is fucked. I didn't even know that. A

435
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,600
lot of people forget. And he also grew weed. Criminal. What? Huge criminal. If I was George

436
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,140
Washington, instead of building dentures out of slave teeth, like a freak, like a freaking

437
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,160
criminal, I would build dentures out of dog teeth. That would have been awesome. That would

438
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,000
look so cool. That would look cool as fuck. He would have been the king. But only the big

439
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,840
dog. I wouldn't do one dog. I would take the canines from like a hundred different dogs.

440
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,760
A hundred teeth by the way. That's basically a shark. You're making yourself into a dog

441
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,600
shark. No. Okay, yeah, that sounds cool. I would do chicklets. Chicklets? Like Dennis

442
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,840
the Menace. You wouldn't have to. You already look like chicklets. Bitch ass. I would probably

443
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
I would do something that if I got

444
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I actually know

445
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,840
wait no, I'm going to look up a picture to show you what I would do.

446
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
I think I would do

447
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
food. Food? Yeah.

448
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
You could eat them whenever. Yeah, exactly.

449
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
I'd do pickles and

450
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
onions. Onions.

451
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Where my teeth should be.

452
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Because onions wrap around like braces anyway.

453
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Yeah, I think I would do

454
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
a sunfish beak

455
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
or a turtle beak.

456
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
I would do whale teeth. You know, they have those

457
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,760
like bristles. This is the Sunfish teeth. I would have these. I've seen that before. Just

458
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,880
two really big, just two, like one buck tooth on the top, one buck tooth on the bottom.

459
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,120
I think I might get an angler installed on the top of my head. That would be fucking

460
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,360
sick. That would be realistic right now. Yeah, what are you, is it going to, because I mean,

461
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,760
you're not trying to attract fish, so what are you putting on the end of the angler?

462
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,280
Probably something for me. You've got hair on the sides. I'm going to try and lure myself.

463
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,480
Caleb yeah, I'll like use it to motivate myself on the end. I don't know if

464
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,920
everyone's seen it. Maybe poop if it was opposite day, but unfortunately it's not

465
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,960
so I'll probably do food. It's not so it's not opposite day. It's not it's so

466
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,960
you're doing it's not opposite day and you're putting food. It's not boogers day.

467
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,080
It's a boogers day. It's boogers wait it's boogers day. It's boogers day. Is it

468
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,280
actually a boogers day? Can you survive just eating your own boogers? You need

469
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,880
dust to get boogers. At first I was like. So what if you're in a really dusty room.

470
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,960
first one you as I thought I thought you might like can you can you eat them and

471
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,920
survive like well,

472
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,520
my mom told me that they

473
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,240
still believe it yeah, no they'll kill you what if you eat them yeah, it's just

474
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,000
shit from your body right yeah, it's just for us collecting

475
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,520
but why is it green and you can use and dust and yeah, it's again yeah, bugs

476
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,680
dead skin and smog and whatever particle doesn't come out of your butt goes on

477
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,620
there really or no, you know what it is, it's whatever poop you smell the

478
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,640
particles from the smell. When we turned in the car, they did the inspection. I

479
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,200
was really, really happy. They found no boogers. They didn't find all the

480
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,360
boogers. I hidden there. I probably had honestly for the four hundred boogers

481
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,900
and a rental car

482
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,920
pretty high. Did I probably put four hundred to five hundred bars in the

483
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,240
front seat of that car? I mean I would I would just throw them out the window,

484
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,040
but I knew they were. I would never do that's embarrassing dude. I'm trying to

485
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,040
I'm trying to sneakily put them. Yeah, wipe them under the seat on the floor.

486
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,240
I put them on the back of my leg and whenever we get out I'd scrape them off the parking

487
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,120
break. I think I got hemorrhoids from the tour, speaking of. You got hemorrhoids? I think

488
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,760
so from sitting down so long. What? If you sit down for long periods of time you can

489
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,000
get hemorrhoids. We weren't sitting all that much more than you probably do in your daily

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,960
life. No, that's not true. Four or five hours a day? Yeah. Sitting longer in the car than

491
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
I ever have sat down.

492
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
What?

493
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,120
I've been longer in the car than I ever have sat down.

494
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Is that on period?

495
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
It's on period.

496
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,280
Speaking of period, are your hemorrhoids bleeding constantly?

497
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,520
No, I just wiped one time and I saw blood.

498
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,480
Did you eat blood for dinner?

499
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,320
I did eat a steak at a Cracker Barrel at an Outback Steakhouse.

500
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,280
Oh, I forgot about that steak.

501
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Oh man, that steak.

502
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,880
You know, I never got sick.

503
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,840
You had a blue steak.

504
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,560
It wasn't blue, it was pink. It was completely pink and red and raw.

505
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,680
It was, yeah, it was raw. That's what it's called.

506
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,320
A blue steak, listen, I'm not eating no blue steak, man.

507
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Yeah, blue, what is this, Dr. Seuss?

508
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I'll eat green eggs and ham, though. What's up?

509
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,760
That's what it's called when it's like blue rare.

510
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,040
The fuck are you even fucking talking about? You're not making, you're saying the wrong

511
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
color.

512
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Yeah, green egg is actually when it's scrambled.

513
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
That's right.

514
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
That's actually what it means.

515
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Yeah.

516
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
For an egg to be scrambled.

517
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Yeah, we went to Outback.

518
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,520
I'd like to take you out back.

519
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,160
Fuck you in full view of the neighbors.

520
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Yep.

521
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,720
Amarillo was cool because every street.

522
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,280
Oh, shout out Young Javonchi.

523
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Oh, true.

524
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Dude, shout out my guy.

525
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Shout out Young Javonchi.

526
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
We said we would.

527
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,240
Our waiter, we told him we'd shout him out.

528
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,760
Our waiter out back, very kind young man.

529
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
He's a rapper.

530
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
He's a rapper.

531
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Young Javonchi.

532
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Young Javonchi's got two songs.

533
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
He goes crazy.

534
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Continues.

535
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Yeah.

536
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,600
It was cool because every single street or every single block, it was like steakhouse,

537
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,200
Steakhouse, steakhouse, steakhouse.

538
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,040
- Yep.

539
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,680
- I've never seen that many steakhouses in my life.

540
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,600
- Yeah, it was swaggy.

541
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,960
- We just got off at a, it was just a truck stop.

542
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,800
- Oh, is that why?

543
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,120
- Yeah, it's all just restaurants.

544
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,320
- Ah.

545
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,160
I thought that that's how it was.

546
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,040
- You thought that was like the steak district?

547
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,880
- Yep.

548
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,700
- Yep.

549
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,540
(laughing)

550
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,680
- I think there's a lot of beef production in Texas,

551
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,520
so I did think that.

552
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
- So you thought that all the chain steakhouses

553
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,720
need to be next to the beef production capital?

554
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,560
- Yep.

555
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
- All right.

556
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
- We did drive by some--

557
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,920
- I mean, the steak was better in Texas.

558
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,880
those cows that those those were those are those like slaughterhouses yeah yeah

559
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
those are crazy yeah it is crazy to see that where do we go we went to love it's

560
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,600
insane to look at like 10,000 living things and be like you will all be dead

564
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,660
- Well, we went there as soon as it opened.

565
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,500
- Yep.

566
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
- The second we were literally waiting outside the doors,

567
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,620
and a security guard opened the doors and we ran in.

568
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,460
- Yeah.

569
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,280
- To go to the knife guys.

570
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,120
- We went into the knife guys

571
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,180
and I bought a pocket knife that says Freemasons.

572
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,020
- Yeah.

573
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,840
- And Cameron--

574
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,060
- I bought a knife that says Operation Desert Storm.

575
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,900
- Yeah.

576
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,740
- Yeah.

577
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,560
- That's what it was.

578
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,400
That thing is sick.

579
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,240
- It's pretty cool.

580
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,780
- And I bought two bags of Skittles.

581
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,740
- No, you bought, it wasn't Skittles,

582
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,900
you bought a Freemasons hat and a lollipop.

583
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,940
I remember that.

584
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,520
Oh I did get a lot, they had lollipops and I said, dude the guy was being a hassle.

585
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,980
I was like how much for the Freemasons hat?

586
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
He was like 15 bucks.

587
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
I was like okay let me get that.

588
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,340
There was a bucket of lollipops.

589
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,980
I was like also the lollipop and he started laughing.

590
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
Damn.

591
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,780
It's like dude I'm giving you business.

592
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,940
First of all, second of all I'm fucking hungry.

593
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,060
I have blood sugar issues.

594
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,660
You should be thankful I don't have a knife in my hand.

595
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,940
I mean that guy he can laugh at whatever he wants because he's got a samurai sword right

596
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
behind him.

597
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,940
I really was tempted to buy ninja stars but I didn't know if they'd let me get home.

598
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,700
that night helmet so fucking bad. The $1500 night helmet.

599
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,700
The night helmet. And then they had the left corner of that store was all fairy figurines.

600
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,500
Yeah, that was such a sick store. That was so cool.

601
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Anybody around there, you gotta go check it out.

602
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,900
And there was like a guy in there with like pushing his little kids on a stroller.

603
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,300
Yep. That was so cool. Like he was buying them

604
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,100
their Christmas gifts. Yeah.

605
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,060
In May. Their Christmas gifts, yeah.

606
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,700
We need to go back out right now, dude. I'm having like, I know.

607
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,700
We need to go on another tour immediately. I know. I have like a phantom steering wheel

608
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,500
at my hand. I need to be back there. Yeah. I need to be back in the south. Dude, we

609
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,220
should move the, let's just move the whole operation of Texas, man. To Lubbock. Go just

610
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,340
full. Lubbock, we can go to the big city. Yeah, not, fuck Austin, dude. That shit. Yeah.

611
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:22,460
Lubbock's the next. Lubbock is next up. It's next, dude. Lubbock, Texas. Lubbock, Texas. We love it. We

612
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,980
love Lubbock. Just need some air fresheners in the office and we're good. Yep.

613
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,940
Texas is a, I think, I think that's gonna be the next like big place where

614
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,700
everybody lives. It'll be the next like California or New York. Yeah, yeah, I

615
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,900
think at ten years probably probably Texas probably gonna rival like India and

616
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,940
population. Yeah, probably over a billion people. Yeah, I think that it was

617
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,300
close to the Texas. We saw the Texas Chainsaw House. Yeah, we did now a shitty

618
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,140
restaurant. It's a restaurant on a bed and breakfast like mmm. Also, it wasn't

619
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,380
open. What kind of restaurant isn't open? Yeah, it was only open on like Wednesday.

620
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,060
a terrifying restaurant. It honestly was put there just to scare us. It was very

621
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,980
funny because it's called, they changed the name, it's now called the Grand

622
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,220
Central Cafe. Yeah. And they have a picture of like, they have a giant

623
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,220
picture of Grand Central Station like right at the front and like it's like

624
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,580
that's like the only theme-y thing and then we like went

625
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,180
around I looked in the other window and like they just have a they have a huge

626
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,420
like life-size figure of Leatherface. Yeah. Why would you not call it the

627
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,260
Leatherface Murder Restaurant? Trying to split the difference is insane. Yeah. Like one of

628
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,860
like pretend that it was never a and the only murder house or grand central,

629
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,340
because it had a has a train track that goes next to yeah yeah and it's like but

630
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,580
that's it's way more important that they made yeah the murder movie here right I

631
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,060
know and the only grand central theming was literally just a big a print yeah

632
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,420
picture of grand central station, but yeah it's very funny to to not be able

633
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,220
to decide yeah yeah, so we do yeah. Well, what is it going to make more people

634
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,220
walk in here. What do people like? What do people like? What are people, what are

635
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,500
gonna make people want to come in here? Also, don't make it a, make it a...

636
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,260
Make it an awesome playhouse, not a restaurant. Make it a mosque. Yeah, or an arcade.

637
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,660
That'd be cool. They built a mosque in the Texas Chainsaw House. Yep, and that's okay

638
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:18,460
with me? You know what I saw? What? A movie? If you look in the background of the

639
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,780
final shot of Texas Chainsaw, what can you see? You can see seven Muslim guys

640
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:28,820
cheering it on really they're saying yes go the best movie rooftop go leatherface

641
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,780

643
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,740

644
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,580
and they were they weren't cheering but I think they were probably just hanging

645
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,260
out. Yeah. Listening to some kind of club music. Some ungodly music. Yeah. Full Zohan'd out

Even though you don't live in san francisco cj, but we're gonna meet up we're gonna meet up in san francisco

660
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:06,060
And I will make you my food slave. Yeah, you will truly become my one food slave. Yep. I hope you like making uh

661
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:12,220
I hope you like making PB&J empanadas. I hope that's not too much for you CJ. A peanut butter

662
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,060
jelly sandwich with GF Extra Crunchy. You're probably so weak you can't even... Yo, Extra

663
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,380
Crunchy though. You probably can't even mix in the organic natural stuff, the oil and the peanut

664
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,420
butter when it separates. So I'm gonna get you the crunchy one. That's right. CJ, we're coming back

665
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,540
to San Francisco and we're gonna go and we're gonna attack you. Yep, and if you have a brother who

666
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,900
could be a toilet slave that'd be cool too. And if you have a sister who could be a TV slave then

667
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,140
We might have a whole slave family. Yeah. Yeah. We have top ten nastiest April

668
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,100
Fool's Day jokes today on the top tens on the top ten. This is from Heather. From

669
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,340
Heather? That's all they say Heather. Heather. That's all they say? That's all they say?

670
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,700
That's all they're saying is Heather? I'm very happy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I just opened this up on my phone too.

671
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,620
I don't know. We've seen her before I swear. Read it out. I think we've talked about this lady

672
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,180
before. I'm very happily married to the creator of this awesome website. I love

673
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,980
love hanging out with my husband traveling horror movies music and my

674
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,420
pets. I'm this is kind of this is a conflict of interest. You shouldn't be

675
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,580
allowed to make make a list. If you're married to the web, we agree to this is

676
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,660
like honestly fucking disgusting, especially to get like she gets her.

677
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,060
This is the second time we've had one of her lists on our show.

678
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:24,360
What was the other one? We did I can't remember is a very long to my years ago.

679
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,960
At this I can't remember her at all number one nastiest April Fool's day

680
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
is I'm gay.

681
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,820
- Damn!

682
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,520
- Damn.

683
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,780
- No, I'm not saying I'm gay.

684
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,620
- What?

685
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,600
- No, I'm not saying I'm gay.

686
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,900
I'm saying, I'm reading the list.

687
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,000
- You're saying you're gay.

688
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,920
- No, number one is saying, in quotes,

689
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,760
I'm gay.

690
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,220
- Caleb's gay?

691
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,100
- Here's a comment.

692
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,760
Someone said this in the lunchroom at school

693
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,940
and everybody believed it.

694
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,780
Then a few days later he said he wasn't,

695
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,900
but no one believed him

696
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,100
because he done told everybody he was gay.

697
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,900
(laughing)

698
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,300
I mean, it would freak out you parents, really.

699
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,140
- Yeah.

700
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,300
- Beck, you need to get some better parents, buddy.

701
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,880
- When I told my parents that Caleb was gay,

702
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,180
they said, "What? What?"

703
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,780
- "LOL, probably the funniest.

704
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,820
"It's more funny when a guy says that."

705
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,060
That is true, it's funnier when a girl says it,

706
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,220
it's just hot.

707
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,300
(snorts)

708
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,140
It's just cool.

709
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,260
- When a girl says it, it's just, I have to leave.

710
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,080
- Really?

711
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,920
- When they say it, yeah.

712
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,760
- Oh.

713
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,580
- Oh, when a girl says it?

714
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,420
- Yeah.

715
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,260
- Oh, okay.

716
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,080
- You guys think I have to leave right now?

717
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
April Fool's Day prank. That's a good prank.

718
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Guys, I have to leave.

719
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
It's genius.

720
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,080
It was a complete accident, but I could tell by the way you reacted that I accidentally pranked you.

721
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
I thought you just got a crazy notification or something.

722
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
I have to leave.

723
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
I can't believe I actually got pranked.

724
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
Yeah.

725
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Here's the comment. I'm going to try this next year.

726
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
Whoa.

727
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
I'm going to try this.

728
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
You guys ever do an insane April Fool's joke on someone?

729
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
Something next level?

730
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,440
I mean, I've talked about it before, but it wasn't really that, like, it was more on the

731
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,920
viewers of Pornhub.com.

732
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
You pranked the viewers?

733
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,160
Did you upload something?

734
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,240
I uploaded something and then four minutes and twenty seconds in.

735
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
He cut out the cum shot of him.

736
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
Yeah.

737
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Cutting off.

738
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,280
So people didn't even get to see the cum on his face?

739
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Yeah.

740
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,680
It was in high school and I edited four minutes and twenty seconds in.

741
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,320
It's just the Cory in the House theme song and then it cuts back to the video.

742
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,280
That honestly, I'm not kidding, that's the funniest bullshit I've ever heard in my fucking

743
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
life.

744
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,800
4 minutes and 20 seconds in?

745
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
It was in 2014.

746
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
You have to give me.

747
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,040
Are you kidding me bro?

748
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
You have to give me.

749
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I have to give you props and a word.

750
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
No.

751
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Cash props.

752
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
That's what I have to give you.

753
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
You have to let me.

754
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,280
I'm losing my fucking mind.

755
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,600
I'm falling out bro.

756
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
You have to.

757
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Nah.

758
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600

759
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,440
Nah bro I'm sliding out of my chair.

760
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Can you please give me the benefit of the doubt.

761
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
Bro that shit was insane dude.

762
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,600
Oh my god.

763
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
I was 16.

764
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Oh no.

765
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
I was 16 when I did that.

766
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
No.

767
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
It's too good.

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,000

793
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:17,040
because because it's very useful. Yep, I was a yeah. I don't think I was a I

794
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,040
mean, I think I think we're I don't know you're trying to defend. I think

795
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,540
that your old you know yeah, I think that we should. I think we should get

796
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,040
like a printer that can make that kind of thing like a lenticular picture

797
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,680
bookmark or something like I don't know how those are made, but I think that's

798
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,440
the next frontier. Yeah, let's take your stuff. We're just making bookmarks and

799
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,080
stuff. I would say the next frontier. You don't really see those anymore. Like

800
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,720
that was they were on the cover of books and movies and bookmarks. That's because

801
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,120
you don't nobody no kid wants to look at that anymore. It's because they lost

802
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,200
technology. But probably kids nowadays don't even know that that existed. And if

803
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,480
we bring it back, we're probably gonna make a fucking killing. I mean, it's like

804
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Dude, if Toys R Us started stocking hoops and sticks,

805
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,040
like the Victorian times.

806
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,320
- Toys R Us is gone, yeah.

807
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,400
- Yeah, well if they came back,

808
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,120
then probably they would sell a bunch of toys.

809
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,280
- Remember when Toys R Us went out of business

810
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,120
and then there was a GoFundMe?

811
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,280
- Kids nowadays probably don't even know about Toys R Us.

812
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,480
That's what I'm saying, you bring it back.

813
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,800
- Toys R Us went out of business,

814
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,600
then there was a GoFundMe where they were like,

815
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,880
bring Toys R Us back.

816
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,220
- They should bring it back.

817
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,180
people tried to buy toys are us out of bankruptcy. I probably got to go to

818
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,460
toys or us, maybe three times in my life. Me too. I got that was that's a

819
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,460
story. That's a store. Any parent that knows what's good for them will never

820
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,980
set foot in that store. That's the first like you like target is bad enough

821
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,500
right yeah. I only went there. I think one time and I stole some Pokemon cards

822
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,420
and got caught really. I was my mom got me a Playmobil treasure chest. I

823
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,420
shot. I remember after she was like you can't tell you your dad. I bought that

824
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,980
I bet a treasure chest is expensive. Yeah, a lot of treasure no matter what

825
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,180
fucking material it is. Yeah, yeah number two someone died who

826
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:09,180
you got dude. He got you got got what just saying hey guys someone died

827
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,780
who oh my God worked again. No, but seriously number two is someone

828
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,340
duray top ten says this should be number one one time on Super Mario

829
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,340
Logan Bowser jr. Pranked chef PP by telling him that his mom died. He

830
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,020
should have been grouted forever for doing something so harsh. Thanks as

831
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,340
As this list is the nastiest April Fool's Day jokes, this one has to be voted upon by me.

832
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,540
Not a joking matter, says Cheesy Nachos.

833
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,100
My cousin has done this before.

834
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Moose4life19.

835
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:41,060
If my cousin did that, I'd beat the crap out of him.

836
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,060
That would make someone cry/emotional/suicidal.

837
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,500
Spam peeper approved.

838
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Spam peeper?

839
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Who the fuck is Spam peeper?

840
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Who's Spam peeper?

841
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,700
I don't know, but he approved number two.

842
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,460
Oh, oh, Sam Pepper.

843
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
Remember him?

844
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,660
video it was like a video where it's like pranking my friend to tell him that I

845
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:06,500
died and it was a video of him like like I think he put like a bag over his head

846
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,920
and then his friend that video was fucked up I wasn't a fucking I in 2014 I wasn't

847
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:21,740
a legend I didn't watch this kind of stuff okay I was just I was a damn

848
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,100
normie and I would just watch fucking Breaking Bad like a normie dude. I wasn't doing awesome

849
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:34,180
legendary shit like that. I didn't even know who H3H3 was. He's judging me and I like it.

850
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:42,860
I should be judged. Number three, I'm pregnant. You're what? I'm pregnant. Are you actually

851
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:50,220
pregnant? Are you expecting? Yes, I'm pregnant. Holy fucking shit. Holy fucking balls. I'm

852
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,740
pregnant with holy shit holy okay crap tits I think this pregnancy might be

853
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,020
amazeballs if I actually put my mind to it and stop smoking I said this to my

854
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,780
mom she ended up going through my phone I regret nothing huh I told my mom I was

855
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:11,500
pregnant and I found out that day I was I was like no way I tried it too and I

856
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,380
I am an eleven year old girl. I could never pull that off. I'm only eleven

857
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:23,540
it's not about it's that it's just it would be too much logistics too much

858
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,940
planning. I try to have the executive function. I tried it. My friend believed

859
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,560
me and I'm an eleven year old boy.

860
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,500
The hell do it.

861
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,880
I if do you think if you like swallow something can it show up on an

862
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,500
ultrasound? No, yes, yeah, so if I

863
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,320
like if I like a volleyball and I wrote on it like April fools that I don't

864
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,220
think that they would see the text on it. Okay, what if it was like okay, okay,

865
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,000
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, what if it's like okay, a dinner plate and the

866
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,980
letters April fools are like cut out of it. I saw there lost me at dinner. I'm

867
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,000
too hungry now. Okay, well I'd be I would said eat before the way before that,

868
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,340
so you should have been least should have lost that

869
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:12,200
because to eat is more delicious dinner eat is any meal eat is any meal or snack

870
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,920
that's true or anything that you could eat snack this. I can't eat that you

871
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,200
could eat this. That's what eat could also be a piss. Who's dinner is just

872
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,200
going to be a normal food dinner could be and you could prank somebody that

873
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,400
by but anyway, then they could ultrasound and see

874
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,600
it would look like I

875
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,200
that would be a speech bubble. You should do maybe like a bunch of shit

876
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,020
That wouldn't show up very well.

877
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,520
Eat so much shit that you look pregnant.

878
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Because there's already a bunch of shit in there, so it would be hard for it to have a contrast.

879
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
What are you doing?

880
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,520
I took a b-reel.

881
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
What's a b-reel?

882
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
I took a b-reel.

883
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
You don't have a b-reel?

884
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
I took a b-reel.

885
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Bro, how many times do I have to tell you, man?

886
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
I'm not with it like you.

887
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Yeah?

888
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Yeah, dude.

889
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
I'm not fucking up with all the different apps and shit.

890
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
You take one photo.

891
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
I don't even know what pingas means.

892
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Pingas?

893
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
Yeah, what the hell is that?

894
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,520
Well, then you should have seen it at the Chicago show.

895
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,560
Who the fuck is Mama Luigi, man? I don't know this shit, dude.

896
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,200
I knew that shit.

897
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,880
Which yo legendary ass.

898
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,160
It's making the cable go crazy.

899
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,520
Number four, I'm moving away. I used to do this a lot when I was a kid.

900
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,000
Really?

901
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,400
Yeah.

902
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,280
You ever try to run away as a kid?

903
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,720
Were you like attention starved?

904
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Uh, probably, yeah.

905
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,280
That's like the equivalent of like, I haven't eaten anything all day.

906
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,760
Yeah.

907
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:28,920
Yeah.

908
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,080
But I was six. I don't think a lot of six year olds say I haven't eaten anything all day.

909
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,340
I know I'm sorry. I was trying to be a role. Yeah. Well, I know that's what I mean. That's like

910
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:43,180
That's probably the same time. That's the same type of behavior that I actually did this on April Fool's maybe two week two years in a

911
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,520
row

912
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,640
And I would just I would just pick somebody and tell them that I don't remember what I did for April Fool's

913
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,340
I'm gonna prank dude. This is rude. What if I told you guys I was moving away. I'll be pretty sad. What?

914
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:02,380
Guys, I'm not I just was I was just saying like I was just saying I'm moving away. I'm not moving. No Pat

915
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,480
I'm not moving away man. I'm staying right here. He wants you to move away. He knows

916
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,180
it's a prank and that's why he said. He's distracted. Look at him. He's distracted by

917
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,180
a shadow on the floor. I got distracted because I just remembered what's in this

918
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,060
bag. What's in it? Wait, what's in that bag? What? I don't think we can say it.

919
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:26,340
What's in the bag? Oh, I just remembered what's in that bag. I don't know what's

920
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,620
in that bag. I don't think so. We'll tell you later. Yeah. I think it might

921
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,960
fucking blow your mind and you might enter a new dimension.

922
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Wait, what?

923
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,360
When did you guys get a bag that I can't know about?

924
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,360
You don't remember what's in this?

925
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,340
I'm just going to hold the bag.

926
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,640
I think you should.

927
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,220
What's in there?

928
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,160
Was I here when the bag was arrived?

929
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
I think so.

930
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,440
I think you were here when I ordered this bag.

931
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,200
When you ordered the bag.

932
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,200
Can I see a part of it?

933
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Oh shit.

934
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,200
Yep.

935
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,200
No way.

936
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,200
Yep.

937
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,880
I completely forgot about this bag. This bag is swag. One day that's going to pay

938
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,200
off.

939
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,700
Yeah, that's going to pay off.

940
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,200
And it's going to sit right there.

941
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,200
You guys are all going to look back.

942
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
And you at home, you have to guess what's in the bag.

943
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,200
You guys are all going to look back in like a few months or a year or

944
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
whatever, and you go, oh my God, that's what they were talking about.

945
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,700
Exactly.

946
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,700
In the bag. Five hundred of something.

947
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,200
They ordered five hundred of something that they didn't use.

948
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
That was supposed to be used on the tour.

949
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,640
MinecraftCrazy530 says, "I need to do this to my enemy."

950
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,660
It's like, your enemy would be happy about that, you asshole.

951
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,500
- Yeah.

952
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,340
- Well, maybe it's like a Batman joke or situation.

953
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,440
- I relate hard as fuck to their username, though.

954
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,280
- Yeah.

955
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,100
- I just did this--

956
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,940
- Is it MinecraftCrazy530?

957
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,760
- Yeah, 530.

958
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,800
- Yo, 530, you know I'm cracking a beer open.

959
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,300
- 530, you get home from work, exactly 530,

960
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,160
hop on the beer. - Exactly 530.

961
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,000
- Hop on the computer.

962
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,740
- Hop on the beer, yeah.

963
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,200
Yeah, I shove that beer up my butt.

964
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,000
I jump on that like like Zangie from Street Fighter. You jump on your

965
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,700
spinner. Yeah, I spin around and I want jumps his butt on it. It jump my

966
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:09,300
but it open it around if it's a twist off and you spin around that

967
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,600
actually yeah kind of sick if it's not a twist off you just have to pull

968
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,700
number six. I'm dying. No, you're not actually dying. Are you okay? I'll

969
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,100
tell you this much. Are you okay? I remember you okay. I remember this

970
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:28,280
I put red pen ink all over my face on a scissor and on hand and leg and it looked like I stabbed my leg

971
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,700
I watch out pretending to trud down the hallway everyone

972
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:37,060
Trud down the hallway everyone was screaming and running around in Curtis

973
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,500
They were freaking out then I stood up and everyone gasped and I said it's red pink April fools

974
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:49,460
But everyone was traumatized for the rest of the day damn that is fucked up. I get you skipped one, dude

975
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,460
I did something similar.

976
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,460
You skipped number five.

977
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,460
Oh shit, I did.

978
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,460
We have to go back to number six.

979
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,460
But wait, what did you do that was similar?

980
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
It was my friend Declan's end of the year party

981
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,460
in the

982
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
seventh grade.

983
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,460
Yeah.

984
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,460
And I

985
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,460
took a marker

986
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,460
and I

987
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,460
convinced my friend's mom

988
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,460
that this kid Mike

989
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,820
pinched me in the nose and I had like red ink all over and I was just like

990
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:28,420
nothing nothing happened. We used to do all sorts of fucking Harold and Maude

991
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,820
shit with my parents. We would like do the pretend you're dead and cover

992
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:37,420
yourself and catch up in your room thing yeah and then call for you. We would call

993
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,340
we'd be like mom or dad and then they would get to our room and we'd be

994
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,660
pretending to be dead. It's like well how could you die so fast? Yeah how could you?

995
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,460
and they never fell for it even a single time.

996
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,780
- Yeah. - Yeah, that makes sense.

997
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,500
- But literally I just took a marker

998
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,660
and just drew on my upper lip.

999
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,500
- Nice. - And I was like,

1000
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
"I'm fucking bleeding!"

1001
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,540
- Yeah.

1002
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,900
Number five is someone wants to go out with you.

1003
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,820
Here's a comment, that'd be rude.

1004
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,140
- LMAO, I almost got slapped when I told my cousin this.

1005
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,300
- Look at my face.

1006
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,620
Who wants to go out with me?

1007
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,620
- Your cousin?

1008
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,740
- My cousin?

1009
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,580
- Yep.

1010
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,420
- I have to call him. - Score!

1011
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,620
- Here's one.

1012
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,940
- I have to call him right now.

1013
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,380
- Just had this done like five minutes ago on messages.

1014
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,180
my enemy did it to me. I'm so upset. Damn. If someone this guy's getting that, if

1015
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,580
someone tells me this joke, I'm going to smash them into oblivion. Oh, you want to

1016
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,580
go out me? I'm going to smash you. This one, the one where they just had it done

1017
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,480
five minutes ago. Do you think it's a coincidence where they like pulled up

1018
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,680
this list and they're like, oh, like somebody just did this or do you think

1019
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,680
that that that happened to them and they opened up the top tens and searched

1020
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,680
prank? Someone wants to go out with you so they could comment on this. Someone

1021
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,040
says I am going to walk under a truck. Why? That's all I say. That's just cruel,

1022
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,760
especially when after you go and talk to the person. It is so embarrassing, not

1023
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,840
that it's ever happened to me or anything. Fidget, fidget. Number nine, remove the frog.

1024
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:01,840
Fidget, fidget. A frog write that? Yeah, what a frog write that? Fidget, fidget.

1025
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,680
You know how they be saying that? Wait, I'm remembering now, they say

1026
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,320
they say ribbit, ribbit. Yeah, wait Pat, why are you calling us a

1027
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:17,960
fidget. Oh my God. Oh my God. Look at him. Just look at him. Just look at him.

1028
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,040
It's all you can do.

1029
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:28,480
That's a good phase. You'd be a great female librarian. Yeah. With your

1030
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,240
glasses like that, like down on your nose. Yeah, that would be good. I'm

1031
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,400
trying to look like when Ernest dresses up like a grandma.

1032
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,560

1043
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:14,880
Don't do it my friend's cousin did this and her boyfriend committed suicide. It's not funny damn damn

1044
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,920
What he pranked her harder than she pranked him. Yeah, that's a better prank. Yeah

1045
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:26,680
Kill yourself. Yeah, that's a good prank in in what world is that something you guys are okay with joking about?

1046
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:35,040
You just got pranked yeah, oh my god. I actually think that's fucking horrible. It's fucking atrocious to kill yourself

1047
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,580
it's selfish disgrace yeah to God exactly it's not okay to joke you're taking

1048
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:44,400
you're actually it's a it's a it's a permanent solution to a temporary

1049
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,480
problem yep and also that life that you just took could have gone to an aborted

1050
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,520
child yep yeah instead you used it to fucking what you use it to you use this

1051
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,760
to fight yourself all over the you could have cured cancer if you weren't so

1052
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,720
lazy abortion and all the time blown it up with you inside but instead you

1053
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,600
you fucking wasted your you just put your dad's bullet in your head right you

1054
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,080
could have just down a bullet yeah he's gonna get gored by a wild boar yep you

1055
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,120
could have jumped out of a plane on to an antifa rally yeah but instead you didn't

1056
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,520
you decided to kill yourself said you took cyanide yep that's right

1057
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:28,480
yeah you could have flown over Russian talk some damn sense into Vladimir

1058
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,480
Putin I do feel bad for people who tried to kill themselves before we had like

1059
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,600
guns and stuff. Why? Because it must just been hard. Probably really easy. I don't think

1060
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,840
anyone tried to kill themselves until they invented depression with corn syrup. True.

1061
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,400
When NAFTA was created. That's a good point. Yeah, I think it also you could I think there's

1062
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,280
way more ways to you could just walk into an animal. Let's be real, how many ways to

1063
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,720
die are there? You could walk to an animal. What? There's one thousand ways to die. But

1064
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,800
what if the animal what if it's a straight straight Yogi Bear situation? Then that gives

1065
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,200
you a reason to live. Best friend situation. Win win. Yeah. It's a win win dude. Either

1066
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,220
raised by wolves or here's the thing about a thousand ways to die

1067
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:09,300
crave crave to be raised yeah there's a thing about a thousand ways to die

1068
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:15,540
there's a thousand ways to die yeah but really there's only four subsections of

1069
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:24,860
how to die elaborate please there's like you know impaled mm-hmm poisoned yep

1070
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,860
Drowned.

1071
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,860
Yep.

1072
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,860
Shot.

1073
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,860
Okay, so what about when you fall?

1074
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
Fall.

1075
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,700
You're getting impaled by your own bones.

1076
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,260
What about my grandpa dying in his sleep?

1077
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,260
Poison.

1078
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,260
Body poison.

1079
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,260
What about cancer?

1080
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,260
Is that poison?

1081
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,260
Cancer is definitely poison.

1082
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,260
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1083
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,820
What about getting sucked into a propeller?

1084
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,900
Getting sucked into a propeller.

1085
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,900
What about--

1086
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,900
I think that's a poison.

1087
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,900
What about struck by lightning?

1088
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,300
Struck by lightning is a tail because you're--

1089
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,300
No, electricity poison.

1090
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,300
No, that's shot.

1091
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,300
Yeah, that's shot.

1092
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,300
That's shot.

1093
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:00,440
shot into a propeller what if like a wizard makes you instantly vanish yeah

1094
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:08,120
what if you shooting that's a shooting because he shoots his wand what if he

1095
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,320
doesn't use this one he's really got us honestly well if he doesn't use his one

1096
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,200
he probably uses finger or a thought we have shoot at him okay but yeah you're

1097
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,920
getting shot with a ray of yeah wait so it was it's impale isn't being shot all

1098
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,760
- Impaled?

1099
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,700
- Impaled is the same as shot.

1100
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,540
- Impaled?

1101
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,360
- Those are both shot.

1102
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,080
- No, no, 'cause you don't shoot with a knife,

1103
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,800
unless it's a ballistic knife.

1104
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,160
- What if you load a gun with a knife?

1105
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,480
- That's still an impale.

1106
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,520
- I think instead of impale, it's hit.

1107
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,200
- Yeah, what if you get hit really hard in the head?

1108
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,040
- I think, yeah.

1109
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,880
- 'Cause then that covers falling, too.

1110
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,700
- But a hit, yeah, a hit could also be an impalement.

1111
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,200
- I think an impalement is a hit.

1112
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,960
- Okay, so it's hit, shot, poisoned, drowned.

1113
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,100
- Drown is poison though, drown is water poison.

1114
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,180
- You are getting poisoned by water.

1115
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,020
- We're not suffocating.

1116
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,920
- The last one is peaceful death.

1117
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,760
- Peaceful.

1118
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,760
- Fourth is peaceful.

1119
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,600
- Yeah.

1120
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,440
- Suffocating is poison too.

1121
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,280
- 'Cause you're being poisoned by it.

1122
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,120
- 'Cause it's air poison.

1123
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,620
- No, no, the fourth is break.

1124
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,460
(laughing)

1125
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,780
- Break?

1126
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,620
What does that mean?

1127
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,600
- That means you break.

1128
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,560
- Like you broke in half?

1129
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,880
- Yeah, you broke in half or your neck broke.

1130
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,160
- Okay, fair enough.

1131
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,760
What about if you get torn apart by,

1132
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,000
so if you get torn apart by chains like this set of bites,

1133
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,840
that's a break.

1134
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,840
- Yeah, that's break, 'cause that's not anything else.

1135
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,440
He's smart.

1136
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,600
- Damn.

1137
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,660
- What about being hanged?

1138
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,240
- Being hanged, that's a break.

1139
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,080
- Break your neck.

1140
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,580
- Break your neck, unless you're suffocated,

1141
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,840
then that's a poison,

1142
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,380
'cause you're getting poisoned by air.

1143
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,480
- What about being eaten?

1144
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,580
- Yeah, eaten. - Swallowed whole.

1145
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,120
- Eaten is a break.

1146
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,040
- No, you're swallowed whole.

1147
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,080
- No, 'cause think about it.

1148
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,920
Think about it. - You're digested.

1149
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,980
- Think about it. - That's poison.

1150
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,040
- Think about it. - That's poison.

1151
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,960
- You get eaten.

1152
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,540
Think about eating a flat wing.

1153
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,880
The flat of a wing.

1154
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,920
- Quicksand.

1155
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,200
- Quicksand is a poison. - Quicksand.

1156
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,260
- What is that suffocation?

1157
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,100
- Oh yeah.

1158
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,460
- That's 'cause you have to break the flat of the wing

1159
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,300
to get the beat up.

1160
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,120
- Heart attack is poison?

1161
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,960
- Heart attack is poison by the body.

1162
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,760
- Or is your heart hitting you?

1163
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,600
- It's a poison.

1164
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,420
- I think it's shooting.

1165
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,600
- It's a poignant pain.

1166
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,440
- Shooting pain in your left arm.

1167
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,260
- Your blood is good poison.

1168
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,460
- That's why they call it a shooting pain.

1169
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,360
- No, it's a poison.

1170
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,780
- Your blood doesn't get poisoned.

1171
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,620
- Your blood turns into poison with a heart attack.

1172
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,460
- That's just not true.

1173
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,340
- That's sepsis.

1174
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,720
- Okay, then it's a break because your heart broke.

1175
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,420
- What if you die for no reason at all?

1176
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,260
- If you die for no reason at all.

1177
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,820
you what if you cross your eye for no reason what if you make a weird face and

1178
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,280

1190
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:31,380
okay computer computer is a shot lost in a chocolate river lost in a chocolate

1191
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,220
oh yeah glue break Augustus glooped yeah glooped is a break because you're not

1192
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,540
breaking

1193
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:41,700
listening if anything. It's a drown. No, think about it, because you're in the tube, the

1194
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:48,220
tube compresses you. It's breaking you. Think about the 3D, the Augustus Gloop was stuck

1195
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:53,820
in a tube. The A Thousand Ways to Die announcer says like, he was stuck in a tube that compressed

1196
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:58,260
his ribs which broke into his heart. Over 3,000 pounds of pressure applied to the boy's

1197
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:03,340
ribs. Yeah. I think right now Augustus Gloop is the funniest thing in the world to me. I

1198
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:07,580
I think in the past few weeks, I literally I the other day, like after we got back

1199
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,980
for our sitting at home and I thought about Augustus Gloop and started

1200
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:14,900
laughing at myself. It is so funny. You always mentioned the name being the

1201
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,500
name is the it's the funniest thing ever. I think we even talked about the

1202
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,340
show, but just them having a board meeting yeah and deciding who's going to

1203
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,500
get killed, which way maybe that what do we do with that gloop boy, the gloop

1204
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,100
fellow? I don't know. Maybe we turn them into a blueberry. Maybe what what kind

1205
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,460
chocolate should we kill agustus gloop with should it be solid chocolate i

1206
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,180
don't know i mean i'm not so sure and bill maybe hmm yeah or maybe glue

1207
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:43,620
hold on hold on hold on let's go through so agustus gloop that's a break that's

1208
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,660
not a break i don't agree with that that's a break that's not a break i

1209
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,620
don't agree with violet beauregard you're the tie breaker for a gloop i

1210
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,060
think loop is poison because i think it's drowning i think it's drowning which is

1211
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,380
not poison you know what drowning is poison but he gets into the tube i think

1212
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:01,260
you know i know what you drowns from lack of air yet to drown i think it's a

1213
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,560
wardrobe within we sent out as a poison

1214
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,220
no we're to have drowning drives one of the thing that i was just shoot is it

1215
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,140

1216
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:12,600
yeah okay so dronics poison that was a good idea of what i've heard is a

1217
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,380
reasonable is operating as poison

1218
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,500

1225
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,220

1230
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:55,580
Mike TV as he got shot with a TV as a microphone was shot with a shrink ray

1231
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,340
and shrank but it's probably broke all his bones when he that's also that could

1232
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,780
be a break laws of physics situation yeah you know what I think it's for small

1233
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:06,300
this it's - it's two poisons and two breaks all right juice world juice world

1234
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,980
just real poison yeah that's pretty hmm cut I think broken heart is that's the

1235
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,740
own was poison by a bullet is bright wait do we say his shot is hit by a ball

1236
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,540
yeah he's hit by a bullet allegedly uh... all of them are kind of a deal

1237
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:25,380
anybody got a holiday got upper richie valens all pool in her skinner

1238
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:29,380

00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,300
that's a hit you hit the the plane here was a break

1240
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,940
they break apart on the ground seeing is yours only yeah you're not good at this

1241
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,020
they were created a by that i would be a perfect system and then you couldn't

1242
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,860
stand to see it for us yet to destroy it

1243
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:48,160
but i you know i i i think that they all to break it they all could be their hit

1244
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,440
by death i think it's only only to is there a hit and wife

1245
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,820
yeah yeah there's no two things that kill you those are also the with the

1246
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,600
the words that echo in your head

1247
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,420
and i think i have a lot of

1248
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,020
yes

1249
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:05,300

01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:13,820
life-and-life self yeah exactly yet yet elliot smith died from wife probably but

1252
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,620
it was framed to look like a hit of a knife.

1253
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,620
Uh-huh.

1254
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,620
The hit of a knife.

1255
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,620
Yeah.

1256
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,500
That would be a sick fucking name for an album.

1257
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,500
The hit of a knife.

1258
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,500
The hit of a knife.

1259
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,500
And then...

1260
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,940
I would say the blade of a knife would be known.

1261
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,180
Robert Blake, the hit of a blade.

1262
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,180
Robert Blake did a...

1263
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,900
The sharpness of a knife's blade.

1264
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,700
It's going to be the sharpness of the knife.

1265
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,380
Robert Blake did a hit on his wife.

1266
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,380
Yep.

1267
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,140
So that's an opposites react situation.

1268
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,140
Yeah.

1269
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,140
And then...

1270
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,140
Opposites react is the third way.

1271
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,140
Phil Spector...

1272
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:48,740
just show her words opposites attract Robert Blake did the same thing right

1273
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:54,140
