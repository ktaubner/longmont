1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
come back and make a bet

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,120
and receive a bite

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,920
so

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,240
on the way on the way

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,280
into the

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,480
the office

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,520
i've been is we got like some kind of

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,040
all men are cursed

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,540
was placed on us

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,920
your deterred your mic off again what do you do that the second before record

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,920
I don't know. What? It was on and then you turned it off. I don't think I've ever done that.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,400
You do that a lot. Is it working now? You don't do it anymore. You just did it again. What?

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Is it working now? Yeah. Am I working?

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,740
Yeah. Okay.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,400
How about now? Why do you turn it? It sounds horrible. It makes a click noise. It makes like an electrical

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,960
click noise.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
It's not a funny bit because nobody can hear what you're saying when it's off. So when you say

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,920
"Is it working?" it doesn't like translate at all in the audio. Does it pick up on your mic?

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,720
I don't know.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,920
That probably does if you're yelling, yeah.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,840
- I quit.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,660
- Yeah.

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,200
- I'd knock you off. - That was a good one.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,640
So-- - Carmichael!

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,880
- What?

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,720
- What's that?

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,360
- I said his name wrong.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
And no one at home will know I said it wrong.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,400
Well, you yelled it.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,040
I said if you yell it, so you yelled it.

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,680
- Well, I'll just say you said Carmichael,

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,840
you didn't say Cameron.

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,200
- And you yelled it too, so it's loud.

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
Get on with your curse story.

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,680
I was walking in here, I was walking up to the office,

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,040
and in front of the office there's a car

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,240
they're like like double parked in the street people in it as I walked by a

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,580
lady got out of the car. She's holding a crow in her hand now and she placed it.

39
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,040
You know how there's like a the like tree with like a little grassy area

40
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,440
around it. She put the crow in the grass at the tree in front of the office and

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,880
it just started pecking around as I walked in a pitch black of a black bird,

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,600
a crow. I did see that our double parked. She got out of the car. I swear to God,

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,620
not an April Fool's joke. I really saw that and it's I think that something bad

44
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,200
is going to happen and then I walked in here and you guys tried to scare me and

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,000
I walked in and I was like I was feeling weird cuz I was like I just saw a lady

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,280
put a spell on me and like I walked in and all the lights were off but

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,760
everything like the coffee maker was on and doors were open and stuff and I

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,040
really thought I was being haunted for a second. What if you had found that me and Patrick

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,240
had been slaughtered to death? Yeah. Would you have felt anything? Yeah. What if our

50
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,600
rib cages had been ripped open by a dead space monster. I don't understand.

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,080
What if I was in here, what if you walked in here and you saw me eating ribs?

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,720
Would you be sad if me and him both died and there was blood covering everything

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,600
including you? If you were covered in blood, would you like it or not like it?

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,240
If I was covered in sauce, would you wipe me down? If you saw your whole family die, would you

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:50,640
cry or smile? Cry? Because of laughter or sadness? There's a right answer. There is a

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,160
a right answer. Sadness. Sadness because you're because you're crying or because

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:04,040
your family died? Both. Okay. All right. You got it. These are all the right answers. You solved the puzzle.

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,160
If you walked in here and I was eating a rack of ribs. That would honestly piss

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,680
me off so bad. I know. Yeah. I would be annihilated if I walked in

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,160
and you were eating like a full 12 rack of ribs,

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,440
barbecue sauce all over your face.

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,280
- Why?

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
- It would just annoy me.

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,280
- It would be a nasty thing to do.

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,680
- Especially if I saw you pour more barbecue sauce

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,520
on the ribs.

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
(laughing)

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,360
I think that that might finally make me fucking kill you.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
- Yeah?

70
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,640
- Yeah, if I saw you pour stubs on the ribs.

71
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,520
- Would be stubs, stubs is a cooking.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
You put stubs, you don't put more.

73
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,780
- Dude, I'm like tearing up thinking about this.

74
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,280
This is like, I would be so pissed off.

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,580
Stubbs is too liquidy for me.

76
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,520
Even this is getting too close to me.

77
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Stubbs is not thick enough.

78
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,320
Because now I know that you're imagining the ribs, and I know that they would be short

79
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
ribs.

80
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,600
He's going to put chocolate syrup on them.

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,480
Is there the exception?

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,560
Are you baby back or beef ribs?

83
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
I think I'm baby back.

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Yeah, okay.

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
That's better.

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
That's a little better.

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,680
But what if, I think the exception to this, barbecue spare ribs from a Chinese place.

88
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
No.

89
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,360
Not boneless, like bone-in spare ribs, like Chinese style.

90
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,520
That's not a rack of ribs though, that doesn't bother me.

91
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,880
What if I make it that, like I put a smoker outside?

92
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,680
If you put a smoker outside I think I would maybe forgive you for eating a humongous serving

93
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
of ribs in front of me.

94
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Because I would give you something.

95
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Because I would be like, "I'll give you a smoker."

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,920
Regardless, you guys come in, I'm eating ribs.

97
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm giving you like one rib.

98
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,680
I don't want to eat a rib, dude, because I know that you're sitting here and you've already

99
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,880
touched every last one of them.

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,880
I know you've touched every rib. You're picking them. "Oh, which one do I want?"

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Squeezing them, trying to see which one is the softest, because you have no teeth.

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
You can gum them down harder.

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
I have teeth. You don't have teeth.

104
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
You don't have teeth. In this scenario, I have no teeth.

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Yeah, you're eating ribs with no teeth.

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
(laughter)

107
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,880
They have to be very tender. You're just chewing into them with gum.

108
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Yeah, oh my God, and you're wearing a bib.

109
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,880
You're wearing a bib, and like, you're wearing like, you're wearing like a, like...

110
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Why did we stop wearing bibs when we grow up?

111
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
You're wearing like a hazmat suit made out of grocery bags.

112
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Here's the thing, man.

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
So the fanciest thing that you can eat

114
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
is lobster. You wear a bib.

115
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
But then the least fancy thing you need is baby food.

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
And you wear a bib.

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
It's horseshoe theory.

118
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
It all comes down back around.

119
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
It's horseradish theory.

120
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
You dip in one of those.

121
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
So what's in the middle?

122
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
What's the exact bib?

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Lollipop.

124
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,680
is much closer to baby. It's a fancy versus not. Let's take the horseshoe

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,100
right now. Okay, okay, so it is least fit. Okay, yeah, least fancy baby food

126
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,840
cat food.

127
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Yeah, next, yeah,

128
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,120
but you could wear a bib where eating. Yeah, that's like, yeah, ribs has got

129
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,360
to be right above cat food, then because you can wear a baby. No, ribs is on

130
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,700
the lobster side. Yeah, ribs is on the lobster side. You can get surf and

131
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,060
turf

132
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,580
ribs

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
turf and turf. That's barbeque ribs on a lobster. And fish ribs. True. Gills. Barbeque gills.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah. Yeah. Fish ribs. Wait, no that's the. Disgusting. What are you picking up? I was

135
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,040
going to make the horseshoe. I was going to. We don't need to draw anything. We can use

136
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,920
the theater of the mind. We have a highly imaginative audience. So first imagine a letter

137
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,160
C. Rotate it 90 degrees. And then put all those. I think I have them dots all over them.

138
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,400
Yeah, what's that about? You ever heard about those are fleas from the horse? I have okay. Okay, so like

139
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,200
baby food cat food horse meat

140
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,840
Horse meat is pretty fancy

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,920
To me the definition of a salad in a can definition of fancy if you go into a restaurant and you ask for it and they

142
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Don't have it. That's fancy

143
00:06:49,920 --> 00:07:01,160
That logic you go into I don't know like nope, no, what's uh, what's the fancy restaurant?

144
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,400
I say a fan okay obviously a fancy restaurant has fancy food and if you ask

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,440
if you go to a fancy restaurant you ask if they have food and they say no then

146
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,080
that's not fancy. I don't think Lucien's fancy. In my brain the fanciest

147
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,760
restaurant you can go to is Ruth's Chris and those are in hotels. They just have

148
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,960
like steak but I honestly I'm like that's the fanciest. If you go to Peter Luger, so by that logic if you go to like Peter Luger and ask for a

149
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,280
Crunchwrap Supreme that's what I'm saying. That makes it fancy? No because Peter Luger is

150
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,600
fancy so if you go to a non fancy restaurant and you ask for something and

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,760
they don't have it it's fancy but if you go to a fancy restaurant and ask for

152
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,280
something I don't know it I think the middle here uh-huh the direct center of

153
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,360
the horseshoe is Taco Bell it could be between lobster and baby food yeah I

154
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,960
think that actually is right I think you might actually be on yeah I think that

155
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,320
you would never ever wear a bib and Taco Bell no you would be removed you would

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,380
you'd be on the news if you showed up.

157
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,420
- You would be at Taco Bell.

158
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,360
- If you sat down at Taco Bell with a Crunchwrap Supreme

159
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,040
and a Chipotle chicken burrito,

160
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,000
and you wrapped a bib around your neck.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
- You would be on the news.

162
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,200
- Yeah, you'd be, because I would kill you.

163
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,040
- Exactly.

164
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,680
- There's a gun under the register.

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
- Yeah, exactly.

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,680
- And they whip it out when someone comes in with a bib.

167
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,200
- There's a button they have that's in case of bib.

168
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,040
- It's like a Matt Lauer button.

169
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,440
It locks all the doors in the restaurant.

170
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,760
The storm shutters come down.

171
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,120
And then check this out, on either side of Taco Bell, slightly more bib-worthy, non-fancy

172
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,960
side McDonald's, fancy side Five Guys.

173
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,080
Yep, because them burgers is cheesy as a motherfucker.

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
And greasy too.

175
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
No grease in Taco Bell, or cheese.

176
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,240
You're not going to go to jail for wearing a bib there, but it's still a bit of a faux

177
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
pas.

178
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
You won't be killed.

179
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,640
If you wear a bib at Five Guys or McDonald's, and McDonald's people are going to assume you're

180
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
doing a prank.

181
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
I feel like wearing a bib at Five Guys, I could see a hipster doing that.

182
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,120
Well I could definitely see a hipster doing basically anything morally wrong.

183
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Probably a plaid bib.

184
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,540
And hipsters would eat both ends of the fancy and non-fancy spectrum because they would

185
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,520
eat fancy because you can't afford it and they would eat baby food because they're like

186
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,040
what you think it's not good?

187
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,600
But then also the bib is going to confuse them because they think that it's some kind

188
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
of scarf.

189
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Yeah that's true.

190
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
My infinity bib.

191
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah.

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
My infinity bib got sauce on it.

193
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,160
It goes around on my back too so if I hold my food behind the back of my head and it

194
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
my drips. I'm safe. Yeah, I won't get it on my way. Yep,

195
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:32,160
I won't get it on my my cafe latte americano. Yeah, I don't get anything in

196
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,120
my there. I'm not going to get any of my rib sauce in my cafe. Oh, no, yeah, or

197
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
my or my pointed devil tail.

198
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,920
Yeah, exactly, because the devil is a damn hipster. Yeah, and I left I left

199
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,520
before it was cool. Yep, yep, that's true. That's what the devil said. And you know

200
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,420
he likes rock. Uh-huh. I hate that rock shit. You know what God listens to? What?

201
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,340
Iron and Wine. He loves that crap. He loves that boom bap ho hey stuff. You know

202
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,820
what he loves? God loves Lumineers, the devil. He loves the, he loves Jet, Are You

203
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,140
Gonna Be My Girl? That's his favorite song. Jesus Christ favorite song is that

204
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,520
that song like paper and fire paper and fire living on the airstream baby that

205
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,160
one fact you should talk to my dad David yeah yeah I think you guys might really

206
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,000
get along what's that song it's called paper and fire did you make it up did

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,760
you know it I don't know my dad might have originally recorded that and put it

208
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,200
on his iPod you know it'd be so funny if that song is like a like royalty-free

209
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
free song.

210
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,560
My dad just listens to the royalty free music all day. These are just the

211
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,000
these are the most like the true

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,280
garage man like in music. It's by this. It's by this like crazy, like like

213
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,200
Indy garage rock guy. His name is Kevin MacLeod. He makes like crazy punk

214
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,080

Leoed yeah me too yeah and then you and then you realize it's but yeah, it's

216
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,400
cloud the fucked up this fucked up guy mm-hmm strange strange guy strange fruit

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,600
what do you wrote that - yeah really yeah it's royalty free yeah oh that's cool

218
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,460

00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,240
else did he write I like scheming weasel you know that one no that's the song

220
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,680
it's like Turner Turner you know that the one you know the one I know that one

221
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,920
Why did Evanescence become a free music that you could use on YouTube?

222
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,160
Well you could use, I think it was UMG or something, there was some licensing

223
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,880
agreement between YouTube and some record company

224
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,480
and that's why all of those you could like put. Evanescence and then like

225
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,520
Finger Eleven Paralyzer and then 009 Sound System.

226
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,840
That's too loud you have to stop. Yeah. Let's sing that for the rest of the

227
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,880
episode they should have one they should have bought out the Lonely Island yep

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
yeah it would have been awesome it was so she would like the first like when

229
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,920
YouTube would get like you get copyright strikes for music and shit and you would

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,320
have to like replace the that was when they did it manually though which so is

231
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,080
easier to get away with it if you as long as your video didn't have a lot of

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,480
views you could post whatever you wanted yeah but like yeah when they would they

233
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,840
would give you to be like hey we took all the audio out of your thing so then

234
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,000
And then there'll be like a 50 minute fucking tutorial

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,300
on how to load OS 10 onto a computer,

236
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,160
and then the guy's just like mouthing the words

237
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
and you just hear,

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,840
♪ How can you see through my eyes ♪

239
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,680
It was awesome, dude.

240
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,100
- That's what they do with skate videos still.

241
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,440
Like the first, what's that movie,

242
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,520
Foundation, that's like the intro

243
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
is a 21st century schizoid man.

244
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
It has no sound, and then it goes to the first part,

245
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,780
and then there's music, and you like,

246
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,080
"Oh, well just why not just like take the fucking video down?"

247
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,920
You know?

248
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,980
- Dude, these fucking, these drug addicts

249
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,240
who are in charge of all the music

250
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,820
and you get shot in the head and killed.

251
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,260
- Yeah, copyright.

252
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,180
It's all about copyright nowadays.

253
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,260
- I genuinely believe--

254
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,680
- I actually call it copy white.

255
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,980
- Yeah, these fat cats, these big cheeses,

256
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,220
they just wanna line their pockets

257
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,660
with TMs and Cs in circles.

258
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,500
- I genuinely believe that's a copyright

259
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,220
last thing Hitler invented.

260
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,160
you think that was right before he died

261
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,280
he was like

262
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,320
and also he was like i'm gonna kill myself

263
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,360
yeah he was like nobody else can do this

264
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,320
oh yeah

265
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,440
and copyrighted

266
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,840
it's actually copyrighted short from the german word "kopieriten"

267
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,120
if i i i would actually

268
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,080
i'd be pretty happy if if if he copyrighted all that bullshit he did no

269
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,000
one else could ever do it again yeah that's actually might be the most brave

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,800
thing that he could do yeah it's not really brave it's just that he wanted all

271
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,480
the credit for it. If he could copyright the Holocaust so that nobody could ever

272
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,120
do it again. Yeah exactly. I'll take that. He was originally Copy Reich. Yeah that was

273
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,840
his idea. Yeah and there's one guy who's trying to Copy Reich.

274
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,680
Donald Trump. Well I don't know if it's him I think it's probably Brandon. That's what Saturday Night Live said.

275
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,000
If you ask me it's actually all the Democrats. Yeah Brandon and his lackeys.

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,360
Yep. Yeah. The EmoCrips and I don't know maybe the Rebloodlikens. No the Rebloodlikens

277
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,040
are actually cool. No yeah they're cool-likens. Yeah. I'm gonna go ahead and say...

278
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,960
Republic Kings. It is a freeing feeling that Spotify has already given us the

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,240
COVID-19 misinfo thing. Yeah. Now we can just say whatever we want.

281
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,760

282
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,840

346
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,180
continental breakfast is a buffet. We're not thinking about a buffet.

347
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,180
Patrick alert at the buffet warning.

348
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm going to drink all the orange juice.

349
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,680
It's just like it's just like a hundred people running down the aisle like

350
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,180
like a Godzilla movie.

351
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,780
Yeah, it's all Japanese businessmen fleeing the buffet.

352
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,580
Just not giant just normal size, but walking real slow like a giant into

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,780
the buffet and then getting all the orange juice and all the milk.

354
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,580
It's continental breakfast you're describing.

355
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
It's not a buffet.

356
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,780
And you're sitting there slowly, slow motion,

357
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,620
turning a waffle at the buffet.

358
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,220
No, you go to a buffet and you only get orange juice and milk.

359
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,580
And the waffle buffet--

360
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,500
(imitates trumpet)

361
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,340
The waffle maker.

362
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,180
He wants the milk!

363
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,580
He's getting 1%!

364
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,940
And now he's at the 2%!

365
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,820
You're still, you're just screaming like Godzilla.

366
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,020
You're just going, "Ehhh!"

367
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,220
This is a buffet warning.

368
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,480
he's moved on to the buffet waffle maker it is making it a little awful and that

369
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,460
that's it's pissing me off you just do it is getting a single-serve

370
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,860
uh... individually package now here you're going back now he's going back to

371
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,820
his room

372
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,900
he's going back to his buffet room

373
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,700
war room warning is patrick is going back to the buffet really slowly walking like

374
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,020
godzilla or king kong

375
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,020
now he's watching shark tank like godzilla i lived in a i lived in a hotel

376
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,300
for like a couple months yet they give those warnings everyday

377
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,420
Yeah. Did I ever tell you about that? I accidentally... so you'd get like the

378
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,300
continental breakfast tray, you could bring it back to your room

379
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,620
and someone put that in the oven and didn't tell me.

380
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,820
Someone put that in the oven and didn't tell me. So I looked in and I was like, oh

381
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,300
that's just like a cookie sheet that we had.

382
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:45,300
And I turned the oven on. You melted one? I melted a continental breakfast tray.

383
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,500
I melted a continental breakfast tray and like

384
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,420
the plastic was melting down onto like the oven itself.

385
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Why didn't, wait, why didn't you take it out?

386
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I thought it was a cookie.

387
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Either way, why not just take it out?

388
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
Yeah, but why not take it out?

389
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
It's just funnier to just let it in there.

390
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
No, if you leave the tray in there, then you can put your

391
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
Elio's pizza on top of the tray.

392
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
Oh, okay. And then it's already hot.

393
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Alright. And it makes the crust...

394
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
You know you're supposed to heat up a pizza stone?

395
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
Yeah. If you do that

396
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
with an Elio's pizza...

397
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,420
He doesn't know about a pizza stone.

398
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,420
If you had to guess what a pizza stone was,

399
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,140
you fucking honky bitch what would you say?

400
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,980
- A magical stone.

401
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,540
- Yep, you nailed it first try.

402
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,180
Great, you're a genius, awesome, cool.

403
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,820
I look like a dickhead.

404
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,220
- So the plastic melted down onto the bottom of the oven

405
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,500
and then like was catching fire

406
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,980
and I didn't know what to do.

407
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,100
And I didn't want to, I didn't think it warranted me

408
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,340
getting the fire extinguisher,

409
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,740
so I went down to the front desk of the hotel.

410
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,500
- You told them there was a fire in your room?

411
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,820
- I had to wait in line to tell them

412
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,420
'cause I was so nervous.

413
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,500
I just didn't want to like, 'cause if I went,

414
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,820
there's a fire in my room like that would be way worse than me just being like the

415
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,340
oven something's going on with the oven you know like I couldn't just be like oh

416
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,740
fire fire I think there's a middle ground between those two things I don't

417
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:13,540
I was 17 dude I don't know so I'm pretty - man singing upstairs that's all I got to

418
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,740

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,220

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,260

422
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,860

You would have seen my butthole. Yeah. Yeah. He showed me, Joe and Alex.

438
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,840
You were the only one who wasn't on the phone. I realized I was fighting the

439
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,360

think I'd have a strong ass. No, it's all on my thighs. My ask gets nothing.

446
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,240
You're a hopper. Yeah, I am jumping constantly. I never really thought about

453
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,960
you're going your soul is being devoured mm-hmm my soul against a feather mm-hmm I

454
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,280
I think they weigh the same.

455
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
No.

456
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,720
Your soul doesn't weigh anything.

457
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Again Pat is doing...

458
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Your heart is...

459
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
There's a kid screaming this time.

460
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Your heart is filled with sin.

461
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Your YouTube reaction faces.

462
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Huh?

463
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
His heart is filled with sin.

464
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,520
Yeah, so it weighs more than a feather.

465
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,880
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

466
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,000
How much does sin weigh?

467
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
A lot.

468
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
A lot.

469
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
A lot?

470
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
A lot.

471
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

472
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,280
Are you getting ready to throw something at me?

473
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
No.

474
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Are you...

475
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
You promise me.

476
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,400
it's a fidget thing that I need to do. You need to do that? Yeah, so I can pay

477
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,920
attention. A skateboard is basically just like the opposite of

478
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,640
like the tablet with the Ten Commandments. It's like the evil tablet.

479
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,440
It's like if you put it upside down. Yeah, it's instead of the Ten Commandments it has

480
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,200
a dragon. Yeah, it's the RDS logo. The Red Dragon skateboard.

481
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,760
That actually sounds pretty cool. Yeah. Have they put the Ten Commandments on

482
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,160
the bottom of the skateboard? That would be pretty cool. I think, okay, so there's a skater

483
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:09,080
Brian Sumner he was like born-again Christian and he made this like God like

484
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,440
this like Christian skateboard company and like there's a shit ton of like

485
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,160
sick born-again Christians are so fast because it's like I don't want it like I

486
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,400
don't want to stop doing this one thing that I do like Christian metal Christian

487
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,280
rock and then you become a Christian and you have to like somehow put the things

488
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,640
that you like into Christianity yeah yeah it's so funny that the members of

489
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,880
of corn are gradually one by one becoming born again. I remember the first one did

490
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,320
yeah first one was yeah. I remember reading I because I was you know my

491
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,920
family super Christian and I was at my dentist's office who he was a he went to

492
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,780
my church yeah and they own the only like magazines I had were like Christian

493
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,400
ones and one of them was an interview with corn yeah I was like oh this would

494
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,760
be cool. He'll probably talk about fucking drugs. Yeah, I'm open it up and

495
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,640
he was just like Jesus is it love is yeah. He left corn and he made a solo

496
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,740
album a Christian new metal album that's yeah he was on Huckabee uh-huh and then

497
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,420
he played bass with Huckabee dude it's so sick Huckabee that video yeah that

498
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,740
video is tight dude Mike Huckabee what does he says like well the music may not

499
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,860
sound that great but this man loves God it's so funny to still go by head and

500
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,460
become Christian yeah yeah I'm head you know his real name Brian Welch Brian

501
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,660
head welch brian head welch was he a was he a good part of the band or yeah he's

502
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,740
basically the the band like after he left they they don't sound like corn anymore

503
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,540
but then he came back we are not saying about getting molested he very clearly

504
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,820
no I don't think he I mean is there room where he could maybe work on him I

505
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,420
definitely I think they will turn event - I mean two out of five maybe I don't

506
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,600
that's like enough that is like they will all eventually. I feel like if one of them

507
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,300
does it and then another one does it years later. How many corn songs are about

508
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,420
Jonathan Davis getting molested as a kid or whatever? Most of them. Most of them?

509
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,180
Almost all of them. That'd be so funny for him to go to like the one establishment.

510
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,760
He's gonna become Protestant, he's not gonna become a Catholic.

511
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,500
Maybe. You don't become, there's no born-again Catholics. I'm born-again Catholic.

512
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,260
Catholic. That's not true. Well except for the the one small slice of people in this

513
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,400
city, the worst city in the entire world. Yeah. With the worst kind of people. Those

514
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,700
are, you really have to be a true piece of shit to become a born-again Catholic.

515
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,780
Born-again Christians are just people who fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. People who fucked up

516
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,380
and just need, they just need something. They just need, honestly they just need

517
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,540
new movies. Another really good Christian. They just need access to new movies. The born-again

518
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,720
Catholics do it because it's like oh I'm a piece of shit I need to pay for my

519
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,720
being a piece of shit by getting whipped and stuff. They do it so they can take

520
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,840
pictures. That's true. Yeah. Take pictures with the rosary. Yeah.

521
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,480
There's another really good Christian new metal band. That's like

522
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,100
probably I think the funniest combination. Like the funniest music to

523
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,320
be Christian is like new metal. Yeah. Where it's like hip-hop and metal combined.

524
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,960
Demon Hunter. That's another really good one. P.O.D. is fucking sick.

525
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,280
Didn't P.O.D. have a song in Grind? I don't know. I'm thinking it's a click click boom.

526
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:20,000
click-click boom is sick yeah is that pod or is that no that's saliva yes that's

527
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,320

wish mine looked like that but it does not pop out like this well that's the

542
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,660
curse yeah that's the curse that's what you have a perfect penis but it pops out

543
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,100
at the worst times like when you're ordering at Subway or when you're

544
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:07,380
studying at Hogwarts. And also every pair of pants you have comes with a perfect

545
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,940
ripped seam. Yeah. That's just fails at the worst time. No I wouldn't do that. I would

546
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,700
do it dude. Because also like if you have a big ass fucking perfect. Yeah it'd be more

547
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,380
embarrassing if my thing was little. Yeah. Okay if we're not living in like a

548
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,140
fantasy world you're gonna go to jail. No you're you have to explain. You don't go to jail

549
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,420
for an accident. They're not gonna send you to fucking. You're gonna be killed.

550
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
You know who didn't go to jail for an accident?

551
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,420
We're not going to send you to Azkaban just because your pants flew off at the park.

552
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
You know who didn't go to jail for an accident?

553
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Is a middle school or an elementary school.

554
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
Yeah dude, you're there too. You're in elementary school.

555
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
She's an adult. He's an adult.

556
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
You know who didn't go to jail for an accident? Casey Anthony.

557
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
True. She's still walking around.

558
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,420
And she had one of the worst accidents.

559
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,420
You would have a hundred accidents a day.

560
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Are you calling her child an accident?

561
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Yes. She didn't want, she wanted to stay partying.

562
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
You're right.

563
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Honestly, I think she was dragging her down.

564
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:04,140
did I call her crazy Anthony? Wow. I call her crazy momthany. Yeah crazy momthany. I call her Carmelo.

565
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,580
I hear like you I say like oh you remember that that stuff in the news with crazy?

566
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:15,820
I call her Carmelo Anthony. Because she's because she uh loves twos but she hates threes.

567
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:23,820
She never sees threes but she sees twos and never threes. Sees threes. She sees ones and twos but

568
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,220
but she can't be out there with the threes.

569
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,060
- Yep.

570
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,420
- 'Cause her kid dies before she turns three.

571
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,260
- Yeah.

572
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Remember the Nancy Grace,

573
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,660
did you guys watch that with your mom or was it just me?

574
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,420
- No, my mom, I think that--

575
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,500
- My mom loved Nancy Grace.

576
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,980
- My mom didn't know who Casey Anthony was.

577
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,820
- What?

578
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,580
- I like was talking, I brought up Casey Anthony

579
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,420
to my mom the other day. - That's crazy.

580
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,740
- And she was like, "Who's that?"

581
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,340
I was like, "What are you talking about?"

582
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,180
- That's insane.

583
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,000
- Isn't that crazy?

584
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,780
- My mom was obsessed with that case.

585
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
- I know, I feel like--

586
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,900
Like everyone's mom at least had an opinion.

587
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,740
That's crazy.

588
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,680
- Yeah, she literally had no idea who it was.

589
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,960
She had to look it up.

590
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,460
- Like everyone's mom at least said like,

591
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,540
well, I don't know.

592
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,720
- We were a little busy.

593
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,920
My mom was a little busy fighting Obama.

594
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,760
- Oh, yeah.

595
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,440
- Yeah, doing spiritual warfare against Barack Obama.

596
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,060
- Yeah, my mom was like,

597
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,820
'cause I would come home and I would hear like,

598
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,860
innocent taught Kaylee Slane in the pool

599
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,540
at the back of her house.

600
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,380
- What year was that?

601
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,200
What year did that happen?

602
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,200
2007, 2009. Something like that.

603
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Yeah, my mom was a little busy thinking about all of the kids and not just one kid

604
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,200
being put in FEMA camps because of the H1N1 virus.

605
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Yeah, kids being torn apart and used for drumsticks.

606
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:44,200
My mom did think for a while that, she was like, "God gave me a vision. Obama's going to use swine flu to put Christians in FEMA camps."

607
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
And I was like, "Okay, sounds fun."

608
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,320
go to camp? Camp? That's badass dude, let's go. We get to go to camp for free? Is there

609
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,200
jet skis? I didn't get to go to camp as a kid, did you guys go to like any kind of

610
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,520
summer camp? I went to a church camp for three days, it was supposed to be a week

611
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,560
long, I went for three days because I was vegan and I could, they, they did not have

612
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,240
any food that was not like pizza. Yeah, you were vegan in the south. Yeah, so I ate for

613
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,240
three days, all I ate was pickles and Sun Chips. It was the only thing in the entire

614
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,240
camp I could eat. And then I started like vomiting like black bile and I left the camp.

615
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,240
I went to camp for a few years and I hated it so much I made my parents stop sending

616
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,920
me. My parents couldn't afford it. I used to run around in the summer. Yeah, running

617
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,880
around in the summer is good. Summer run around is very fun. I would not wear, when I was

618
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,700
from the age of like 6 to like 9, I would not wear shoes outside. I would just run outside

619
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:42,040
like hobbit feet. I got sent to this summer camp, it was like a tennis camp, but it was

620
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,440
like the high school. So we play tennis outside for like an hour or two or

621
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,120
whatever. And then we go inside to like inside the high school cafeteria to eat

622
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,720
lunch. And they'd like put a movie on like a tiny TV. And then it would just

623
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,200
be like, we just sit in the cafeteria for the rest of the day. You could draw

624
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,640
or you could watch the movie or you could eat your lunch and that's it.

625
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,760
Yeah, I fucking like my my younger brother used to not like we just

626
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,780
wouldn't wear shoes, me and Eric, and like, it would,

627
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,880
it got, he did wear shoes one time, he had this pair of DCs,

628
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,400
and there's that video of him breaking his arm.

629
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,440
They had to take his shoes off for some reason

630
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
in the room when he was like, you know,

631
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,960
they were checking out his arm.

632
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
- Pervy nurse, to smell his feet.

633
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
- Pervy nurse, yep.

634
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,720
- Yeah.

635
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,560
- We gotta take your shoes off.

636
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,880
- Dude, they threw his shoes out.

637
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,840
- They threw them out?

638
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,640
- They threw them out, I think they took them off

639
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,480
or something. - Like a gunshot victim?

640
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,200
- They took them off, or they like,

641
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,400
- They took him off. - Cut him off his body.

642
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,080
- Yeah, they took him off and like smelled him.

643
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,840
They went like, I could smell them.

644
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,160
And they're just like, Jesus Christ.

645
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,680
And just threw them out and he had to go home

646
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,320
in like little like slippers.

647
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,160
- Damn. - Whoa.

648
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,440
- They were DC Mantecas too. - That's disrespectful.

649
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,680
- They were my DC Mantecas that he was wearing.

650
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,560
And they had like, they were DC Mantecas

651
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,120
with like the panels and shit.

652
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,640
Had like little graffiti writing on them.

653
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,480
- And how old were you?

654
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,400
- I was nine.

655
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,480
- So you've always been like this?

656
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,320
- What?

657
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:12,600
shoes and shit. You remember the shoes you had when you were nine years old?

658
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,800
It's so funny. Dude, I don't remember.

659
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,880
Dude, my best pair of shoes I had. I don't remember a pair of shoes that were

660
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,200
on my feet until maybe three years ago. I had Vans Bucky Lasix. I think they were

661
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,440
Vans Bucky Lasix 5. Are you hearing this? This is crazy. As a nine year old, you were

662
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,640
aware of the shoes that you had. Black leather Bucky Lasix with like a gray

663
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:38,580
accent and after that right gray swoop the swoosh the van stripe and then after

664
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:44,940
that I got audio they weren't the BAMS which I was kind of bummed out about I

665
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:52,860
think their audio Kenny reads fucking nine I think they're Kenny reads yeah

666
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:59,040
yeah yeah they're black audios wait you just said was that from the ages of 5 to

667
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,400
nine you did not wear shoes and then you immediately went into to skating so I

668
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,880
do like no like like like I also have my friend Anson gave me a pair of the

669
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:17,560
at knees low cuts and then another Cali cuts you should wear shoes in the summer

670
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,920
but like once I started skating I paid attention to shoes and shit you should

671
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,200
have been out there fucking catching frogs in your mouth and shit I was with

672
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,520
wearing specific shoes. No, no. Then I started skating and then I stopped

673
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,920
running around. These are not compatible. One of these is a lie. Yeah, the devil did grab. You made a deal with the

674
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,480
devil. He said, "Do you want to be... do you want to have knowledge of all shoes?"

675
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,480
And the trade-off is knowledge of nothing but all shoes. Maybe. And he said

676
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,400
yeah. And he signed it with your tail that you had. Dude, I had like little

677
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,440
hobbit feet. It was so gross. You still have hobbit feet. Yeah, I do. I can pick things up

678
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,440
with them. Everyone can do that. Everyone learned how to turn on the TV with their remote.

679
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,440
I can write my name with my foot. Yeah, so can I. I can

680
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,440
actually jump. With your feet? I can actually jump off the ground.

681
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,440
What? That is sick. I can do a somersault.

682
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,440
I can do two somersaults in a row. You can't do a somersault.

683
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Whoa, you got really close to your desk.

684
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,440
That's not a somersault. In what world is that a somersault?

685
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,920
That was a somersault.

686
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,160
Are you guys stupid?

687
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,000
That was a somersault.

688
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,820
What would you call a somersault?

689
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,660
That was a roll.

690
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,500
You rolled.

691
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,520
What's the difference between a roll and a somersault?

692
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,560
You have to jump onto your hands

693
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,880
and then dismount onto your feet for it to be a somersault.

694
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,920
That's a cartwheel.

695
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,240
No, a cartwheel is sideways.

696
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,340
A somersault is a forward cartwheel.

697
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,180
No.

698
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,720
You can't just roll on the ground and call it a somersault.

699
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,640
That's definitely what a somersault is.

700
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,960
You guys are stupid.

701
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
No.

702
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,620
You guys are not.

703
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,600
Well, you know a lot about gymnastics?

704
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,880
Yeah.

705
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,040
I used to go to tons of gymnastics birthday parties.

706
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,280
- Cheerleader. - I'm not a cheerleader.

707
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,880
- Cheerleader. - I'm like the big parachute

708
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,720
that they'd put you under.

709
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,560
- Oh, you know what else? - Cheerleader.

710
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,120
- 'Cause sometimes I would imagine me and the gym teacher

711
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,080
getting stuck in there.

712
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,480
- The Bucky Lazics, I had checkered laces.

713
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,320
- What?

714
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,540
Oh, that's cool.

715
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,460
That's really cool. - They had to distract you

716
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,840
from being mean.

717
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,680
- I was being mean?

718
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,000
- I threw a wrench at you.

719
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
- The definition of somersault verb,

720
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,940
to perform a somersault or make a similar movement

721
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,780
accidentally.

722
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,720
(laughing)

723
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,400
- I'll call it an accidental somersault.

724
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,320
If it wasn't a somersault, I didn't make a similar movement.

725
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,480
It was a similar movement.

726
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,000
Is that not what he did?

727
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,160
This is exactly what you did.

728
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
You did not do that.

729
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
You're literally stupid.

730
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
He didn't use his hands.

731
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
He just rolled on his head.

732
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
I used my hands.

733
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,840
I put my hands down before my head.

734
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
You just don't know what you're talking about.

735
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,800
You're not a gymnast like me.

736
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,420
I used to do tons of gymnastic stuff.

737
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,920
You're talking to me and the king of parkour.

738
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,360
I had a monkey ability.

739
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,800
I was into parkour way before you guys.

740
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,600
does not true still I was using to parkour no cameras really in the water

741
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,880

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,560
views and then denim is just yeah I've seen I mean a lot of them I can't put out

745
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,240
because it would just like skew the scene and a lot of people be mad at me

746
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,600
like there's a bunch of records I can't really break because I feel bad for like

747
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,700
the people to him climbing that I came up with you know he's so cool to watch

748

752
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,520
his parkour videos I have seen no piece I've seen the parkour but not any of the

753
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,240
pizza stuff. I haven't seen it. I haven't seen the pizza material you're

754
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,160
by now. You're doing a choking video for me right now in real life choked on

755
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,600
water.

756
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,160
It's thinking about delicious pizza.

757
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,240
He tried to bite it.

758
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,960
Dude, if you drink water and think about pizza while you're drinking it, it

759
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,840
will taste like yeah. That's a like water with your left hand. You feel like

760
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,880
a fish. Yeah,

761
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,040
that's true. I heard that yeah. I heard that sit on your throat before you

762
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,760
drink water.

763
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
It feels like someone else is drinking the water.

764
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,880
If you sit on your entire body for a while and then do anything, you feel like a ghost.

765
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Yeah.

766
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
Mm-hmm.

767
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Yeah.

768
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
That's why they call it the ghost.

769
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,920
If you sit on your phone for a little bit and then smell it, it smells like your butt.

770
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,320
I forgot that I put my mask in my back pocket.

771
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,880
Dude, that happened to me so many times.

772
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,440
I would put my mask in my back pocket and then have to put it on to go on the bus or

773
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
something and just--

774
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
And then smell your butt?

775
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
It's just toxic.

776
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Yeah.

777
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Really?

778
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Yeah.

779
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
I would never put that in my back pocket.

780
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,320
thinking. Do you ever just smell the fart zone of your pants before you put them on to see

781
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,960
if they smell like the farts that you've been throwing in all day? Yeah. I love that. I

782
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,640
do that. I mean, you know. I love that so much, man. It gets me high. You don't love

783
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,320
that. It doesn't get you high. I love to smell my own farts. I love, the first sniff, you

784
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,000
weirdo. The first sniff of your own fart is great, but I do not want to sit in a room

785
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,840
that's filled with farts. I sit in my room. I hate the smell of my own farts. Dude, you

786
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,280
need to go get that checked out because you're supposed to be the smell of all

787
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,520
farts I sit in my room and I fart all day and I keep the door closed so they stay

788
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,920
in there so I'm just like even if the most beautiful woman farted near me I

789
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,920
would say what I hate other people's farts but my farts are like seriously

790
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,960
like dessert to me if a beautiful woman farted near me I'd say P you it's like

791
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,880
when you rub your hands all over your balls and then put them in your mouth

792
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,960
mouth yeah your balls not your hand oh it's tastes like hand my nasty ass hands

794
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,920
why do balls smell so bad I use I touch so much because it's just my hands it's

795
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,240
the sweat building up in the taint area plus the the butt juices are rolling

796
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,720
down to the taint area the butt juice is coming off the butt but my balls are

797
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,680
like the butt juice. It's like the center. It's like the central hub of a sewer area

798
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,600
where you fight like a slime monster. Yeah, so all my poop is your thigh. It's

799
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,320

800
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,040
your pant leg. True. And into your balls. All smells travel. Every smell in your

801
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,400
body travels to your balls. It's like Delta Airlines in Atlanta. Yeah. Okay.

802
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400
All right, now I get it. It's like a hub.

803
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,960
Yeah. All smells on your body can be linked back to your balls or vagina.

804
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,600
Vaginas don't smell that bad.

805
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,680
Vaginas smell horrible.

806
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,440
No, they taste and look and feel horrible. They smell okay.

807
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,880
They smell and the feeling and the look.

808
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,400
They're putrid. Vaginas are useless.

809
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,440
Yeah, they're pretty much...

810
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,800
Why does anybody ever want to...

811
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,680
Pretty much non-functional.

812
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,360
...do anything with a disgusting vagina?

813
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,760
Especially, you know how sometimes girls you can see their vagina from their from the back?

814
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,960
It's like that's I think it's a but it looks like a butthole. Yep. That's disgusting if I saw a vagina from the back

815
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,320
It's disgusting

816
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,640
It's next to your butt

817
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,800
It's like you have oh my god horrible. It's like I have two but I mean I got I have half a mind to pull out

818
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,160
A measuring tape and show you just how close it is and maybe you'll understand

819
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,920
I'm gonna pull out a square foot of sheetrock and close that puppy up.

820
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
I'm going down there with spackle.

821
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Yeah, I'm gonna close it like John Taffer.

822
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,920
I'm condemning this disgusting...

823
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,920
This is how people get sick!

824
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,920
(laughter)

825
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
Shut it down! Shut it all down!

826
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,920
(laughter)

827
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Look at this! You can see it from the back!

828
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,920
It looks like a second butt!

829
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,920
Look at this! There's old food in here!

830
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,920

831
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Dude, I fucking love John Taffer.

832
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,020
I love John Taffer.

833
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,400
I'm putting, um...

834
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,860
I've been getting back into Bar Rescue.

835
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,440
I just have been watching all the videos.

836
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,280
Yeah, dude.

837
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,700
There was one where there was a bar,

838
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,040
I told you there was an episode called

839
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,560
12 Beers a Slave.

840
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,540
Dude, so good.

841
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,740
Such a good name.

842
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,800
But then I was watching another one

843
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,800
that was about a bar where all the bartenders

844
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,280
were just like, had their titties and asses out,

845
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,460
and one of the bartenders was named Cheeks.

846
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,300
Mm-hmm, okay.

847
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,360
And she was getting her...

848
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,760
Dude, they ran a marathon on Paramount.

849
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,900
shots out of her butthole. Whoa. And I was like and there and he was like we have to

850
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,280
fix this bar. I was like that's the best bar ever. Dude some of the bars you go into. They seem awesome.

851
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,080
Yeah some of them on the show it's like like yeah like the food and shit is

852
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,300
nasty but like they'll have like some drink special that's like. And also a good

853
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:43,700
bartender is drunk as hell and gives you free stuff. Yeah. A good bartender is the

854
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,180
drunkest person in the entire bar. I don't want to go to a bar and have

855
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,980
somebody who's like worried about making their boss money. Yeah. Somebody if I go

856
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,340
to a bar and the person is like like oh yeah I know how to make like I know how

857
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:01,120
to make a vodka Lewis what the fuck is a vodka Lewis I just made that up. He always goes in there he

858
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,860
always sends Maria Menouonos in there and she gets like an like a Manhattan or an

859
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,380
old-fashioned yeah it's like these are all places that all they have is well

860
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:14,820
you get a gin and tonic. Why are you there? You don't get a Manhattan there. No.

861
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:20,020
They have Campari there to weed out people. Not to bring it back but that's like going to a baby food store and

862
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,920
ordering a lobster. Exactly, it makes no sense. Well that actually makes more sense

863
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,640
than going to a Taco Bell and ordering baby food because of the bib situation.

864
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,780
They have a kids menu. That's true. That actually makes pretty... yeah. You would go to a

865
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,280
baby food store, see the bib section. Yeah. Oh yeah. It must be a lobster store.

866
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,260
Yeah, but you'd still be wrong though. Yeah. You, they could... it's just an

867
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,480
understandable mistake. You could put lobster biscuit in a baby food jar. You

868
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,980
could put anything in a baby food jar. You could feed a baby a whole lobster. You

869
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,380
could feed a baby and he has been keeping up with Leon the lobster Leon the

870
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,300
lobster of the pet yeah no have you who's that just molted he molted oh

914
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,840
What is it? I got bit by a snakes thing. I just found out that frogs don't have cocks

915
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,880
Yeah, what does a snake have a dick? No, no, they have they have like a I

916
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,200
Think they have a thing where it like it like pops out like they have like a yeah

917
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,520
They all have like this

918
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,320
It looks the same from the outside

919
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:50,280
But then like the male snakes can like open it up and shoot their wiener out or something

920
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,160
See frogs basically just have an area that drops come they have a cloaca. Yeah

921
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,560
I felt I held a frog once and it peed on me or toad actually it came I want to oh

922
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,760
Yeah, I was trying to fertilize your hand. Yeah, maybe your hand looks very frog like yeah

923
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,080
Oh were you holding frog eggs while you were holding him?

924
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:12,040
He always had that might be he was holding them and I mean around like nuts and popping them into his mouth

925
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:17,040
It tastes you the caviar I I do think like that's the ideal sexual organ

926
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,760
Right is just what like being able to just like all that drops

927
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,060
- You know, just dump, like, any time,

928
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,000
like, you never have to jack off or have sex,

929
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,800
you just dump out cum whenever you want.

930
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,880
- Turtles, sea turtles can breathe through their cloaca.

931
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,720
- What?

932
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,600
- Yeah, you can through practice.

933
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,680
You don't have a cloaca.

934
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,960
No, no, you can breathe through your butt through practice.

935
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,800
- Really?

936
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,640
Try it out for me.

937
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,480
- Cagle exercises.

938
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,720
- Getting one, having one hold of poop, pee,

939
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,160
lay eggs, cum, and breathe.

940
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,680
- Why do I even need eyes, then?

941
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,600
It's like, just fucking, just make me,

942
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,920
I mean, we've done this. - Just make my whole body

943
00:52:48,920 --> 00:53:08,920
the

944
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,480
they just have a lot of what I okay here if I think whoever so okay Elon Musk or

945
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,920
whatever yeah needs to build basically a giant like underground city that is

946
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,680
everything in in that city is designed like it will kill you if you're not

947
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,840
cube-shaped it will kill you if you poop and pee like you know it has to be like

948
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,400
like it has to be artificial evolution we have to whittle down the population so

949
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,320
only the people who are most like cloaca cubes survive yeah people have kids

950
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,400
generations after generations then well eventually have a cloaca like we just

951
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,160
need you know what I mean we need somebody we need to do we need to do

952
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,600
unnatural selection to design a cube that poops and pees and comes and breathes

953
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,200
and looks out of one no little arms no legs no eyes no mouth no you just

954
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,400
thoughts and and not even thoughts no need just just liquids and fluids and

955
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,560
semi fluids basically a piece of plastic a plastic cube filled with blood and a

956
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:05,240
hole on the top yeah it's kind of ideal yeah and well in glasses too if you need

957
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,240
them. Yeah, if you wear glasses, yeah.

958
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,240
Glasses to show he's a nerd.

959
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,240
And a jacket and a letterman jacket.

960
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,240
A monocle over the

961
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
cloaca part.

962
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,240
But yeah, like a perfect,

963
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
can somebody draw this up? A perfect

964
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,240
fleshy cube with just like a

965
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,240
receding

966
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,240
volcanic hole. And it has, it's like

967
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,240
skin, like it's not like a

968
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,240
gelatinous cube, like it's not like

969
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,240
from like D&D, it's not like slime.

970
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
It's flesh. It is skin.

971
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:40,500
Yeah, yeah, it's made out of skin. It's a cube, but it has right angles and points and like yeah parts of that

972
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,680
But as one clutters a single hole on the front yeah, and it looks weird

973
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,880
It looks weird. Yeah, but it would look it would look normal in the future

974
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:56,100
And I also if we're halfway through like some people are cloaca cubes and some people are still people

975
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,800
Yeah, what's it like a cube a flannel?

976
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,360
- Yeah, we'll get to like a cube with arms and legs.

977
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,640
- A flesh cube with flesh arms

978
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,760
and the front of the cube is a face.

979
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,600
- Yeah.

980
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,420
- But on the back of the cube,

981
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,260
that'll be like a missing link.

982
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,080
- That'll be like a missing link.

983
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,160
- That's like Bigfoot to them.

984
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,160
- And then when you can practice tattooing on the cubes.

985
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,000
- Yeah.

986
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,160
- 'Cause they won't, what are they gonna say?

987
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,000
- You can put a--

988
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,840
- You can do it any way you want.

989
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,440
- You could put more dots on other sides

990
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,280
and use them as a human dice.

991
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,780
- You could put a lyrist to holy diver

992
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,000
on the top of the cube.

993
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,760
- Yeah, just in case you forget them.

994
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
- Yeah.

995
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,040
you could pack your lunch in their brain. Yeah. Oh my God, you could put stuff in

996
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,640
them. Yeah. Oh my God, it can be like a Pez. Yeah, you could just put all your

997
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,560
stuff in. We need to trick everybody else to become in cloaca cube so that we

998
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,560
just have boxes we can use when we need to move. Uh-huh. Yeah. Or if we wanna do

999
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,120
holy diver karaoke with no backing track. Exactly. Yeah. And with no lyric

1000
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,160
sheet. Yeah. 'Cause normally I'm like, holy something. You've been out too long.

1001
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,280
me. Oh, what's not right,

1002
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,620
but then if you had a right, the right, you get something you something

1003
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,480

1007
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,400

1008
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,080
love is it's like it's so courageous to write just like the best song ever and

1009
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:35,040
then give it one minute interrupts just silence yeah just just nothing so cool

1010
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:40,080
oh yeah just make it annoying. Did Dio just make one good song? No no no no. What else did he do?

1011
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,720
Like a rainbow in the dark. Invisible from that album is really good.

1012
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,220
- Dude, Dio's Sabbath is good.

1013
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,400
- Yeah.

1014
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,220
- Dude, are you kidding me?

1015
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,920
- Oh, I forgot he replaced--

1016
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,100
- Yeah, you replaced Ozzy.

1017
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,440
- Ozzy, yeah.

1018
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,760
Yeah, Dio's good.

1019
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,600
- Yeah, Dio is so sick.

1020
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,040
- That album cover, sick too.

1021
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,880
- Yeah, I wanna get--

1022
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,960
- Is Ozzy a giant demon with chains?

1023
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,240
- I wanna get that. - Is Ozzy alive?

1024
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,920
- I wanna get that in my house.

1025
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,760
- Definitely.

1026
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,520
- Not like a poster, not like a painting.

1027
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,480
Like, I want that demon in my house.

1028
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,360
- Why did we lose Ozzy Osbourne as a cultural touchstone?

1029
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,360
- He's probably, I mean, you--

1030
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,360
Coronavirus, dude. People don't like eating bats anymore.

1031
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,360

00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,360
*unintelligable*

1034
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,360
And then, oh, his daughter did become the view, though.

1035
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Although, did she get kicked off?

1036
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,360
She said the thing... oh, that was so funny.

1037
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,360
It was a sad news thing. Someone's dating his daughter now.

1038
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,360
Right. Then who is gonna clean my trousers?

1039
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,360
Oh, yeah. She said, "Oh, you wanna get rid of Mexican people?"

1040
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,160
Who's gonna clean up all the bathrooms? Yeah, he's gonna clean up my disgusting farts and shit

1041
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,560
He's gonna clean up my poop and fart people if you get rid of all the Mexicans

1042
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,120
Who's gonna?

1045
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,480
There's a really good episode of the Osbournes where Jason Dill shows up

1046
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,680
And he's like just just so zonked out of his mind

1047
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:23,340
You just can't like like it's him like interacting with Ozzy, and he's like leaving stuff everywhere and Sharon's like

1048
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:31,060
He's just like I don't I don't fucking I don't I don't know man

1049
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,560
It's an awesome, awesome show.

1050
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,560
Yeah.

1051
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,560
It's like what if we got a guy who has Alzheimer's.

1052
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Yeah.

1053
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:46,800
A guy who did like coke from like a fucking, like a guy who like drank cocaine.

1054
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,560
A guy who's actively just dying in front of you.

1055
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,560
What if we put him and his family and get this in their house?

1056
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,320
In their house, their mansion where they have a tiny dog.

1057
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
It's not like fish.

1058
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,320
Dogs that shit everywhere.

1059
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,320
There's no fish out of water aspect.

1060
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,840
It's them just at the house.

1061
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,960
chilling at the crib

1062
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,560
yeah pomeranians that shit all over the floor yeah like

1063
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,320
"I WANTED A POOPING ON THE FLOOR AGAIN"

1064
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,840
I wonder if they if the the people the producers were just like

1065
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,200
cuz they definitely weren't at the house like oh this will be great they just

1066

00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,600
You know how like later Ozzy, like,

Yeah.

1078
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,040
The Melodyne... because he sings in one... he sings one note.

Yeah.

1080
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,680
