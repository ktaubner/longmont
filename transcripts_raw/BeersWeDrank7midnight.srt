1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
(sipping)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,320
(sipping)

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,880
(burping)

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,280
- You're listening to Beers We Drink,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
America's number one beer podcast.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,360
(record scratching)

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,940
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,280
- What's up all my chuggers?

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,520
Trying to get that burp out.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,960
(burping)

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
- This is a journey into sea.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,640
- Into the middle of.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,460
- Plain and clean.

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,300
- Bud Light.

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,900
- Ooh, rip it!

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,820
- Beers we drank, motherfucker,

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,340
with Juvio, Caleb, and Rex.

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,300
- Hold on.

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,340
- Are we cracking?

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,840
- Oh, okay.

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,880
I gotta introduce my beer.

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,140
So I'll wait until this bullshit is done.

23
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,500
- Well, if you're so slap happy to introduce your beer,

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,940
then I think you can go first this time.

25
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,660
- Okay, so I don't wanna get,

26
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,540
I don't wanna get accused of same-beering

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,520
the podcast. Yeah, but it is it is a Modelo Negra, but it's a

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,940
different type of container that it comes in. If you could see

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,740
it's a bottle.

30
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,300
And can you say what the name of this podcast is?

31
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,020
Brews we drink?

32
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,700
Yep, that's right. That's right. So this is a beer that you

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,860
drank already.

34
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,740
Nobody it's different in a way.

35
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,020
The one I had last week, I think was in a can and this one has

36
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,020
foil on top of it, like a Ferrero Rocher almost.

37
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,580
- I really hate that foil on there.

38
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,460
'Cause I feel like they're probably charging me extra for it.

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,760
'Cause of its gold, 'cause of its color is golden.

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,860
- I'm assuming this is like an extra $20 in New York City.

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,020
- It's pretty expensive.

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,860
No, it's not expensive at all.

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,700
It's like the cheapest beer there is.

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,760
How is it? Is it better or worse out of the bottle versus the can?

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,900
I'm opening it still.

46
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,440
OK, well, then we'll just completely move on then.

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,280
Yeah. Yeah. So can I can I do my because I really want to try it.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
This is a fucking mess. So I have two beers today.

49
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,280
OK. Oh.

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm very excited about them.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,940
Mm hmm. This is.

52
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,480
Computer Karen, yo, a SpongeBob

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
based beer paired with a

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,360
SpongeBob based flying slush man.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
He is. Oh my God.

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,440
By four or both by four or five north in their new SpongeBob line of beers.

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,860
Wow. So you're excited.

58
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,560
Yes, I have Plankton's wife.

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,900
There was like computer like Krabby Patty.

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,640
There's there's like seven different SpongeBob beers.

61
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,540
Yeah, but I'm very excited for computer.

62
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,100
Why don't we think about a company making beers based off of a children's TV show?

63
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,060
I feel like that's some sort of breach of morality.

64
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,140
Every single person who watched that show as a child is of legal drinking age.

65
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,540
Yeah, but they're still running it. They're still making that show today.

66
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,140
And there's children today watching it today.

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,500
You do this. There might be little kids out there trying to buy that beer.

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,460
Yeah. There's kids watching this podcast.

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,020
Is it really good? Did you take a bite?

70
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
It's really good.

71
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
He took a bite.

72
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,900
Computer, Karen is raspberry, guava, grapefruit, and mango.

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Grapefruit? I've never heard of that.

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
But that sounds really delicious.

75
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Shut up!

76
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,700
I got delightful news. It tastes the same. It's the same beer.

77
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,060
You're kidding.

78
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,060
So you started with Karen. I'm very excited to hear about the Flying Slushman. That's

79
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,940
going to be coming up. Stick with us here at Beers We Drink. I'm going to introduce

80
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,940
my beer right now. Guys, I went classic this week with a Sapporo. Wait, but not just any

81
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,940
Sapporo, a Reserve Sapporo. Classic. Which I think I probably had this when I thought

82
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:03,780
I was having a normal Sapporo and I did not know. So I'm going to take a little sip. What

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,220
does it mean to be reserved? Oh my God, that's the best beer in the world. This is probably

84
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:17,120
for can, this is probably the best, if you can only have one, this is an amazing one

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
beer to have.

86
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Agreed.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,580
This is a perfect beer.

88
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,400
And I like that there's a great aspect to a Sapporo where the can is too heavy, it's

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,500
made with Japanese Damascus steel, which they make knives out of.

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,220
100 times folded beer can.

91
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,240
It's been folded 100 times in every can.

92
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,380
It's been brewed 100 times as well.

93
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,100
It has a hundred times brew.

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,320
It's very, very old, but for whatever reason, the can design, they put like an inch of just

95
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,380
pure metal at the bottom, so it always feels like there's an extra sip in here when you

96
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,940
finish the can, so it's like almost a prank beer.

97
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,940
That's awesome.

98
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
So I like it.

99
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,940
Definitely.

100
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,780
So I have a thing about Japanese beer, which is that I think sake bombs are like a healing

101
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
elixir.

102
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Do you?

103
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,380
sick, like you have like a stomach issue, you've got you've got a cold coming on,

104
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,140
you go get a bunch of Saki balls, knock that shit right out. I would agree that

105
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,820
it probably helps with your mental health, but I'm not sure about your

106
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,140
physical health. I have healed physical ailments with Saki balls. I think if anyone knows about

107
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:30,020
potions and and breweries, it's gonna be him and not any of us. Why is that? Because he

108
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,020
he eats funny pills to like heal his brain.

109
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,040
- I do.

110
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,680
- I do too. - He's a genius.

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,100
- Well, we do eat funny pills.

112
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
That's just part of being a man.

113
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,280
- Not at his rate.

114
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,380
- That's just part of being a man

115
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,820
who thinks that his brain is the number one

116
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,900
most important thing on earth.

117
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,740
- Right. - Yeah, but if we put it

118
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,740
in a graph, I think Rex's pill and,

119
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,380
you know, pill consumption is much bigger than yours.

120
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:05,300
reach there's at least 15 different pill type object like let's get an overview

121
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,340
helicopter cam go yeah the webcam not not not don't pull them in move the way

122
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:19,300
okay starting on one end of the rainbow please tell me that you're gonna go all

123
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,660
the way around well of course I got golden book tea pills I got central tea

124
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,160
pills. I got all the different, you know, I got fucking

125
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,960
healthy brain pills.

126
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,860
I got immune plus gummies.

127
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,500
I got all my, you know, I got logic.

128
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,100
I got. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

129
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,540
I remember these.

130
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,460
I remember this.

131
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,240
I got extra strength migraine relief for when you take too many pills

132
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,600
and your brain feels a little fatigued.

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,620
You got to hit that balance.

134
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Mm-hmm

135
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,860
I've got another thing of immune plus gummies, which I'm hitting on

136
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:08,140
What's this I love the would you just vase I just these are babes, okay, so you're basically

137
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,660
Blast fate that's awful

138
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,700
That's fair. You're doing very well mentally and physically is what I'm kind of gathering. I think that if I

139
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,220
Had one more week like the last four weeks had been I would be in the hospital

140
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:31,260
Yeah, well we have a grizzled you look very grizzled I'm glad you're free yes listen guys

141
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,740
so I've been thinking about this podcast a lot because

142
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,380
people have been

143
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,380
Over the moon I might say

144
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,980
about the quality the quantity

145
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,860
The

146
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
the sound mixing.

147
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,520
Yep.

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:58,720
And basically this is, we're rapidly becoming a top 100, top 50 podcast and people are begging us to put it on a

149
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,680
its own stream, its own feed. They want its own RSS feed. I want to list to it on iTunes.

150
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
Yeah.

151
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,760
No, motherfucker, it's actually a premium experience, right?

152
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,260
True.

153
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,340
That's kind of the whole point of the podcast, I might say. It's almost a speak easy

154
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,780
to be on brand.

155
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,200
But, I

156
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,800
Did notice that this becoming a little bit of one of these hanging out podcasts right and we don't want that

157
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,180
We don't need another hanging out podcast. No

158
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,260
Get the microphones away from white men

159
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,280
We hate crackers at beers we drink

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,140
So basically what I want to do is I kind of want to change the format to you guys know that show around the horn on

161
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,980
ESPN I love that show so around the horn is the greatest show ever made

162
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,100
My problem is I watch that shit and I go what the fuck are you talking about?

163
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,920
I don't know what the fuck like who the fuck any of these people are

164
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,060
I don't know what you're talking about

165
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,940
But I do like that you're in squares and that there's some different graphics and you're talking about individual stuff. But when they go

166
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,300
Greg

167
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,940
Masterson he

168
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,020
Destroyed his knee on the on the fucking field. I don't care who that is. I don't know what that is

169
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,220
I don't know what field they're talking about. Exactly. That's my problem. So I

170
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,300
So I am thinking that maybe we should go,

171
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,380
we should do topics one by one and just get,

172
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,180
at least for this episode, we try it out.

173
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
We should get everybody's view

174
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,100
on a different topic one by one.

175
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,660
I would love that.

176
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,580
There's nothing I would love more than to share my views.

177
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,060
It's funny that you say that because all week

178
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,380
I've been thinking about a specific topic

179
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,620
that I wanted to bring up and talk about.

180
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,540
Okay, well not before I get to my two topics

181
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,220
that I actually brought.

182
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,860
Okay, that's more topics than what I brought actually.

183
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,200
I brought two. So, no, number one is I had a new idea for a new show description that

184
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,840
we could put on iTunes if we, or not iTunes, but on the, like if, if there was a page somewhere

185
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,600
that said beers we drank, it would be, so you guys remember these old jokes? Yeah?

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Yeah, I remember jokes.

187
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,040
Okay, you guys remember old, or wait, so I did it in the wrong order.

188
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
I remember every joke.

189
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,120
Okay, so basically it would be a Jewish guy, a Mexican guy, and a normal guy walk into

190
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,400
a bar. In a ball? No, no, not a normal guy.

191
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:20,280
And that would be like, because this is, this is the, it captures perfectly the point of

192
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,040
the show, the conceit of the show, which is that the whole show is just about what if

193
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,720
these three were at a bar and, but they didn't like hanging out and they like doing, they

194
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,240
like pretending they were doing around the horn at the bar. Because you don't hang out

195
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,780
on the show. It's not a hangout show anymore.

196
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,280
Not a hangout show.

197
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,940
No, it's not.

198
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,160
It's just in a round the horn style.

199
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,020
What if three guys went to a bar?

200
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,020
They were all different races and levels of normalcy

201
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,200
and had different kind of hair.

202
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,460
And then they pretended they were on ESPN for an hour and four minutes.

203
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,260
We do run the gamut of hair.

204
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,760
Yeah, that's right.

205
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,960
Normal.

206
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Yep.

207
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,100
Interesting.

208
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
Interesting.

209
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Oh, OK. Double interesting.

210
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,740
I was trying to get a boring.

211
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I got an answer hint haircut kind of.

212
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,580
- No.

213
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,400
- You have a Hitler--

214
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,740
- That is quite literally the least interesting haircut

215
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,580
for 10 years running. - No, I didn't get

216
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,400
a Hitler haircut.

217
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,240
- You did.

218
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,900
- No, I got like a little mullet sort of.

219
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,220
- You got the fucking Edgar, but you're not cool enough to--

220
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,140
- That's not true.

221
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,580
I'm not an Edgar, don't say that about me.

222
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,420
That's actually racist.

223
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,240
- You're a fucking Edgar.

224
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
- What's his Edgar?

225
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,020
- First, racist incidents.

226
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,240
Don't worry about it.

227
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,580
Number one racist incident in "Breeze with Rank."

228
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,420
- I think you look good.

229
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,300
I think you look like you're in Peaky Blinders.

230
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,220
(laughing)

231
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,460
- No, that's not true.

232
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,260
Which that would be a much funnier show if it was in Mexico.

233
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,160
Peaky Blinders.

234
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
What's that show about?

235
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,660
I've actually, I know nothing about it.

236
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,260
It's Killian Murphy.

237
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,460
Some blokes in England drinking some fucking beer.

238
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,560
So it's basically the show's about this.

239
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,860
It's about a guy will say something like,

240
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,960
"I don't want to pay that."

241
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,660
Or like, "You better get out of here."

242
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,260
To the guy from 28 Days Later.

243
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,360
But then he comes up and he has a full Hitler haircut.

244
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,160
And he walks over and he says,

245
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,960
"Actually, bloody fuck you."

246
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,600
And then that alpha male song from TikTok starts playing

247
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
and there's like a bunch of different videos of him.

248
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,060
Yeah.

249
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,360
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

250
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,860
And he starts walking around in slow motion.

251
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,700
So that's so it's like the episodes are only about.

252
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, but the episodes are 40 seconds long.

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,700
It's like Fight Club in England.

254
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,560
I think very mixed.

255
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,440
Fight Club in England?

256
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,800
Yep.

257
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,060
(laughing)

258
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,600
- You can't say that and then like get out of it

259
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,520
by taking a sip and now you're pretending to cough.

260
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,560
Okay, next topic I have here.

261
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Guys, there's, I mean we've heard all about it,

262
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,920
but this AI stuff is getting frankly out of hand.

263
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,760
AI stands for artificial technology

264
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,760
And it is a growing, it's a growing technology.

265
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,420
It is growing.

266
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,340
And I hate to say that.

267
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,280
So what is y'all's opinion on that?

268
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Around the Horn style show.

269
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,680
Around the Horn.

270
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,880
Where we kind of give our own opinions

271
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
on the different topics.

272
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,280
One thing I will say about Around the Horn,

273
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,040
completely ripped off At Midnight.

274
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,520
I agree, points.

275
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,780
(laughing)

276
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,580
- Actually, okay.

277
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm rethinking the whole thing.

278
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,320
(laughing)

279
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm rethinking the format of the show

280
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,640
for no reason right now.

281
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,940
Okay, so if AI was in a room with you,

282
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,920
what would you say to them?

283
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,080
- Hey, how's it going?

284
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
- Points.

285
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,660
- No, that's--

286
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,600
- Points for politeness.

287
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,240
I would say, "Hey Siri, turn off."

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,800
- Negative points to Jubio, negative points to you.

289
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
We'll take all your points away.

290
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,200
- Siri's actually, no, fuck off.

291
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,500
- You said, "Oh, and now he's cussing on TV."

292
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,960
Yep, you're done, you're never invited ever again

293
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
to @midnight.

294
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,880
- But it's @midnight, you can say--

295
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,560
- Or @945.

296
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,920
- You can say, "Was it actually at midnight?"

297
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
- It was at midnight.

298
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,680
- The TV show?

299
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,040
Oh yeah, dude.

300
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,400
I one time watched it with my dad and he said,

301
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,920
he was like, "This is filthy.

302
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,520
"You cannot watch this in my house."

303
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,360
And he made me turn it off.

304
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
- It was pretty disgusting.

305
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,280
And it turned out the guy who ran it

306
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,720
was no clean whistle himself.

307
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,920
- He had the old, I would say he had the--

308
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,640
- Justin Orland.

309
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,600
- Basically the same guy.

310
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,560
He had the number one Me Too story.

311
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,920
- So funny.

312
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,760
- Where he was--

313
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,580
- Easily the funniest.

314
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,840
- His girlfriend had like full vagina reconstruction

315
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,600
or some shit like that.

316
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,440
Or no, it wasn't that.

317
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,140
like she had like a life threatening thing in her,

318
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,040
like she had a life threatening vagina.

319
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't even know that it was her vagina.

320
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
She had some kind of surgery where she had to have it.

321
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,900
And if she didn't have it, she would die.

322
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,940
It was a really, really bad recovery.

323
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,540
Bomb extraction surgery.

324
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,040
Yeah, she had a bomb in her body.

325
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,740
(laughing)

326
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,600
She's in the, the only two people who are in the like

327
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,200
recovery room are the girl's mom and Chris Hardwick,

328
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
her boyfriend.

329
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,100
And her mom is like, when can she like go back to work?

330
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,980
Like when can she go home or whatever?

331
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,720
And Chris Hardwick just goes, when could she have sex again?

332
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,420
Yeah.

333
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,740
When did you fucking suck my stupid dick?

334
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,580
The doctor.

335
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,700
Points to me.

336
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:38,340
When he asked the doctor, the only thing he said is when can she fuck again in front

337
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,680
of this girl's mom after she had like her stomach ripped out of her body.

338
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,520
Yeah.

339
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,620
That's it.

340
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,580
So you got canceled for that?

341
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:45,980
Speaking of canceled.

342
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,860
No, and then also I think that he raped also.

343
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,220
Well, yeah, whatever.

344
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Speaking of points to him, did you see the stuff about

345
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,860
Emily Radage?

346
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,100
You know, her husband and the Saftey brothers.

347
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,760
Oh, no. What happened?

348
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,160
So he he used to work for the Saftey brothers on like Good Time

349
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,260
and Uncut Gems, who's like a casting director.

350
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,120
So it leads off with the story about like a 17 year old girl.

351
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,160
They were like, we're going to bring you on to do a scene with Robert Pattinson,

352
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,440
your favorite actor.

353
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,400
You love what a dumb bitch. Wow. That's right.

354
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,360
And then they were like, just kidding.

355
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,960
It's just some ex con we hired.

356
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,860
And then he's like, can I fuck you?

357
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,840
Can I put my penis inside you?

358
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,800
To Emily Rzaczkowski?

359
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,000
No, to some 17 year old. Oh.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
And then he

361
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,160
so then it like moves on from that story.

362
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,300
And it talks about a different girl during Uncut Jams,

363
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,800
because I was during good time.

364
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,540
So then during Uncut Gems, he found another 17 year old on Instagram

365
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,300
that he was like, I'm going to make you famous and then like brought her

366
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,300
back to the apartment where he and Emily were like staying.

367
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,200
He's like, Can I put my penis in you without a condom?

368
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,740
Just kidding. I'm not going to ask.

369
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,400
And then just like kind of did it. Never mind. And then

370
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,800
no points to him.

371
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,780
You know, I was talking to him and then that's it.

372
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,860
- If I had been there, by the way, I would have said--

373
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,700
- Points.

374
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,860
- No points, no, I would have said no points.

375
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,060
No points at all.

376
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,900
- Too much.

377
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,980
- Way too much, dude.

378
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,820
- And then I would go--

379
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,140
- No points at all.

380
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,200
- I would do my thing, I would hit my button,

381
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,460
I would go, "Rapey McRapeface,"

382
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,220
and then you go, "Points."

383
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,060
- Yeah.

384
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,740
- And then I go, "Okay, points to me for Rapey McRapeface."

385
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,340
No points to you for having sex with a 10-year-old.

386
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,940
Yeah, so he hit up a 15 year old on Instagram

387
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,380
and then she like was like, Yo, why are you DMing this 15 year old?

388
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,180
And he's like, Why are you a retarded kike?

389
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,480
Which you can say, because Rex is both.

390
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,440
I can say both.

391
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,180
I can say both those things.

392
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,900
And he's like, What?

393
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,080
It's a fucking it's a joke, bitch.

394
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Get a sense of humor.

395
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,440
And wow.

396
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,780
So that's his cancellation.

397
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,380
This was Emily Radzikowski's husband.

398
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,920
Yeah.

399
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,980
Friend married.

400
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,180
Wow.

401
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,980
So how does I mean, obviously, that's terrible.

402
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,180
That guy's bad. Yeah, it's not funny.

403
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,360
But the real story is, how does it reflect on her

404
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,120
that she would even be married to such a monster?

405
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,580
So I'm kind of and she's famous and he's not.

406
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,180
So I'm a lot more interested in blaming her in this situation.

407
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,380
If you guys join me in that.

408
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,460
It is entirely her fault.

409
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,460
I do see that she enticed him to do this.

410
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
If she had been sucking his dick enough, this would never have happened.

411
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
Or she should have, she should have

412
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
maybe

413
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
immobilized him, should have broken his kneecaps

414
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,460
or something. Yeah. She should have killed him.

415
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Should have gone through his phone more. More women should be going through their men's

416
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
phones. Agreed.

417
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
We need to do more background checks on everyone for everything.

418
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,460
If I had a fucking

419
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,460
boyfriend,

420
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,460
I'd be going through his phone all the fucking time

421
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,460
dude. Yeah?

422
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
Oh my god yes. If I had like a

423
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,600
hot, successful boyfriend.

424
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,440
- Yeah.

425
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,680
- There's no fucking way I'm not touching that phone.

426
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,260
- I wasn't successful, but my ex used to have

427
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,920
a fucking GPS tracker on me.

428
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,460
- Did you see that?

429
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,000
Like she shot like a dart gun that went into your neck

430
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,120
and put a chip in you.

431
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
She just had the location sharing on your phone.

432
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,840
- Yeah, but she made me install an app to do it.

433
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
- Okay, that's a little crazy.

434
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,180
Yeah, that might as well be a blow dart.

435
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,020
- Yeah.

436
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,820
I wasn't even doing anything.

437
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,900
I didn't leave my house.

438
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
I still don't leave my house.

439
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,540
- That's even-- - Was that when you

440
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,360
were working at a distro, Cream?

441
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,860
- I would get even more suspicious.

442
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,780
If you were just in the house all the time,

443
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,300
I would assume that you would--

444
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,140
You just got a second phone.

445
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,540
See, you see how good I would be at being a girlfriend?

446
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,860
A crazy girlfriend?

447
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,980
- You would be really good.

448
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,420
Which is crazy because Julio was in this call,

449
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,260
and as a Latina, he should be the crazy girlfriend.

450
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,440
- Exactly.

451
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,980
- What's the one app that you guys would go through

452
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,220
on your boyfriend's phone?

453
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,060
I would go instantly on Instagram to see his feed and then check.

454
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,120
Yeah. We'll check the feed first and then I'll find all the hot girls that he

455
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,660
follows. And then I'll go to, to his, uh,

456
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,500
messages and see that he sees messaging, uh,

457
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,460
LeBron James or something like that. And go like, who the fuck is this?

458
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,900
Yeah. How, how,

459
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,540
how awful would that be if you thought that your boyfriend was cheating on you

460
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,940
and you go into, uh, you go into his like Instagram DMs.

461
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,660
And instead of like him DMing like hot girls all day,

462
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,140
he's literally like just responding to like,

463
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,280
reacting to Russell Westbrook stories

464
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
with like praying hands emojis and shit.

465
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,900
That would be worse, right?

466
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,440
If he's like reacting to J. Cole stories,

467
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,420
like, yo, this is lit.

468
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,260
Like I would--

469
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,180
- I'll do you one better.

470
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,220
He's just reacting to his favorite podcasters stories.

471
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,180
- That'd be way worse, yeah.

472
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,540
- Yeah, he's reacting to Patrick and getting it.

473
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,500
(laughing)

474
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,740
Yeah, you find out that he's he's responding to Brandon Wardell

475
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,440
open Q and A's on Instagram stories.

476
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,800
You got. Yeah, I'm leaving this guy.

477
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,040
But if I had a boy's phone and he was my boyfriend,

478
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,300
I would probably go through the settings and probably change his

479
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,900
change the language to French or Chinese or something. Yeah.

480
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,100
Something that's really hard to speak.

481
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,540
Yeah, exactly.

482
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,480
And then let him, you know, go do his thing.

483
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
That will teach him to have a phone.

484
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,140
What do you even need a phone for?

485
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,080
Not much these days, but that's back to my point about artificial

486
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,700
and technology technologies,

487
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,840
which is that guys, this is getting crazy these days.

488
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,380
Basically, I don't I saw this.

489
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Sorry, am I speaking?

490
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,080
Let him finish.

491
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,180
Thank you.

492
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,080
Muted.

493
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:06,400
Basically, I saw that OpenGPT can now draw a smiley face

494
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
with no-- if you just ask me.

495
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,240
[LAUGHTER]

496
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,120
That's the other way.

497
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,520
That's fucking crazy, dude.

498
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,480
So it's worrying me--

499
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
It's going to take all the jobs.

500
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
I-- that's-- yeah, you're fucking telling me.

501
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
I have a job as a smiley face drawer.

502
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
[LAUGHTER]

503
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I get paid $400,000 a year to draw

504
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,080
smiley faces.

505
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,380
I'm going to be in

506
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
my livelihood is in danger.

507
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,580
Eli Ezra Yudkowsky's

508
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,680
fucking militia army of

509
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,960
minimum wage workers

510
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,760
who bomb Amazon Web Service servers

511
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,820
because they host a chat GPT thing.

512
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,220
That's what I'm looking to do.

513
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,600
That would be very, very fun.

514
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,660
What do you think AI is going to take over

515
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,600
creative jobs like podcasts and shit?

516
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,300
I think, actually, I think like 18 months.

517
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,160
Yeah, yeah, I think it's going to be real.

518
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,420
I think we're pretty much done.

519
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,720
This is like I would say beers we drank might even be seen

520
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,360
as historically as the last great podcast, right?

521
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,460
By humans.

522
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,200
Yeah. Once I starts doing their own version of wait, wait,

523
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,120
don't tell me and stuff, you're just going to it's over.

524
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
Car talk, right?

525
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,560
They can bring car talk back with the dead guy.

526
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,800
Right, exactly. That's the thing.

527
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,160
You could have a new episode of the Joe Rogan podcast

528
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,500
three times a week.

529
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,600
It's three hours long.

530
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,500
They have famous guests with a lot of voices,

531
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,960
and you get to hear your favorite podcaster, Joe Rogan,

532
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,700
talk to famous people multiple times a week for free.

533
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,060
Wow.

534
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,660
Don't even need to include Joe Rogan in the whole thing.

535
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,800
You're saying AI is going to make this dream a reality?

536
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,900
Oh, I was talking about Spotify.

537
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,600
Oh, OK.

538
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,800
Oh, never mind then.

539
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,100
We're talking about artificial technology right now.

540
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,500
Talk about AI, not Spotify.

541
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,900
Why don't we talk about...

542
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,400
Wait, that just gave me like an awesome idea.

543
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
Oh, yeah, that is true.

544
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,700
Just like having an app where you can just like make your own

545
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,400
pod, like your own dream podcast.

546
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
It's just like Joe Rogan speaking to my friend.

547
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,700
Well, oh my God, what would be your dream Rogan episode?

548
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,100
Um, yeah, actually you.

549
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
- Shut up.

550
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,500
(laughing)

551
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,340
- I wouldn't want to go on.

552
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,320
- It would be so funny because you would be

553
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,780
so intimidated by him.

554
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,620
- You would.

555
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,440
- Me? Joe Rogan?

556
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,560
- You're the same kind of guy.

557
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,240
- He's a pipsqueak.

558
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,680
He's a pipsqueak, I would take him out.

559
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,520
What, bald?

560
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,960
Is that what you, bald with tattoos

561
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
and basically shredded, ripping muscles.

562
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,000
- You would be so shy, you'd be like,

563
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,960
"Oh my God, my king talking to me right now."

564
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
- I do love him so, so much.

565
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,360
- Yeah, you would be stunned.

566
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,900
Anytime I hear, I've heard a couple of stories of him acting, even just,

567
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,920
just slightly, just a little bit Hollywood and a little bit snobby.

568
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,040
And it literally, it's, it causes psychic damage to me.

569
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,680
Yeah.

570
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,200
He is my, he is my every man.

571
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,960
I thought he was better than that.

572
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,640
Yeah.

573
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,360
Yeah.

574
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,520
Yeah.

575
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,840
Yeah.

576
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,480
But then he's been, you know, then you realize he was on TV when he was like 21.

577
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,080
Yeah.

578
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,800
It's kind of amazing that he's as, see, now I'm just going to gush about him

579
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
for five or five or 10 minutes.

580
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
It's amazing that he's so he's built.

581
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,140
Um.

582
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,340
Are you crying?

583
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,140
No, it's sorry.

584
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,640
He's built a basically a entire Empire

585
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,140
with just him and his little brother or whatever.

586
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,640
Jamie.

587
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
I don't know what Jamie is.

588
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,040
But him and his little brother basically done.

589
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,240
They changed the entire world.

590
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,440
So now there's more and more people are starting to believe

591
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
in Atlantis.

592
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,740
and I would say that's directly his doing.

593
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,580
So I think he's a very good man.

594
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,300
- Yours goes a lot to Joe Rogan, I would say.

595
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,540
- Yeah, absolutely.

596
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,940
- I would say we're brother podcasts.

597
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,660
- Yeah, yeah, no doubt.

598
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,060
- We're a brother podcast.

599
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,900
- Yeah. - Yeah.

600
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,920
- Either that or impulsive. - A projector style podcast.

601
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,840
Yeah.

602
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,100
- I would say we're part impulsive.

603
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,300
- I think we're both, we're half and half.

604
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,060
- We're like the best parts of Rogan

605
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,980
and the best parts of impulsive put together.

606
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,420
I'm Big Mike, Jubio is George,

607
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,720
and obviously Rex is Jake or Logan Paul.

608
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Right. George.

609
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,720
George is there like a comedian friend

610
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,960
like started stand up like six months ago.

611
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,900
And Bobby Lee made fun of him because he's a Christian

612
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,200
and he like walked out of the episode.

613
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,000
That's awesome.

614
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,080
You got so bad comedian who walks out on a podcast.

615
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,140
Yeah, because Bobby Lee is like,

616
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,860
"Oh, Christian, yeah, what do I suck Jesus's cock?"

617
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,540
And he was like, "I can't even fucking do this."

618
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,700
And he left the room.

619
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,620
That's not cool, man.

620
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,460
I don't play with that.

621
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,080
You watch impulsive clips, shorts?

622
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,620
No, no, no, no.

623
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,260
No, it's even worse than that.

624
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,220
I watch podcast drama channels

625
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,960
that when something crazy happens on Impulsive,

626
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,020
they will cover it.

627
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,940
Now that is what's up.

628
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,740
Now that is the lowest of the low.

629
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,700
I think whenever I think of Caleb using his phone,

630
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,500
I feel like half of the day he's just,

631
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,420
he's just browsing YouTube shorts.

632
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,300
And the other half of the day, he's playing a game on his phone

633
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,820
and he's never looking at either discord or text messages or slack.

634
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,140
He's always, I almost always have do not disturb on.

635
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,700
There's a single button that is just an electrical pulse that zaps him.

636
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,380
And I like about it for

637
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,220
- 30 minutes.

638
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,460
(laughing)

639
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,700
- If I could set my phone up to do that, I probably would.

640
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,540
- Yeah, absolutely.

641
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,460
- If I could put a thin layer of electricity

642
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,580
that just like zaps up and down on the top.

643
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,420
But no, worse than my phone--

644
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,660
- Before Julio was the group Twitch streamer,

645
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,220
my dream idea was that I would be a Twitch streamer

646
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,700
and I would have like a shot caller

647
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,580
that would be like a love sense,

648
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,180
but for like Twitch streaming.

649
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,020
And so people would--

650
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,700
- You can totally do that now.

651
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,300
- No, I think that's against TOS.

652
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,140
- It's against TOS.

653
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,180
- Well, it's against TOS on Twitch,

654
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,100
but there's Skick and Rumble going around.

655
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,740
- Oh, shit.

656
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,460
Yeah, we should go on Kick

657
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,580
and we should start beheading animals.

658
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,820
- We should start gambling and shocking you

659
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,100
whenever you lose money.

660
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,740
- I do think I would get shocked for five--

661
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,660
- Hey, that is so smart.

662
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:34,100
We shock him when the bonus pot loses money.

663
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,940
(laughing)

664
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,540
- Use the shock of electricity?

665
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,220
Okay, we are doing that, that is so funny.

666
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,300
- That is such a good idea.

667
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,260
- I know, that's what I'm saying.

668
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,780
When I found out that you couldn't do it,

669
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,160
it was like devastating.

670
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,860
- Yeah.

671
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,540
- That was my dream.

672
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,860
- Today's a new day, so we're ordering

673
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,820
a shock holler tonight.

674
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,380
- I'm looking at my screen time,

675
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,020
and my number one by a lot is YouTube.

676
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,940
And then my number two is New York Times Games,

677
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,940
because I'm a bit of a crossword/spelling bee fan.

678
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,940
- You're spending eight hours a day looking for Wartle.

679
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,180
(laughing)

680
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,500
- She's like, F-U-D-G-E.

681
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,340
- No. - No.

682
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,100
C-R-E-A-M, no.

683
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,780
- What is your guys' top one favorite

684
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,580
Wartle word to ask to submit?

685
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,180
- Dozer.

686
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,620
- Okay. - Or bozer, I mean.

687
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,660
Bozer.

688
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,540
- That's not funny.

689
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,020
- Do you mean like my opening gambit or my--

690
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,580
- I don't do WURTLE anymore.

691
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,380
WURTLE is for babies.

692
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,580
- WURTLE's fun.

693
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,620
- It's for children.

694
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,900
- I do love when I can use a silly word like penis.

695
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,460
- You know which one's my favorite one?

696
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,940
My favorite one is KITTLE.

697
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,340
- Okay, and hey, I got another question for you.

698
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,620
What is your favorite shape to put into that block

699
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,340
that only accepts a single shape?

700
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,980
What's your favorite one?

701
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,060
Since we're just going with just baby fucking loser games.

702
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,900
Circle?

703
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,720
- Okay.

704
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,120
- Cool, and what's your favorite domino to stack?

705
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Which one, the one with the three dots and one dot?

706
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,840
- I'm gonna take over here as the host

707
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,040
and I'm gonna give you negative points

708
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,500
for being rude to me.

709
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,660
- Okay, that's been Beers We Drank.

710
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,040
Thanks for joining us.

711
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,240
We're never, it's basically completely over

712
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,040
because there's been a mutiny.

713
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,600
We'll be back next week with a hot girl instead of a Jubio.

714
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,240
- Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

715
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,440
- That's the idea.

716
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,160
- We're never gonna hear our first guest.

717
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,320
We need guests now.

718
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,080
- I don't need guests, dude.

719
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,400
- We need to do one of those podcasts

720
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,880
that has so many guests that no one gets to speak

721
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,120
a full sentence the entire show.

722
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,720
- Right. - For like three hours.

723
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,560
- What are you even talking about?

724
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
- I wanna just sit there and drink my beer quietly

725
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,400
for an hour.

726
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,840
- Yeah, I just wanna see something else.

727
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,040
- Just listen. - Talk.

728
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,300
(laughing)

729
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
I fucking hate talking.

730
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,360
- We should choose one podcast that already exists

731
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,480
that has a lot of guests on it,

732
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,160
and we should just take all of the guests that they do

733
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,560
just the week after every single time.

734
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,240
- I think that's a good idea,

735
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,280
but also I don't know any podcasts.

736
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,400
- We could check out Impulsive, you could check that out.

737
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,960
- I guess, I mean, the only way that I discover new podcasts

738
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,360
is when I go on Google Podcasts

739
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,040
and I search the word spaghetti.

740
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,200
And I look at all the spaghetti podcasts.

741
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,440
- What are you talking about?

742
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,000
- I've done it before. - He does do this.

743
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,120
- You have a spaghetti method to find podcasts?

744
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,600
- I don't find them, I just think it's funny

745
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,400
that you can go on a like a podcast tab.

746
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,440
You can do it right now, listener.

747
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,160
You go on a podcast tab, you search a silly word like spaghetti,

748
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,500
which who's going to call their podcast spaghetti or the spaghetti podcast?

749
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,960
Probably is going to be dozens of results of people being like this.

750
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,540
And you listen to this.

751
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,460
No, I just look at him.

752
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,900
Yeah, you I take that back.

753
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,200
Caleb has a normal time on his phone.

754
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,480
You are the monkey.

755
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,320
- Yeah, you have a crazy time.

756
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,160
- I'm gonna look at my screen time.

757
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,040
- Oh, I wish I was playing Crazy Time right now.

758
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,080
- Oh, wow, we haven't played Crazy Time in a long time.

759
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,160
- I know. - I would love,

760
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,860
do you remember the first time

761
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,320
after discovering online gambling,

762
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,560
the first time that you went to a real casino?

763
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,800
And you were like, this is trash.

764
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,080
- It's bad. - This is literally

765
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,360
so fucking bad, bro.

766
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,600
Where is the Crazy Time?

767
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,720
Where is, like, I was hoping that it was gonna be

768
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,460
basically just different stages like SNL.

769
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,900
And I'm just going to walk up to them and be like,

770
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,200
Hello, I'd like to lose $100.

771
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,700
Wow. Twitter number one for old Jubio.

772
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,740
Yeah. And then Firefox number three.

773
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,140
That's crazy. This guy loves jacking off.

774
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
Yeah. No, that's not true.

775
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,740
I'm looking up stuff.

776
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,520
So you hate jacking off?

777
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,680
I hate jacking off.

778
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,120
No, it's not true.

779
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,180
That's not true. I just look up stuff.

780
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,620
I'm going to go look at my tabs now.

781
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,060
When I went to a real casino,

782
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,260
I've only gone to a real casino once after I started online gambling.

783
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,060
I lost $300.

784
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,620
Was that an AC with us?

785
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,220
OK, twice. Yeah.

786
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,400
AC was fun because we were all together,

787
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,120
but I went to one with my parents, with my dad, and

788
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,020
I remember going to all the slots and being like, where are the bonus buys?

789
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,600
Why are all these slots so bad?

790
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,960
And then I lost $300 and I was walking towards

791
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,960
the ATM to take out more money.

792
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,580
And I happened.

793
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,840
My dad happened to be coming from the other side of the casino, saw me.

794
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,980
It came up. It was like, Oh, how are you doing?

795
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,340
Yeah, you still up?

796
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,520
I was like, Of course. Yeah, no, I'm just

797
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,920
actually I'm going to go cash out.

798
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,520
And he's like, Yeah, you know, I'm up like 400 bucks.

799
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,260
Like, I think I think I think we're good.

800
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,960
They get out of here.

801
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,800
And I was like, Oh, yeah, that's probably a really good idea.

802
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,000
Let's get out.

803
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,420
Wow. So your dad still thinks you made money.

804
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,480
Yeah, I completely lied to him about it.

805
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,560
That's so embarrassing.

806
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,680
My dad losing $300 in an hour and a half.

807
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,560
Yeah, that is a lot of money.

808
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,720
You know what happened?

809
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,620
What I started doing dollar 50 spins on a slot going,

810
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,960
I can't lose all my money doing this.

811
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,760
You can you lose.

812
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,720
I've never I've been to a casino.

813
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,420
I've had probably 15 days at casinos at this point,

814
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,120
And I've never came like I've never won.

815
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,620
The slots are eaters.

816
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,080
They do every single time.

817
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,680
Yeah, you really have to like go.

818
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,520
You have to be like you have to want to play like backer

819
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,220
rot or some shit like that.

820
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,920
But like the last thing I want, the one time that I went and did that shit,

821
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,380
I went and played roulette

822
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,920
and it was like real late at night.

823
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,760
And there was this like fat southern guy who was like

824
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,480
just he was putting so much money down.

825
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,060
And so everybody loved him.

826
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,220
Everybody was just like loving it because he was betting like a thousand dollars

827
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,760
on like numbers and shit.

828
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,100
Like he's obviously a rich dude.

829
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,460
But he was like

830
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,200
yelling about he was he was screaming quotes from like Talladega Nights.

831
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,520
Like he thought, yeah, so he was like, he's like throwing down

832
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,360
a thousand dollars on the thing, like tipping the lady 500 bucks.

833
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,160
And she's like, oh, thank you so much.

834
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,900
And he's like, oh, sweet baby Jesus.

835
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,500
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, little baby Jesus in a manger.

836
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,100
And everybody's like, yeah, yeah, this guy's the man.

837
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,000
And he got to live, he thought for like a while, like he's doing.

838
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,500
He thought that he was like

839
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,100
the the king of the world for a minute.

840
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,400
He was he was doing Will Ferrell lines.

841
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,040
And he's saying, if you're if you a first, you're last.

842
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,600
And he's just like and everybody's for some reason just loving it

843
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,680
because he's like just a drunk, ugly guy screaming.

844
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,140
And I was like, that is the you have to be like that kind of guy

845
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,440
if you're going to make any money in one of those games.

846
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,020
Yeah, you have to be like a Porky the Pig dude

847
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,900
who's dishing out office quotes.

848
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,980
And then people will say for whatever reason,

849
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,200
God will bless you and you will make a lot of money.

850
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,820
God blesses all his retarded children.

851
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,120
Yeah, exactly.

852
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,540
Totally.

853
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,660
And it's just a movie that I like only the half of it.

854
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't like the first half of the movie.

855
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,340
Did a rewatch recently.

856
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,960
Not really.

857
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,180
None of his shit really holds up.

858
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,720
OK.

859
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,880
Yeah, Elf does completely hold up.

860
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
If anybody...

861
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,300
Yeah, you think Elf holds up to me in particular?

862
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,180
You are an elf, canonically in the Bible, Jews are Elves.

863
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,320
So next question.

864
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,140
I like Elf.

865
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,160
I like the other guys.

866
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,120
I like the other guys.

867
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,780
The other guys.

868
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,120
You never seen that?

869
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,460
Oh, you're saying the movie, the other movie, the other guy.

870
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,320
Yeah, I'm naming Will Ferrell movies.

871
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,120
I thought you were talking about the other guys.

872
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,060
Creatures. You are a moron.

873
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,320
No, I like Elf. I like the other guys.

874
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,560
I like what's another welfare.

875
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,420
I like Anchorman.

876
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,760
Anchorman's great.

877
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,520
Yeah, that movie came out today.

878
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
We called Dankerman.

879
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,320
He would.

880
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,220
Smoke one.

881
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,560
No, because anchor it.

882
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,820
No, no points taken away.

883
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,640
- No, it would be called Anchor Woman or Anchor,

884
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,600
like do that.

885
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,440
- Anchor them.

886
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,280
- Anchor them.

887
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,120
- Anchor them.

888
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,900
Anchor them, that's perfect.

889
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,620
It would be called, or you could even add--

890
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,240
- Say points right now.

891
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,560
- Okay, points.

892
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,520
But not points to you, you said Danker Man,

893
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,840
which made no sense.

894
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,520
- Anchor them, I said anchor them also.

895
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,360
- No you didn't.

896
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,480
- What do you wait on at midnight?

897
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,400
Do they win money?

898
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,040
- No, oh my God, oh my God.

899
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,480
- You foolish man.

900
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,320
- Where do the points go?

901
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,160
(laughing)

902
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,520
- That's literally a conversation I've had with like,

903
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,560
my grandma walking in the middle of the night

904
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,520
and I'm watching at her.

905
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,480
Wait, where do the points go?

906
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,320
- I live in a different country.

907
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,160
- Wait, they just,

908
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,480
the points just go away at the end of the show?

909
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
- Yes, you moron.

910
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,460
Haven't you ever seen "Whose Line Is It Anyway?"

911
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,080
Where the points basically don't matter as far as I know.

912
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,920
- But they do,

913
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,320
because the winner gets to be the host at the end.

914
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,380
- Wait, he has seen "Whose Line Is It Anyway?"

915
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,100
- I mean, whose line is it anyway?

916
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,140
- Whose line, the points matter.

917
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,980
- Okay, so the points actually--

918
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,420
- They say they don't matter, but they do matter.

919
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,100
- Okay, so that's actually the trick of At Midnight.

920
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,640
They say that the points matter.

921
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,300
- But they don't matter. - But the points do not matter.

922
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,620
- I think you're trying to lie to me.

923
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,160
- No, I'm not.

924
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,780
I'm really not.

925
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,780
'Cause when the workaholics boys get up there on At Midnight,

926
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,780
they're not fighting each other,

927
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,360
trying to climb to the top over each other's broken bodies.

928
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,920
It's not competitive like that. They're working together to make somebody laugh and his name starts with a J and

929
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,240
It ends with a bunch of I don't know how to spell your name

930
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,480
But it ends with a bunch of probably accents over every single word and maybe a backwards L somewhere

931
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,600
With Ron funches is saying puns in his sweet voice. Yeah, his sweet is honey voice

932
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,840
He sounds so pretty he has a beautiful. He's like if Danny Brown was jovial

933
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,640
He's one of those guys that should have stayed really fat. I

934
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,820
Hate wait hold on wait. He lost weight. You don't even look it up. You're gonna be so upset

935
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,120
They're both

936
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,780
I'm gonna punch his weight loss. Oh

937
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,500
My goodness he lost weight isn't that awful look at him. He's like

938
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,040
Jonah Hill

939
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,920
Yeah, it's so bad and he used to be basically as fat as a balloon and now he's

940
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,180
He used to be a big old black balloon. And now he's basically just a normal guy. He lost

941
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,420
140 pounds that's too much man

942
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:52,080
You're supposed if you're a fat guy who's who has ever had a picture taken of him of you

943
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,680
You need to realize that somebody somewhere is sitting looking at that picture

944
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,200
You're going

945
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,620
(laughs)

946
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,880
Laughing at it.

947
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,720
Yeah.

948
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,160
So it is on you to not tear away that person's joy

949
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,020
by losing weight.

950
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,860
You can't do it.

951
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,680
You're supposed to go out.

952
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,100
If you're comically fat, you need to completely be a,

953
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,920
what's his name?

954
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,960
Ralphie May.

955
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,980
You need to die.

956
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,960
You have to die.

957
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,880
You have to die.

958
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,660
You have to just exponentially get bigger and bigger

959
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,840
and bigger until, I think he popped one day.

960
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,680
I think he was in the middle of traffic in Los Angeles and he popped and he exploded.

961
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,180
Yeah.

962
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,620
And people thought that maybe some kind of fish market truck, uh, uh,

963
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:42,300
flipped over, but it was just Ralphie Mays kind of in trails and we're

964
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,100
finding whole, whole pieces of sushi.

965
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:50,840
Just splattered across the, uh, the four or five leather tarp of meat.

966
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,620
Yeah, exactly.

967
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,540
Can you imagine what that is?

968
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,800
(laughing)

969
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,380
I mean like, you can't put him in a normal coffin.

970
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,600
You literally, you have to put him in a round coffin.

971
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,040
They have to, right?

972
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,200
They make fat guy everything.

973
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,160
Damn, coffin for fat.

974
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,240
A reinforced fat guy coffin.

975
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Coffin for a fat person.

976
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,280
Oh my God.

977
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,960
A company called Goliath Casket makes them

978
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,560
as big as 52 inches wide.

979
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,440
- That's so sick, dude.

980
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,760
- Goliath casket. - Imagine that doesn't

981
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,360
fit you enough, but you're like,

982
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,320
you know, you're on the line,

983
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,840
so they're like kinda squishing you in,

984
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,240
they're like. (laughs)

985
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,920
- Dude, this is like a queen-size bed.

986
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,200
- Yeah. - Wow.

987
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,000
- Yeah, and it still might not be big enough

988
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,080
for someone like Ralphie Mae.

989
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,920
- Wow.

990
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,280
- I think it'd be funny if they were like,

991
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,360
no, we can't put him in a coffin,

992
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,680
and they're like, they burn your body,

993
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,320
and then there's too much ash to put in an urn,

994
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
So they have to put you in like a big jar.

995
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,240
Yeah, they have to put you in a rain bucket,

996
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,500
like a 50-gallon drum that you would keep a chemical in.

997
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,000
And people have to be like, "Yeah, that was my dad."

998
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,840
Yeah, they put him in a Home Depot paint bucket.

999
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,840
He's in that big blue, Breaking Bad, 55-gallon drum

1000
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,340
right over there.

1001
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,480
And when we go to spread his ashes,

1002
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,480
we have to roll it down the beach.

1003
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,860
We have to roll it up and down the dunes.

1004
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:27,380
Yeah, God bless those big fat people for being a giant burden even in their death.

1005
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
That is so amazing.

1006
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,380
It is really dope.

1007
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
Yeah.

1008
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,100
Do you think there was fat cavemen?

1009
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,100
No.

1010
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
No.

1011
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:44,060
I, last night, or a couple nights ago, I smoked way too much weed and I asked Chad GPT if

1012
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,500
there's any evidence that cavemen ever experienced any kind of depression.

1013
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,300
(laughing)

1014
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,060
- Like a cave painting, with like a frowny face.

1015
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,100
- I was like, was there like an Elliot Smith caveman,

1016
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,260
who was like, yes, exactly, frowny face.

1017
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,220
- You asked Chad to be T this?

1018
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,060
- Yeah.

1019
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,900
- What did he say?

1020
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,180
- I think that's just how you do anything now,

1021
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,980
because I'm into artificial technology.

1022
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,020
Yeah, you'd go on there and you say, what is it?

1023
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,620
Dude, honestly, the thing that I saw

1024
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,540
that scared me the most this week,

1025
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,020
was the somebody showed that you can take a picture

1026
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,940
with the new one, take a picture of your fridge

1027
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,460
and it will tell you what to make

1028
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,100
with the like ingredients in your fridge.

1029
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,940
- What?

1030
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,760
- Yeah, and I-- - What?

1031
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,600
- Is that scary?

1032
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,140
That scares me.

1033
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,540
- See, that's what I'm saying.

1034
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,380
- How is that scary?

1035
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,420
- Artificial technology-- - We have to do terror,

1036
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,820
we have to terrorize this shit.

1037
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,820
We have to-- - It gives you,

1038
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,160
it gives you access to a dumb friend at all hours.

1039
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,000
- Yeah, exactly.

1040
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Young friend with unique skills.

1041
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's amazing.

1042
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Who might one day become a ghost,

1043
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
literally a ghost or a god or a demon

1044
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
if you give it enough time.

1045
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Have you seen the post where people are asking

1046
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
to do ASCII art of like a word

1047
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and it just spits out a completely

1048
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
different word that's completely wrong?

1049
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
No, I haven't seen that.

1050
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I think you should ask it to do that.

1051
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I think it really grounded it for me.

1052
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Like it's just, oh, this thing doesn't do anything.

1053
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It doesn't know anything.

1054
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,960
you're wrong you're wrong dude no it's over anything but it knows a lot you

1055
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,080
have to understand it's it's a dumb guy with access to every book okay Rex I

1056
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,840
think it's now it's time for you to break out with the thing that you showed

1057
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,760
me earlier today what did you show him earlier did he showed me wrist GPT oh

1058
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:41,760
yeah Riz GPT what's Riz GPT it's a new thing some guys made so it uses augmented

1059
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,860
reality glasses, uh huh, whisper, whisper API, which is the

1060
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,620
uh, chat to beauty plugin that transcribes audio on the fly.

1061
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,260
Yeah.

1062
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,860
And then, uh, what it does is while you're talking to someone,

1063
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:02,860
it will in front of your eyes display a generated response to

1064
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,660
what they're saying.

1065
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:10,360
So you don't even have to use your brain to think of what to

1066
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
say in a conversation.

1067
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:17,080
It's marketed to like end awkwardness in first dates and job interviews.

1068
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:22,680
But the best part about the job, the like the technical that it did was like this person

1069
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:29,400
is like asking you a question and he, you, the AI comes up with like the most generic

1070
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,880
answers that don't really answer the question.

1071
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Which is perfect.

1072
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,160
It also takes, it takes so long to process that.

1073
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,120
Yeah it also takes like five seconds.

1074
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,120
So you're just sitting and smiling.

1075
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,120
So the setup is this.

1076
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,120
By the way, you said job interviews.

1077
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,480
So you're in an interview for like a marketing position.

1078
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,840
Could I just look this up?

1079
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,920
You sit there and the guy says,

1080
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,640
"So what's your biggest weakness?"

1081
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,400
And you just kind of look right at him.

1082
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,360
For like a minute.

1083
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,200
For a minute, and then you go.

1084
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,320
While it's like processing.

1085
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,680
Hey, I just realized that if we were both emojis,

1086
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,240
we'd be the perfect pair.

1087
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,680
Want to find out which one?

1088
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,600
Yeah.

1089
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,440
Something like that.

1090
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,920
It's just like something super generic

1091
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,160
that wouldn't really convince anyone to hire you.

1092
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,120
- I think that you would get hired if you said,

1093
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,200
"Hey there, sorry, I know we're in the middle

1094
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,040
of a job interview.

1095
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,080
Are you Pluto?

1096
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,800
'Cause you may not be a planet,

1097
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,120
but you still look out of this world."

1098
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,200
They're gonna be like, "Wait, this guy actually has

1099
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,360
extreme charm.

1100
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,680
I think he would be an amazing member of the geek squad."

1101
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,240
the two options were first dates and job interviews

1102
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,360
because those are like two very different,

1103
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,160
you know, type of scenarios.

1104
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,200
- Those are things where people get awkward, you know.

1105
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,920
- Yeah, but those are like two very different scenarios.

1106
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,760
- Can we use this right now?

1107
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,400
- There's two different energies.

1108
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,160
- Is this out yet?

1109
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,480
- I don't think you can really use it.

1110
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,560
I think you just use it like open AI.

1111
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,040
- It says it's coming soon, guys.

1112
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,940
Riz GPT, oh wait, hmm.

1113
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,400
Hmm, I might've been wrong.

1114
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,880
It might actually be out.

1115
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,880
But I was thinking after, like with that context earlier,

1116
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,600
how cool would it be,

1117
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,240
ChachiPT as a co-host to the podcast?

1118
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,960
- That would be probably the,

1119
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,240
honestly, probably by the time this podcast is posted,

1120
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,240
there will be 500 podcasts that have some variation

1121
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,800
of that idea incorporated in them.

1122
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,560
- Yeah, but I was thinking beer.

1123
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,800
- Yeah, but we should ask him what he thinks about beer.

1124
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,840
- I was, when I was walking to the beer store today,

1125
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,480
I was on my phone typing the chat,

1126
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,920
CBT, can you give me some,

1127
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,680
some other titles for my podcast?

1128
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,560
Here is some past titles like, uh, you know,

1129
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,400
like red Mustang. Yeah. You know, I,

1130
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,600
I forgot what the, what I called it last time, but that one,

1131
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,960
I am become a drunk destroyer of beers or whatever,

1132
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,680
right? Drinker of beers. What does it say?

1133
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:07,160
I said here, have a beer, gives beer. It says as an AI language model I don't have a

1134
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,920
physical body to consume beer but I appreciate the gesture.

1135
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:18,920
I like that it only took us like a month to get to the level where we're like what if we just read shit in the chat sheet.

1136
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,920
It is fun dude.

1137
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,920
Wait, wait, I have to get his opinion on your topics. AI and the other thing. I forgot what the other thing was.

1138
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,320
Oh, no, that's, I don't want to do this.

1139
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,560
I just wanted to give it a beer,

1140
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,960
but I thought that maybe it would be like,

1141
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,600
okay, grabs beer, gulp, but it didn't.

1142
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,160
So I give up.

1143
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
And now I will open my second beer, by the way,

1144
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,760
which is a little bit of a curve ball, guys.

1145
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,600
I'm ready.

1146
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,960
You know me.

1147
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,920
I never go the same beer twice.

1148
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,920
This is a June Shineheart Kombucha.

1149
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,760
Oh, okay.

1150
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,160
P.O.G. flavor.

1151
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,000
So you might not--

1152
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,840
Person of color.

1153
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,660
Player of the game.

1154
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:02,500
of player of games. I actually don't know what what is a passion fruit orange guava.

1155
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:13,700
Mmm Wow. Penis of Grinjer. Penis of Grinjer? I didn't say that. You did say that. Let's

1156
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:23,180
see how this one is. That's um pretty good. I can't lie. I like hard. Okay I want to

1157
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,180
I get to my topic now.

1158
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,180
Oh yeah, to your topic, yeah.

1159
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,180
My topic that I've been thinking about this entire week.

1160
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,180
Yeah.

1161
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,180
I want to talk about animal beefs.

1162
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,180
The fuck are you talking about?

1163
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,180
Like meats?

1164
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,180
No.

1165
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,180
Animal beefs?

1166
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,180
Like between animals?

1167
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,180
No, between you and an animal.

1168
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Oh.

1169
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,180
So, it's been well documented that Caleb has been fighting different mice in New York.

1170
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,180
That's true.

1171
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,180
So we don't really have to go into his beefs.

1172
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,180
Unless he has an update on those.

1173
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,180
I would rather ask Rex on whether or not he has an animal beef that he's ever been in

1174
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,340
- I'm gonna go in one, because I myself

1175
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:00,340
have been embroiled in a tight beef this past week or so.

1176
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,900
- I don't know why you're dragging me into your story.

1177
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,620
I don't have problems with animals.

1178
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,940
- I'm just, I just wanna, okay.

1179
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,660
I'm just opening the floor to see

1180
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,540
if you had a story about this.

1181
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,860
- So you're opening the floor so that you don't feel

1182
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,340
bad about telling your story?

1183
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,180
- No, I don't.

1184
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,820
- Why are you getting so defensive, Rex?

1185
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,980
You're acting like it's so crazy

1186
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,140
that you might beef with an animal.

1187
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,940
- Why would I beef with an animal?

1188
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,300
- Because you broke, but you stopped being vegetarian,

1189
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,180
for one, and I'm sure, by the way,

1190
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,100
when I stopped being vegetarian, animals started noticing.

1191
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,060
- Did they?

1192
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,540
- Animals started treating me differently.

1193
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,360
I will say that.

1194
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,580
I was vegan until I was 17 years old,

1195
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,980
as soon as I stopped, animals started treating me worse.

1196
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,220
Strangers, stranger animals, strange animals,

1197
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,620
different animals, really weird animals.

1198
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,620
You were a predator.

1199
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,580
Pigeons stopped looking at me, started shitting on my face.

1200
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:59,420
Dogs, any time that I would go to another person's house when I was vegan, dogs were attracted

1201
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,620
to me like I was made out of fucking beef jerky, right?

1202
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,860
Which might have had something to do with my sweat condition.

1203
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,780
But they loved me.

1204
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,540
And I knew that it was because they didn't eat me.

1205
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,420
Cows, when I would drive down the road in a cow, in like a farmland area, cows would

1206
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,420
look right at me, make direct eye contact.

1207
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,700
And then when I stopped being vegan, it all went away.

1208
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,500
So I think you're probably experiencing a similar thing.

1209
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:31,560
So the beef that I've been embroiled with, it's been with, funny you say pigeons because

1210
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
it's been with pigeons.

1211
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,340
You guys have pigeons in Mexico?

1212
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:40,460
My entire adulthood I've been having a really tense relationship with pigeons because in

1213
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,500
my old house, where I used to park my car, there was like, you

1214
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:49,460
know, there's like, there were just shit on my car all the time.

1215
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,740
Yeah, because they sit on top of it shit in it. And I was like,

1216
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,220
pretty pissed was like, Oh, I'm like parking on the street.

1217
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,940
Something nothing much I can do. But ever since I moved into this

1218
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:04,380
apartment, I noticed that the past people who lived here, the

1219
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,800
left a grill with like a cover on it. And as soon as I took the

1220
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,640
cover of, there was like a nest inside of it and there was a

1221
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,600
pigeon there. So I was like, all right, I want to just take just

1222
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,400
throw the shit away.

1223
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,120
Whoa,

1224
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,920
the pigeon will know the pigeon will know this is not a this is

1225
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,280
not welcoming space for my kind.

1226
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:21,920
Leave a note.

1227
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,600
Wait, that is not how by the way, that is not what you're

1228
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,480
supposed to do with a bird's nest. You're supposed to not

1229
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,720
touch it because it's temporary. And they're gonna forget that

1230
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,240
they made it or something. I don't remember why you're not

1231
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,480
supposed to do that.

1232
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,320
I'm pretty sure that's wrong. Anyways, I threw it away. I was

1233
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,040
like, you know what, he they'll get the message they'll get that

1234
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,620
I'm racist against them and they will never come back. And I left

1235
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,400
it at that for a couple for a month or so. And I, I kind of

1236
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,660
noticed that they were like kind of flying in and out. And I was

1237
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,260
like, shoo him away if I ever saw him. If I ever caught him, I

1238
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,600
was like in the living room. But this past week, we noticed that

1239
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,700
there's in my balcony, there's like two like AC condensers,

1240
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,600
like just sitting by a corner, and behind one of them, that

1241
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,280
we're nesting again. And one night there were just a pigeon just hanging out on

1242
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,440
top of like the like just hanging out on the wall. I'm like, "Oh that's weird." And we

1243
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,520
saw the nest, we're like, "Oh that sucks." So that same day I bought my best

1244
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,080
friend Santiago. Santiago the owl. Some of you may know him. We don't like, I don't

1245
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,600
like Santiago. We already talked about this on the podcast. Yeah, we won't go into too much

1246
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,360
depth in it. So we could like just scare them so that they wouldn't hang out in

1247
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,860
here anymore. Um, and I put him

1248
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,460
down, and I thought he was doing

1249
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,740
his job. But I come in the next

1250
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,140
day, and there's a pigeon just

1251
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,660
sitting on the nest. And I'm

1252
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,540
trying to shoot away, but it

1253
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,500
just won't go away. I'm like,

1254
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,900
Joe, get out of here. Fuck,

1255
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,460
fuck off. And it's not gonna

1256
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,560
wait. And I'm like, All right,

1257
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,780
I'm gonna get the broom, and I'm

1258
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,340
gonna kill you. So I get the

1259
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,700
broom. And I try to like, like,

1260
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,420
just nudge it. So just flies

1261
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,460
away. And the fucking thing

1262
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,380
starts batting at it. It bats at

1263
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,140
the broom. And it was so violent

1264
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,020
towards me. And I'm like, you

1265
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,580
know what this this pigeon must be sitting on an egg and they're really

1266
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,480
defensive but I really don't want them to be here laying eggs in my fucking

1267
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,040
balcony so I googled and apparently they're they really hate pepper so I

1268
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,680
just like threw a bunch of pepper in the balcony and the thing left and sure

1269
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,940
enough there's a fucking there's a tiny little pigeon egg on the nest behind my

1270
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,620
AC unit.

1271
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,460
So I'm like, okay, this is that egg.

1272
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,500
You're a killer.

1273
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,260
With I am going to listen in the past.

1274
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:37,060
Every every episode, one of us has to wear the evil crown.

1275
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,740
Caleb was the evil guy when he when he shoved a finger up his ass.

1276
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,060
Rex was the evil guy.

1277
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,260
I mean, that was that was a little.

1278
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,860
Right. So you guys were judging.

1279
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,020
It was like taking the logic pill on the podcast.

1280
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,140
I'll be the evil guy this week.

1281
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:52,780
I threw away.

1282
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,940
- Don't pretend like those are comparable, man.

1283
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,900
You're in the life. - I'll be the evil guy.

1284
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,260
- You're literally a murderer.

1285
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,460
- I threw away the nest and the egg.

1286
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,300
- Oh my God. - And I was like,

1287
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,540
you guys need to get out of here.

1288
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,340
- You didn't even give it a chance.

1289
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,260
You didn't even, okay, here's what I'd do.

1290
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,700
If I'm in your situation.

1291
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,100
- They're gonna come grab it and take it away.

1292
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,340
They don't have any hands.

1293
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,100
- Hey, asshole, here's what you do.

1294
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,700
You pop it on your favorite chair

1295
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,540
and you hatch that puppy.

1296
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,460
- No.

1297
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,660
You sit on that. You should be sitting on it right now.

1298
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,500
And you warm it up.

1299
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,380
This is a strictly no pigeon household.

1300
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,980
I'm popping that egg and speaking of my ass,

1301
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,980
it's going directly in my ass and I'm making the most beautiful baby pigeon

1302
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,620
you've ever seen in your life. I cannot believe you.

1303
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,380
You did not go out and buy a $30,000 incubator.

1304
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,420
I did not even think about that. I thought about, I've been putting pepper,

1305
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,620
I've been putting pepper all over my balcony every single day.

1306
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,140
So they sniff it and they go away.

1307
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,380
-You should have put pepper on the end. -The amount of time you've spent doing this,

1308
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,020
you could have found a rehoming place that could take care of it.

1309
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:56,820
Absolutely.

1310
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,100
-Absolutely. -I am...

1311
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,140
-There's no such thing. -Genuinely...

1312
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,780
Genuinely, you're a bad person.

1313
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,620
-I don't care. -I have never...

1314
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,100
This is the first thing you've ever told me, and I'm like,

1315
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,460
"Is he a bad person?"

1316
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,900
I'm starting... It's not an evil crown.

1317
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,420
-Yeah. -It's a...

1318
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,900
You have an actual evil...

1319
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,060
And you're smiling as you tell us a story.

1320
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,980
-You're a soul-sucking pet. -You look crazy right now

1321
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,680
with the knowledge that you've killed a living thing.

1322
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,020
Not just killed it, you ripped its mother away from it

1323
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,380
and then you threw it in the trash,

1324
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,460
which is the most insulting way to kill it.

1325
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,540
- I warned them several times.

1326
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,940
- They don't speak Spanish.

1327
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,780
- I didn't say they didn't speak Spanish.

1328
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,660
- They speak English and you should too.

1329
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,900
(laughing)

1330
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,620
- My actions speak for me.

1331
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:46,500
- You were a cold, this is why--

1332
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,460
- I'm in disbelief.

1333
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,220
By the way, child of divorce.

1334
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,660
This is what that does to you.

1335
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,500
- It is.

1336
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,260
- If you are thinking about divorcing, look at this.

1337
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,300
Look at this fucking evil.

1338
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,500
You will end up with an evil Mexican fucking goblin.

1339
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,020
- Edgar-ass son.

1340
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,860
- Yeah.

1341
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,900
- Stop calling me Edgar.

1342
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,060
I don't have an Edgar Hecker.

1343
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,900
It's a moat.

1344
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,540
- I don't know who Edgar is.

1345
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,140
- It's a racist epithet.

1346
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,020
- A racist epithet?

1347
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:15,860
Edgar?

1348
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,680
- It is.

1349
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,880
some West Coast shit that I'm not privy to? It's like a Southern thing.

1350
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,400
It's some West Coast shit! It's kind of like a Southern thing.

1351
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,360
Because every Mexican guy in the South looks the same. Yeah. And they're named Edgar?

1352
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:35,920
Pretty much, yeah. Edgar is like a... I don't know if I can say that word. A white

1353
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:43,640
type of guy for like a Mexican type of guy. You know what I'm saying? No. I don't know.

1354
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,640
- A white guy who wants to be a black guy,

1355
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,880
the Mexican version of that is an Edgar.

1356
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,400
- Is an Edgar, oh, okay.

1357
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,080
- I'm kind of oversimplifying it.

1358
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,120
- Juvia's definitely an Edgar then.

1359
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,480
- I don't think I know what,

1360
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,720
I think we're thinking of two different things.

1361
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,920
- No, I'm thinking of the same thing,

1362
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,460
I'm just explaining it bad.

1363
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,820
- So like my brother is an Edgar?

1364
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,280
- If he was Mexican, yeah.

1365
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,720
- My older brother, oh, okay.

1366
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,120
- But you said it's about white guys

1367
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,760
who are pretending they're Mexican.

1368
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,840
- Yeah, you're doing the worst job of explaining this.

1369
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,880
- Oh, it's Mexican guys who pretend to be white.

1370
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,640
- I also don't think you know what this,

1371
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,380
I used to think that you knew what this meant, Rex,

1372
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,800
I don't think you know what it means anymore.

1373
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,280
- I know what it means.

1374
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,200
- No, you don't.

1375
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,920
- I know what it means.

1376
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,520
And I'm not looking it up right now

1377
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,680
to make sure I'm right before saying it.

1378
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,400
- No, you're stupid.

1379
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,680
- If you looked that up on my Google,

1380
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,440
you'd probably just get some Edgar Allen Poe shit

1381
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,560
'cause it would be basically tailored

1382
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,760
to my more poetic interests,

1383
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,040
because I don't really sit around

1384
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,320
doing racial stuff all day.

1385
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,320
- Here is the urban dictionary definition of an Edgar.

1386
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,300
- Okay.

1387
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,000
- And you will see that I am right.

1388
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,840
- Okay.

1389
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,640
- A middle high school Latina boy

1390
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,240
who typically wears Jordans, sags his pants,

1391
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,280
has a bowl cut or mushroom cut,

1392
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,680
and often says the N word.

1393
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,680
- Oh, a mushroom cut.

1394
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,520
- Yeah.

1395
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,120
- Is that what they call that?

1396
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:10,620
Yeah.

1397
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,020
Why are they doing that?

1398
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,820
That thing looks terrible, man.

1399
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,020
Uh, it just, they, they love it.

1400
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,820
They do love it.

1401
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,320
Why?

1402
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,280
I don't know.

1403
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:18,780
I don't know.

1404
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,740
There's something about that belt of like the Southern US and like all the way

1405
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,900
Northern Mexico, that's just like that.

1406
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,420
Everyone up there is like that.

1407
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,920
Yeah.

1408
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,020
So you have, there's Mexicans in Mexico who are doing that?

1409
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,740
What I'm trying to say is I'm one of the good ones.

1410
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,380
Wow.

1411
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,220
Wow.

1412
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,700
Hard to disagree with that.

1413
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,420
You're the only one I know.

1414
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,540
And I'm saying that is a Mexican version of the white guy

1415
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,380
who wants to be black.

1416
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,220
There's a word for it.

1417
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,040
- Oh, okay.

1418
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,640
- I don't know if you can say it.

1419
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,640
- You should say it.

1420
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,060
- I really don't think I should.

1421
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:54,900
- I think I don't know what you mean,

1422
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,820
and you should say it right now.

1423
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,720
- I should say it?

1424
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,580
- Oh, fuck.

1425
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,100
- Damn, yo, he got you.

1426
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,140
You soundboarded his diss.

1427
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,980
Yo.

1428
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,820
- Oh.

1429
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,380
(laughing)

1430
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,660
He said, "Shay it," and you went, "Badoom."

1431
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,540
- I really wish we had like a drumming, just build up.

1432
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,140
But yeah, you should say it right now.

1433
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:18,980
- No, no, no, no, no.

1434
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,420
- Yeah, I really would rather not.

1435
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,260
- No, that's okay.

1436
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,420
I didn't learn that you weren't allowed to say that

1437
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,580
until probably six weeks ago,

1438
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,500
so there's plenty of recorded times of me saying it.

1439
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,020
- Wait, you can't say it?

1440
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:29,940
It's illegal to say it?

1441
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,780
- You can't say it anymore.

1442
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,300
- You definitely can't say it.

1443
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,460
- Yeah, you can't say it anymore.

1444
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,460
Who says who?

1445
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:36,960
The board.

1446
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,960
I don't know. Who's in charge of that?

1447
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,460
The committee.

1448
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,460
Basically, basically 14 year olds are in charge of that.

1449
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,460
So whatever.

1450
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,960
That is kind of how the world works out.

1451
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,960
If a 14 year old says that you're not allowed to say it,

1452
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,460
you just can't say it anymore.

1453
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,460
Because one day they're going to be your boss.

1454
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:54,460
So just, it's better to just not touch it.

1455
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,460
Yeah. It's for the best.

1456
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:56,960
Yeah.

1457
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,460
Okay. Well.

1458
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,460
Do you have any topics, Rex?

1459
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,960
Or any animal beefs?

1460
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
Nope.

1461
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,960
My life has been quite boring.

1462
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,160
Yeah.

1463
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,460
Yeah.

1464
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,160
And way to go.

1465
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,160
It's funny that for you, man.

1466
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:14,640
To, in the last 10 minutes of the show, just bring up that you did animal cruelty.

1467
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,600
I think that was smart.

1468
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,500
That was smart.

1469
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,860
That really kept the energy going.

1470
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,840
And I'm not an Edgar.

1471
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,340
Yeah.

1472
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,260
So we're going to leave it at that.

1473
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,200
Welcome guys.

1474
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,120
Beers we drank another episode in the bag.

1475
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,760
How exciting is that?

1476
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,160
We'll catch you next week where hopefully.

1477
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,520
I got points for my topic.

1478
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:37,800
By the way, Jubio, I would like to say really quickly that torturing animals is early signs of psychopathy and serial killing tendencies.

1479
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,300
I didn't torture it.

1480
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,300
You put it in the trash.

1481
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,300
You put peppers around it because you found out I hated it.

1482
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,300
Then let me put you in the trash if that's not torturing.

1483
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,300
You turned your balcony into Guantanamo Bay.

1484
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:49,800
Yeah.

1485
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,300
That's not how it works.

1486
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,300
You made a torture chamber. You pepper sprayed them. I heard you say that.

1487
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,300
No. I don't say pepper spray.

1488
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,300
You sprayed pepper all around my balcony.

1489
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,360
(laughing)

1490
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,340
- And then you put them in the trash.

1491
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,580
- It's a natural pigeon repellent.

1492
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,420
- No.

1493
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,240
- It repels them.

1494
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,340
- Yeah, you propelled it into the trash can.

1495
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,660
So I'm gonna stop recording right now

1496
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,860
because you're such a piece of shit.

1497
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,700
- Okay.

1498
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,200
(dog barking)
