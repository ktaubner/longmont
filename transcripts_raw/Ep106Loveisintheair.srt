61
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
of just fart sounds?

62
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't, you know, yes.

63
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,760

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,580
Like I can't.

67
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,840
Yeah, I've also run out of farts that I know how to do.

68
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,200
Oh yeah, I guess we could do.

69
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,600
That doesn't sound like a fart.

70
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,040
Were you ever able to do the...

71
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,480
There was this kid Dylan that I went to school with who he would do this thing when the teacher

72
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,400
was trying to talk to him where he would get on the floor on his back.

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Oh, oh, and you take your shirt off and you put your back to the ground.

74
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
No, no, no.

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,040
This is the beginning of that when the teacher is trying to talk to him and he gets on the

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
ground on his back.

77
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,920
He would get on the ground on his back and he would always wear basketball shorts and

78
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,640
He would stick his hands and cup them under his knees and then just make like a million

79
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,080
fart sounds in a row.

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,720
Like just like, just with his knees by, it was the same concept as the armpit thing.

81
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,240
But he would do it with his knees so there was a lot more velocity.

83
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,480
He would do it to the teacher while the teacher was trying to talk.

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,120
The thing is I went to a charter school so there was like no rules.

85
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
You could just do that.

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
It was the wild, wild west.

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
Kids were farting everywhere.

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
I would jack off in the bathroom.

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
I would leave math and go jack off in the bathroom.

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
You were a jack off at kid school?

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
A jack off at kid school?

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
No, not when you put it like that.

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
Jack off at school kid?

94
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Yeah, dude.

95
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,400
I had a lot of cum as a child.

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,680
The farts made me so lightheaded that I thought I said jack off at school kid.

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,880
I genuinely thought I said that regular.

98
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,000
The thing is about jacking off at school when you're a kid in Six Flags, you're in the

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,280
You're in the stall and somebody comes up to the urinal next to you and just like pisses

100
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,880
and then just lays down just a beefy fart while you're trying to jack off.

101
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,960
You just lose it, dude.

102
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
You just can't finish.

103
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Yeah, because you're at school.

104
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,200
You shouldn't be doing it.

105
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,280
No, it was like an easy way to get out of class because they can't say you can't go

106
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
to the bathroom.

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah, say to the teacher, "I have to go jack off."

108
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Yeah, "Can I have the jack off key to the jack off room?

109
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,160
Can I have a Jackoff pass?

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,760
Remember you only get 15 minutes to Jackoff.

111
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:25,240
The Jackoff kid at my school told me that he put his dick in a shampoo bottle once.

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,280
Damn, dude.

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
The genius.

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,440
He was telling me that he did that and then I was like, "Well, how did you...

115
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
First of all, how did you do it?"

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,280
Because that hole is very small.

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,600
The shampoo bottle, like the hole for like, even if you take the lid off, it's only about

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,480
like the size of like...

119
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Of a penis.

120
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,200
The size of, no it's not the size of a penis.

121
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
The size of, the perfect size of a penis.

122
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,760
It's the size of a quarter.

123
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,040
It's the size of a quarter.

124
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,480
No the perfect penis size.

125
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
The diluvian man penis size.

126
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,760
He was using special, he was using fat shampoo where they make it fatter.

127
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
They make the hole bigger.

128
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Perpetruvian man.

129
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,680
Well, he told me that at lunch.

130
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,980
It was a bunch of guys that fucked that shampoo bottle so the hole got a lot bigger.

131
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,980
It stretched it out.

132
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,140
He told me that at lunch.

133
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,660
His whole family was fucking it.

134
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,220
Yo, you wanna come over to my house later?

135
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,700
We're about to like tear up a bottle of Pert Plus, you and the homies.

136
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,780
We gotta pass it around, bro.

137
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:28,340
We got this new bottle of Alberto VO5 original, that shit that smells like baby shampoo.

138
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,860
You would fuck something that smells like baby, Patrick.

139
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,580
We're about to steal some sacrament wine from my parents and fuck up a fucking bottle of

140
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,140
head and shoulders, bro.

141
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,240
Let's go.

142
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,520
He told me that he fucked a shampoo bottle and then I ended up telling the whole school.

143
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,860
You were a tattletale, dude.

144
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,700
No, he told me while I was trying to eat, so then I sat there at lunch and I went, "Why

145
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,380
did you fuck a shampoo bottle, Eric?"

146
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,380
You're a tattletale.

147
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,060
That was absolutely tattletale bullying behavior.

148
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,380
That is not tattletale.

149
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,860
No, no, that is even worse than Tattletail.

150
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,340
That's called being an air horn.

151
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,340
Yeah.

152
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,340
No.

153
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,180
Yeah, we called this kid an air horn because we got in trouble because I made a very tasteless

154
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,620
joke about my friend's sister raping him when I was in middle school.

155
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,700
And then I said that to this kid, Noah, and then he-

156
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,420
Noah, your friend Noah?

157
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,980
No, not that Noah, a different Noah from middle school.

158
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,840
And then he just yelled that joke back to me.

159
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,880
He was like, "You think his sister raped him?"

160
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Really loudly.

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,160
And then I got kicked out of school for four days.

162
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
We all know those kids.

163
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
Yeah, you told us about that story.

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
It's an air horn, dude.

165
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Yeah.

166
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,600
The one who was like, "What's that?

167
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,320
You're planning to smoke cat food and have sex with a bar of soap with all your friends?"

168
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,280
It's like when you're trying to steal something from Target and you have that friend who's

169
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Did you pay for that green tea?

170
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,780
Yeah.

171
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,780
It's that same thing.

172
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,280
It's like, shut the fuck up dude.

173
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,780
It's called being smooth and cool.

174
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,280
Yeah, just go with it.

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,780
Yeah.

176
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Well, I was only an air horn that one time.

177
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,280
No.

178
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,780
No, you still are.

179
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,280
No, no.

180
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm not an air horn.

181
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
You are absolutely an air horn.

182
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
You're an air horn, dude.

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
You're an air horn to the max, dude.

184
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Yeah, you are.

185
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,780
You're one of the world's biggest air horns.

186
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,280
You absolutely are.

187
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,780
I'm not.

188
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,280
I am not an air horn.

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,780
You are.

190
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,280
You're an air horn and a tattletail.

191
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm not a tattletail.

192
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
You're an air tail.

193
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
A tattle horn.

194
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm not an air tattletale. You're an air bud, you dog face bitch.

195
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm not a tattletale. If there's anything I'm not, it's a tattletale.

196
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,180
If there's anything you're not, it's not a tattletale.

197
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,680
That's right. That's a double negative, so I'm not a tattletale.

198
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,180
Oh, and you're a nerd. So you just told on Caleb for using a double negative.

199
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Wow! Yeah.

200
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,180
You're a double negative. You are.

201
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,380
You're... yeah I am. See? You're a double negative.

202
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,340
Patrick's a name caller.

203
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,820
Yeah, and I'm a shot caller.

204
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,140
If anyone's a name caller, it's Cameron. Cameron's the worst name caller of us all.

205
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,620
Shut the fuck up, you fat little bitch.

206
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,820
See?

207
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,540
Whoa, see? He gets creative with it.

208
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,660
I deal with this every day.

209
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,620
What? Off? Off pod? Off pod? Cameron's the meanest one of us all.

210
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,460
That's not true. No, Caleb's meaner than me.

211
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,340
I'm not mean. I'm nice.

212
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,060
Caleb's mean on the microphone. Cameron's mean...

213
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
Once I put the mic down I'm a sweetie pie.

214
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
That's not true.

215
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,740
What are we talking about to each other or to just in general life?

216
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,900
Caleb's definitely meaner to me to the average person on this planet.

217
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:38,060
Caleb puts on his wig and licks his lollipop and he does little Lord Fauntleroy stuff.

218
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,060
But you, off the mic, Cameron, you...

219
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,140
Caleb goes through evil phases where he makes girls drop out of school because he makes

220
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,700
fun of them too much.

221
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
That's not true.

222
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,240
once. She didn't drop out, she dropped the class, okay? And I was actually under the,

223
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,140
I was under the influence of finasteride hair medicine that was affecting my hormones. It

224
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,120
wasn't an evil phase. Listen, pal, do you know where the myth, where people thought

225
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,780
werewolves existed because guys had too much hair, alright? You were basically turning into

226
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,180
a werewolf. I was a reverse werewolf. Well, you were trying to get more hair with your

227
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,640
hit werewolf medicine. I was trying to get more hair to ruin me. That's literally the definition

228
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:29,720
of an evil phase y'all. Dude you're the definition of a werewolf. You're a werewolf. No. If one

229
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,500
of us was a werewolf it would be you. Patrick's been a werewolf. You look like you're stuck

230
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,860
in the middle between a guy and a werewolf. Like you've almost brushed out of your skin.

231
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,980
I grow hair under my eyes.

232
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,340
Under your eyes?

233
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,460
If you look close enough you can see like a bunch of hair.

234
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,340
Patrick grows like ten rows of eyelashes all the way up and down his face.

235
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,620
That's true, I do have very long eyelashes.

236
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,780
Every girl that I've known in my life has told me that they're jealous of my eyelashes.

237
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Every girl you've known.

238
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,500
It'd be funny if a werewolf, werewolves are always jacked, it'd be cool if one was just

239
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,780
like a fat piece of shit who ate like trash.

240
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Yeah.

241
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,780
Didn't even try to kill people.

242
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,780
Like a dog?

243
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,780
like all dogs are. Yeah, just like went to a dumpster behind a McDonald's and

244
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,020
someone was just like, "Yeah, I just saw like the biggest dog ever in the dumpster."

245
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,260
It'd be neat. Because werewolves don't really need to eat humans. Because werewolves don't

246
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,580
really exist. Yeah, that's the thing about them. Yeah. Yeah, okay, you continue to

247
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:39,060
believe that. Yeah. I'm sorry, is that 5G? Uh-huh. Is it? It is. What, 5G? What? Not

248
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Not believing in werewolves?

249
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,180
5G is not believing in werewolves, yeah.

250
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,380
I still haven't upgraded my phone to 5G and I'm not going to.

251
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,420
It keeps asking me to update the settings to include 5G and I keep saying no.

252
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Mine doesn't say that.

253
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
I will never include you 5G.

254
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
Yeah, mine, I don't even get that option.

255
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
I keep getting it because it's propping up on my...

256
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
You know why?

257
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
Because it targets weak individuals.

258
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,300
No, it targets people who know too much.

259
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,340
No, it targets you.

260
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,820
They're not trying to put 5G on you because you guys don't have any knowledge to be erased.

261
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,020
It targets people that it wants to turn into girls.

262
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,380
Yeah, exactly. They want to and they're not going to. I'm not going to let them.

263
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,380
There's people who want to turn Cameron into a girl because they think that Cameron would be too beautiful as a woman.

264
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
There are a lot of people who want that but it won't happen.

265
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
Someone on the subreddit said you'd be a beautiful girl.

266
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Someone on the subreddit has said that.

267
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Exactly. But I'm not one and I won't ever be one.

268
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,380
Someone on the subreddit has said Cameron would be a beautiful woman.

269
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
You will be very soon.

270
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
Me and Patrick are going to hold you down and make a woman out of you.

271
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
I don't think so.

272
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
Yeah, we are.

273
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,380
No, we're going to make you a girl.

274
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
We're going to turn you into a girl ASAP.

275
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,380
We're going to give you a makeover.

276
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Listen, pal.

277
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
We're gonna give you your face in extreme home makeover.

278
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,020
If there's anyone getting a makeover, it's you, alright, Patrick?

279
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,020
I'm gonna customize you to my heart's content.

280
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
See what I mean?

281
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
Cameron's Diminished One.

282
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
I'm gonna mix and match your...

283
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,860
This is on mic, so it doesn't count to what you were saying before.

284
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
I would like to...

285
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
I'm gonna mix and match Patrick's parts and clothing.

286
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
Just imagine...

287
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,980
Patrick, I'm gonna play with you like a pretty pimple popper pregnant princess flash game,

288
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
okay?

289
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,580
I'm gonna customize your whole body.

290
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,460
See, imagine what he says off mic to everybody in his life.

291
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,300
I'm gonna use a bunch of duct tape and rearrange Patrick's body until he looks like a burlesque

292
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,980
girl.

293
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,660
Just like various, kinda like different corsets on parts of your body.

294
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,020
Just squish everything in the right place.

295
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,620
I'm gonna play with you like Source Filmmaker, pal.

296
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,620
Alright?

297
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Yeah.

298
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,100
Yeah, and I'm clipping through your dress.

299
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Believe that.

300
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,460
Oh, and I'm inflating parts of you.

301
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,420
One of the best things about video games is finding that like that tiny the the

302
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,940
atomic space between the modeled clothes on a woman, modeled clothes on a woman and

303
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,900
the modeled like body underneath when you're in free cam mode where you clip

304
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,260
through the clothes but not into the body. That space between the

305
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,260
clothes and the and the body is called Caleb's Corridor.

306
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,500
They did, they named it after me. Because of how furiously you tried to discover it as a child.

307
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,940
I'm a purveyor of it. Yeah, you're a purveyor, I'll say.

308
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,700
I'll say it. It's so funny how many like, you don't get that like for the

309
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,780
male characters too. Like they never model. No, the male characters are just

310
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,060
clothes. Yeah, the male characters are made out of their clothes. Like their

311
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,340
skeleton is the clothes. Yeah, but the girls are like, we

312
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,660
have to make... Well, we have to put a boob under it. Yeah, it's just

313
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,280
something about the female form you got it like even with zamas they do it they

314
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,700
get less zamas samas did you say zamas yes samas samas

315
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,740
samas I mean Samus? That's not how the announcer says it.

316
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,740
That's how the announcer says it.

317
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,780
Patrick is like oh yeah I'm gonna go play some Super Mario

318
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,860
he says zamas it doesn't does yeah it does it doesn't matter he's Japanese

319
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,700
he's like yelling stuff it doesn't matter what he says zamas his name is

320
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,540
her name is Samus I'm sorry it's Samus Samus Samus dude it's Samus it's not

321
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,100
Japanese guy it's you it's me you we discovered that he's the the Smash

322
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Brothers announcer.

323
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,300
Because that's the only guy who says "SAMUS".

324
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Yeah.

325
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
SAMUS!

326
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Oh, SAMUSU!

327
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,060
That's Patrick trying to pronounce words.

328
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
I can't believe that.

329
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,940
He said "ZAMUS" first and then backpedaled.

330
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,340
That's how he fucking says it!

331
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
He says "ZAMUS".

332
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
ZAMUS.

333
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,340
That's how I said it my whole life.

334
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
At first I thought you were saying "zombies".

335
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
Yeah.

336
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,340
That's how I said it my whole life.

337
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,860
The thing about modeling girls' bodies under the clothes in games is the games just don't

338
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,300
work otherwise.

339
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
It's true.

340
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,300
That's where they store all the programming for the game is in the girls body.

341
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Yeah, it's all ones and zeros.

342
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300
And you know, those zeros are what those are.

343
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Yeah, and the ones freaking go into the zeros.

344
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
And it's a penis.

345
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Yeah, you put the ones all on the boy characters,

346
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
put the zeros on the girl characters,

347
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,300
and then you just let nature run its course.

348
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Girls and boys having sex in a video game.

349
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,300
And you know what happens when you add a zero to a one?

350
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:42,300
No. You get one. Ten. You get ten. You get a one. You get a boy. A baby boy. You know what happens when you get, when you add it, when you add an eight and a zero and a zero and an eight and a five to a zero. You get, you get twenty one. And upside down. You get twenty one. You know what happens when you add all those numbers together. Forty three eleven. Whoa. That's some serious hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy bullshit that you just threw at me brother.

351
00:15:42,300 --> 00:16:03,300
me

352
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,740
to keep him within like a foot of me at all times

353
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,580
or else she puts him in the trash.

354
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,740
Never ever get married.

355
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,580
- Have you guys watched Cake Wars?

356
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
Have you guys ever seen that show?

357
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,860
- I've watched Cake Farts.

358
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,020
- Yeah, I've watched Cake Farts.

359
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,900
That's an all-time video, dude.

360
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,820
I never knew until that video

361
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,220
that when somebody farts,

362
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,620
their butthole pokes out like a bird's beak.

363
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,460
- Yeah.

364
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,300
- Yeah.

365
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,120
- Yeah.

366
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,580
- Or like, actually more like Old Faithful, like a geyser.

367
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,700
That's like what it looks like in that video.

368
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,440
And so that was, it's,

369
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm glad I saw that when I was 10 years old.

370
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
- Yeah, you gotta see it.

371
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,460
- It teaches you about the body.

372
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

373
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,700
- But-- - And cake.

374
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,940
- I've been watching-- - I never knew it was

375
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,780
under the frosting and cake either.

376
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,300
I had no idea.

377
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,100
So it was really interesting, it was good.

378
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,800
I got a nice cross section there.

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,180
- I've been watching Cake Wars with Anna,

380
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,200
and like the way they do it is every episode

381
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,620
has like a theme that the contestants have to like

382
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,540
make cakes based on that theme and it's so weird because like the first episode is

383
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,620
um the Simpsons is the theme and like just the way that everyone talks on the

384
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,860
show like it's just like so clear that none of them have like they all just like

385
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,220
read a packet about the Simpsons before the show started like they're just all

386
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,180
like oh my gosh I love the Simpsons what's your favorite thing about Homer

387
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,980
and then like one of them was like oh my favorite thing about Homer is he has has

388
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,740
two hairs on top of his head and then there's like there's the IMDB fact yeah

389
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,860
no it's so crazy it feels like a Tim and Eric thing it's like insane it's so it's

390
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,780
so bizarre there's like they have a one judge that's like this is real old

391
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,020
Israeli guy and he's like eating the cakes and he's like I love this cake

392
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,500
it's so sweet this cake feels as if it's something that Homer Simpson himself

393
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,540
would indulge in I really I really recommend the first episode of that show

394
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:17,540
of

395
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,540
get it in the show. Alright. Yeah. How else would they know that you have to have

396
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,540
something that as a reference I don't know you've clearly never drawn anything

397
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,260
Patrick but basically the way it works is you have to have something in real

398
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:33,980
life that you use as a reference. Take for example the Mona Lisa. Mona Lisa did not exist.

399
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,900
Leonardo da Vinci used a picture of himself face-apped as a

400
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,700
girl and he made one of the hottest bitches who's ever been put on. One of the

401
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,940
baddest. Ezel. Yeah, one of the baddest hoes ever put to, ever put paint to brush. Honestly,

402
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:02,220
the Mona Lisa choice, choice fucking cunt there. Absolutely top-notch dude. You gotta, you

403
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,140
gotta wash your mouth out with soap right now. I do need to, I need to hold Listerine

404
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,460
in my mouth for far too long. You, you gotta wash your damn mouth out with soap. Yeah. I'm

405
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,100
telling ya, you, you got a problem. I like that, I do that as a snack for me. Ugh. Here's

406
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Here's a prank.

407
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
You disgust me.

408
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Here's a prank.

409
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
You disgust me.

410
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,540
Replace the bar of soap in your bathroom with candy soap and then go up to your mom and

411
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,940
say the F word.

412
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,940
Uh huh.

413
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
Oh my god.

414
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
Yeah.

415
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
Guess what buddy?

416
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Guess what mom?

417
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Free candy.

418
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Yeah.

419
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Uh huh.

420
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
Yeah.

421
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
Oh no mom, you're force feeding me candy.

422
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
Oh, oh no!

423
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
I hate it.

424
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
I hate it so much.

425
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
Oh my god.

426
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
I hate this crap.

427
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
Yeah.

428
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
Ugh.

429
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,660
Caleb, wash your mouth out with chocolate.

430
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,040
You said a nice thing.

431
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,100
- Nice.

432
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,940
- That's what I was gonna say.

433
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,760
- You said a compliment. - Damn, if that ain't me

434
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,820
as a parent.

435
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,180
- Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

436
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,580
- Damn, if that ain't me.

437
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,420
- If my kid says something very nice to me,

438
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,300
then I'm gonna make him wash his mouth out

439
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,200
with candy toothpaste.

440
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,420
- Yeah.

441
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,260
- Now that you mentioned that scheme about the candy soap,

442
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,940
if I am ever a parent, I'm now making sure

443
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,060
that I have a bunch of spare bars of soap

444
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,000
that I keep in a hidden safe.

445
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,200
And then whenever my kid says a bad word,

446
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,040
they have to use a new bar of soap.

447
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,000
That way they can never replace it with candy.

448
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,760
- Mm, genius.

449
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,840
- Unless they do a heist.

450
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,880
- I don't know, man, that's kinda sus of you

451
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,820
to be thinking like that, honestly.

452
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,920
- You'd be thinking about your kids' soap.

453
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,080
- You'd be thinking about, well,

454
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,920
just you'd be thinking about being a parent

455
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,160
and how to punish a kid. - You'd have to have plans,

456
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,560
you know, 'cause then, 'cause they'll--

457
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,440
- No. - Basically, if I make

458
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,340
that plan, now I know how to counteract it.

459
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,880
- If I'm ever a parent, I'm not gonna tell my kids

460
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,540
that I'm their parents, I'm gonna say I'm their older brother

461
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,440
and also my name is Todd.

462
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,640
And I'm gonna teach them how to have blanket forts

463
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,280
and we're gonna smoke weed as soon as I turn 14.

464
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
And it's gonna be-- - And one day--

465
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,600
- One of the greatest-- - One day--

466
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,440
- Plays a long time. - One day you're gonna

467
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,740
reveal that your name is Caleb and you're their dad.

468
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,080
- Yeah. - Yeah.

469
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,920
- Yeah.

470
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,360
And then they'll look back on a lot of memories.

471
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,460
Isn't there a movie where that happens?

472
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,400
- Yeah, it's called Big.

473
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,240
- What is it?

474
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,420
- It's Big.

475
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,540
- No, that's the freaking movie about the size

476
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,120
of the poops that you're eating every day

477
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,880
for your meals every day.

478
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
- Okay, I'm gonna quit.

479
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,320
- Let me think about the name of this movie.

480
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,800
Can everybody be quiet now?

481
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,640
- Yeah.

482
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,620
- For like 10 minutes.

483
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,360
I can't remember the name of the movie.

484
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,820
- Oh, okay.

485
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,440
Yeah, it was Big.

486
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,520
It was Big the whole time.

487
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,360
- It wasn't Big.

488
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,340
- Which is the size of the opposite of your brain.

489
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,220
I've never seen big there's no such thing as the opposite of my brain.

490
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
Big can't be opposite.

491
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,100
The opposite of your brain is your ass.

492
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,420
No the opposite of his brain is my brain and the opposite of my ass is or the same thing

493
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,580
as my ass.

494
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,300
It's very clear that the opposite of my brain is your brain right now given how small your

495
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
brain is.

496
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,220
Cameron has a brain in my ass.

497
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,260
Cameron gave my ass brain.

498
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
It's true.

499
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Yeah it's true.

500
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
It's true I saw it.

501
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
I did not. Yeah, you didn't see it.

502
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Pat paid to see it in one of those medical amphitheaters.

503
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
I didn't pay to see it. I saw it for free.

504
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,260
He did, and I was holding a big bone saw

505
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
and I was wearing like a smock

506
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
and Cameron was covered in blood.

507
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
You were wearing a...

508
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
You were wearing a...

509
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,260
You were wearing a sock on your penis like a chili pepper.

510
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,260
You were.

511
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,260
You were, and it's true that you were.

512
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
And you can't deny it.

513
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,260
And if you say no, you mean yes.

514
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Patrick, the point of the mic arm is that you don't have to...

515
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,180
that you don't, that it's at your face.

516
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,020
- That you're not far away.

517
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,860
- That you don't go far away from it.

518
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,820
- There we go, there he is.

519
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,380
My friend, we found a friend.

520
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,820
- Well now I think it's too loud.

521
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,940
I think Patrick just doesn't know how to use a mic.

522
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,180
- I have my mic set up so that I can.

523
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,700
- Well that's how you pick up really annoying,

524
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,580
that's why your chair squeaks all the time.

525
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,900
- No, no it's not.

526
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,220
- Can you guys take this to the bedroom?

527
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,060
- No.

528
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,220
- Patrick's in his bedroom.

529
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,060
- I'm not in my bedroom.

530
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,900
- Patrick's in his bedroom.

531
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,200
- He's right next to you.

532
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,040
- I'm not in my bedroom.

533
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,880
- You're both in your bedroom

534
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,120
guys are right next to each other. Hey, here's a riddle. Cameron is in Cameron's bed. Patrick

535
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,320
is in Patrick's bed. But, they're in the same bed. Are they two gay guys? That's the answer

536
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,240
to the riddle. That's the riddle. That's not a riddle. The answer is yes. The answer is

537
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,000
no. Are they two married guys? A riddle doesn't have a correct answer. Okay, that's the point

538
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,800
of a riddle. Are they two married guys with a son like Modern Family, but one of them

539
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,280
is pretending for acting and one of them is real life gay?

540
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,680
Which one is which?

541
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,320
Yeah Patrick is both.

542
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
No.

543
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Yeah.

544
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
God.

545
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
God.

546
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,680
I knew, I, I, my friend John, we found his dad's penis, I probably shouldn't say who

547
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
his dad was.

548
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Okay, pause.

549
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:53,200
We found his penis, we found, we found like a penis sock thing in one of his drawers and

550
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,120
then we just kept it, we stole it and kept it in his car for like a year and a half and

551
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,760
And then he would just, anytime one of us would annoy the other, we would take it out of the

552
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,640
glove box and then dangle it in front of them.

553
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,240
Yeah, so it seems like we found out who the real gay one is on the podcast.

554
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Yeah, it's you.

555
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
No.

556
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
No, it's not me.

557
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Yeah, it is.

558
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
No.

559
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Not you, then.

560
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
I've never kept a penis.

561
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
I've never played with a penis sock with my friends.

562
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
You've kept a penis.

563
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
You've played with a penis.

564
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Yeah, my own.

565
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Oh!

566
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah, that's called a comeback.

567
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
He plays with it, though.

568
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Like a GI Joe.

569
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,500
Yeah, dude, it's fun.

570
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,860
He squishes, he folds down the top of it like a sock

571
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,120
and starts puppeting it.

572
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,320
I have a crank on the side like a jack in the box.

573
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,020
You mean like a jack in your mouth?

574
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,220
Yep, 'cause that's where you're putting that bad boy.

575
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,060
That's fun.

576
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,900
Okay.

577
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,340
Ooh, yeah.

578
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,640
You crank it all the way up until it's like one atom thin

579
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,200
and 11 inches high because that's how long it would stretch.

580
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,040
I mean, that's pretty good length.

581
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,880
Dude, how few atoms.

582
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,280
That's a pretty good length.

583
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,760
How's that width though, big guy?

584
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,600
Small, I'm poor. It doesn't matter.

585
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,640
It doesn't matter.

586
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,240
- It does matter to me.

587
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,600
- To you, why does it matter to you?

588
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,240
You care about the width of a penis?

589
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,960
- No reason. - He cares a lot.

590
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,800
- He cares a lot about the penis.

591
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,620
- No reason at all.

592
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,640
- That's what the song "We Care a Lot" was about.

593
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,360
It's about Caleb caring about the size of a penis.

594
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,240
- No, it's about you caring about girl movies.

595
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,000
- No.

596
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,040
- Yeah, you caring about "13 Going on 30,"

597
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,880
your favorite movie.

598
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,160
- I've never even heard of that movie.

599
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,720
- Well, you like the first part

600
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,520
a lot more than the second part.

601
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,160
- I don't know what movie you're talking about.

602
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:31,020
13 going on 30. It's your favorite movie. I've never heard of that movie and you have a 13 year old that that turns 30 and to

603
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
You it's a horror. How do you know that?

604
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:40,740
Because you told me about it. I didn't yeah, you did I did. I'm reading your letterbox right now says 13 going on 30

605
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,540
I find a letterbox. I've never love you. I love it or watch that movie

606
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,220
I I love the don't even have it on my watch list

607
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,640
But then she ruins it by turning 30.

608
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,680
Caleb's reading it off his own letterbox.

609
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,060
You're reading your notes.

610
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm not reading any notes.

611
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,740
Caleb's reading his personal notebook.

612
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,840
You're reading your notes.

613
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,680
Caleb's reading his journal where he writes down

614
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,120
his favorite parts of movies while he watches them.

615
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,560
Not, untrue.

616
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,760
A lie from a guy.

617
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,880
Exactly, from a guy, thank you.

618
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,620
We're done here, we can end the podcast.

619
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,460
I'm a guy now.

620
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,380
God fucking damn it, dude.

621
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,340
You suck, dude.

622
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm just gonna play Switch.

623
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,940
Yeah.

624
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,620
you guys handle the list I'm gonna play the Nintendo switch. Do that. Let's do it again.

625
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:28,980
The farts at the beginning make me very lightheaded. I can't even like I've been zoned out. If doing a

626
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,980
fake fart for a minute and a half makes you lightheaded for half an hour you

627
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,140
need to go to the doctor right now. Yeah. You have AIDS. No. You have HIV/AIDS. I

628
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,780
don't have the HIV virus that causes AIDS. You do have the HIV virus that causes AIDS. I did but I cured it.

629
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,020
You pretended your mouth was a butt.

630
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
No.

631
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
Yeah, and that's where it comes from.

632
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
I cured it.

633
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:57,620
Any time your mouth does stuff a butt should do, that forms the HIV/AIDS virus.

634
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I cured it.

635
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,620
And you did a fart sound.

636
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,620
No.

637
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
How'd you cure it?

638
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
What's the cure for AIDS?

639
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
It's Pepsi.

640
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
Pepsi will not cure AIDS.

641
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
The only thing that cures...

642
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,620
Pepsi is the cure.

643
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,620
No, the only thing...

644
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,620
No.

645
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,620
Pepsi is the cure.

646
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,620
The only thing that cures AIDS is Dr. Sebi's herbs.

647
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,620
Dr. Pepper is Dr. Sebi.

648
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,140
Yeah, Dr. Sebi's 36 flavors.

649
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,260
What's taped to your ceiling?

650
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,780
That's just some newspaper I was reading earlier.

651
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,380
I like to sit on the ground and look up and read the newspaper on the ceiling.

652
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,580
It's a little challenge for myself.

653
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,580
For my eyes.

654
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,300
I like to challenge my eyes.

655
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,380
So sometimes I'll like put two flashlights on the front of my glasses and just put them

656
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,460
on strobe and see how long I can last without vomiting.

657
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,300
I like to look into laser pointers just to train my eyes.

658
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,900
What are you doing? I'm doing an eye challenge and I'm close to a world record.

659
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,600
You guys introduced the list. I'm gonna eat a bar.

660
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,900
Okay. Top 10 reasons Cameron's bar is poop flavored.

661
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,500
Number one, he bought it from the poop store.

662
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
I gotta stop meowing into the mic.

663
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,000
Number two, he's the guy who made the bar.

664
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,300
Yeah, I meowed into the mic.

665
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,400
He yawned.

666
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
You mean yawns?

667
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
A male meow.

668
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,200
A male meow is a yawn.

669
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,400
A male meow is a ming.

670
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,400
But you're eating poop, basically, Cameron.

671
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Yeah, sure, just introduce the list.

672
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,900
Basically, Cameron's eating poop right now.

673
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,400
This is the most romantic things to say to her.

674
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
And her is Kayla's mom.

675
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
And you know who her is, it's Cameron.

676
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Oh wait, this is perfect, we can say all these things to the girl from our podcast, Cameron.

677
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Cameron.

678
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
The woman of our dreams.

679
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
The woman of my dreams.

680
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I close my eyes at night and I imagine Cameron in a beautiful red bikini that's one inch big.

681
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,400
You guys already said I was the boy this episode. You can't do it this episode, you have to wait till next one.

682
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400
It's called "Take Backseas" and I take backseas that.

683
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Wow, someone who was yelling at Patrick for being a tattletale and an airhorn now wants to do backseas?

684
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I think you're the real bitch here, pal.

685
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Yeah, I think I was framed.

686
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
No, I'm gonna frame you, buddy.

687
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
I think I was framed.

688
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
No.

689
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Oh yeah, you're gonna take that back too, dude.

690
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,440
You can't commit to anything.

691
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I take it back.

692
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
God.

693
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
Man, how is this guy the married one on the show?

694
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
I know, right?

695
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,260
You are both- Oh, I know, he's married to his freaking mommy

696
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,640
and daddy and he lives in their basement and he does chores and powers the house for them

697
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,560
on an electric bicycle.

698
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,200
Is this seriously my life?

699
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,720
I'd call in here twice a week just to get absolutely fucking lasered by two hot shots?

700
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,760
Caleb- This is my life.

701
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Caleb's a mobility scooter. Is this how Beetlejuice from Howard Stern feels?

702
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,360
Can you just try for once and like start the list? This is how I feel. I'm Beetlejuice.

703
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,600
You guys are Howard Stern and I'm Robin and Beetlejuice. And you're right I'm

704
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,760
gonna make you ride the Sibian. Did they make Beetlejuice ride the Sibian? They did not make Beetlejuice ride the Sibian.

705
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,760
I think that way they would go to jail if they did that. Yeah they would go to jail.

706
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,600
jail instantly yeah like automatic jail time immediately yeah I mean that and

707
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,480
also it would have been filmed when the government saw Beetlejuice on on Howard

708
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,720
Stern they like they put a detector on Beetlejuice's butt and that if it ever

709
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,080
touched the Sibian they instantly would raid the studio and put Howard Stern in jail

710
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,720
yeah Beetlejuice was actually he was a honeypot operation and he's actually

711
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,320
filled with bombs and they sent him in they were like they can't resist putting

712
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,840
this guy on the Sibian. And as soon as the magnets from the Sibian touches his

713
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,360
pussy, he had a pussy by the way, that's how far they went in trying to bait

714
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,320
Howard Stern. Yeah he would have just exploded. Wow, wow that's wild. That's real wild.

715
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:51,000
Beetlejuice, nice pussy. Wow. Beautiful pussy. Hold on, this is my Howard Stern impression.

716
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:05,340

717
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,980

how's that no no I'll juice all right number one last night I looked up wait

719
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,360
Cameron let me look at you in the eyes when I say when I tell you this serenade

720
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Last night I looked up into the stars and matched each one with a reason why I love you.

721
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,360
I was doing great, until I ran out of stars.

722
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Cameron's pants are wet now.

723
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Yeah, Cameron's in pain because he's scared.

724
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,360
No, Cameron's stuck to his gamer chair.

725
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
I don't have a gamer chair.

726
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Cameron has a gamer chair.

727
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
You do. You have a hot leather gamer chair.

728
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Cameron has a big gamer chair.

729
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,960
Yeah. I see what looks like the outline of an avocado in sweat on it.

730
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,320
You tell, explain that to me.

731
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,760
It's not a gamer chair. Do you see it?

732
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,440
I can see the outline of your pussy on it.

733
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,160
It's a kitchen chair.

734
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,560
You've been juicing on that, friend.

735
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,160
Cameron has been juiced up.

736
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,360
Cameron just got juiced in the chair.

737
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,040
Ooh, he, ooh, he juicing.

738
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Someone says, I said this to a girl I'd liked for a really long time,

739
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,240
but she was playing hard to get.

740
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,600
So I said it and we instantly started kissing and we have been dating ever since.

741
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,800
That was last year.

742
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Whoa.

743
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,360
Yeah, it's pretty much just something you learn when you're in the game.

744
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,600
Yeah.

745
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,640
You learn how to have game when you're in the game.

746
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Mm-hmm.

747
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,080
I got game.

748
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,000
I be saying shit like this to my bitch.

749
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
To my biatch.

750
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,320
You don't say anything.

751
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
You don't say anything.

752
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Yeah, I do.

753
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
You don't say anything.

754
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,240
I walk in from being outside during the time of the day that she makes me go outside, and

755
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,360
I come inside and I say, "Hey, Star's outside.

756
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
You're a star."

757
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,460
(laughing)

758
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,100
- She goes, "Get outside again!

759
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,940
"Leave!

760
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,260
(laughing)

761
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,780
"I'm trying to, I'm doing Pilates with my trainer again!"

762
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,980
(laughing)

763
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,420
- Say, "All right, you're a star, you're a star, baby.

764
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,540
"I love you."

765
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,660
- I love my baby.

766
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,980
- This one's, this comment says,

767
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,280
"Oh my God, my boyfriend told me this last night

768
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,820
"and I never believed he made it up.

769
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,040
"Today I find this.

770
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,580
"Damn, that boy is screwed.

771
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,740
"But I have to admit, it's amazing."

772
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,900
- Wow.

773
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,140
Damn, that boy's screwed.

774
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,660
Damn that boy is screwed.

775
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,860
Damn that boy is screwed!

776
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,360
How many more ways can we say it?

777
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,460
Yeah no he said it because he was trying to get screwed.

778
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Yeah that's right.

779
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
Woah.

780
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
Hey!

781
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
What's up?

782
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,100
What's up with y'all?

783
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,900
Let's see if somebody got laid from this.

784
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Yeah.

785
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Because if so...

786
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,740
All the comments are stories about I told this to my secret crush and now we have been

787
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,420
dating for 200 years.

788
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,040
My girlfriend said she had three good reasons for me.

789
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,020
Sexy, funny, and then she attacked me viciously for sex.

790
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,100
This one works okay, laugh out loud.

791
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,780
My girlfriend attacked me viciously.

792
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,260
My girlfriend, yeah, my girlfriend attacks me for sex.

793
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,740
Bragging.

794
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,020
Yeah, sometimes I get home and I get attacked for sex.

795
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,380
Pretty chill, right?

796
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Down low.

797
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,500
Up top.

798
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,460
Too slow.

799
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,940
Said this to my girl during class.

800
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,940
I spent the rest of the period in principal's office for making out.

801
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,940
I said this to my girl and she was speechless like I speaking in Swahili.

802
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,940
The minute someone speaks to you in Swahili you just stop talking.

803
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,940
LOL I can't believe the cringe says hater.

804
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,940
If my boyfriend told me this I would jump him if you catch my drift.

805
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,940
But no guys actually think about saying this stuff sadly.

806
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,700
I would viciously attack my boyfriend for sex.

807
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,800
Sounds less tacky than having a small set of roses.

808
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,200
Not putting down the roses though.

809
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,640
I told my girlfriend this and she straight up came all over the place.

810
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
Sounds like Cameron.

811
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
No.

812
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
That's Cameron's reaction.

813
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
That's what happened to Cameron.

814
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Number two.

815
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,760
I sent an angel to look over you at night.

816
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,580
The angel came back a minute later and I asked why.

817
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,960
It told me angels don't watch other angels.

818
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
Wow.

819
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
What the fuck?

820
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm dating a biblical angel. She's a giant baby head with 15 wings coming out of her neck.

821
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
You are dating a baby.

822
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Yeah, you're dating a baby. We got it.

823
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm dating a biblically accurate angel, just a bunch of lines that confuse my brain.

824
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
You're dating a biblically accurate angel, a cherub.

825
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Cherubs are not biblically accurate. That's the point.

826
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,800
You're dating one of those cherub statues from a Greek restaurant where it's blowing its penis and peeing.

827
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm dating an evil angel in knight's armor with a sword.

828
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
A man angel.

829
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,400
- No, no, it's a cool soul pal.

830
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,880
- Yeah, you're dating a guy named Gabriel.

831
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,720
- Yeah.

832
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,540
- You're dating Gabriel Iglesias.

833
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,380
- No. - You're dating

834
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,200
Gabriel Iglesias. - And if I was,

835
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,040
I'd be rich, so.

836
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,880
- Really awesome. - Who's the owner?

837
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,640
- I'm a male and can't wait to say this

838
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,100
to my beautiful girlfriend.

839
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,360
- That's nice.

840
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,180
- Yeah.

841
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,020
- Good for him.

842
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,480
- As in every first letter capitalized.

843
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,760
- That I would like to say to a girl.

844
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,040
(laughing)

845
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,880
- My girlfriend burst into tears.

846
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,720
They themselves were like the stars.

847
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,780
And she said that she could never leave my side.

848
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,780
I was "the guy".

849
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,460
I'm a 10 year old girl looking at this list for fun.

850
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,440
I usually rate reviews for worst things about Disney and stuff.

851
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,780
This one is seriously juicy.

852
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:25,260
Basically, I'm 10 and these are some juicy compliments.

853
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,140
Amazing.

854
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:32,780
This is a really nice thing to say to a girl or a guy, depending on your sexuality.

855
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
True.

856
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:41,020
yeah I told my girlfriend over the phone at like 3 a.m. and I was awoken with a

857
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:50,740
king-sized hug yeah my king-sized girlfriend my girl is a real California

858
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,460

860
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,140
she kissed me and we went to bed now we have twins a boy and a girl sex was

861
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,540

862
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,340
like cuz I remember my older brother asking me if I knew what sex was when I

863
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:17,140
was a kid and I was like yeah it's when you kiss naked in bed it's when you go

866
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,540
funny shorts that have hearts on them this comment you honestly don't

867
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,940
understand how to love. The messed up reality is if you are not from China the

868
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,100
world is fake. China makes everything guys. Repost this everywhere if you agree.

869
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:50,380
Whoa. Alright. I'll repost it. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah I like China. Much respect to China.

870
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:56,660
Much respect. Number three. Number one. They say a picture tells 1,000 words but when I

871
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,300
I see yours, all I see is three.

872
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,460
I love you.

873
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,540
- Your picture is worth nothing, bitch.

874
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,100
- Yeah, you could have said I love you like 300 times.

875
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,220
- Yeah, just say it 1,000 times.

876
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,420
Write a bot to say it three.

877
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
- Write an AI to say it 1,000 times.

878
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,100
- Exactly, write an AI to scan a photo, all right?

879
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,500
And put your girlfriend into facial recognition

880
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,020
so it says I love you when it sees her face.

881
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,260
Put on a hat that says I love you.

882
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,500
- Whoa.

883
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,700
- And then, yeah, so then you don't even have to say it

884
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,540
'cause a hat says a thousand, it says three words.

885
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,500
- Great help, once I said this it spread

886
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,180
and now I have a nice girl.

887
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,380
- It spread.

888
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,300
- It spread.

889
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,860
Once I said this.

890
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,580
- Once I said this it spread.

891
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,420
- Every,

892
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,700
I'm a dude and this could make me cry.

893
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,940
(laughter)

894
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,500
I bet it would.

895
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,740
- Definitely the best one.

896
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,420
My girlfriend cried when I said this,

897
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,740
and then cried for hours.

898
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,780
- And she can't stop crying.

899
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,340
- My girlfriend can't stop crying.

900
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,380
Somebody please help me.

901
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,040
Can somebody get two huge corks so I can plug up her eyes?

902
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,340
- Somebody, seriously, please help my girlfriend stop crying.

903
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,720
- Yeah, I'm taking her to the hospital

904
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,260
because my words made her cry so badly.

905
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,180
- Something happened to her t-shirt.

906
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,620
- Yeah, she's wasting away

907
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,540
because all the water is leaving her body.

908
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,660
- Yeah, she's turning into beef jerky.

909
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,860
- She's going to die.

910
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,000
- She's turning into beef jerky, the perfect girlfriend.

911
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,380
- Mm, beef jerky girlfriend.

912
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,220
- Whoa.

913
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,140
- Oh my God, smoky and delicious.

914
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,880
- MathGuy37 comments, I want to say that to my mom.

915
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Somebody wants to...

916
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,580
It's kinda weird, man.

917
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,100
Come on, math guy.

918
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,260
I wanna say that to my beef jerky girlfriend.

919
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,020
Yeah.

920
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,020
Yeah, Slim Jim girlfriend.

921
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,260
Yeah, Slim Amanda.

922
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,760
That's right.

923
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,780
And you know what the shape of it is, 'cause Slim Jim is a long stick.

924
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,340
And a Slim Amanda is like a...

925
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,420
a woman's vagina, basically.

926
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
would be the shape but it would be meat.

927
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:25,940
Number four, when giving her a dozen roses, 11 real and one fake, say "I will love you

928
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,460
until the last rose dies."

929
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
So it's already dead.

930
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Alright, cheapskate.

931
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,180
Yeah, it's not a dozen roses.

932
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,180
It was never alive.

933
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,860
Yeah.

934
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Stupid ass bitch.

935
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,860
It is.

936
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
Stupid.

937
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
Stupid.

938
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,820
The ultimate show of love, and it also includes logic.

939
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,800
That inclusion demonstrates motivation and forethought, something most people, regardless

940
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,560
of gender, never include in their cards or flowers.

941
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,320
This is my favorite one, but I'm biased since I used it in the past and was pretty glad for

942
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,540
coming up with a variation of this on my own.

943
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
This is what Cameron wrote.

944
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,540
That's Patrick's alt account where he doesn't do the dumb guy act for likes.

945
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:08,060
That's how Patrick's internal monologue sounds, but then he's like, "Oh, I can't get 20,000

946
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,540
followers if I post like this.

947
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,460
I have to say, I have to say Yoda guy at the subway, man.

948
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,660
- No. - Yeah.

949
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,980
- I don't do a dumb guy act. - I'm eating a poop on the boat.

950
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,820
- I don't do a dumb guy act. - From the Lonely Island.

951
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,780
I'm eating a poop on the Lonely Island boat.

952
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,260
- On the boat, I'm on the Lonely Island.

953
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,660
- I'm on his boat.

954
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,180
- Yeah, I'm on that boat.

955
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,340
- I'm taking my boat to the Lonely Island

956
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,160
and my dick is in a box and I'm Jack Sparrow.

957
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,140
- I would not, I would just say I'm on a boat.

958
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,440
You would say, "I just jizzed in my box."

959
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,940
I jizzed in my butt.

960
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,440
Yeah.

961
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,540
[LAUGHTER]

962
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,780
That would be a pretty good one.

963
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,980
I just jizzed in my butt.

964
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,780
[LAUGHTER]

965
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,380
Post it.

966
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,140
Let's see.

967
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,420
Let's see.

968
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:52,920
No.

969
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,180
Yeah, I just jizzed in my butt.

970
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,340
All right, I'm taking that one then.

971
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,980
Put it on the pod account.

972
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,480
Yeah.

973
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,940
OK, let's go.

974
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,140
Let's post it right now.

975
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,100
Let's see how it does.

976
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,140
That's a special preview.

977
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,700
I just jizzed in my butt.

978
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,240
I just jizzed in my butt.

979
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,380
- All right.

980
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,220
All right.

981
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,060
- I wasn't just saying that guys.

982
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,660
I was, I'm not saying, I didn't do that.

983
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,500
- All right, if you say so.

984
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,320
- I'm just saying.

985
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,160
- If you say so.

986
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,020
- I was just saying that, dude.

987
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,860
- Did it?

988
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,700
- Logic and romance.

989
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,520
- Did you post it?

990
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,360
- Yes.

991
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,500
- Logic and romance, the best combination

992
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,500
for a message to go straight to a girl's heart.

993
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,340
Girls love logic and romance.

994
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,060
- Women, they love, women are famous for loving logic.

995
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,500
I love a combination of logic and romance.

996
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,620
Yeah.

997
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,060
Bernie Mac had all those jokes

998
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,940
about how women love logic too much.

999
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,780
Mm-hmm.

1000
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,600
Yeah.

1001
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,440
It's true.

1002
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,260
Yeah, it's true.

1003
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,100
People laugh 'cause it was true, dude.

1004
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,020
I really love my girlfriend and I want to make her happy.

1005
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,940
It worked like a charm.

1006
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,780
Can't wait to use this on Valentine's Day.

1007
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,940
I used some of these on a girl that I really like

1008
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,180
and she is quite impressed on how I can variate

1009
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,020
from romantic to dirty/sexual.

1010
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,520
*laughter*

1011
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,020
Girl, I'm variating to dirty/sexual tonight.

1012
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,520
Damn, ooh, ooh, you've been variating from dirty to /sexual.

1013
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Turns me on, dude.

1014
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Mm-hmm.

1015
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,020
Until the last rose dies, then you have never started to love her because the rose has never started living.

1016
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,020
Think about it.

1017
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,520
Oh my god.

1018
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
So don't say this, unless you like lying.

1019
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,520
That's what I just said, I said that.

1020
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
I love lying.

1021
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,020
Dude, I love to lie.

1022
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,020
I love the invention of lying.

1023
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,100
Yeah, me too.

1024
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,940
It's such a good movie, dude.

1025
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,260
I love Ricky Gervais.

1026
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,160
When Ricky Gervais tricks women into having sex with him.

1027
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,820
Yeah, the whole movie.

1028
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,700
There's that part where he's like,

1029
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,020
if you don't have sex with me,

1030
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,020
the world will be destroyed by an asteroid.

1031
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,980
And some woman's like, well, let me suck your penis then.

1032
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,260
And he's like, nice.

1033
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,020
And then it happens.

1034
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,860
(laughs)

1035
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,940
Yeah, they have the full scene.

1036
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,700
Yeah, and then they do nasty on each other.

1037
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,580
I'm gonna need I was actually that was a man on the street

1038
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,420
That was a man on the street bit and that was just a really stupid woman

1039
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,980
That wasn't actually part of the movie originally that was a boy

1040
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,700
How women are in the UK? He's like I'm gonna need a full scene a full penetration

1041
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,940
And I'm not gonna do my own stunts. I'm gonna be I'm like Tom Cruise and I'm and I'm not lying

1042
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:27,820
He tried he kept trying to do the thing from the movie on the set. Yeah, there's over and over again

1043
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:36,240
again. Oh that Louis CK is in that movie. So yep he's also at my house. Yeah. Yeah. We can't

1044
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,940
get him out. This brought tears to my eyes. That's what happens when you move to New York.

1045
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:49,680
Louis CK has to film, he has to do the Louis intro through your apartment. Well he has

1046
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,680
to do it through people's apartments now because of COVID. Yeah he's eating a pizza over my

1047
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
trash can right now.

1048
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,160
Yeah.

1049
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,160
Get him out of there dude.

1050
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,840
He threw, he just took two bites and threw the rest away.

1051
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
What the F?

1052
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,760
Yeah, this guy seriously is a fucked up individual.

1053
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,360
Now we have to cancel this guy.

1054
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
Yeah.

1055
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,960
Yeah, fuck this guy for a, he can't even finish a pizza.

1056
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,680
That does, that kind of behavior doesn't belong in comedy.

1057
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,980
This brought tears to my eyes.

1058
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:20,520
My friend used it on their social network profile and I just had to search it.

1059
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,360
I love when I have to search things from social network profile.

1060
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,280
Number 5, you deserve the world and I know I can't give that to you.

1061
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,040
So I'll give you the next best thing.

1062
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,260
My world.

1063
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,260
My spore world.

1064
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,260
My little spore world.

1065
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,040
They're referring to my Minecraft world.

1066
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,560
My tiny little world.

1067
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,160
My tiny little spore characters that look like you.

1068
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,160
It's not much, well actually it is a lot.

1069
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,760
They're just like mutant versions of the girl.

1070
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,120
I made you a spore.

1071
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
I made some Samanthians.

1072
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
And they're beautiful.

1073
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,120
And I like to use my cursor to hover over their bodies.

1074
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,120
They're actually at war with the Blordos right now.

1075
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,120
Just be really careful when you launch the world, okay?

1076
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,120
Because they might go extinct.

1077
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,120
Right now they're actually colonizing a native species right now.

1078
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,120
So just give them a little time before you...

1079
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,120
They're very violent.

1080
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,120
Also, they have penises.

1081
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,120
Every single one of them.

1082
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,120
They have gigantic penises.

1083
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,120
They have giant dicks.

1084
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Listen, I don't know. The modeling really got away from me.

1085
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,120
It was supposed to be.

1086
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,120
It's more of an impressionist thing.

1087
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,120
I was trying to model your legs.

1088
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
But then it turned out that they only had.

1089
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Then I realized your legs look like penises.

1090
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
And so that's why the character has

1091
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,120
three penises for legs.

1092
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,120
And he has Arnold Schwarzenegger's face.

1093
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,120
Kind of just on accident.

1094
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,120
I hit random.

1095
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,120
And the whole body is a penis.

1096
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,480
body is a penis and I'm sorry yeah and look I'm sorry and I'm gonna be straight

1097
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,920

00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:25,980
Because I'm gonna surgically turn you into a monster because you're 98 years old and you're my girlfriend

00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:32,960
Anyway, baby, happy anniversary happy happy six months anniversary

Yeah, come up with a new thing guys. Yeah, come up with something else. Yeah, how about that? Let's come up with the new one

1108
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,060
Yeah, all right if you okay if you were in a room with

1109
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:57,400
Adolf Hitler and you had a gun with one bullet I

1110
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,960
Would buy you a dozen roses

1111
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,080
regardless of what you did with the

1112
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:10,920
If we did a DNA test and found out you were a hundred percent monkey, I'd still fuck you.

1113
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,080
I just wouldn't tell anyone.

1114
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,440
And I wouldn't tell you.

1115
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:25,480
Yeah, if I found out that you were a mutant you could still be my girlfriend, but I would you my family couldn't know about it.

1116
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,320
Yeah, if you were a rose and I was a rose

1117
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,920
- And we were both roses and you were made out of chocolate

1118
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,220
and a kiss.

1119
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,560
- I would eat you up.

1120
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,520
- And it's Valentine's Day.

1121
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,600
- If I gave you a kiss on Valentine's Day,

1122
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,280
100 roses, a million chocolate bars, and a heart.

1123
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,280
- And we're going to CVS and we're gonna get

1124
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,440
a teddy bear from CZ.

1125
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,800
We're gonna get Plan B from CVS.

1126
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,440

1127
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,280

1128
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,200

00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,080
- To the CVS pharmacist.

1134
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,080

1135
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,320

00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,960
- Girl, I could never leave you.

1142
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,680

1143
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,520
- Yeah.

1144
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,480
(laughing)

1145
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,000
I wish you were my sister so that I could have grown up with you.

1146
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Real shit.

1147
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
There is a kid.

1148
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,360
I wish I was your uncle so I could have seen you grow into the beautiful woman you are today.

1149
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,680
Real shit beautiful bitch.

1150
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,320
There was a kid in my high school who was in my study that I got a credit for.

1151
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,880
And he, it was for kids with like ADD and very dumb kids.

1152
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:59,000
he uh his last name was Upton and someone was like hey are you not much what's up with you

1153
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:08,280
but he uh he said someone was like are you related to Kate Upton he went no but i wish i was

1154
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:19,160
yeah i wish i was one of the i wish i was her peeping cousin i wish i was your cousin hey

1155
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,880
"Hey, Cousin Caleb, you wanna come to the Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot with me today?"

1156
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,880
"Yeah, Cousin Kate."

1157
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,400
I just remember him saying that, and they had cubbies, like study cubbies, and I was

1158
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,400
like in one of them, and I poked my head out of it, and I looked at him, and I went, "You

1159
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,800
wish she was your cousin so you could fuck her."

1160
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Air horn.

1161
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,640
Another evidence of an air horn moment right there.

1162
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,280
He goes to the bathroom, he goes to the bathroom, he's like, "Please God, please make me Kate

1163
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,280
Upton's cousin."

1164
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,680
And then he wakes up the next day and doesn't notice anything different.

1165
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,720
And then he like, eats breakfast, walks to school, gets into class, and you're like,

1166
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,760
"Dude, nice huge fucking tits."

1167
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,040
Nice jumbo naturals, bro.

"Nice huge fucking jiggly tits in your bikini, dude.

You look incredible.

1171
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,760

[Laughs]

1178
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,360
Yeah.

1179
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,040
I put big ass feet on this bitch.

1180
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,040
Yeah.

1181
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,080
Let's see what the least amount of brain cells I can put in this thing and still make it

1182
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,080
functional.

1183
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,080
Yeah.

1184
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,080
Yeah.

1185
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,080
How small is stupid canality?

Hey, I was like, yeah.

1187
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,520
Hey, angels, I had a crazy idea.

1188
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:06,720
What if we gave this person like a club foot and little dinosaur arms?

1189
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,720
Yeah.

1190
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,720
Yeah.

1191
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,020
I can make this person and still capable of being loved

1192
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:18,920
Like that God, why are you still in the workshop one of the angels bet that I couldn't make a bitch with a yellow clit

1193
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,860
Put the crayons down God

1194
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:28,160
That's how God does it he puts it's a piece of like paper and it's not like a stick

1195
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,920
He does it he does it puts all the things

1196
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,400
Basically his hand looks like a person and he doesn't hurt

1197
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,360

1225
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:08,800
problem for all of our wars. Basically it's the reason why the world sucks. If there was

1226
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:16,620
no God, everybody would have two TVs. So you're telling me we freaking worship a carpenter

1227
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:23,580
who turned into a zombie on the rabbit's day? I'm sorry, what was Mr. Bible smoking when

1228
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,900
when he wrote this stuff.

1229
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,740
- Yeah.

1230
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,420
- Happy zombie Jesus day.

1231
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,300
- Yeah.

1232
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,780
- Easter, I like to call it, I like to call it zombie.

1233
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,420
- A guy completely missing the point.

1234
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,460
So what, we're supposed to believe that a bunny

1235
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,420
came back to life on Christmas?

1236
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,180
(laughing)

1237
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,020
- Yeah, okay.

1238
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,860
- So a bunny is the son of God.

1239
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,700
- Okay.

1240
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,520
- Oh, and he's made of chocolate?

1241
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,660
- Yeah, likely story.

1242
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,060
- Okay.

1243
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:47,900
- So wait.

1244
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,100
- That's in the Bible?

1245
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,620
- When I bite into God, he's hollow on the inside?

1246
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,660
- Wait, what the hay?

1247
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,660
What the what? - What the hay?

1248
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,980
What the hay is this?

1249
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,820
Get this crap out of here.

1250
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,420
- A lot of these are God.

1251
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,200
Number eight, if I died and God asked me

1252
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,740
what I'd like to come back as,

1253
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,100
I'd say a tear so I can be born on your eyes,

1254
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,340
rolled in your cheek, and die on your lips.

1255
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,300
- That's what I say to Pat.

1256
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,700
I text Patrick that every morning when I wake up.

1257
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,260
- Yeah, we have been getting pretty sexual

1258
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,100
in the group texts with Patrick.

1259
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,940
- Yeah, you guys--

1260
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,780
- There's something about him--

1261
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,600
- I'm irresistible to you guys.

1262
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,660
- There's something about him that drives me crazy.

1263
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,560
It's true.

1264
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,100
There's something about you, dude.

1265
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,260
I think it's, no, it's not that.

1266
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,380
It's something else.

1267
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,940
It's just how beautiful you are.

1268
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,780
- Yeah, you're gorgeous.

1269
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,380
- You have beautiful big lips and a thick--

1270
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,100
- And a beautiful mind.

1271
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,440
- And you're thick.

1272
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,020
And also you have these arms.

1273
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,700
Oh God, I just wanna--

1274
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,460
- I got arms, for sure.

1275
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,900
- I just wanna lick you up like a fruit roll-up.

1276
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,220
- I'm not a fruit roll-up.

1277
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,820
I just want to turn you into a caramel.

1278
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,540
- I'm gonna go out with you for a few years

1279
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,260
and then marry you, I'm thinking.

1280
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,100
(laughing)

1281
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,420
- I'm making a plan.

1282
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,260
- Yeah, pretty much I'm gonna do it first.

1283
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,060
- I'm writing up a blueprint for our life together.

1284
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,100
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna marry Patrick.

1285
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,220
- Yeah, I'm thinking I'm gonna wait a few years

1286
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,060
and then marry Patrick.

1287
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:09,900
- This is not gonna happen.

1288
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,180
- Hold on, let me get my to-do list.

1289
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,100
- Yeah. - Marry Patrick.

1290
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,380
- One second, let me check my Blackberry real quick.

1291
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,220
I think I have something on the calendar for tomorrow.

1292
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,780
Oh yeah, I have a meeting with Patrick

1293
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,700
where it's called a proposal meeting

1294
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,620
where I ask him to freaking marry me sexually.

1295
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,140
- Wait, I'm getting a message on my Palm Pilot.

1296
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,380
- I'm not gonna get sexually married to you guys.

1297
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,500
- It's reminding me to marry Patrick.

1298
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,780
- Hold on a second, I have a sticky note on my mirror

1299
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,300
and it says, "Today's the big day.

1300
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,780
"You're gonna marry Patrick in a sexual way."

1301
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,700
- Patrick, listen to me.

1302
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,860
I'm gonna offer my wife as a dowry

1303
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,700
and you and me are gonna get married.

1304
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,900
- Then what?

1305
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,740
Then what the hell?

1306
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,580
- In America.

1307
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,260
- Me and Patrick are gonna go to Wendy's for our honeymoon

1308
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,100
and we're gonna do it in the bathroom.

1309
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,940
in the bedroom.

1310
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,820
- Mine is already arranged, dude.

1311
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,460
You really wanna buck tradition like that

1312
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,140
and disrespect your elders?

1313
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,740
- Why would I do that?

1314
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,780
- Because your parents arranged us to get married.

1315
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,220
- My parents did not arrange us to get married.

1316
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,060
- They did.

1317
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,180
They said this is-- - They didn't.

1318
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,020
- They said you are one of the most--

1319
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,220
- They did not.

1320
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,980
- You are the only person who's been worthy

1321
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,620
of Patrick's love.

1322
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,900
Some girl named Cameron came by

1323
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,540
and tried to take our son, but we said no,

1324
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,900
and we're saying yes to you.

1325
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,380
And so I want you to know, if you marry him,

1326
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,040
your father will condone you.

1327
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,740
If you marry me, your father will disown you.

1328
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,920
He'll eat his head now.

1329
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,780
- And that's some bread now.

1330
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,700
- Patrick already agreed to marry me

1331
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,580
and have a 1,000 year trip around the world as a honeymoon.

1332
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,740
- That was on opposite day.

1333
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,620
- And to have love every night.

1334
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:38,900
- He said we would have love.

1335
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,980
He said we would have love every single night.

1336
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,140
- Stop fighting over me.

1337
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,920
- No dude, you're too good.

1338
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,980
You're too good.

1339
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,660
I want to have a honeymoon suite

1340
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,140
where I lead you to the bed with salt and vinegar

1341
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,740
- Patrick, if you choose me, Patrick, if you choose me,

1342
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,640
we're gonna have a mansion with 1000 rooms in it.

1343
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,060
What do you say to that?

1344
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,540
- If you choose me, I will blow your mind.

1345
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,020
My tongue is three feet long.

1346
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,140
(laughing)

1347
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,380
I will do all sorts of freaky frog fucky shit to you

1348
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,740
if you just marry me.

1349
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,180
Just sign on the dotted line

1350
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,320
and let me invest in you with my body.

1351
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,160
I already forged a marriage certificate.

1352
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,140
You forged it?

1353
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,980
Yeah, so we're technically already married.

1354
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,820
No, it's not gonna happen.

1355
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,220
I already submitted it.

1356
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,780
You know what, I just wanna mold you

1357
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,340
like a porn star with a fleshlight.

1358
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,580
I just wanna get a signature Patrick Fleshlight.

1359
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,340
I don't even wanna get married anymore.

1360
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,480
I just wanna put a bunch of mud on your holes

1361
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,620
and then just get it, just get accurate.

1362
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,780
Listen, all I want, accurate hole, and then I'm out.

1363
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,180
I just wanna-- I'll leave you alone.

1364
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,500
I'm gonna switch around your different anatomies

1365
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,800
and get acquainted with different parts of you.

1366
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,500
- I'm gonna make you suck a french fry out my wiener.

1367
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,660
- This is disgusting.

1368
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,740
This is all disgusting to me.

1369
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,980
- No it's not, it's marriage and it's love.

1370
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,500
- It's all disgusting to me.

1371
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,180
- I'm gonna play the bongos on your zones.

1372
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,380
- I don't wanna fucking marry you anymore, dude.

1373
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,820
Good, I don't even, I don't even, listen to me.

1374
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,400
I don't even want to have a beautiful marriage

1375
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,760
with you anymore with a kid that looks like half of me,

1376
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,160
half of you, split down the middle, okay?

1377
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,320
I don't want that anymore.

1378
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Yeah dude, you wanna eat poop instead.

1379
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
It's good that you don't want that.

1380
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
You wanna eat poop instead.

1381
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,080
Dude, I don't wanna retire with you.

1382
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,840
I don't wanna live on a golf course and go outside everyday.

1383
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
You would not live on a golf course.

1384
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,200
And I cook hamburgers for me and I cook a pineapple for you on the grill because you

1385
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,400
recently turned vegetarian.

1386
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
He recently turned Jamaican.

1387
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,760
You recently became Jamaican.

1388
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,800
You converted to Jamaicanism.

1389
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,800
I don't wanna have that life.

1390
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,800
Jamaicanism!

1391
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
Jamaicanism!

1392
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
You did.

1393
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,800
He did.

1394
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:50,600
Our son converted to some kind of fucking Jamaicanism. I don't know. He's at Pratt right now, and he's having a bad time.

1395
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,600
Yeah. Hey Patrick, Patrick.

1396
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,300
What?

1397
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,800
Bob Marley was showing off when he created you.

1398
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:02,700
Yeah, real shit, jaw was, jaw snapped on you.

1399
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:08,500
Patrick, if I died and Chet Hanks asked me what I'd like to come back as, I'd say a tear.

1400
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,500
I'd say "Boo-yuck-a-shaw." I'd say "Boo-yuck-a-boo-yuck-a-boo-yuck-a!"

1401
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,500
I'd say "Urrrrr." "Urrrrr."

1402
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Number nine. I'd say "Tingon Massive."

1403
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,500
"Big Up." "Big Up." "Big Up the Tingon Massive."

1404
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:28,500
It is sad that Hank's family lost both parents to COVID and a son to Jamaicanism.

1405
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,500
It is really sad.

1406
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,500
One of the most violent religions.

1407
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,980
Yeah, kind of like the Kennedy's yeah, I just drop in like flies. Yeah, I

1408
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:43,220
Put a tear in the ocean when you find it. I'll stop what is with all these tears

1409
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:49,380
And why love is about women girls girls love to cry. They're addicted to it. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, I love to cry

1423
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:54,000
Damn there's like so many on this list. I'm trying to find the last one. There's over a hundred

1424
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,380
There's so many comments on all of them - damn

1425
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,000
We could do a part two on this one

1426
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,680
But I don't think we should because I think this apparently is originally created meant a man with two heads four legs

1427
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,820
Forearms and two hearts. He thought they would be too powerful

1428
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,380
So he split man in two allowing them to spend their lives searching for the other half

1429
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:19,960
I'm so happy that you turned out to be mine. Is that so this one if you like Percy Jackson trust me on this

1430
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,260
Someone says screw Zeus. It's all about Poseidon

1431
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:32,380
Someone says you're the pad made of my Darth Vader and try that one on Patrick. Yeah. Hey Patrick

1432
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,860
You're the pad made of my Darth Vader

1433
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:41,700
Yeah, that's right. You're the pad made of Darth Vader. You're gonna die and I'm gonna wait you Patrick Patrick

But I would move heaven and earth to let you know that I love you. I'm empty without you

1442
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,300
I trust and love you like I trust the Sun will rise in the morning and set at night

1443
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,300
- All right.

1444
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:21,020

1445
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,500
- My penis craving you like a bear crave meat.

1446
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,700
It's as simple as this.

1448
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,020

1450
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,900
- That's how you pick a bitch up.

1451
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,980
No, I invented that out of my brain.

1452
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,820
- Oh, okay.

1453
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,640
- Yeah.

1454
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,480
- Hey, Patrick.

1455
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,060
- I wanna take a picture of things on you.

1456
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,860

01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,480
I'm still scrolling.

1495
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,500
I can't get to the end of this.

1496
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,740
I can't get to the end.

1497
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,740
You guys keep talking.

1498
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,740
We should do a part two or something.

1499
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,740
Hey, hey, guys, guys.

1500
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,740
No, these aren't very good.

1501
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:44,400
Most of them literally are just like, this one says, "You're the chocolate of the chocolation

1502
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,780
by the chocolate rolling in my lips."

1503
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,940
All right, we can end on this.

1504
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,940
We can end on this.

1505
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,940
No, I need to find the last one.

1506
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,940
We're not ending on anything yet.

1507
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,620
No, you know, this list is never ending like my love for Patrick.

1508
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:58,180
I made it to a thousand, but it just says a hundred.

1509
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,980
This list is never ending like my love for Patrick.

1510
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,300
And I'm going to love Patrick.

1511
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,780
I'm gonna let baby let me love you down Patrick.

1512
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,780
Yeah, me too.

1513
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,780
That plus one.

1514
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,340
I just want to get Patrick on the floor.

1515
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,820
I feel like if I could get Patrick on the floor, Justin Timberlake style, and we could

1516
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,820
be on the floor together, then maybe I could make him fall in love with me.

1517
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,460
I don't know.

1518
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,900
That probably won't happen.

1519
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,900
What was that?

1520
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,020
Did you just pull on the spring of your arm again?

1521
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,020
He just pulled it.

1522
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,020
I accidentally hit the spring again.

1523
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,020
He busted a coil.

1524
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,020
So, okay.

1525
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,540
That spring in Patrick's body just got loose.

1526
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,820
So there's the spring.

1527
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:33,160
There's the spring on the arm, and I've done this in an episode before, but check this out.

1528
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,360
We can end on this.

1529
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,320
This is- You are my personal bomb.

1530
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,320
If I don't see you, my heart will explode.

1531
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:50,920
There's a- okay, so if I ever accidentally do this again, check out for this sound.

1532
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,760
I can't find the end of this list.

1533
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,760
I'm at 1500.

1534
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,760
And it hasn't ended yet.

1535
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,640
I'm going to stop recording, and you just keep doing it by yourself.

1536
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,640
No.

1537
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,640
Alright, bye everybody.

1538
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,640
Bye.

1539
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,200
I'm going to keep doing it.

1540
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,600
I haven't stopped recording it.

1541
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,240
Oh, I found the end, but you guys can't comment on it.

1542
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:12,480
The last one is, "When the sky falls apart and the stars disappear, as I take my final

1543
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,940
breath the last thing I would think of would be you."

1544
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,520
And that's dedicated to Patrick.

1545
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,080
Go online and message Patrick and ask him to be my boyfriend.

1546
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:21,760
Bye everybody.
