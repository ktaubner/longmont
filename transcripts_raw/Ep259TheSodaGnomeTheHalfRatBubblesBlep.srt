1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,300
- Well.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,280
- Well. - Here we are.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,740
- Welcome to the future.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,240
The future of podcasting is here.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,460
Guys. - The whole show

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,040
is gonna be like this from now on.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,160
- We have entered a new dimension.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,680
Not only a new dimension, a new world.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
And not only a new world, - A new dimension.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,760
- A new life.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,040
Welcome to second life. We're here beautiful bumblebee buzz public cinema, which is a

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,480
Some kind of horse stable. It's a horse farm. I think yeah, it's a horse. Well not a horse farm. You don't usually farm

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,240
Horses well, I think yeah, but farm you could call it a farm still

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,180
Yeah, nobody would be it. Maybe only the most annoying person on earth would say it's actually not a farm. It's a stable

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,360
- Maybe that would be something that a crazy person would say.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,520
- Maybe the only most rude person on earth would say

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,800
that maybe the most annoying person on earth.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,720
Wait, what are you doing, Patrick?

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,920
- I'm just laying down.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm resting.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,240
- How is it, wait, what's that horse doing?

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,080
- I'm just laying with my horse.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,520
- Second life is the most amazing,

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,520
it's better than real life and it's not even close.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,860
- Yeah, easily, so easily.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,120
What's your favorite part about Second Life so far?

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
Our new lives.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,020
- Probably my horse and the fact that I'm Cameron.

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,160
- Yeah, I like my wolf body that I was able to find.

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,200
- I'm living my life as Cameron now, which is pretty good.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,740
- You wish, buddy.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,800
- I like my little radio.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,740
- I think you wish.

35
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,960
I mean, look at my life in here.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,880
I got a horse.

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,200
- You have the confidence to wear an unbuttoned shirt.

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
- Yeah.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,900
I like I feel like all three of us are able to be

40
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:06,200
Exactly who we've always wanted to be definitely I have I'm not bald, but I have very short hair

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,860
Patrick gets to be Cameron and he gets a horse named brouhaha. Yeah, and Cameron gets to be some kind of green

42
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,080
kind of demon with no genitals

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,160
- And Julio is me. - There's probably some

44
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,600
genitals under the fur.

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,920
- I don't know if you can see Julio here,

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
but he is me, and he is in a steampunk hat with no shirt.

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,440
- And he has a scorpion on his shoulder.

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,680
(laughing)

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Which is a fashion accessory you could never wear

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,720
in the real world.

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,040
- No, you could not wear a scorpion.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,600
It would not work at all.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040
- It would not work even a little bit,

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,420
but in Second Life, anything is possible.

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,500
except for getting a username you want guys i tried to get my favorite user name

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,900
and they made me add a bunch of numbers after it

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,820
as i was already taken

58
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,600
they didn't mean to me that i don't really think in

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,980

86
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,060
would have me. Marcus W123 just an average old pervert. A bunch of stuff

87
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,020
like this here. You know what we need guys? Listen, all right, what is what is first

88
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,220
life all about? Work, taxes, work, close food, hamburgers, you're both

89
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,340
fucking close as shit. It's about money. Yep. So guess what second life is about

90
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:22,200
about guys. Linden. Linden rules everything around me. Lareem. Okay? This is what we care

91
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:29,140
about now guys. Linden, for those who don't know, is the dollar of the second life world.

92
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,320
And this shit is ruling my every waking thought. All I think about is Linden all day and night.

93
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,800
How can I get some Linden?

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,980
I need to get a buzz ball item that I can put in my hand.

95
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,380
How are we going to make Linden?

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,460
You want to get buzz balls in this game?

97
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,260
I want to download a buzz ball model and put it in my hand.

98
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,380
There's so much stuff about this that's so different from the real world.

99
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,060
Like for example, being able to download things instead of having to get them.

100
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
Exactly.

101
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
I agree.

102
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,880
- A little crash course for people watching.

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,540
Downloading is the getting of Second Life.

104
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,420
How normally you would get something or have something.

105
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,500
- Or install it.

106
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,580
- You would either download or install it.

107
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,340
And it usually is gonna cost a couple of linden at least.

108
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,060
- And instead of giving, you upload.

109
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,220
- Yes, yes.

110
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,060
So now you're getting familiar with the Second Life lingo.

111
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,380
I do feel like, you know what this is guys?

112
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Us in Second Life, this is the immigrant story.

113
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,060
- Yeah.

114
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,140
- This is three people who don't know any of the customs,

115
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,300
the cultures, coming along.

116
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,500
We went through the Sex Ellis Island, the tutorial.

117
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,480
We fucked it, you fucked me, you know?

118
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,900
- You asked me to.

119
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,920
- Well, yeah, well I was strapped down

120
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,820
to some kind of device, okay,

121
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,980
and you just basically clicked on it.

122
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,460
- And for all, and listen, for everyone listening out there

123
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,060
who sees what my character looks like,

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,740
he looked a little different when this happened, okay?

125
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,580
- Yeah, he did. - I think it's scary.

126
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,780
- My character used to be a little more attractive

127
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
before his disease hit it. - I think that your character,

128
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,580
you hit the wall. - Was a woman.

129
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,280
Your character was a woman and Caleb was a man?

130
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,940
- My character was a man, but he had wings.

131
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,780
I made my character a woman. - Oh.

132
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,100
- He was the default avatar for my character.

133
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,860
I loaded up the account, pervert1325673

134
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,420
second life was like let's go ahead and give this guy bangs a black suit and

135
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:41,200
wait and by the way if it does it based on your name this shit nailed my vibe

136
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,900
instantly I have I have a groovy shirt bell-bottom pants and a radio that I

137
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,640
walk around with and I didn't change a single thing except my haircut I did a

138
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:59,140
lot to make myself look like Cameron I think I spent maybe 20 minutes just

139
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,780
looking at a photo of Cameron I had as my wallpaper on my computer and I was just

140
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,900
going through the sliders and editing the face and everything. There's sliders on

141
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,460
here? Yeah you can edit that I shouldn't have told you guys that because now

142
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,140
we're gonna spend the rest of the episode. We're in the throes of it but man I

143
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,480
wish I wish I had done some sliders instead of picking this gay-ass normal

144
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,540
default skin that's so average. This thing is average as fuck. This is the

145
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,540
- The average Second Life user skin, I think.

146
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,860
- Yeah, there must be a lot of,

147
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,120
for this to be a default skin,

148
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,340
there has to be so many people

149
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,660
who are logging into Second Life

150
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,760
to pretend to be a woman and flirt with other women,

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,920
and just be like, I wanna be an ugly beast.

152
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,740
In my real life, I'm just a normal guy,

153
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,240
but I wanna be a hideous monster.

154
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,860
- This is hard mode, mate.

155
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,300
You're on hard mode trying to have sex in this game,

156
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,660
dressed up as this evil character.

157
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,060
- I don't know, I don't think it's that hard

158
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,940
to have sex with another werewolf.

159
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,340
- Well he's naked and he has no penis.

160
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,060
- Yeah.

161
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,980
- So like people know you don't got nothing down there.

162
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,460
- Again, there could be some fur covering some stuff up.

163
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,340
- You think your penis is so,

164
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,540
okay so even worse, your penis is so small

165
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,380
it can be blocked by one piece of hair.

166
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,820
well listen buddy as much like other part my entire body on less of a show or more

167
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,520

172
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,760
well you made him jump

173
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
uh... wow that's crazy

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,820
so i can do things in second life that

175
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,420
are possible in the real world

176
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,260
like make a horse jump, make a horse jump.

177
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,460
Horses are not very obedient normally.

178
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,300
- No, no, no, no.

179
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,180
- So how are we gonna make Linden, guys?

180
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,740
Because I need this shit.

181
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,020
- Yeah, I need Linden so bad.

182
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,200
- We need some kind of Ed, Edd, Neddy scam

183
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,260
that we can start running on people.

184
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,780
- I would like to sell my body,

185
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,240
but unfortunately I think there's gonna be some steps

186
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm gonna have to undertake before then.

187
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,140
I think I'm probably going to buy

188
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,980
a full body volumetric scanner

189
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,740
like they use for CGI movies and I'm gonna scan my entire body in one-to-one

190
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,620
perfectly and walk around as a perfectly photorealistic avatar. Oh okay that's

191
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,340
see I thought that you were saying that you were going to scan your body into

192
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,420
this game and then sell yourself as some kind of escort. Oh that's exactly what

193
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,380
I'm saying. Oh okay all right. Just making sure. That's what I just said yeah that's what I

194
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,780
I think I might do to make some--

195
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,180
- Sorry. - Linden.

196
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,180
- I was distracted by my horse.

197
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,820
- Yeah, this has gotta be one of the worst ideas ever

198
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,860
in terms of keeping Patrick attended.

199
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,100
- Right, well, and that window,

200
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,500
the second life window doesn't even have to be open.

201
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,540
- That is true.

202
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,380
- There, you don't even need it.

203
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,640
You should be just be standing there.

204
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,900
- I'm sure that he is gonna keep it open the entire time.

205
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,880
- Oh, I will.

206
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,800
No, 'cause I have to look at a PowerPoint at some point.

207
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,440
Um, yeah, I guess another way to make Linden would maybe to be to open a restaurant

208
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,120
Yeah, yeah, there needs to be

209
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,000
I think that one thing I'm gonna start investing in pretty soon with maybe even real-life Linden is

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,460
Peripherals I'm going to get some kind of

211
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,040
Haptic feedback suit to make this experience even better. I think

212
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,840
Yeah, so when like my horse bucks at you you'll feel like when your horse steps on me

213
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,840
I feel the I've always thought about thought about that with haptic feedback suits

214
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,020
Is it gonna be when that when those come out and they're really good

215
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,720
Is it gonna be something where you get stabbed and you feel really like actual pain? Is that what people want from this?

216
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,560
Probably will be true

217
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,480
There will be true that will be true

218
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,400
there will be truth revealed.

219
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,680
what are you gonna do make it where you get stabbed and you'd come

220
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,400
i mean i think that's what i was the only other option for a happy

221
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,920
feedbacks that's what i would do it with the two things you could possibly be

222
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,680
aware that for that would be the option is out i would put i would

223
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,560
put on the haptic feedback suit set it to the come only setting and then go play

224
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,720
chivalry

225
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,280
ever since get

226
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,820
every single night but my open the open mic on

227
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,260
and then just get in sort fights with guys

228
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,740
and you know

229
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,940
have a said going into my of my key bindings for my for my haptic suit and

230
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,920
and uh... it for my uh...

231
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,540
uh... and sixty four emulator and setting it so every time mario jumps it

232
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,420
simulates a leg shaking orgasm

233
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,780
this is a few of the settings around

234
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,080
i guess you're right that that why would anybody said it to pain

235
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,000
if there is a choosing option

236
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,860
i would set it to pain once and then if it wasn't that bad i would go out and i

237
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,180
I would be a criminal and I would muck people.

238
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,260
(laughing)

239
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,100
- Well that was--

240
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,920
- You know what I would do?

241
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
I would set it to pain one time.

242
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,540
- Exactly, I'd be like, okay, now I know I can handle this.

243
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,860
I'm gonna go try and kill people with my knife.

244
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,580
And if they get the knife and stab me, so what?

245
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,420
- Yeah, just do a bunch of draining.

246
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,240
- Set it to pain.

247
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
- Yeah.

248
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,380
- Set it to pain one time and then go

249
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,580
to nuclear blast simulator.

250
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,420
- Yeah.

251
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,940
- And see what the fuck happens.

252
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,740
- Yeah, play one of those car games

253
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,620
that just crash a Maserati on the wall 5,000 times.

254
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,260
- God, that would be fucking incredible.

255
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,640
that be it that's got to feel amazing to do to have a feedback and jump into a

256
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:54,420
car and just crash it 200 miles an hour. Oh my god, dude you fucking you put on the haptic pain

257
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,020
feedback suit and you're playing some what you're playing like a fighting game

258
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,100
or something but there's like they released it they rushed the release and

259
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,340
there's a bug in it so you get punched one time and it simulates all your bones

260
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,060
breaking constantly until you force quit the game. That's what I mean dude at some point

261
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,700
they're gonna make a haptic feedback suit

262
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,220
that is way too strong.

263
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,300
And it's gonna like,

264
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,560
you're gonna do mortal combat fatalities

265
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,740
and get decapitated or something.

266
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,900
- Are they, who is working on these haptic feedback machines?

267
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,980
- There's people, - Me mostly.

268
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,800
- They have haptic feedback gloves for VR.

269
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,220
I've seen these. - Oh yeah.

270
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,340
- Yeah, but--

271
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,700
- You've been looking into them like every single day?

272
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,660
- Pretty much, looking at the technology,

273
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,500
seeing if it's getting any better.

274
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,980
But my fear is always,

275
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,460
'Cause the big thing with the haptic feedback is like,

276
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,400
oh, it'll simulate like holding something.

277
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,740
Like it gives you like resistance

278
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,180
when you try to like close your fist

279
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,820
on like an apple or something.

280
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,640
- Yeah. - Right.

281
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,860
- But I would just get scared that it would,

282
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,660
it would somehow think that the apple was as big as a planet

283
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,020
and it would bend all my fingers back and break my hand.

284
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,540
- Yeah, it's a very high or a very high risk

285
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:10,880
when it comes to a glitch. Normally in a glitch you'll be upset or you'll lose a few hours

286
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,260
of progress. Oh that's so funny, look how I have a long arm. Yeah, oh my god I'm clipping

287
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,900
through the wall. I'm stuck in the wall and then you have your haptic feedback suit on

288
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,700
and you're like "I'm stuck in the wall!" Yeah, you don't want this. This is a bad time to

289
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,780
get a glitch guys. So I think sex, even worse if you- I think we're working on eliminating

290
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,980
glitches though. I've heard that. They're trying to stop glitches? I've heard that they're getting

291
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,980
rid of glitches. Oh, that's good. That'll change everything. I think that they, that's why

292
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,640
they should probably just keep haptics to sex because if it destroys your penis you're not

293
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,440
gonna tell anybody. Yeah. Yeah. You're not gonna be like. Yeah, no, imagine, imagine

294
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,440
you have the VR headset on and you just use like the haptic succulator 5000 and you're

295
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,080
and you're like walking around like after you're trying to hide it from your

296
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,560
your your wife or your girlfriend you're just walking around the apartment just like

297
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:18,800
your cock is broken in half i think what would probably be the scariest thing

298
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,600
is imagine you watch bowser you watch bowser sucks you off vr

299
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,920
- Yeah, it's just air playing directly.

300
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,520
- You didn't know anything about his jaw strength?

301
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,840
(laughing)

302
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,160
- You maybe didn't think too hard

303
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
about the fact he's a dinosaur.

304
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,000
- Yeah.

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,720
(laughing)

306
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,560
- I think,

307
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,680
I think the scariest scenario

308
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,480
is that you put on the haptic feedback suit,

309
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
you get into second life.

310
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,400
Here you are at the tutorial island,

311
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,480
you take two wrong turns.

312
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,280
Uh-oh, you're in tickle world.

313
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,200
- Oh my God.

314
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,760
Oh, a haptic tickle where there is no escape.

315
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,200
You have to unzip yourself from the suit

316
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,120
to escape this tickle.

317
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,960
- Yeah.

318
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,720
- That would be scary as fuck.

319
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,080
- Yeah, I guess if I was creating a tickle trap,

320
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,360
I would probably make it though,

321
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,280
so that the action of reaching for the zipper

322
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,800
would cause unimaginable pain.

323
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,960
- Or unimaginable tickling.

324
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,240
- Yeah.

325
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
You'll only be tickled if you try to take your suit off.

326
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,920
- Have they figured out maybe some kind of

327
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,800
evolutionary reason why tickling is programmed into the human body?

328
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,880
Maybe not. Maybe it's just uh, maybe it's just one of God's mysteries or miracles.

329
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,280
Yeah, unfortunately I think it's sexual in nature. Yeah, I think that tickling...

330
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,800
Unfortunately I think it's sexual in nature. Tell that to my brother!

331
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:55,340
like oh I have okay all right well never mind then don't tell don't tell my

332
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:03,800
brother that god tell that to anybody but my brother please don't tell my brother

333
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:11,980
that tickling is sexual do you think that that would change your relationship

334
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,860
with your brother if you had sex with him?

335
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,900
Yeah, that would probably change it in a massive way.

336
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,100
Yeah, if he found out that tickling is inherently sexual.

337
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,740
Well, I sure hope not,

338
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,900
because I've been tickled.

339
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,460
I think I've been tickled by everybody

340
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,540
in this call right now.

341
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,460
Really?

342
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,660
At some point, yeah.

343
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,900
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that makes sense to me.

344
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,300
But I think I'm probably in the top 1%

345
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,220
in terms of the ticklish community.

346
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,380
I think I'm extremely ticklish.

347
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,660
- In terms of being ticklish?

348
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,060
- I'm very, very ticklish.

349
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,380
- He is. - Which makes me

350
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,180
also very sexual, I think, by--

351
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,300
- Trust me, I know.

352
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,780
- And I'm a tickler.

353
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,820
I tickle Patrick pretty often.

354
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,260
- You do? - Yeah, Patrick is fun to tickle.

355
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,660
- Well, he's just always just sitting there.

356
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,140
(laughing)

357
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,980
You know?

358
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,740
- I just made my horse jump so high.

359
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,220
- Wait, watch this.

360
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,580
Julio, you gotta watch this really quick.

361
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,740
- Holy shit.

362
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,560
(laughing)

363
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,400
- Oh my God.

364
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,980
That's the highest I've ever seen a horse jump in my life.

365
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,180
- Yeah, this is in my second life.

366
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,240
- I think that the horse is gonna explode on impact right now.

367
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,400
Nope, didn't work.

368
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,680
All right.

369
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,880
- Well, we should-- - The metaverse gone crazy, y'all.

370
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,360
- Is this the metaverse, technically?

371
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,200
That's the thing, they did all this--

372
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,320
- This is the metaverse.

373
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,160
- The horizon worlds and shit.

374
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,580
None of that shit is touching this, man.

375
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,240
And this game's 20 years old.

376
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,620
- And it's goaded.

377
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,420
- This is actually the metaverse,

378
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,040
and it's been around for a long time, guys.

379
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,540
We don't need these work-from-home fools.

380
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,200
People make a living playing this game.

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,220
70, I looked it up, there's $70 million a year

382
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,260
that is cashed out from this game.

383
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
- Oh my God.

384
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,220
- By people who are like--

385
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,340
Who like--

386
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,460
sell stuff. You sell stuff. You can be a landlord. You can be an escort. You can be a landlord.

387
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,360
You can sell like clothes. There are shops. People will complain and be like, "The shop

388
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,700
I went to, their interface was horrible." Yeah, and I don't want to alarm you guys, but

389
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,620
I'm completely in space right now. Well, it's high up enough that you're in space? Yes, I'm

390
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,540
seeing other planets. I think that is somewhat alarming to me. I'm looking at a sky dome.

391
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,980
Oh, you can rent a skydome in here.

392
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,260
That is crazy.

393
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,100
- Can I tell you guys something that I did

394
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,420
in the real world this weekend

395
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,220
that basically demonstrates why second life is superior?

396
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,060
- Yeah, why?

397
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,900
- So this weekend I went to Coney Island

398
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,580
to the amusement park.

399
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,620
- Okay.

400
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,460
- Me and my fiance, we were riding a bunch of all the rides

401
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,780
and we were having a rather lot of fun on them,

402
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,140
spinning around and twirling and writing down

403
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,640
uh... which sounds great right

404
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,080
well we get on this one ride

405
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,860
at the end well we're waiting in line for this one right

406
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,940
as little girl comes up to my fiance and starts is talking to her and being like

407
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,300
have you guys been on this is right before this reds awesome all i just want

408
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,860
you to sleep with some talking and then she's like

409
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,960
she like started singing she is a like

410
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,840
uh... and that she said

411
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,940
my name is harmony

412
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,300
and i'm gonna be a singer

413
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,400
she followed us onto the ride and she has to sit with us

414
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,860
uh... and i think it's like okay sure

415
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,100
and then we got on the right and it's been around and swung around rather fast

416
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,820
and me and

417
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,460
i think i'd say both felt that we were going to completely throw up and puke

418
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,860
all over this little girl

419
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,240
and did you do it

420
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,260
we've just

421
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,980
so we're literally genuinely so close to both throwing up onto this small child

422
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,340
(laughing)

423
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,660
- Who was completely alone.

424
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,540
- She would have never sang again, man.

425
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,060
- No, it would have completely ruined her entire fun

426
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,900
at Coney Island.

427
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,720
- If you had vomited--

428
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,460
- If I had been in second life, I would never have gotten

429
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,200
sick, I would have just been having fun.

430
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,980
And instead of a small 10 year old child approaching us,

431
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,300
it probably would have been a 50 year old man,

432
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,020
who I would have had a lot in common with

433
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,700
to talk about topics with.

434
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,260
- You could have talked about movies,

435
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,100
there's no kids allowed in this damn game,

436
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,300
it's 18 plus, y'all.

437
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,500
- Exactly.

438
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,500
- What would a puke in a haptic feedback suit feel like?

439
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,100
- I was thinking, see that's what I would,

440
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,860
probably amazing, well that's why,

441
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,740
you don't just need the outside for a haptic feedback suit,

442
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,100
it needs to be a balloon that you swallow.

443
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,340
- You know what, now that I think about it,

444
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,180
it should just be a body.

445
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,700
It should be a robot body that your soul goes into.

446
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,500
- Yeah, this is making way more sense than just the outs,

447
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,100
'cause the outside's only half the story

448
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,420
when it comes to living.

449
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,180
- Less than half, maybe.

450
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,220
- You need some kind of haptic feedback tube

451
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,700
that goes through all of your intestines,

452
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,220
through your stomach, one that sits in your heart.

453
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,660
You need a coating around every single organ

454
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,300
for it to be a true haptic feedback suit.

455
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,140
- Well, couldn't that just like,

456
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,140
couldn't that be, I mean, just kind of like an exoskeleton?

457
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,140
- No, you need a different-- - No, you need an endoskeleton.

458
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,120
- An endoskeleton, okay.

459
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
- You need a skeleton.

460
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,880
- I was thinking, I was imagining an exoskeleton

461
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,920
that has different tubes for different orifices,

462
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,680
like little things for your eyes,

463
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
something that goes in your butt, your urethra,

464
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,520
your ear holes. - You need to be able

465
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,880
to bite your fingernails.

466
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,760
- Yeah, that's true.

467
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,080
- Yeah, you need to be able,

468
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
the suit needs to be able to simulate

469
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,520
you biting your fingernails,

470
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,600
and also your fingernails getting shorter

471
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,880
when you bite them.

472
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,700
- Yeah. - Yeah.

473
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,540
- And gradually growing back.

474
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,920
It needs to really cover everything,

475
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
or else what's the point?

476
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,280
So I guess you're right, it should just be a robot.

477
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,120
Guys, speak--

478
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,900
- Cameron just became a girl.

479
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,740
- Wait, what?

480
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,840
- Just playing around with my avatar.

481
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,800
So just another thing you can do in Second Life,

482
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,120
no big deal.

483
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,080
- Well, Jubia, do you have my slides up?

484
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,000
I'll take that as a-- - Why are you sitting

485
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,820
over there now?

486
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,380
- As a, amazing.

487
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,920
You were talking about prostitution being an escort

488
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,480
earlier, Cameron.

489
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,320
- Oh yeah.

490
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,040
- Oh wait, actually, that comes later.

491
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,840
First of all, guys, so the community in this,

492
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
I wouldn't even call it a game,

493
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,360
the community in this world is very strong.

494
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,680
But what breaks down communities in first life?

495
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,040
- The rumor weed. - Infighting.

496
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,580
- The rumor weed, guys. - Yes.

497
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,680
- The rumor weed is a disgusting weed

498
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
that we need to get rid of,

499
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,320
but there is a website called Virtual Secrets

500
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,640
on which people share the juiciest of Second Life gossip,

501
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,960
and I wanna show this to you guys.

502
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,440
This is, "Virtual Secrets is one of the most

503
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,700
"highly debated topics in the Second Life community,

504
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,460
"at least for a percentage of users that read/participate

505
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,780
"in blogging within the community.

506
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,080
"Secrets are submitted to the website anonymously

507
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,560
"and are posted by the moderator.

508
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,740
"There is no fact-checking."

509
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,820
- Not that different from the real world, if you ask me.

510
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,960
Consider this website a digital supermarket tabloid

511
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,140
for virtual worlds.

512
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,360
In fancy terms, secrets are user-generated content

513
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,560
submitted for a moderator to post without checking details.

514
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,420
In 2008-- - This is TMZ.

515
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,640
- This is TMZ.

516
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,340
In 2008, Virtual Secrets started and has become

517
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,420
one of the most popular gossip, rag,

518
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,300
slam book style sites about Second Life.

519
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,100
If you don't like what you see here,

520
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,940
You can close the browser.

521
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,260
Holy shit, that's some Tyler the Creator shit.

522
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,940
Lords, you are forever my girl, I will miss you.

523
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,780
Which I'm guessing is one of these two beautiful women

524
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,220
at the bottom of the page.

525
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,040
So I wanna show you--

526
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,700
- I'm guessing it's the one at the bottom.

527
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,300
- I wanna show you guys some of these

528
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,300
gossip/ragslack/slambook style slams.

529
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,140
Number 11, this is from the most recent week.

530
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,460
This is a meme and it's two buttons.

531
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,080
One says, "Take one for the team."

532
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,560
And the other says, "Fuck Emily at the Villa

533
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,440
or we all get banned."

534
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
And then the sweating guy says,

535
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
"She has a bigger cock than me."

536
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,560
So this is a, I guess, some kind of situation

537
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,640
that's going on this week in Second Life

538
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,320
at the Villa with Emily,

539
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,880
because there's a bunch of these posts about Emily.

540
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,280
This next one is Bernie Sanders,

541
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,240
and it says, "The real Emily from the Villa."

542
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,520
And it's Bernie Sanders saying,

543
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,120
I'm once again asking, "Fuck me or I ban you and your friends."

544
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:57,560
And then this one is the exit, the car veering through the exit photo.

545
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,440
And going straight is, "But don't tell my boyfriend, okay?"

546
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,840
The exit is, "Fuck me or I ban you and your friends."

547
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,040
And the car is me running from Emily at the villa.

548
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,480
I'm not sure I've even processed this one.

549
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,380
This one seems like it was created wrong because wouldn't they be running towards...

550
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,180
These are not professional meme makers, man.

551
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,260
These are just people trying to do slam books.

552
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
Uh-huh.

553
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,140
Well, I think this one is a whiff.

554
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,720
This one is a little bit of a whiff, but this next one, guys, this one's good.

555
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,100
This is "Fuck Emily or Draw 25" and then "Every Guy at the Villa Has a Bunch of Uno Cards."

556
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,640
"At the Villa," man.

557
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,880
So I think that we need to go check out the villa at some point.

558
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah we gotta check out the villa.

559
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,760
Cause I wanna meet this Emily, maybe we get an exclusive interview or something.

560
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Yeah.

561
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,800
Yeah, we'll have her on to defend her honor.

562
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,240
This is, so apparently people in Second Life make Facebook profiles for, not themselves

563
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,420
but for their characters, their alter egos.

564
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,520
And this is Josh Dyed who made a post that says "People when it's Black Power and a smiling

565
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,560
guy.

566
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,660
when it's white power and a raging guy.

567
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,840
I find it very interesting how you guys like to give creators the benefit of the doubt

568
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,840
when they are being racist, but when a creator makes a mistake on a product, y'all go on

569
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
a crusade.

570
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Maybe because throwing racism around at the drop of a hat subtracts from and is an insult

571
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,240
to actual instances of racism.

572
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,880
If you're okay with one race empowering themselves, showing pride, etc. and not another and leap

573
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,160
to associate only one with racism, then congratulations, you are the problem, you have prejudice in

574
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,960
your heart.

575
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,200
So guys, there is, this is, a lot of people think that they could go to second life to

576
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,920
escape this racial world.

577
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,660
It's not going to work, buddy.

578
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,480
It's racial in here, too.

579
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,100
It's just as, if not more racial, in this second life.

580
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
That's insane.

581
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,600
Sarah Mercury from WAP, whiny ass pig.

582
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,760
Bitch, you ain't no Barbie, I see you work at Arby's.

583
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,240
One big room full of fat bitches.

584
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,000
Bullying is never okay, unless it's me doing it behind your back.

585
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,300
there is a seat that says pig bitch big farts.

586
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,140
- That is a--

587
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,880
- This is completely an Instagram style meme.

588
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,200
- Yeah, I mean look at that,

589
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,340
that's a parody of Kreashan's Gucci Gucci in there.

590
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,840
And then, who is Sarah from Mercury WAP?

591
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,960
Or Sarah Mercury, what is WAP?

592
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,160
I want to know all this stuff.

593
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,260
- I'm guessing this is one of these worlds.

594
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,100
But WAP I guess stands for--

595
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,760
- Wet ass pussy, that's what I heard that stands for.

596
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,360
- Whiny ass pig is what it,

597
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,420
See, that's what it stands for in first life.

598
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,700
In second life, this is whiny ass pig.

599
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,780
- I honestly, and that's maybe the one thing

600
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,380
where I like first life better than the second life.

601
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,300
- Same. - Damn, Cam!

602
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,280
You crazy!

603
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,300
- And then I think this is the last gossip one.

604
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,300
This is a picture of a child named Bubbles Blep.

605
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,680
(laughing)

606
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,860
Bubbles Blep.

607
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,980
It says, "What did she even do to everyone

608
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,140
to make them hate her so much. Genuinely curious, it seems like she has the whole of all second

609
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,740
life communities backing her up. People in the last virtual secret said she did stuff

610
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,740
but what did she do exactly? So apparently Bubbles Blep is the center of some kind of

611
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:26,940
massive controversy right now. And I can't imagine being mad at this. This is just a

612
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,620
little ass kid, what could this kid possibly be doing? Yeah, it's Bubbles Blep. How could

613
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,120
- Why would you be mad at a kid named Bubbles, man?

614
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
- Bubbles, Bubbles Blip.

615
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,640
- Bubbles Blip. - What a name.

616
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,900
- Bubbles Blip.

617
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,420
So you were talking about escorting earlier

618
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,640
and being a prostitute as a way to make linden.

619
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,420
So I found this website called Second Life Adventures,

620
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,960
I think it's a blog spot,

621
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,080
and it's this woman, Caroline Takeda.

622
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,500
Caroline Takeda is a well-known name

623
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,160
in the virtual world of Second Life.

624
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,540
She is a blogger, porn producer, and escort girl who has made a name for herself in this

625
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,400
virtual world.

626
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,800
Okay, so let's read about some of her adventures.

627
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,240
She has a guide to doing escorting in Second Life.

628
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,200
And I was looking through it and it has just like some examples of some work she does.

629
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,240
How to make money as an escort girl in Second Life updated June 2022.

630
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,000
You are thinking about a career as an escort girl in Second Life?

631
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,360
Then you should read this post.

632
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,540
It gives you an insight into what you can expect working in this profession.

633
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,180
This is one of her stories.

634
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,820
"Caroline, sorry to bother you.

635
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,320
I'm a big fan and would love to discuss some escort services with you whenever you're available."

636
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,720
This is Kevin, and Kevin has nothing in common with George at all.

637
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,800
The thing is, the title is "Not Every Client is George Clooney."

638
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,240
So she's saying this guy has nothing in common with Mr. Salt-N-Pepper.

639
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,960
He did not even want to look like the pretty and famous.

640
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,320
Instead he created an avatar that resembles pretty much the type he is in real life.

641
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,080
The result is a heavily overweight guy.

642
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,400
I really enjoyed reading about all your adventures on the blog.

643
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,480
It's super hot.

644
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,640
The fact that you escort me and that I have the opportunity to be with you makes it even

645
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
hotter.

646
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,480
I just like the whole experience in general.

647
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,400
In fact, I get most of my clients either via this blog or via my profile on our escort

648
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
website.

649
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,940
Kevin booked me for an hour.

650
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,920
He actually considers himself a groupie.

651
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,220
i like that

652
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,480
so here's a photo of him and of her and kevin

653
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,160
uh...

654
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,720
this

655
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
i have since you're dead

656
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,160
uh... this is

657
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,320
this is an example of a standard sex job this is

658
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,440
i'm guessing is fat as you can possibly make it

659
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,240
perfect for itself

660
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,340
no you can walk around i think you're pretty crazy with it

661
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,040
i've not seen anybody have this kind of body

662
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,360
but the uncensored photo, he has a bright pink

663
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,920
little tiny cock and she is holding it.

664
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,420
And there's a lot more photos from this engagement.

665
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,640
And I would really quickly like to say,

666
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,200
so her services cost 1,000 Linden an hour.

667
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,280
- Okay, what's that in real life dollars?

668
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
- How much is real life dollars into Linden?

669
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,720
- I looked it up, 1,000 Linden is $3.

670
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,560
(laughing)

671
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,840
$3 an hour.

672
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,480
She has sex with guys that don't look

673
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,100
exactly like George Clooney.

674
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,480
Here's another one.

675
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,920
One of my regular clients is very imaginative

676
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,560
and a bit of a pervert.

677
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,400
Every time he hires me--

678
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,520
- Maybe it's Cameron's rival here.

679
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,360
- You think this is Cameron?

680
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,400
Oh, it could be pervert one.

681
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,720
Every time he hires me,

682
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,040
he comes up with another kinky thing to do.

683
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,640
For some of his dirty fantasies,

684
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,920
it would be rather difficult

685
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,760
to find a non-professional partner.

686
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,540
That's a job for a professional sex worker.

687
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,760
The last time I met him,

688
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,200
he made me kneel in a dirty stall of a pig's die.

689
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,360
I sat right between a couple of pigs

690
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,520
to serve him as a dirty sex toy.

691
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,320
I had a long shower after that one.

692
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,140
And let's look at a photo from this experience.

693
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,800
Sex in a pig's die.

694
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,120
Fucked in a pig's die.

695
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
So this is, she's having--

696
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,240
- But the pigs are there.

697
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,080
- There's pigs.

698
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,920
- She's waiting for the pigs.

699
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,680
(laughing)

700
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,560
She's having sex in front of a bunch of pigs.

701
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,740
And also there's a guy in the back.

702
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,020
I caught this, I was censoring this photo,

703
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,620
and I caught this at the last second.

704
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,140
There's a guy just laying on a bale of hay

705
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,820
with a beer and he had his cock out.

706
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,320
So this guy, I guess this is some kind of--

707
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,140
- The guy's just chilling and watching, I guess.

708
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,060
- He's just chilling, yeah.

709
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,660
There's no, you know, you don't have to wear clothes in this.

710
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,500
But that's sex in a pigsty.

711
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,580
- Oh, it's not the real world.

712
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,540
- And then this is, I think, my favorite thing I've found

713
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,700
on her website.

714
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,580
This is the fucking rat.

715
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,180
Ever had sex with a furry in Second Life?

716
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,420
And so-- - The fucking rat.

717
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,740
- For the audio listeners, this is a photo

718
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,380
of a kind of a brooding rat wearing a leather jacket,

719
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,980
jeans, and some boots at what looks to be a cafe

720
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,620
or a restaurant.

721
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,380
And he's kind of looking mysterious.

722
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,860
The chair is too big.

723
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,080
It's not made for a rat, this is a human chair.

724
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,780
And so this guy, this is not somebody paying to have sex

725
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,060
with Mrs. Makeda, or Takeda, Caroline.

726
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,060
This is somebody who is trying to become an escort, okay?

727
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,640
- Oh.

728
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,460
- Do you want to do the rat?

729
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,560
A question I received from the Sleen.

730
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,400
That's her partner.

731
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,500
- The Sleen?

732
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,660
- The Sleen.

733
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,060
- What the hell are you talking about?

734
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,780
Apparently we received an escort application

735
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,440
via the form on the website

736
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,620
from a furry portraying a rat-human hybrid, a male rat,

737
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,300
which is why the Sleen didn't want to conduct the interview.

738
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,100
The Sleen is male.

739
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,420
Come on, I said.

740
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,240
You have experience with half humans.

741
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,580
Remember Felmane, which goes to a 404,

742
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,420
so this is a deleted page.

743
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,300
He replied, "She was a half cat

744
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,500
"and a hot teenager in real life."

745
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,820
That is the opposite of a male rat, don't you think so?

746
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,060
All right, I did the interview.

747
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,540
I met him at the reception area in the office,

748
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,980
casually dresses in jeans, simple top,

749
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,340
and my favorite boots.

750
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,620
Nothing too sexy, just like the girl next door.

751
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,460
- The male fucking rat was dressed like the girl next door.

752
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,980
- I wanted to make sure to create a strictly professional,

753
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,580
non-sexual impression.

754
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,940
Didn't want him to think about sex with me at all.

755
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,080
No, I don't do rats.

756
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,520
Call me rodent phobic, but no.

757
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,580
The rat was very pleasant to talk to.

758
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,260
I learned quite a bit about the furry communities that day.

759
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,000
Yes, they do have sex as well.

760
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Apparently it's quite a thing.

761
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Maybe we discovered a niche here.

762
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,160
So now she's interested.

763
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,800
I invited him to the Sky apartment after a bit.

764
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,580
No, not for sex, just for a bit more relaxed,

765
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,840
less cold ambiance,

766
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,240
continuing our talk over a bottle of wine.

767
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,560
And then this is a photo of her having wine with the rat.

768
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,360
and it's called, I cropped the caption out,

769
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,360
but it's called, "Nothing wrong with a glass of wine, right?"

770
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,320
- I bet one thing led to another, doesn't it?

771
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,680
- Well, you'll see here pretty soon.

772
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,280
He did raise the question though,

773
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,920
"Isn't it the Sleen who typically does

774
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,160
"the interviews and casting?

775
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,360
"Are you doing it because I'm a male?"

776
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,400
The Sleen. - The Sleen.

777
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,960
- "Are you doing it because I am male?"

778
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,180
"Yes, that's why," I replied.

779
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,440
"Are going to do the audition with me then?"

780
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,980
He continued.

781
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,760
"I noticed from our conversation,

782
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,780
"You know what you're doing.

783
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,820
"When it comes to emoting and role play,

784
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,660
"you are doing very well at that.

785
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,940
"And honestly, it would feel a bit weird

786
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,660
"to have sex with a half rat," I replied.

787
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,700
"Caroline, you are seen by many

788
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,180
"as the princess of sex in Second Life.

789
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,400
"Shouldn't you have tried everything at least once

790
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,700
"to maintain that reputation?"

791
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,740
He did have a point there.

792
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,720
"I will think about it," I promised.

793
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,940
"Most importantly, get me some text

794
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,780
"and some nice pictures over

795
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,680
"so I can put you on the website."

796
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,040
- That is incredible half rat riz.

797
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,560
If a half rat man walked up to you in a bar

798
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,720
and he was hitting on you and you're like,

799
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,560
"I'm sorry, I'm not interested."

800
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,320
And he was like, "Shouldn't you try it?

801
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,000
"Don't you wanna try fucking a half rat at least once?"

802
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,840
A male rat.

803
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
- That only works in the second life.

804
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,280
The first life, almost no women would have sex

805
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,680
with a half rat.

806
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,720
- No, very small percentage of the community.

807
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,200
- A few days later.

808
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,320
Caroline, that sofa you wrote about as Michelle,

809
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,840
the ruckus let's smash couch one,

810
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,120
They released a bed now,

811
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,220
which is even better than the sofa.

812
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,640
I bought one for my own apartment.

813
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,680
This is from the rat.

814
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,760
That sparked my curiosity.

815
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
Mind sending me a taxi?

816
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,080
Would like to see that actually, I asked.

817
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,520
Which by the way, you can fly in this game.

818
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,640
And you can teleport in this game.

819
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,520
But she is taking a taxi.

820
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,880
- It's called stimulating the economy.

821
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,720
You know, you gotta--

822
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,920
- I guess you're right.

823
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,520
- The taxi drivers gotta make their lindens too.

824
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,480
- I can't imagine, if a prostitute is making three bucks

825
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,280
an hour, I can't imagine what a fucking

826
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,880
tachy driver makes in this game.

827
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,520
(laughing)

828
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,280
Seconds later, I was standing in his apartment.

829
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,160
Very different place, really.

830
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,420
It was on one of the upper floors of a building

831
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,320
providing living space to furries.

832
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,480
In fact, the entire region was offering a place to live

833
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,960
for the furry community.

834
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,180
There must be quite a big community when they build

835
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,840
entire regions for them.

836
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,120
The apartment as such reminded me at 80s architecture.

837
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,280
Very colorful, nicely decorated and spacious,

838
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,840
featuring living room, bathroom, a kitchen,

839
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,440
and of course, a bedroom for sex fun.

840
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,200
That's where he--

841
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,720
- I guess that is interesting.

842
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,480
I never thought about it before,

843
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,360
but in second life, really the only reason

844
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,720
you do need a bedroom is for sex.

845
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,120
- Yeah, you're not sleeping?

846
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,280
- Yeah, it's only a sex room.

847
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,040
- Well, she does have another segment on this website

848
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,000
called AFK sex, which I guess is you can,

849
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,660
you can like when you go away or like log off,

850
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,660
you can put your character in a sex position

851
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,160
with another person, which is pretty awesome.

852
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,540
Also, apparently a big problem is that people make alts

853
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,060
and play on like two different windows

854
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,760
and pretend that they are like actually pulling

855
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,220
and like having sex with people,

856
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
but they're having sex with themselves,

857
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,300
which is a big problem if you look into virtual secrets,

858
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,000
guys a lot of gossip about this. That's crazy. Anyway, that's

859
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,400
where he had placed his new ruckus. Let's smash bed. He sat

860
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,500
on the bed and explain some features such as many more

861
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,300
cuddle animations than the sofa actually has. Okay. Let's test

862
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,800
them. I want to see the different animations. I heard

863
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,800
myself saying and added quickly. This does not count as

864
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,700
having sex. This is just testing the bed a strictly technical

865
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,700
I took off my clothes and joined him on the bed.

866
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,700
I noticed I made his tail twitch a little.

867
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
He couldn't hide a little excitement.

868
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,700
He could hide it. He's using the computer.

869
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
He had to click twitch tail.

870
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,700
He had to click on a button that said twitch my tail.

871
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,700
We went through the menu, pose by pose, to see what they were like.

872
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,700
He couldn't resist some sex talk and roleplay in between.

873
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Nor could I. The habit, I guess.

874
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,700
Here's some examples.

875
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,200
Guys, here's some examples of the ruckus let's smash bed with the rat.

876
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Okay, you ready?

877
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Okay, yeah.

878
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Okay.

879
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
So.

880
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,640
They're just testing the bed.

881
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,720
This is not sexual at all.

882
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,160
No, technical.

883
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:45,880
This rat, by the way, this is, I've censored these photos, this rat has a huge white dick.

884
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:54,520
a giant white penis coming out of this rat's body and he is taking he is making uh caroline's

885
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,960
having one of the best nights of her life depending i mean looking at these photos um

886
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,160
she's fucking this rat y'all and then this is a photo that is captioned getting fucked

887
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:15,040
by the rat honestly yes it was fun looking at the rat mounting me fucking me and getting

888
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,480
all excited about it and even ending in real life climax. No, it did not excite me sexually

889
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,280
or arouse me. I can certainly say it is not my thing, but at least I tried it once. I

890
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,600
can say now, I got fucked by a rat.

891
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Jesus.

892
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,840
So that's an amazing story from Caroline, guys.

893
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,440
That is such an inspiring and wonderful story for all the rats of the world.

894
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
If you're a rat...

895
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Rats, it's possible.

896
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Buddy, this is in your future.

897
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah, let me pull mine up here.

898
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Am I going next or...

899
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Oh, okay.

900
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Or actually, let me put it in slideshow mode.

901
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Okay.

902
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Oh gosh.

903
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Is this working?

904
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Can you see a blank white screen?

905
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yes.

906
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah.

907
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Okay.

908
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,640
Alright, here's what I found today.

909
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,400
So first of all, here's just one guy I found who had a bunch of posts, but I just threw

910
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
this in here.

911
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
This is Clive Steele.

912
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,360
He's on the Second Life forums.

913
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,400
He says, "To all the sick-" and his thing is that he does a bunch of italics and different

914
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,000
fonts and boldings and colors of text.

915
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
He likes to really spruce up his posts here.

916
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,320
"To all the sick twisted haters who've tried to make my life miserable on Second Life since

917
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,040
2010, I have a hot girlfriend and you can't knock me down.

918
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,400
Where's your (laughs in parentheses) girlfriend, oh keyboard warrior?

919
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Losers!

920
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
RFLMAO."

921
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,560
and then it's a picture of it looks like one of the twins from the matrix without

922
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:51,120
the dreads riding a motorcycle behind a woman who has a very low-cut shirt and

923
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:58,520
big things yeah that looks like Eminem dude yeah it does wearing matrix glasses

924
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,080
in the man a matrix robe I just really liked that he was I liked he's riding

925
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
behind the girl.

926
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:12,360
I thought that was really funny.

927
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:18,800
And then someone replied to him and said, how much did she cost?

928
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,840
And he said, how about you PM me your address and we take it from

929
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,280
there? Oh, we can have and then a fist emoji. I just thought cowardly

930
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,560
calf went crazy. That is cowardly calf. Incredible.

931
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,920
Here's a post.

932
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,200
uh...

933
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,620
most discriminated against group of avatars this is by female winslet

934
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,680
uh... and female winslet says furry hate is pretty legendary in second life and

935
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,000
i've always assumed that furries were probably the most hated and

936
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,240
discriminated against group in second life but recently i have wondered if

937
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
that is true

938
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,500
thoughts on who it might be and why

939
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,600
uh... and then a bunch of people had different ideas besides furries on who

940
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,560
was the most hated group of people in second life and there's a bunch of

941
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,360
groups of people in second life i didn't even know existed

942
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
we got of course balloon pilots.

943
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,600
(laughing)

944
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,160
There's so many of these that I just don't understand

945
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,840
what it could possibly mean.

946
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,240
But Anna Nova says, "Balloon pilots,

947
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,160
"you wouldn't believe how many ban lines

948
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,760
"and worse still, zero delay security orbs there are.

949
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,660
"I think anything that has a range more than 100 meters

950
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,120
"should be banned by the TOS

951
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,520
"to react faster than 10 seconds."

952
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,440
I have no clue what that could possibly mean,

953
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,040
but this person thinks balloon pilots

954
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:36,040
are very discriminated against in Second Life. We also have vampires. "No biting signs in

955
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,280
many public areas are one thing, but often this extends to 'no' insert brand name vampires.

956
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,080
You will be staked. I've managed to avoid becoming a vampire despite my home RP sim seemingly

957
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,840
morphing into a vampire RP plays, but hold no ill will towards vampires and have only

958
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,840
rarely encountered rude ones who try to bite random people." It's so funny to me that this

959
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,840
person is running a home roleplay simulator and it just gets invaded.

960
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,840
Yeah, I can't fucking stop running into these vampires.

961
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,840
They're just trying so hard not to become a vampire.

962
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,840
Well also, good on him for not giving into the hate there.

963
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:18,600
He's like, "No, these are good, hard-working people, even though they're invading my random

964
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,440
RP and trying to bite me."

965
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,480
It is so fucking funny that you could be like, "I want to join Second Life.

966
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,840
I want to roleplay.

967
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,440
I want to be I want to be the owner of a 7-eleven. I want to

968
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,340
run a 7-eleven and somebody else's fantasy can just completely

969
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,840
encroach on yours and be like we're a bunch of werewolves and

970
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,340
we're going to come.

971
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,940
You're working at your job. Yeah, it does seem like the

972
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,240
entire the entire game. If you can just be a vampire in

973
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,840
anything, then the entire game is a vampire RP. Yeah, it is

974
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,440
and vampires are one of the default options for avatars. I

975
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,040
noticed here's another one. I am an elf and run two Sims and

976
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,940
a store of my own and I am also a guard on two other Sims most

977
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,820
people we have ever had to ban have been human avatars. In fact, I would go so far as to say

978
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:04,600
that 95% of those who incur a ban are human avatars. But we do not ban humans. Just because

979
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,540
one or two of an avatar type may do something wrong does not mean they all need to be banned.

980
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,860
Judge the individual, not the whole type. So this is a rare example of a non-racist

981
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:20,420
elf. Wow. An elf who doesn't want to ban all humans. Are most second life elves racist?

982
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,420
Is that why you're saying that?

983
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,980
I have no idea, but I just said that.

984
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,860
But it seems like maybe they are to me.

985
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,580
The latest folks to be discriminated against in Second Life are flyers.

986
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,980
Y'all flyers have been discriminated against recently.

987
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,300
True, we almost got banned from this server for flying.

988
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,300
I am now getting booted from many sims because I'm in fly mode when I tp in and I don't land

989
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,820
fast enough.

990
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,020
Flyers should not be discriminated against.

991
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,820
it's not right this to this isn't a group of people who got

992
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,420
discriminated against, but this is a little every forum thread

993
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,020
and second life completely derails into an insane argument

994
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,140
that I don't understand at all for like at least one full page

995
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,740
and the results are always so insane. I read another I didn't

996
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,940
put this part in, but another that I was reading just randomly

997
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,240
became an argument about whether Islam is an okay religion. It

998
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,840
was like it was like a thread that was like what are you

999
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:22,300
today. But this this argument that came into this thread was so somebody said I

1000
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,420
would expect an officer of a role play sim will be better in drawing the line

1001
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,940
between in character and out of character but then again you said you

1002
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,460
were just office here because of personal relations so whatever and this

1003
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,020
person replied and said I find that many people in Second Life take their RP way

1004
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,220
too seriously when I tell people I don't RP they go but but but Second Life is

1005
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,820
all RP in the demon RP sim there was a rule that no one was allowed to play with

1006
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:50,580
a demon's private pet. If someone asked me if it was okay to play with a demon's private

1007
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,900
pet, I'd say, "Well, it's against the rules, but if you can find a willing pet, go for

1008
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,940
it." It was none of my concern if they wanted to incur the wrath of a demon. That would

1009
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,740
actually make for a better RP experience than just following the rule. Then, if the demon

1010
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,380
came back to me, I'd tell him it wasn't my problem if he couldn't keep his or her pets

1011
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:11,020
in line. So there was basically a giant argument in this thread about whether it should be

1012
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,140
allowed

1013
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,620
to this uh... play with the demons private pet and what officers should do

1014
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,800
about it

1015
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,080
this side or emerald person is somebody that i i kept seeing a lot on the forms

1016
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,820
it's a lot of uh... people who to are very active

1017
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,500
what appears a lot of stuff

1018
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,260
it's incredible

1019
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,180
then another more another discriminated against group of people

1020
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:40,180
so the no says no answer for you to scrimmage

1021
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,180
I really love soda gnomes.

1022
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,180
No extra details.

1023
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,180
Gnomes are pretty discriminated against.

1024
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,180
Do you primarily use a human avatar?

1025
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:56,180
By Gopi Passiflora.

1026
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,180
Moira Kathleen says, "I'm primarily human.

1027
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,180
Once in a while, maybe a couple of times a year,

1028
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,180
I'll go around as a dinky for a week or two."

1029
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,180
I googled what a dinky is,

1030
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,180
and it's a little anthropomorphic cat.

1031
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,180
And this is one of the first results on Google

1032
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,820
dinky's Navi avatar

1033
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,620
And to use this Navi dinky avatar you need the dinky kitty avatar

1034
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,820
Okay, so don't be trying to use the Navi without the dinky kitty. Yeah, you need the dinky. There's levels to this shit

1035
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,580
If you think that you don't need a dinky. But it seems like dinkys are pretty popular right now

1036
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:31,300
Yeah, what do you say? If you think you don't need a dinky buddy, you better do some dinky. You got another thing coming

1037
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,340
Is there a shi- is there an oblock RP?

1038
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,340
*laughter*

1039
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,300
like there is a lot i had a good but i didn't put some input there were people

1040
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,780
complaining about people acting gangster

1041
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,020
yeah

1042
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,540

1043
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,620
about a year this shit up

1044
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,720

pursuing a relationship with a human at the moment. Wow. And here in this picture

1070
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:11,340
you can better see Sodanome's full outfit. He's got a gnome from the waist up only.

1071
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:16,900
Yeah, he's got a classic garden gnome head with the beard, kind of a cone hat

1072
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:25,580
pulled down over his eyes. His shirt is of all over print of a lion. He's wearing

1079
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,980
so to know i'm so just keep this remember so that i was going to come back period

1080
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,700
for the hope is that every single threat of this website is talking about the

1081
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,620
people who

1082
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,540
uh...

1083
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,340
need ideas for a male punk abby i'm thinking of using johnnie rotten of the

1084
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,820
sex pistols in his prime as a possible influence

1085
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,960
i know my punk did love a mohawk in a black vest of some sort what other

1086
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,860
necessities

1087
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,220
does the punk aesthetic have

1088
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,460
and so to know says

1089
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,740
I made a Johnny Rotten who is 600 years old and a gnome.

1090
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,220
(laughing)

1091
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,880
- I see it, 7-Eleven!

1092
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,980
- This is a gnome who's at 7-Eleven

1093
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,780
wearing full rainbow clothing

1094
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,060
and has a rainbow mohawk that's about the height of his body.

1095
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,220
- And it's also poking out of his hat.

1096
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,220
He still has a hat. - Oh my God.

1097
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,260
- Yeah.

1098
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,420
- That is incredible.

1099
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,780
- That's so to gnome 600 year old Johnny Rotten.

1100
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,180
How does your second life look today?

1101
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,500
i'm starting this thread so we can post pics of absolutely anything we like in

1102
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,900
second life a rock

1103
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,660
a set of stairs our homes

1104
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,160
your nose whatever

1105
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,120
i'm starting with a couple of pics from the island as it is now

1106
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,700
so yeah this is going to be a little picture heavy but i'll paint a picture

1107
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,980
with all the same for everyone

1108
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,660
and this is from bagnew

1109
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,620
so to know

1110
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,620
so to know it says

1111
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:14,060
the rainbow gnome a new superhero was born and it's his same rainbow johnny

1112
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:22,220
rotten gnome but he's flying through the clouds. Then we have do gay or bi women

1113
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:27,380
outnumber straight women in Second Life a question asked by Sam's Byron. Someone

1114
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,700
said Beth Quandar says women running male avvies are way better lovers than most

1115
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,080
guys and Sodanome says not gnome males.

1116
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,400
Damn, Sodanome getting after it. Yeah, he can't find a female gnome though he has

1117
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,080
to date humans. He's got to be the biggest celebrity in Second Life. Yeah, I did find

1118
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:54,400
another throw where people were like, "Sodanome sighting!" That's amazing. Wait, we need to

1119
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,760
add him. Yeah. "What are you doing today?" Okay, this is the, I think this is the one

1120
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:07,600
that's kind of picture heavy. By Kasumi Ravenheart. Zanessa posts Sunday morning cartoons and

1121
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,200
it's a woman in in

1122
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,080
the job of very revealing pajamas and back

1123
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,120
on a apollo

1124
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,000
you know i don't know what i'm doing room with a gigantic probably two hundred

1125
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,120
inch tv on the wall and she's watching family guy on the fox website

1126
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,320
it's not her t_v_ while

1127
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,840
it's so funny to imagine

1128
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,320
well first of all watching family guy for funds for sunday morning cartoons but

1129
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,120
then also having a giant as t_v_ and instead of was watching it show you pull

1130
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,160
it up on a website

1131
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:42,920
on the TV. So here's Zanessa again back in her living room watching classics. She's

1132
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,360
watching I Love Lucy I think on her TV. She just likes TV, she likes Family Guy and

1133
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,400
the classics. Beautiful modern home too. Yeah it's wonderful I mean look at

1134
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,200
the wall. Wow. That's exactly the kind of wall you want in a house is a rugged

1135
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,320
outdoor type of stone wall you might see in a garden. Zanessa, if you're

1136
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,520
- Zanessa, it's not all fun and games for Zanessa.

1137
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,080
Sometimes there's work to be done.

1138
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,280
And here she is alone in a meeting room

1139
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,840
and she's working on a website called Estequely Virtual.

1140
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,280
And it looks like she's working hard on her laptop.

1141
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,780
- Maybe she's some kind of real estate agent.

1142
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,200
- It seems like that could be the case, yeah.

1143
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,800
- Zanessa, if you're listening to this,

1144
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,720
please add Cameron Fetter on Second Life.

1145
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,800
He can show you the world.

1146
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,960
- Zanessa, you're gonna like him a lot.

1147
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,560
he's gonna take you out of this hustle and bustle of the workforce.

1148
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,160
You're gonna watch cartoons all day, baby girl.

1149
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,720
This thread is like hundreds of pages long and most of it is exactly like people with

1150
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,840
women avatars who are wearing bikinis and they're just doing mundane everyday stuff

1151
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,160
with their kids out.

1152
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,340
It's pretty crazy.

1153
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:55,920
But it's also stuff like Orwar who posts, "Just sitting in my living room listening to the

1154
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,600
sparkling of the fireplace, the ticking and chiming of my clock, and the soft music of

1155
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
the harpsichord playing away.

1156
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,580
And it's in a room that's almost completely pitch black.

1157
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:10,080
You can just see him sitting in a very ornate chair next to a gramophone.

1158
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,600
He's there, does he have a fucking gramophone?

1159
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,280
This is kinda scary.

1160
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,320
I don't think I would want to join this guy.

1161
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,200
He's a carnivore.

1162
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,920
Yeah, it says "concupescent carnivore" is his bio.

1163
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,760
I don't want anything to do with Orwar.

1164
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,560
sparkling of the fireplace and that listening to the ticking and chiming of

1165
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,200
my clock

1166
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,080
you don't get stuff like that now it is that's all uh... nine-dollar box don't

1167
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,520
take or chan

1168
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,660
only girl

1169
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,220
my three painting for the cultivate homes for a troops auction fundraiser

1170
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,040
are finished and set up in the gallery i will get more info to you all if john

1171
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,760
doesn't post in the art section as soon as i get it

1172
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,120
so here we have

1173
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,120
uh... a woman who's standing in front of these gigantic twenty foot tall paintings

1174
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,560
that she's made of

1175
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:01,400
a woman holding an american flag a woman dancing on jupiter and a woman maybe

1176
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,660
turning into radiation waves

1177
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,100
yeah something

1178
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,440
uh... and they're beautiful

1179
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,920
and they're going to the troops

1180
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,320
uh... but tell you

1181
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:16,160
now i'm sitting in a birdcage watching a giant baby

1182
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,640
oh my god

1183
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,080
uh... that is a scary baby

1184
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,080
sitting in a birdcage and she's watching a giant baby

1185
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,600
If you can be small and gnome-like, can you also choose to become a humongous giant?

1186
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,120
This is a problem in Second Life.

1187
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,700
This is the number one thing people complain about, is that height creep.

1188
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,920
People have gradually been making their avatars taller and taller, where people will complain

1189
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,880
they have an original avatar from when they first logged in years ago, they join now and

1190
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,880
it's like half the size of everybody else.

1191
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,600
Because everyone keeps making their things bigger and bigger.

1192
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,000
It's been an issue.

1193
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,120
inflation or deflation or something but with height it's something flation it's

1194
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,840
something flation on this is my last one this is from Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte

- Yeah, he looks very, very cool.

1200
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,440
I'm not gonna lie, he looks cool.

1201
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,880
I wish I knew how to change my avatar.

1202
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,720
- Yeah.

1203
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,160
All right, so, hold on,

1204
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,720
let me start sharing my screen real quick.

1205
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,360
So, I got very interested

1206
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,100
in the political inner workings of Second Life.

1207
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,680
I wanted to know what everyone on this website,

1208
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,840
where they lean, you know?

1209
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,760
I was starting to look for stuff.

1210
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,640
and i saw this post from twenty twelve

1211
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,820

1213
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,280

1216
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,480

1217
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,000
a kind of scary

1218
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,020
doesn't but does it look familiar to you

1219
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,780
uh...

1220
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,320
no who does that look like

1221
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,540
do you guys

1222
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,740
i think that this

1223
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,040
is in alias

1224
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,280
an alien ron de santis all my god the overlay look

1225
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,540
look at how this line is a shit

1226
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,660
i think that this is ron de santis in second life

1227
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,240
it looks almost exactly like him

1228
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,120
Isn't this fucking crazy?

1229
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,280
- This is pretty crazy.

1230
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,700
- Wait, but this is claiming he was not in the US.

1231
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,540
Now we have all three of them.

1232
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,360
- Well, no, no, no, that was Johan Ruh.

1233
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,160
Johan Ruh was not in the US.

1234
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,040
- Oh, okay.

1235
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,520
- This is Medhu Simone,

1236
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,520
which I think if you jumble those letters around,

1237
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,360
it may spell Ron DeSantis.

1238
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,620
- Is that true?

1239
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,960
- Yeah, if you jumble them

1240
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,240
and turn them into different letters,

1241
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,960
it'll be Ron DeSantis.

1242
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,220
It's the same amount of characters.

1243
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:16,220
this next one. Politically neutral alternatives to black lives matter. I want to support racial

1244
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:20,940
equality, reduce instances of racial prejudice, and generally live in a more accepting society,

1245
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,820
safe, inclusive world for everybody. So I should support BLM, right? Well, I don't think

1246
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:31,020
so. BLM is a registered organization that openly described themselves as subscribing

1247
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:37,820
to many elements of Marxism. And I didn't read the whole thread, but here's a moderator

1248
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:43,140
saying this topic may this topic seem to have gotten off topic so we're going to

1249
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:47,620
lock it please remember in the future to treat others with respect and follow our

1250
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,700
community standards when posting and replying on the forums.

1251
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,340
Can I throw something in here? I noticed a lot of locked threads and something I

1252
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:59,180
noticed is every single moderator and admin on the forum all have the name

1253
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:05,020
like first name Lyndon. Yeah Lyndon means like the creator was named like

1254
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:09,660
something Linden. I know so that's what all the all the mods and you have to

1255
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:15,380
join the the Linden family. Yeah. To become a mod. It's a family affair. Yeah. It's a mafia.

1256
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:23,900
It's a family business. This next one. Looking for a Mesh Donald Trump avatar and Love

1257
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:30,020
Zhao Ying says if a jelly doll could wear an orange Cheeto that would come close.

1258
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:34,380
I think that John Oliver already said something like this. Yeah I think that

1259
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:40,140
they're just aping John Oliver here. I think you'd already call Donald Trump a jelly doll. Yeah a jelly doll wearing an orange Cheeto.

1260
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:48,140
Donald Trump you are a- Donald Trump is a jelly doll wearing an orange Cheeto!

1261
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,140
*laughter*

1262
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,140
Yep.

1263
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:59,860
Oh and that post was by Vanity Fair, so I think that there is a- I think Vanity Fair was planning something here.

1264
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:04,920
And they were gonna plan a smear campaign against 45. This next one

1265
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,540
Pedo hunter

1266
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:15,060
So sick of child avatars and adult zone skyboxes with kitty stuff in thinking of setting myself up as a pedo hunter and effectively

1267
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,420
Just hunt them out before anyone starts

1268
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:22,740
I'm not after your kid RP as far as I'm concerned your weird hobby is your is your own

1269
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:30,340
So long as it's not stripping down and getting intimate and Rhonda Huntress said taking the express train to Bandsville

1270
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,340
Eh?

1271
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,340
Good luck.

1272
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:37,060
Then, Sio Emerald said, "Have fun in your vicious circle of frustration."

1273
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:46,180
Which, then, Sparky Linden said, "This looks very similar to a thread that Tommy Linden

1274
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,940
just closed recently."

1275
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,220
And given the inappropriate nature of the title and the content of the thread, we're gonna

1276
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:55,180
go ahead and lock the thread this time.

1277
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:01,700
So if you try to become a pedo hunter in Second Life, it goes against some community guideline

1278
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,900
or something.

1279
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:17,980
Amber Frost, created by user Ja Porca, they said, "Do you think Amber Frost will start

1280
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,140
the socialist revolution in America?

1281
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:26,440
I have been watching close on YouTube and seeing him, she is turning everyone against Trump

1282
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,420
and is making $100,000 a month from her podcast.

1283
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:37,260
To which Cindy Evanier said, "Religion and politics, two subjects we have been told are

1284
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:43,580
best kept off the SL forums, which got 11 hearts and three rewards."

1285
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,420
She got three awards, I mean.

1286
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,420
That is crazy.

1287
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,420
Wow.

1288
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,420
Yeah.

1289
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:52,700
want to talk about Amber Frost or Chappo or any kind of left-leaning political

1290
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:57,740
stuff you will be banned from the forums or that I think this like thing was

1291
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:02,940
closed on this next one so then I stopped getting political and I started looking

1292
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:10,020
at the adult side of it and this is from Zappa Olchawi they said recommendations

1293
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:15,700
for penises and their post said hello everyone sorry for what must be a

1294
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:22,100
a frequent question, but I am newly a premium member and I want to get a good bleep.

1295
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,700
Could you refer me to a good previous thread or make suggestions?

1296
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:30,780
I currently have a delight bleep which is free, comes with a HUD, but the HUD seems

1297
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:36,940
to let others interact with my bleep, but I cannot cause it to be erect.

1298
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:41,740
For instance, could anyone recommend any very good penises that my avatar Zappa can make

1299
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,740
erect?

1300
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:47,940
especially looking for animated penises and not just Zappa licks Zappa's bleep.

1301
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:55,200
Thanks!" and then another person said "diaper bondage and institutional role

1302
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,940
play. I am into the whole intimate must wear, inmate must wear diaper and be

1303
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,740
restrained at all times thing but unfortunately many of the prisons on

1304
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:08,860
Second Life lack this. Furthermore I enjoy insane asylums and padded cells

1305
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:14,140
but I cannot find many on Second Life. Does anyone know places that may cater to

1306
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:19,820
these kinds of interests? Also, finally, what are the more unique prisons? A lot of

1307
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:22,820
them are too similar and I was just wondering if there are any that truly

1308
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:27,740
stand out. So there are prisons in Second Life where you can become just like a

1309
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:33,900
sexual diaper prisoner. I mean a padded cell is a big diaper. Yeah, it's one big

1310
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:39,880
diaper. That's true. That's why they call it a padded cell. Yeah. This next one, Big

1311
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,500
Boobs from 99spooner. Does anyone know a place to find busty girls to have sex

1312
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:51,480
with for free? Just wondering. And then here is an argument that I saw. So Leah36

1313
01:06:51,480 --> 01:07:00,280
said, "Me looks down. Um, do I needs implants?" And Charlie Muggins then said, "Given the

1314
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,680
way you express yourself, you're looking in the wrong direction.

1315
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:09,280
Then Madeline Blackbart said, "Wow, grammar Nazi-ing again."

1316
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,080
What's with all the grammar Nazis?

1317
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,960
Or are you the same one from last time?

1318
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,960
You do realize that she's using sarcasm here.

1319
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,640
The needs implants is supposed to be parody.

1320
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,320
Wow, this guy's white knighting.

1321
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,800
If you're going to do satire, you better make sure it's distinct from what you're parodying

1322
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,080
or else you might contribute to the issue.

1323
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:36,280
sad that the virus of white knighting has even gotten to second life oh yeah this

1324
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:41,960
is sad as fuck mm-hmm yeah what's this next one here Oh porn films in second

01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,660
all uploaded somewhere else oh my god we're all on the horse together now I

1350
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:19,300
have only one thing to say to you please get your ass in this world because it's

1351
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:25,780
popping off in this bitch. Leave the old world behind. The war, the disease, there's none

1352
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:30,820
of that here. There's vampires and people who dress up like kids. This is where you need

1353
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:36,100
to be guys. This is the ultimate youth group. Get here right now.

1354
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,100
Is there any way-

1355
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,300
We're flying around on a horse, motherfucker.

1356
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,300
Oh my god, this is amazing.

1357
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:46,060
Is there any way that we can make our own second life world? I'm sure this would cost a lot

1358
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,060
of money.

1359
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,060
It would be millions of Lindians.

1360
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,060
Yeah, it would be a lot of money.

1361
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,060
How much is this?

1362
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,060
Yeah.

1363
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,060
I'm ready to spend my entire life in here.

1364
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,060
I do love it. We're going to ride off into the sunset.

1365
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,060
Oh my god.

1366
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,060
We just got stuck on a billboard.

1367
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,060
Guardians of the Galaxy has just premiered.

1368
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,060
Oh my fucking god.

1369
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,060
We have to go to the movies right now.

1370
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,060
Alright.

1371
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,060
Alright, so come see us.

1372
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,060
Oh yeah, what are you going to say?

1373
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,060

Be here, YouTube.

1385
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,780
It's going to blow your fucking mind.

1386
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,700
Julio will put the teaser that I made right now.

1387
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:51,400
[music]

1388
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:58,600
Imagine to be on Halloween night, you think I'm going to dress up as a real

1389
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,200
actual lifestyle of a person. Yeah, I'm going to make someone's culture my

1390
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:08,000
costume. That's like me. That's like me dressing up like like my word

1391
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,060
happens.

1392
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:20,000
I'm going to start. I got to start saying my word again. Yeah, I think that I

1393
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,080
to start scoffing. I say my word sometimes I think.

1394
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:31,080
E-Gads. E-Gads is not as good as my word. Zoonz. Zoonz? You mean Zooks? No, you're thinking

1395
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:39,880
of Gadzooks. I'm saying Zoonz. That's Shakespearean. Zoonz? Z-O-U-N-D-S. Zoonz.

1396
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,480
I was like Zoonz and then Zoonz would be tunes to sounds. Zoonz is short for God's

1397
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,480
God's wounds.

1398
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,880
Yeah, that'd be like me dressing up like an emo.

1399
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,880
You took that long to think of that?

1400
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,120
It didn't feel, it wasn't that long.

1401
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,560
It was pretty long.

1402
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:04,320
And that'd be like me dressing up like an emo or a cinephile.

1403
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,320
You're dressed like a cinephile right now, a child cinephile.

1404
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,760
Okay.

1405
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,800
Just seen the new Winnie the Pooh movie.

1406
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,160
I've just seen

1407
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,600
rocking up to

1408
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,600
the kids

1409
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:26,100
standing up at the end of cars for Bravo.

1410
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:31,480
There's a report that the cars for Premiere got a 10 minute

1411
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,300
standing ovation from one guy.

1412
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,600
Yeah, like it's a fucking con

1413
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,800
Premiere.

1414
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,320
Nowhere is like a movie theater and fucking the first showing in Illinois.

1415
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,640
Got a 45 minute standing ovation.

1416
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,040
Couldn't get the guy out of the theater.

1417
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,200
From a man named Bruce Meese.

1418
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:56,640
Local film critic.

1419
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,000
