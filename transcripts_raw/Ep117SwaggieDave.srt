$100 a day to have a kid and you have to battle your son cuz he's trying to constantly make you come. Yeah

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,160
Get out of here you have to learn advanced SWAT techniques all sons are trying away

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,840
They're trying so hard to make their dad come until they turn 18. Yeah, that's what that um that

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,920
Ari aster short film is about yeah, oh, yeah, yeah the crazy thing about the crazy thing about that family

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Son in the dad never come

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,120
That's what he was referring to

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,140
Yeah, the dad actually was happy even though he looked sad

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,040
That's the strange thing about the story thing is he's my dad's frown is upside down. Yeah

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,800
Yeah, see my dad's did my dad's he's part chin so when he when he frowns

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,920
what the son does to the dad but it's actually there's one shot where you can

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,480
see their welcome mat actually says goodbye and that's that's what the

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,440
strange thing is that the title is referring to it's a happy birthday home

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,560
and it's from red bubble yeah it's kind of a it's kind of a strange thing that

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,600
nobody really I would say that's a pretty unrealistic movie because it is

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,920
all like doom and gloom when in real life it'd be like your dad like walks by

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,400
some yeah monstrous guttural noises we're having venison tonight by the way

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,400
yeah and then like two hours later it's like what are you talking about we never

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,440
said that yeah we never said we were gonna have venison I'm taking dad

75
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,240
outside and we're gonna have a little uh prime rib mm-hmm yeah remove one of

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:10,280
dad's two of dad's ribs and then I'm so he can suck my dick yeah that's the

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,200
car accident that we have to remove his ribs so he can even get down there.

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:24,360
No dude we're disgusting. We're nasty AF today. So a son and dad relationship

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,640
story I wasn't here for this but I got to work and somebody told me that the way

80
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,560
so we have like Slim Jim's at the counter and one of the guys I was working with

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,840
told me that a guy came in and bought 35 Slim Jims and he said and they're like

82
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,960
like wow that's a lot of Slim Jims he's like yeah my son loves them.

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,400
And then the best part of that is that there he bought 35 Slim Jims but there

84
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,720
were 36 in stock so he just left one Slim Jim. Like he was like no 36 that's way too much.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,600
I think we need to introduce this guy to slimjim.com. Yeah. Yeah, I think you could

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,640
probably order... How many Slim Jim's do you think you can order at once? I think if you

87
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,960
order over 30, if you order over 30 you probably like get a call from the CDC

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,600
because you're gonna bring some strange disease in your stomach. Right. If you

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,680
order over 35 you have to send in verification that you have two sons.

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,920
(laughing)

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,260
- You have to send your son's birth certificate.

92
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,720
- That's too much for one son.

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,140
- Two learner's permit.

94
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,880
- Two learner's permit, not the copies.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,140
So once they get that back, once they have that,

96
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,600
they can keep it if they want.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
- Yeah. - That's right.

98
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
- Yeah.

99
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
- But I, you know.

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,920
- Just imagine doing that with anything else.

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
- Yeah.

102
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
- Just buying just a shit ton of stuff.

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Ah, my kid.

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,720
- Yeah, my son.

105
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,560
- Yeah, sorry.

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,380
- Yeah, sorry.

107
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,220
- My son loves gum.

108
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,060
- Do you think that's a,

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,220
do you think it's worse to feed your...

110
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,460
(laughter)

111
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,980

- Sorry, these are my son's.

117
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,180
- That's why I had to buy them 400 count.

118
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,020
- Trust me, I don't use these, come on.

119
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,840
- Do you think it's--

120
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,820
- None for me, please.

121
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,260
- Do you think it's worse to be feeding

122
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,180

123
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,140

So let's see if we can break some records tonight.

208
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,000
Happy Sabbath.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,680
- Man, I've been-- - You guys excited for--

210
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,920
- For New York City, baby? - Yeah, I've been drinking

211
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,400
so much coffee.

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,180
- Yeah? - Nice, congrats.

213
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,020
- I know. - That's cool.

214
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,320
- It's changing me.

215
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,240
- Good. - What do you feel like it's,

216
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,280
how do you feel like it's changing you?

217
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,520
I don't, I, you don't get the, it does, Will described it like perfectly where it's like

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,060
monster energy, I don't want to just repeat what Will said, but it does feel like you

219
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,900
get poisoned when you drink Monster.

220
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Because you are getting poisoned.

221
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,520
Yeah, no, I feel like Monster gives you about 30 minutes of caffeine high and then like two

222
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,320
hours of, uh, of aspartame fuckin' mind buffs.

223
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,760
There's not aspartame in it, that's the thing.

224
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
It's some other sweetener.

225
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,280
yeah there's they don't have to list what's in it on the ingredients because

226
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,760
it's just dark magic right it is cast a spell on it before they I don't really

227
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,800
put it on the shelf I think the thing I really don't like about this about

228
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,080
energy drinks is that caffeine is an ingredient it's not like a feature yeah

229
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,480
like that means that they have a white caffeine powder that they pump into this

230
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,520
yeah mm-hmm is that horrifying up for you so they got

231
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,400
- It's got a freaking salt bae there, dude.

232
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,760
- It's definitely liquid caffeine.

233
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,880
- Yeah, they have salt bae.

234
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,600
- They have salt bae, freaking sprinkling caffeine in.

235
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
- He does that down his arm, that's his move.

236
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,080
- That's what's tasty about it, he does it on his elbow.

237
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,640
- It goes down his sleeve, it goes down his long sleeve

238
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,960
and up into his armpit,

239
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,000
and it comes out the bottom of his shirt.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,400
- Every day he marinates his arm in like a ginger soy sauce

241
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,560
for six hours.

242
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,800
- He's got miso paste under his armpits just for men to--

243
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,840
insanely wrinkly shiny pasty offer some that orange is my salt arm

244
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,480

245
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,960

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,680
little little Robin Williams doing it doing a vape.

251
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,280
I hit the jewel.

252
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I'm a ghost!

253
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm a ghost, I'm in your house.

254
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,280
I've been dead for five years.

255
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I'm in the wall.

256
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Look at me, I'm making the room cold.

257
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Has he been dead for five years?

258
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
No, I think it's six.

259
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,120
- Yeah.

260
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,160
- That one was a tough one for me, dude.

261
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
- Yeah, we've been over that.

262
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,280
- Have we been over this?

263
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,520
- Yeah, you listened to Maren on the beach.

264
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,000
- I listened to Maren twice in a row,

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,560
and walked on the beach.

266
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,720
- Yeah.

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,240
- God damn, dude, my life sucks.

268
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,400
- My life be like, ooh.

269
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,280
- My life be like, ooh.

270
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,520
(laughing)

271
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,880
- But you guys ready to come to New York City

272
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,720
in a couple of days?

273
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,280
- Yeah, I'm ready to go there and not have a panic attack.

274
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,320
- Take the big apple by storm.

275
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,440
- Be swag, dude.

276
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,600
I think indoor dining's about to start up.

277
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,440
- I'm not doing that.

278
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,140
- Yeah, I don't wanna do indoor dining.

279
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,720
Also public school-- - Not in New York.

280
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,360
- We could go to public school.

281
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,760
- Oh, okay, you wanna go there real bad, huh?

282
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
- I don't know, I miss Foursquare.

283
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
I miss being the king of something.

284
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,600
- All right, if that's your intention, then that's fine.

285
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,720
- You're gonna go play Foursquare and be the king

286
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640
and look for a queen at the public school?

287
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,120
- Yep. - Psyche.

288
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,240
- You're gonna say,

289
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,120
would anybody like to be my queen?

290
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
Would anybody like to be my crazy queen?

291
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,920
Excuse me, I am the four square king. Would anybody like to be my queen?

292
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I would not go there.

293
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Sir Caleb!

294
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
I would be the king of recess, dude. I just want to fuck the teacher.

295
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Is that so wrong?

296
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Is that so wrong? I just want to fuck my teacher.

297
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Is that a crime?

298
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
If fucking my teacher is a crime, then put me in jail.

299
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Put me in that university.

300
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
(laughter)

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,120
- Airdrop me in there.

302
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
- 'Cause I'm trying to commit a crime.

303
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
If fucking a teacher is a crime, then I'm doing that.

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,840
- I'm trying to commit a crime.

305
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,640
- If it's legal, I'm ghost.

306
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,960
I don't want anything to do with it if it's fine.

307
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,480
- Is it legal to fuck a, I know a guy who's a college

308
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
professor who fucks his students all the time.

309
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
Is that legal?

310
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,920
- No.

311
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
- I think it is.

312
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,120
- I don't think that's legal.

313
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,240
- I think it's against the school.

314
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,080
- You gotta stop hanging out with these.

315
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,680
- It's against the rules of the school.

316
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,060
I don't, I bet that, I feel like they probably have just policies at the college, I don't

317
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,180
think it's illegal, but I think it's probably like you're not supposed to do that and you

318
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,700
could get fired for it.

319
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
That makes sense.

320
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,300
It doesn't take that long for you to think about that.

321
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Yeah, I guess that does make sense.

322
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,900
So what's his full name?

323
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
What's yours?

324
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,580
Do you guys remember when that guy in our college killed himself?

325
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Yeah.

326
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,300
He was a student fucker?

327
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Yes.

328
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
No?

329
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,420
professor like fuck the student and then ran away yeah and ran away from home

330
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:33,620
that's it was sad but I won't say who it is but somebody told me they were they

331
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,780
were planning on going to like the school open mic and going up and doing

332
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,900
like an opening joke where's just like what's up with all these fucking rapist

333
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,900
professors killing themselves recently.

334
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:54,860
Jesus Christ. That is funny. Oh my god that's a funny joke. That's a funny one to me.

335
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,380
But yeah what are we gonna do when you guys get to New York? What's our first move?

- Child psychopathy in the virtual world.

455
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,880
- In the original Nintendogs, he could hit them,

456
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,840
it just would give you negative points.

457
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,280
- I was thinking about this the other day,

458
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,440
you know how like a warning sign for like psychopaths

459
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,880
and serial killers and stuff is if they like kill animals

460
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,520
or hurt animals when they're a kid?

461
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,880
Like before they figured that out,

462
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,720
were they just like, oh man, Timmy killed a cat,

463
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,080
that kid's a freak.

464
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,920
- That kid's kind of weird.

465
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,640
- That kid's a weirdo.

466
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
- Ah, what a little creep. - He's getting into biology.

467
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
What a little creepy.

468
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640

469
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Yeah, he wants to be a doctor.

470
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Oh, this guy's so stupid.

471
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
He doesn't realize you're supposed to pet a cat.

472
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Yeah.

473
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,400
Yeah, they were, originally they just thought that they were stupid.

474
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,080
Originally they were just like, yeah, we need it.

475
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
This guy needs to take some more tests.

476
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,560
I feel like all, I feel like all kids like fuck with like lizards and stuff though.

477
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Yeah, bugs for sure.

478
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560

480
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,960
You can, no, you can fuck with bugs as a kid and you're not a psychopath.

481
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
You fuck a bug.

482
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
A lizard is not a bug.

483
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,320
Yeah, you fuck a bug.

484
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
A lizard is a bug if it's small enough.

485
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Mm-hmm.

486
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Yeah.

487
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
A snail is a lizard.

488
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
That is true, yeah.

489
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,720
You were, I mean, yeah, all kids fuck around with iguanas and 10-foot-long Komodo dragons.

490
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
My grandma's house.

491
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,720
Oh, man, when you were a kid, you didn't-- You remember pulling the legs off of your

492
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,320
Yeah, holding a magnifying glass over my marine iguana.

494
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,720
When I was a kid, my grandma had, she had, like, slugs all in her backyard, and I would

495
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
pick them up and sniff them till my head hurt.

496
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
(laughter)

497
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
They had like a really weird smell.

498
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
And I'd go outside and be like, I can tell that they're here.

499
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
I can smell them from here. And I'd like find them.

500
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Hey, grandma, slug season is here.

501
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
I think that's why I like nicotine now.

502
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I think it's kind of the same feeling.

503
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Yeah, that's what they make cigarettes out of.

504
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
There's nicotine naturally produced in slugs.

505
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Every cigarette is a slug penis.

506
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Every cigarette is a slug.

507
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Mm-hmm.

508
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I'm gonna start calling cigarettes slugs.

509
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,240
sounds cool British way to talk about cigarettes that's like if they if

510
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,600
British people as a collective got in trouble for calling them fags they'd

511
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,360
switch to slug mm-hmm yeah you know cuz those two words are equal in their mind

512
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,680
for both you know both meanings yeah exactly that's just how British people

513
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,440
think number two make it bite the pull rope swing him around let go and he'll

514
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,760
fly off this is what I do with Caleb yeah I made a little bite my pull rope

515
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,000
and then I swing him around and he flies off. I stopped calling for that. I have not done that in a while.

516
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,840
Yeah. But it might happen this weekend. I mean you might turn me to the old me.

517
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeah, I'm back on my bullshit. I'm back to biting the pole rope and flying off. Oh my god. My dad was a

518
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,560
monster. He'd give me a bone two hours later. I mean peanut butter out of a chew

519
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,440
toy it's really bad dude it's really fucking bad yeah yeah people used to

520
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,400
hide the ball on me mm-hmm number three hey throw things at it and then a

521
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:50,480
animated laughing like yeah was there a brick in the game yeah the nintendo brick

522
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,280
yeah we don't know we just put it in we don't know what the kids are gonna do

523
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,840
with it yeah I downloaded the bludgeon mod we thought yeah I would build a

524
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,800
house for the dog we didn't know that listen when we put when we programmed

525
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,440
the blood functionality into the game we didn't know that kids were gonna find a

526
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,980
way to exploit it by making the dogs bleed it was supposed to be for the

527
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:20,200
chew toys number four when he's thirsty take him for a walk and make him run the

528
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:28,040
whole time I definitely I did that a lot yeah yeah I love just not cleaning up

529
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,020
the poop yeah oh yeah do you think they're taking your dog into the woods I mean

530
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:39,120
yeah in the woods mm-hmm gaming gaming is escapism and in the video game you can

531
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,040
let your room fill up with poop and you don't have to deal with the real-life

532
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,560
consequences yeah cuz he doesn't you can't smell it through the screen not

550
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,440
annoying yeah I don't know I think a play seems like that would be fun for the

551
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,040
dog making a play. Dogs love to play.

552
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,000
No. Not when they haven't had water. That's true, not when they haven't been

553
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,720
watered. I guess that's a good point. You gotta water your dog before you play it.

554
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,920
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. That's my advice. You gotta warm your dog up. Mm-hmm.

555
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,080
There's a comment here from Bubble Burst Baby that says, "That's mean. You'll screw

556
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,640
up your Nintendog and he won't like you for the rest of your life." And

557
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,960
and then the response to that comment is,

558
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,380
"Okay dude, one, it's just a game,

559
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,300
"and two, real people like you and me won't do any of this,

560
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,620
"but I posted one anyway,

561
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,160
"and treat your Nintendog nicely,

562
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,620
"not to be mean to the people who do,

563
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,960
"but just do what you want,"

564
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,440
and then a peace sign.

565
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,460
- It actually says, "Do what ya what."

566
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,000
- Oh, whoops.

567
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,620
- The first time, and he responded to that and fixed it.

568
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,040
- I didn't mean to post so much,

569
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,320
but I had to fix a little problem, sorry.

570
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,160
(laughing)

571
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,440
- Oh man, yeah, this is from 2005,

574
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,120
little Easter egg for all the real April Mandy fans okay now here's my favorite

575
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,640

576
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,800

577
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,040
Yank its @$$ and done let it.

578
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,300
Ram a cart up its @@$$ while it's sleepin'.

579
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:58,960
Lay down some food, toy, water, and when it's 'bout to get it, you get it.

580
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,240
Make it walk all over its $H!+.

581
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,540
Throw a piggy bank on it.

582
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Mwahahahahahaha skull emoji.

583
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,540
But I wouldn't do that to my Nintendog, even though it's not Xmas.

584
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,040
*laughter*

585
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,840
I would do this to my Nintendog if it was Xmas, but...

586
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Can you put stuff in your dog's ass in Nintendogs? Is that an option?

587
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
Probably a thermometer.

588
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,240
When you play with, like, the carrot and you throw it?

589
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,640
We have finally modeled a perfect physics engine.

590
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,640
You can do absolutely anything you want in this game, this dog game.

591
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
- They're just... - You can put it in its ass.

592
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,040
yeah just like like finally creating the first the first full might as well just

593
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,560
be a simulated universe and just kids everywhere are putting putting carts up

594
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,720
there your their dog's ass well it's leaving bees and fucking talky

595
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:57,400
sticks my dog's ass yeah that's the game that's a good that should be that should

596
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,720
be our indie game funny revenue game that is that yeah I think we need to

597
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,560
- Yeah, simulator.

598
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,680
- Branch out into gaming.

599
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,180
I think that's the next thing we need to conquer.

600
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,920
- You know, we did our multimedia empire.

601
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,420
- We had a book, we did a, we're gonna do a movie.

602
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,280
We did streaming video games,

603
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,720
now we need to make a video game.

604
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,560
And we need to release an album.

605
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,060
- And then we stream the video game.

606
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,840
- Oh my God.

607
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,940
- And then we make a new meal.

608
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,040
- A new type of food?

609
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,920
- A new kind of food.

610
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Bread.

611
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,760
- Then we wear--

612
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,580
- Sandwich.

613
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:38,420

619
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,220
to be he has so much money's throwing it away do it for the love of the game

620

- That'd be, I think the biggest problem--

699
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,220
- Cortana, where's my pinky?

700
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,340
- Cortana's kinda too small for him to fuck, unfortunately.

701
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,180
- If you think about it,

702
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,740
Master Chief is wearing a big onesie.

703
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,580
- Do you think Cortana,

704
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,980
his suit definitely has like a vibration setting.

705
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,820
- It has a diaper in it.

706
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,340
- Do you think Cortana, Cortana after--

707
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,180
- For sure.

708
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,340
- Give him a little vibrate down there,

709
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
little rub and tug.

710
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,180
- Where, down where?

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,000
- With the suit.

712
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
- Down where?

713
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,680
On his butt or his feet?

714
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,500
- On his feet.

715
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,340
- On his feet.

716
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,780

721
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,580
hung four hours in a row. 14 make your dog watch hours in a row of Martha Stewart

living and then you add the cotton bunny ears to the Easter egg to make the Easter

723
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,760
bunny oney complete. Dog whimpers. I don't think the dog would try to speak English.

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,280
Yeah I don't think that's true. Yeah. Probably get excited. Yeah. Yeah. Number 15

728
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,360
Even for this thread I mean come on. Yeah even for IGNboards.com. I know.

729
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,560
That's just, that's not right. Legacy account you psycho. This is kind of a

730
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,520
nasty Dirty Carlin style one. Whale it is sleeping, tax a big and heavy thing, add

731
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,720
throw it at its ass and then it might shit itself and eat its shit. And then he

732
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:06,560
responds to that H that I can't I did it but failed somebody says somebody says

733
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,880
make your dog read this thread that's a pretty that it's funny that that insult

734
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,560
has persisted all these years 15 years later people still throw that one out

735
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,000
yeah yeah keep hitting it with a cart says April Mandy where's there's a cart

736
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
- Is there a cart or, you're thinking of Mario Kart.

737
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,640
- Is there a cart?

738
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,460
Is there a cart?

739
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,000
Because they said earlier to put the cart in the guy's ass.

740
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,500
- I'm Googling Nintendog.

741
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,360
It's cart with a K, too.

742
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,760
- We should play Nintendogs.

743
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,960
- Yeah, oh my god, Nintendogs?

744
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,800
- Oh, there's a--

745
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,240
- You raise a guy.

746
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,280
- It's kind of virtual, buddy.

747
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,240
- You can buy it, you can get a Mario Kart toy in Nintendogs.

748
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,880
- Oh, and you put it in its ass.

749
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,120
- Yeah.

750
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,560
- Okay.

751
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,640
Nintendogs would be good.

752
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,600
- They have a, I see, they have different,

753
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,960
You could get the Bowser one and put it in your dog's ass and it's got spikes on it.

754
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,920
Oh man, if I had the Bowser toy in Nintendogs, it's the only thing my dog would be eating.

755
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
[laughs]

756
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,400
Mm-hmm.

757
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Someone says, "April Mandy."

758
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,480
That's like getting a... that's exactly like getting a Hitler chew toy for your dog.

759
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,360
Dude, I would get that and just watch him tear it to shreds, but then stop him from fucking it.

760
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,120
Yeah.

761
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,360
No, no! You don't understand, Fido!

762
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,080
No, that'll make him happy!

763
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,120
That's Adolf Hitler and he loves to get fucked!

764
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,920
By dogs!

765
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,720
Hitler loved getting fucked by dogs.

766
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,240
That's why he was obsessed with German Shepherds, which is something I learned from an Always Sunny episode.

767
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,960
Yeah.

768
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,680
Yeah.

769
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,080
'Cause that he would fuck these kind of dogs.

770
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,720
Yeah, and he would actually have really good sex with the dogs.

771
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,160
Mm-hmm.

772
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,240
Was that bitch really his cousin?

773
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,280
Eva Braun?

774
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,080
Yeah.

775
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,960
I don't know.

776
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Let's find out.

777
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Yeah.

778
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm just going to say that she is because I don't like him.

779
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Yeah.

780
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,360
Oh, here's a Hitler thing.

781
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
There's a guy...

782
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Here's a Hitler thing.

783
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,200
Yeah, at my work, we do like deliveries to people.

784
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,960
And there's a guy apparently who...

785
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
Oh, yeah.

786
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Who gets alcohol delivered sometimes whose name is Swastik Kar.

787
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Swastik Kar?

788
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Swastikaar?

789
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
First name Swastika, last name Kaar.

790
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Oh my god, dude.

791
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
What an unfortunate name.

792
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
What the fuck, that's the greatest name of all time.

793
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Dude, just an Australian pronunciation of Swastika.

794
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Swastika?

795
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
What? I'm not delivering this shit.

796
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Swastika?

797
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,960
I'm not delivering this there.

798
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Some kind of Nazi.

799
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
We gotta get to his house now.

800
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,800
yeah I looked it up and swastika is an Indian name which makes sense because

801
00:42:51,800 --> 00:43:01,880
it's an Indian guy named Swastika. Well yeah isn't the swastika an Indian name?

802
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,780
it was because Indian people were Nazis first and then Hitler took it and made

803
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,280
it evil but before being a Nazi was a sign of peace. That's not true. It's true.

804
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:17,040
yeah yeah it was like it was like hippies yeah yeah twisted it into his own yeah

805
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:29,200
perverted creepy vision exactly did an Indian guy named swastika I will never

806
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:38,120
stop thinking about swastika Jesus Christ fuck all right let's find

807
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,080
another there's so much just sort of back and forth banter in this thread until

808
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,480
Michael Jackson in the room with your Nintendogs so MJ can be

809
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:56,000
creative LMFAO and then like 50 exclamation points he can be creative

810
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,280
lolling at that put Ryan 007 11 in the room with it clap clap clap who's Ryan

811
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,860
Ryan007. Oh, then at the bottom it says "Just kidding though."

812
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,520
Ryan James Bond. Yeah.

813
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,700
Throw the frisbee when the dog gets it, take it and repeat it.

814
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,860
Run over your dog while DS is on.

815
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,960
This guy's not talking about the Nintendog. You turn on the Nintendog's game

816
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,000
and then you run over your real dog.

817
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,160
Drown your dog by making it drink tons of water.

818
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,200
I don't think that's drowning.

819
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,320
Every time your dog turns around and shakes its butt, poke its butthole with the stylus.

820
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,320
When I first got my dog and she started to do that move, I kept on poking her there until she got really mad.

821
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,200
She growled.

822
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,920
Every time I touched the screen, she jumped at me and tried to bite me, and then she ignored me.

823
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,080
Every time I called her name, she would turn around and would scratch up with her hind legs.

824
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,240
Of course I fed her and walked her and seems alright after that. I kid you not.

825
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,840
But when I poke her now, she doesn't get as mad.

826
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,840
I guess I have so many trainer points she doesn't get mad at me anymore.

827
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,960

Grab a tail and his mouth will go on your stylus and throw the dog.

856
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,800
Use the chopper to hit the dog with the propeller.

857
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,880
Get a fancy vase and throw it on the dog's head.

858
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,080
Get a ballon and make them make it explode.

Swaggy Dave is literally problematic. He literally rescued a child prostitute, okay?

894
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,000
We can't put him in the Marvel Universe. He literally stole that swag from another

guy. He stole it from Swaggy P. He stole that swag from Swaggy P. Mm-hmm.

901
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:40,100
I would do that. Were you guys scared of rabies when you were a kid? I was more scared of

902
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:47,180
tetanus. There was a kid in my hometown who got rabies and I bit him and I

Was it Territory War?

940
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,060

00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,740

00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,900

951
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:12,660
abuse your dogs I have three Dalmatians and they are just as precious as can be

952
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,060
Wow that's adorable. You think he's talking about real dogs there? Yeah. Chaos control

953
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:24,580
here has um has a really like evil psychological warfare kind of idea. At

954
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:30,300
the park play with the other dogs it painful in their eyes lol. Wow yeah

955
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,620
conduct it conduct an experiment where five dogs are in prison and five dogs are

956
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:41,140
prison guards and then see if the prison guard dogs take ultimate power. Which I

957
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,940
- I think is what happened in the prison experiment.

958
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,220
Didn't they take ultimate power?

959
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,140
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure they attained godhood.

960
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,620
- That's why they had to shut it down so early,

961
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,100
is that in the notes, they were like,

962
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,420
"Ah, crap, they obtained ultimate power.

963
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,260
"We didn't expect it."

964
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,700
- They actually got a level up.

965
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,500
- Oh no, they became the perfect life form.

966
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,660
- Ah, crap.

967
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,500
- Ah, Jesus Christ.

968
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,140
- Wasn't the whole thing with that,

969
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,860
wasn't a lot of it super exaggerated or some shit?

970
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,700
- I think so.

971
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,780
- And really, it was just like--

972
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,620
- Yeah, wasn't that all fake?

973
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:14,900
so many so many a bunch of study like psychological studies they just like you

974
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,100
can't reproduce them like that's like an issue in science it's going on right now

975
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,380
is like there's a bunch of like in science it is there's a bunch of like a

976
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,380
bunch of old studies and like experiments where like if you just try

977
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,300
them again they just like aren't true well yeah I just every time I meet a

978
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,380
baby I ask if it wants to fuck its mom and it rarely says yes so Freud even if

979
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,420
I try to give it a marshmallow. Even if I say that if you don't do that you can have a marshmallow.

980
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,100
I'm gonna mix it let's mix up all of them together so it's it's a prison

981
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:51,860
experiment yeah with only babies and marshmallows are the moms and

982
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:56,780
they see who fucks the marshmallow and who is and who kills the baby yeah it's

983
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,900
kind of a genius idea yeah and also the entire time there's a monkey

984
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,400
there's a gorilla doing the moonwalk through the screen and you have to see

985
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,140
if the baby's noticing right or if they're too distracted by the marshmallow thing

986
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,580
yeah you know what I mean and it's the thing about the gorilla moonwalking is

987
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,060
it's impossible to tell which direction it's walking because it's an optical

988
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,220
illusion right it's either gorilla or it's two faces making a gorilla yeah

989
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:26,100
yeah yeah and if you look at it you get a headache cuz it's bright green

990
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,580
and then if you watch the experiment and then you blink your eyes a bunch of times

991
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,820
and look at the wall you see a picture of Jesus. Yeah, but if you look

992
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:38,660
away from the experiment you get an electric shock. That's true. I did a

993
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:44,860
thing in, I had to like for my psychology class when I was at UNCW, do like

994
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:51,580
like be in one of the experiments and it was in like a classroom and there

995
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:57,620
was just one computer and basically the experiment was like see if like you and

996
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,380
another person, like there's another person with doing the exact same

997
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:06,460
experiment in another room and they, you each can basically punish each other by

998
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,380
like playing a really loud noise or like not punish each other by playing a

999
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,900
really quiet noise and the other person who's not, didn't exist just kept playing

1000
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,500
like a really really loud noise and they, they, which is like a pretty common

1001
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,220
experiment. Yeah. Just to see like if people retaliate. Yeah. But the guy who

1002

Wow, oh my god, yeah, it's 2006.

1073

It took IGNboards.com a year to come up with a hundred things, dude.

1074
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,880
We could have done that, we could do that in ten seconds.

1075
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,880
Yeah, ten seconds.

1076
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,880
Okay, hit your dog once, hit your dog twice, hit your dog three times, hit your dog four times.

1077
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,880
Feed him a stinky meal.

1078
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,880
Feed him two stinky meals.

1079
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,880
Dress him up in human clothes, marry the dog.

1080
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Poop on him.

1081
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,720
- Poop on him.

1082
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,880
- Poop on him, like surgically attached breasts to your dog.

1083
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,240
- Get feeded poop.

1084
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,400
- You could slowly turn him into a man.

1085
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,360
- Yeah.

1086
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,520

1087
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,440

01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,640
- That's real shit.

1089
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,480
- That's actually real shit. - That's just real shit.

1090
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,400
- Yeah. - People don't realize

1091
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,880
that's just real shit.

1092
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,560
- People don't realize real shit sometimes

1093
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,800
and I'm here to do it for them.

1094
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,400
- People need to realize real shit.

1095
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,520
Realize, realize real shit.

1096
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,360
- I'm trying to think of other ways

1097
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,520
you could fuck the dog up.

1098
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,840
Fire hydrant, I mean anything heavy I guess.

1099
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,880
Yeah, gun, sword.

1100
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,880
Make him listen to your wife.

1101
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,280
Basically all you gotta do is sit on the dog.

1102
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,800
Get your dog a wife.

1103
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,760
Get your dog a fat wife and a job.

1104
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,840
Make him do human shit and then say, "Listen buddy, you thought you had it bad.

1105
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
Check this shit out."

1106
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,840
He'll never talk to you again.

1107
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,080
(mumbling)

1108
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,040
- Make your dog, how about this, make your dog vote.

1109
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,920
Make him choose between a crab sandwich

1110
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,040
and a turd fat guy or whatever.

1111
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,000
- Yeah, a turd filet.

1112
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,880
- Whatever, what is the South Park thing?

1113
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,760
A douche bag.

1114
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,600
- Giant douche and a turd sandwich.

1115
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,520
- Giant douche and a turd sandwich, yeah.

1116
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,800
Who, we're watching the debate tonight.

1117
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,760

01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,560
You know what I'm gonna do?

1121
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,420
If we watch the debate on the stream,

1122
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,000
I'm gonna sit there and any time

1123
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,700
that one of them's talking, I'm gonna say,

1124
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,180
loser says something.

1125
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,940
- Oh my God. - Oh, okay.

1126
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,420
- You're like Immortal Technique, dude.

1127

01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,380
- That's right. - Yeah.

1130
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,420
And then they're gonna make me the president.

1131
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,260
- They will.

1132
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,740
In a landslide victory, people have voted

1133
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,140
for a sarcastic guy named Patrick.

1134
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:18,020
- Hey Pat, you should change your name

1135
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,980
- I'm gonna be the most sarcastic guy.

1136
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,820
- Sarcastic, oh my God.

1137
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:22,660
- Sarcastic.

1138
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,140
- Yeah, yeah, I'm totally gonna not do that.

1139
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,340
- I was thinking the other day, it was making me laugh.

1140
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,120
- Yeah, I'm totally not gonna do that.

1141
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,780
- It was making me laugh really hard the other day

1142
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,700
thinking about a guy who is driven to suicide

1143
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,560
by sarcastic comments.

1144
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,500
Just mentioned today the suicide, now he's like,

1145
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,540
"I could deal with the kid running away

1146
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,080
"and my wife leaving me and losing my job,

1147
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:51,240
but the god damn sarcasm, it pushed me over the edge.

1148
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,380
- It's too goddamn much. - When people would say

1149
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,740
not after stuff, oh.

1150
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,960
- Hey, your wife's home, not.

1151
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,020
- Well, guess what, I'm gonna live.

1152
01:03:59,020 --> 01:03:59,860
- Hey, we found your son. - Not.

1153
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,700
- Not, yeah.

1154
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,340
Yeah, we totally found your son's remains.

1155
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,140
- Not. - Yeah.

1156
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,180
- And I'll leave you with this,

1157
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,780
I'm totally not gonna kill myself right now.

1158
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,020
