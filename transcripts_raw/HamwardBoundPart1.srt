1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:26,080
I just keep releasing the background until--

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,320
yeah, all right, cool.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:36,740
So, um, this is the second, uh, this is gonna be the second arc of the official D&D arcs

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,040
in the Potabatlas universe, and it's a little different.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,720
Yeah, no more Gun City ever again.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,440
Yeah, we're, yeah, I got, we got the feedback, we get it, you guys don't like Gun City.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
I handed it.

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,800
I had a lot of people DMing me thinking I was Sullivan the Frog saying horrible things.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
So we decided to abandon it and do something a little different.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
Introducing Hamward Bound.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,360
It's based on nothing in particular.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:16,480
And I'm going to sort of kick it off and then I'm going to ask you three to reveal who you

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
are.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah, we're in person too, by the way.

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
Yeah, we're all in the same room.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
Yeah, we're all in the same sauna.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
We're all sweating.

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Sweating a lot.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
sweating a lot.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
sweating a lot.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,440
yeah, i'm sweating too much too.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
so okay.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
put all the stones in.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
you don't sweat too much.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
you don't sweat.

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
here, i'll put some more thingies in the middle.

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,440
i'm crushing caleb's penis with one of the stones.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,440
yeah, why do you think i just wore a towel?

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
mm.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,880
okay, so.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,360
the uh, camera comes in from the sky.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:02:01,220
And it starts gently gliding down to a lovely suburban abode in sort of a... one of those

34
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,400
suburbs that has a lot of property ground.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,360
You can get like an acre of property for yourself.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
And you begin to hear a voiceover.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,720
"Hi.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,920
My name is the Candy Hamster.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
I know, it sounds odd.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,160
But most names do if you think about it long enough.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,760
Maybe even yours.

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,520
I was formed through dark magics from rotted nerds rope mixed with radioactive josta and

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,200
Joel energy drinks in the carcass of Ronald Reagan's hamster racist Michael.

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,560
I did my best I could to survive in the harsh streets of downtown DC, doing things I am deeply

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,960
ashamed of and am unable to remember without blacking out completely and bleeding from

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
my ears.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,080
It was a tough life growing up, but lucky for me, I was eventually adopted by a wonderful

48
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,720
uncle and his beloved nephews.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,120
The uncle and his nephews took care of me, bathed me, clothed me, even helped me get

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,360
over my pill addiction and opened a line of credit for me to start investing in futures.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,960
Whatever that means, I love my life here.

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,440
Or at least I DID love my life here.

53
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,160
See, today is supposed to be the most holiest of days between an uncle and his nephews.

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,440
A nephew's adult risk.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,640
Everyone gets together and watches the Rugrats Moses episode, and then drops trow to get

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
their worm done upright.

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,680
However, if there's anything that can ruin this day, it's the three loudmouth pets adopted

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,380
recently by the uncle and his nephews.

59
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,300
Right now they're locked in the animal room.

60
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,000
And hopefully they'll stay there for the whole ceremony.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I wonder if they were to introduce themselves, what they would sound like or talk about.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Oh how I hate them.

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,200
Oh how I want to know more about them.

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,840
A lot of this was just, I was writing this at like 6am.

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,800
We'll all be waiting here, the ever faithful Candy Hamster, to stop them from getting out

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
and ruining this adult bris.

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,840
So, uh, the candy hamster is standing guard outside of the animal room.

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,960
The animal room is just a blank room with toy blocks on the floor.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Okay.

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,120
Uh, no, well there's a door and there's a window and you could-

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
We get a window?

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
There might be other things-

73
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,000
There's a window so you can see outside in the back where the adult press is happening.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh yeah.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm looking.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Um, yeah.

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
And uh, the, the, the three of you are in there, the three of you animals.

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,800
been locked in there just like in the beginning of a different thing sort of

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,640
kept away from the ceremonies as well do mischief yes and the candy hamster has

80
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,560
been tasked with the with outside a bunch of adults put a hamster in charge

81
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,440
of watching an animal like it's not the brightest bunch you know Patrick it's a

82
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
game stop come on come on you're ruining it yeah

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,960
Pat plays Monopoly and he's like Broadway wouldn't cost $1,200.

84
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,400
I'm in character right now. My character is very analytical.

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,760
So yeah, I mean it sounded like the Candy Hamster wanted to know a little bit more

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,160
about you guys. Yeah. And so would I. Yeah. Start over here.

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,760
I am the Hungry Hamster. Okay. I was picked up by the uncle and the

88
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,680
nephews when they were bored one day and they thought it would be funny to buy a

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,760
hamster that ate a bunch of stuff. They've been feeding me a bunch of food ever

90
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,360
since I was born. They've been feeding me pretty much too much food for a hamster. I've eaten things that

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:49,440
hamsters shouldn't eat. Like... I've eaten a tire. I ate a whole tire one time. It's pretty

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
crazy. You'd think as a hamster I wouldn't be able to eat a tire but no. I

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,520
I ate the whole thing in one fell swoop.

94
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Does that mean one bite?

95
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
What do you mean one fell swoop?

96
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
What?

97
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
For me, bites are fell swoops.

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Yeah, definitely from now on we're not gonna write character descriptions.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,520
I have to just work with this kind of reality now.

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,520
By the way, the uncle is Rod Blagojevich.

101
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:32,800
Just a side note, because this takes place in Chicago now.

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,120
This sure does. Well it's actually funny you mentioned a place in the Midwest so

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,320
you already cracked the code. So yeah so for Patrick and for the benefit of

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,080
the audience I think, yes he is the hungry hamster. You have your character

105
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
sheet in front of you Patrick. You should see you have a few abilities that you

106
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,080
might want to key in on. So you have the hamster ball.

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,240
That allows you to deploy your hamster ball, start knocking things over. We can

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,920
talk through that when we get to that. You have hamster bite. That's just a

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:15,960
little nibble. You know what a young hamster would be doing.

110
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,520
You have, which you told me to add to your abilities when we first talked about

111
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,880
about this, check inventory, which I did make into something where you're just

112
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,640
gonna, basically you have a ham tote, it's a little bag, and when you want to check

113
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,520
inventory, you're gonna roll a d20, you're gonna pull out just about anything.

114
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,200
Okay. You have sharing is caring, which is another thing you told me to add and

115
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,960
didn't explain, and it allows you to just share any items that you have as a

116
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,240
free action at any time.

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Okay.

118
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,800
So, yeah, you can see sort of the synergy between check inventory and sharing is caring.

119
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Yeah.

120
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
And then, of course-

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Sharing is caring just sounds like a thing you could do.

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Well, it's up to 120 feet.

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,680
So, it's like he can sort of like mentally just email it.

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Oh, okay.

125
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Yeah.

126
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Yeah.

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,680
It's like a walkie-talkie.

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Yeah, a mental email.

129
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Yeah, mentally, of course.

130
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Thanks, sorry.

131
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Yeah, no, I forgot where the-

132
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Yeah.

133
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Then you have your famous dance.

134
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,720
Famous dance is so infectious and if people fail that saving throw, they will have to do

135
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
the dance for a full minute.

136
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,760
At which point your bite is going to be stronger and they can't do anything besides dance.

137
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
They can move a little bit.

138
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
So you have some cool builds.

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,280
That's exactly what I was imagining when I thought of famous dance.

140
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,520
Yeah, I hope so.

141
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,240
But yeah, so you're hanging out in the room.

142
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Are you playing with the blocks?

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Are you trying to eat something?

144
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm spinning around in the balls so fast.

145
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,480
looks like I'm gyrating when you did I'm in one of those it's it's spinning when

146
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,600
you did the first gun city you you basically said the same thing except you

147
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,560
were like flipping on a skateboard yeah you're always doing something I'm in the

148
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,800

149
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,200

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,840
I give good judgment did I'm sorry so

151
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:16,000
The game we have the hungry hamster who else do we have here? We have I believe somebody else. Yeah, I I'm the pleasant parrot

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,420
So I'm kind of like a parrot. I'm a macaw

153
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,920
Actually, okay. I am the white parrot. No, that's colorful. Oh

154
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,560
Do you have anything else to add?

155
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,240
Are you friendly?

156
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,960
Yeah, I'm actually very friendly. I'm very pleasant. I grew up on a pirate ship. Mm-hmm the

157
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,960
the pirate ship from Captain Phillips, the pirate ship that Captain Phillips was

158
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,400
based on, where they kicked me out because I was too pleasant and too

159
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,160
friendly to those evil nasty pirates. Right. Bad vibe. Yeah, they kicked me out to

160
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,320
Chicago where this adventure is set. Where I was adopted by John Cena who's

161
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,120
another one of the the members of the family believe it or not. Wow.

162
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Yeah, Blagojevich.

163
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,480
That's the first name I thought of.

164
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Family's growing.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Yeah.

166
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Yeah.

167
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,120
They're actually related in this universe.

168
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
Okay, Rob Blagojevich and Blagojevich, okay.

169
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,480
Yeah, and I'm just a cute little happy little parrot that's just lovely.

170
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Okay.

171
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Yeah, you're a sweet little parrot.

172
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm just that lovely little friend.

173
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,080
So interesting thing about the pleasant parrot.

174
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,400
So the pleasant parrot, you have a couple of things going on here that I gave you.

175
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,440
You have speech, so you can mimic human speech.

176
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,240
This is huge for you because none of you guys can really talk to people, as we'll learn

177
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,120
when we meet Caleb's character.

178
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Caleb is giving me the Kubrick stare.

179
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
I'm chilling.

180
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:53,120
And to, so the thing about your speech though is you are really smart.

181
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,620
You're a little too smart for a parrot, so you do have to be careful about how much human

182
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
speech you do.

183
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm going to do some secret rolls depending on how much speech you're using, which will

184
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,360
determine whether or not the CIA is interested in you. You have probably

185
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,300
want a what now, which is an ability that allows you to basically

186
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,740
use the command spell in 5e in my own sort of like jacked up version of it

187
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,540
where you just sort of get to say one word command to somebody and they will

188
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,220
be compelled to do it. So convincing is your silver parrot tongue. You have

189
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,780
talons that allows you to basically like perch on somebody's shoulder like a

190
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,580
pirate parrot but instead of being nice to have on your shoulder you hurt them

191
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,980
and you stay in there and you continue to do damage to them. You have a Noi

192
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,740
which is basically allows you to taunt them and get them the enemy to focus on

193
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,540
you and then have disadvantage on attacks. And then you have Delafrana

194
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,460
which is a you're not sure what this does but it terrifies you. It just says

195
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,180
question marks next to the stats. Yeah it's yeah I can use it three times per

196
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
long rest it says.

197
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Yeah.

198
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
So.

199
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Interesting.

200
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
Dlafurna.

201
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
Dlafurna.

202
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Dlafurna.

203
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Dlafurna.

204
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,940
You're not sure what that is.

205
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,500
It really scares you though.

206
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,940
I just have an ability in my brain.

207
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,460
And you have a knowledge of it.

208
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,460
Yeah.

209
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Alright.

210
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,900
So yeah, what are you doing in the blank room with blocks that is the animal room?

211
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,220
I'm flying up to the hungry hamster and I'm saying, "Hello, how are you?

212
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
Nice to meet you."

213
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm saying hello.

214
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
I'm saying even that to you.

215
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,820
No, that's just what I say because I'm pleasant.

216
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Oh, first-hand.

217
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,060
That's what being pleasant is like, right?

218
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,740
I'm telling him how hungry I am.

219
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,300
You can just tell him how hungry you are.

220
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,140
I'm so hungry right now.

221
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,780
They bred me to be hungry.

222
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I love you.

223
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Thank you.

224
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm hungry.

225
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,780
I'm your best friend.

226
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,780
You're my best friend.

227
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
Oh, that's nice.

228
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:58,700
The camera pans over to what looks to be just a regular dog, but instead he's a what now?

229
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
I'm the normal dog.

230
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
[laughter]

231
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Should we be doing character voices?

232
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
I chose to do one.

233
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
[laughter]

234
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm the normal dog, and I...

235
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
My...

236
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
old owner's name was Steve.

237
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,700
And he used to smoke salvia and blow it in my face

238
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
because he thought it was funny.

239
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,700
And then I got adopted by...

240
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I guess...

241
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Rod Blagojevich and John Cena.

242
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Yeah.

243
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
[laughter]

244
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,340
And I like hanging out and I love my friends more than anybody in the world. Yeah

245
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,660
So the normal dog has no ability what kind of dog are you

246
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,300
Lab mix fuck you more more than anything

247
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,100
I'm a nice guy

248
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,740
With a beautiful smile and blue eyes

249
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:53,620
so the normal dog was dropped in from the the right movie into this game and

250
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,880
Let's get some so you're you you are normal dog. You're you're pretty tanky

251
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,760
So, you know you have and you and you hit can heal you're pretty competent

252
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,460
little pooch

253
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,540
You have a bite and tackle as your sort of baseline attacks. You're gonna want to use

254
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,660
Tackle also can knock somebody prone grapple and restrain them

255
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,100
What that means is that you basically you know how dog jumps on pounces on you and lick your face and you're like, yeah

256
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,640
It's like killing you this time and then you have wound lick

257
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,700
Which you can heal 1d 10 plus 3 health to anyone in range of your tongue

258
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,860
In range of my tongue

259
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,380
We could talk about that so

260
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,940
You have who's a good boy, which means any white woman is fair game

261
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,240
Nice you've advantage on all charisma checks and saving throws involving white women

262
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Crime Dog, you have an advantage on all investigation and perception checks that involves your sense of smell.

263
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,240
If you have the first attack on an enemy, you have an advantage on all attack rolls for the rest of combat.

264
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Like if you're like the first one to get them.

265
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
You have Wimper, which is another sort of charm ability.

266
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Allows you to charm anyone of any species.

267
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,840
And then you have "Vicious", which is sort of like, uh, Ork's savage attack,

268
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,040
um, mixed with, um, the other fucking thing that gives you different kind of critical...

269
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,640
Whatever, you have 19 and 20 for you as critical, rather than just 20.

270
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,040
So you basically have a double, percentage-wise, chance of a critical hit.

271
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,440
- Oh my god. - And then you also get three, uh, instead of rolling just twice your attacks, you roll triple.

272
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,840
- Whoa. - So you're, you're, yeah, you're, you're pretty beastly, um...

273
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,640
- Can I be his character too? - Uh, no, you have to be your character.

274
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,880
Uh, Cameron, we talked about this.

275
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,480
So you guys are sitting in this room, the window outside is showing you-

276
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
I'm barking at the window because I think it's a TV.

277
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Okay.

278
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,680
Yeah, you're barking out at the window, you think it's a TV.

279
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,280
You see as you look out the window, the adult brisk going on.

280
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,520
You see Rod Blagav- I can't say his Polish ass name.

281
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Just say blah blah blah.

282
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Blah blah blah.

283
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,560
You see Rod blah blah blah beginning to give a circumcision to John Cena, who's his nephew,

284
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,860
you see, you also see a, you would see a 30 foot long, three

285
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:25,520
foot deep, two feet wide, just giant fucking trow filled with

286
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:32,080
the Ben and Jerry, Ben and Jeffrey Epstein's Island Time

287
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,160
ice cream, which has nougat caramel, chocolate chunks,

288
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,080
something called Satan's Love, and a full legal defense

289
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,280
strategy by Alan Dershowitz, all sort of in there. So it's like

290
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,880
It's everyone's favorite ice cream.

291
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,980
You see that in there and you see everyone's having such a nice time.

292
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,280
That's what you see out there.

293
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,380
You hear the hungry hamster from outside saying don't go thinking of doing anything.

294
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,280
You mean the can't I'm sorry the candy hamster.

295
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,380
Don't we start the whole thing over?

296
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,880
You see the candy hamster outside.

297
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,780
Is that clean take?

298
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,080
Yeah, that was the candy hamster outside and you don't see him.

299
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,580
But you hear him say don't go thinking of going out there.

300
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,460
I'm gonna stop you 'cause I'm the candy hamster.

301
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,960
RUH!

302
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,460
Shut up, bitch!

303
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,960

Uh, no, I know, he's a tricky fucker.

308
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
You're my friend!

309
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Uh, you're- no, you're trouble, that's what you are.

310
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,340
How are you?

311
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,840
I'm- I'm doing okay.

312
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,340
Bitch!

313
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:27,840
I love you!

314
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,340
No, I'm- you're a bitch!

315
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
You're the bitch!

316
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm gonna- I'm gonna sit down here and plug my ears.

317
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Dumbass hamster-looking motherfucker!

318
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
You're a hamster-looking motherfucker!

319
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,840
You look like a hamster!

320
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
*laughter*

321
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,340
Yeah?

322
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
Oh yeah?

323
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
Yeah you do!

324
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,340
Shut up!

325
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
You shut up!

326
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
You shut up!

327
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna punch you in the mouth.

328
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
But better not!

329
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I will.

330
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,380
I will open this door against orders and punch you in the mouth.

331
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,540
You better not come in here.

332
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
I will, I maybe I will.

333
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Oh you wouldn't.

334
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
No, I maybe I will.

335
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
Roll a persuasion check.

336
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Which one is it?

337
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,540
Uh, d20 and then just add your persuasion.

338
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
No, it's the, the...

339

Well, uh, you can try to fly out of the window and roll a, uh, strength check.

394
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Just a straight strength check to see if you can break it.

395
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,360
Okay.

396
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Uh, that'll be pretty hard for you 'cause you're a parrot.

397
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:08,860
*laughter*

398
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,860

Alright, let me...

402
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,860
The beak is the hardest part of my body.

403
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,360
You know that a bird's beak is the most sensitive thing in the world?

404
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
*laughter*

405

Yeah, okay, so you see, you're yelling help, help,

430
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,440
and you see a little boy turn around and look,

431
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
and he looks just like Rob Blagogovich,

432
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,440
or whatever the fuck, who does have a little boy haircut.

433
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
He does look like a little boy, yeah.

434
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,440
And he starts to sort of wander away from his parent,

435
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,640
And the parent doesn't notice and the kid looks back, he looks to you, and he sort of rushes into the house.

436
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,140
Yes.

437
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,440
Um, yeah. And so you hear your little footsteps.

438
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
[footsteps]

439
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
You can put that in, right?

440
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,940
Is that what footsteps sound like to you?

441
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,440
I haven't walked in years.

442
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,940
[footsteps]

443
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,440
So you hear all those noises that the boy is making.

444
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
[footsteps]

445
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
You hear, uh, and you hear outside.

446
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
[kissing]

447
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,940
And you hear a little boy going, "Aw, come on, candy hamster, let me in!"

448
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,340
(laughing)

449
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,960
Which you guys can hear as like,

450
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,180
bitch, get the fuck back!

451
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,300
The same for you.

452
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,500
- Let him in, bitch!

453
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,860
- No, 'cause the boy can't see you,

454
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,300
and you can't really talk.

455
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,380
So I'm trying to figure out--

456
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,900
- I'm hearing him say, get the fuck back.

457
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,740
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,580
So the candy hamster yells back at you.

459
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,220
He says like, you fucking stay out of this, okay?

460
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,060
This is not about you.

461
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,880
- Oh yeah, what are you gonna do?

462
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,060
- I was a pet first!

463
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,900
You three came in here, the shiny new pets.

464
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
- What are you gonna do?

465
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,740
- What am I gonna do?

466
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,660
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

467
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,060
I'm a slap you.

468
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,180
You got nothing.

469
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,460

470
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,300

472
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,020
[LAUGHTER]

473
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,820
Come slap him in the room.

474
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,020
Yeah, but you come slap me.

475
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,480
OK, roll persuasion again.

476
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,980
It's going to be a bit harder because you already tried this.

477
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,900
But roll again.

478
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,100
I got to wait.

479
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,420
And then I add that with what?

480
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,540
Persuasion.

481
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,500
It's in the skill list.

482
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,140

00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,340
Yeah, now he's still like, I'm not going to do it.

486
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,300

And here's Footsteps come back.

498
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,060
And he cracks open the door a little bit.

499
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,060
And he starts to push in a bowl of water.

500
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Go, go.

501
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060

504
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
(Laughter)

00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
snout and you push it back.

507
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,060
I'm telling him to rescue us in Morse Code.

508
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,060
He just has to put the water back in.

509
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,060
So I can finish the first letter.

510
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,060
Uh, yeah, you push the water back in, and little boy's like, "Uh, oh, uh..."

And he tries to push it out again, he's not sure...

512
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060

684
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,300
I guess it's technically an attack roll. You're not attacking him, but just roll a straight. I just want to lick his butt sure just

685
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,000
You can do that without taking the pants off. You're just roll a d20 and add add three to it

00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,520
I like his butthole and before you lick his butthole you're flying you're going on a zipper

saying really. Well actually I mean like Pleasant Parrot you can roll a straight

741
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,080
intelligence to see if you can understand what the people are saying.

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,240
That's something you hear a bunch. It's like a word. You're not that familiar with but it is new

745
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,480
But you guys can't really understand what they're saying. You see the kids have kind of like sadder faces on it

746
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,480
They're like being really attentive to you all right now and like you can't quite get it

747
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,120

I'm kind of like looking up like a and the little nephews are like poking at you. Yeah. Yeah, you're me

754
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:19,440

757
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,280
I'm gonna put your nose under your nose and you're gonna sniff it

758
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,280
You're not even gonna be able to fucking breathe tomorrow.

759
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,780
You won't breathe.

760
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,280
Are you actually gonna have a Hitler poop mustache?

761
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I will not, 'cause he's gonna have something like that.

762
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,780
He said he will.

763
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,280
No.

764
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
I said he will and it's gonna happen.

765
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
It's not how it works. This isn't the secret, bitch.

766
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
I feel like I already see it on you.

767
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
I'm not gonna manifest it.

768
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I can manifest Hitler poop on you.

769
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Oh, yeah?

770
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,280
You do have a little darker hair where Hitler would have his mustache.

771
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,280
But that's just a pattern of my fur. That doesn't mean I'm Hitler.

772
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Does that mean your dad was Hitler?

773
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
No, it does not.

774
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
I think his dad was Hitler.

775
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,080
literally not Hitler. I am a candid hamster.

776
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
His dad was Hitler.

777
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,080
And you guys are driving along in the mystery machine and the car sort of starts to slow

778
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,080
to a stop. It's been a few hours and you see everyone's...

779
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
This is so long to be seen.

780
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,880
You see everyone's loading out of the mystery machine and you see Rob Bogogovic is like,

781
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,080
"Come on, come on! My little boy haircut. I have a little boy haircut. Come on, I don't

782
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,280
know anything. I don't know that much about him." And he lets you guys out.

783
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
Me neither.

784
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,120
And I have friends who are more into Chicago politics than I am, and I don't live there.

785
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
And you...

786
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Wait, what?

787
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,960
You have friends who are specifically in Chicago?

788
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,200
Specifically, they're from Chicago.

789
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,600
So they would know things about him.

790
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,280
I don't even know who that is, to be honest.

791
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
He's like some guy.

792
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,640
He was some guy who was on the Apprentice.

793
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,960
I'm supposed to not like him because I...

794
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,680
Yeah, because he has a freaky last name?

795
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
Yeah, because he's Polish or something.

796
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,480
I think he had too much swag and they kicked him out of Chicago.

797
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Yeah, too much wagons?

798
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Yeah.

799
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Too much ass?

800
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Too big of an ass?

801
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,600
He's too damn thick.

802
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:57,960
Yeah.

803
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,640
So yeah, his wagging ass is a waddle and out of the car.

804
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,040
And, uh, you guys, uh, are, are sort of like, like kind of, kind of come on out

805
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,520
into this and you see this big old farm, uh, that looks like it's made of knives.

806
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,760
It is the sharpest looking fucking farm you've ever seen.

807
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,040
It is kind of terrifying.

808
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:32,400
And there are just like knives everywhere and swords everywhere. There's like a fence and all the pigs look like they look like they're dressed in some sort of metal garb.

809
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:41,400
And you see come out of it is Uncle Shredder. And you see Uncle Shredder is talking to your family, sort of going back and forth, blah blah blah.

810
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Uncle Shredder! Uncle Shredder!

811
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,400
And then you see all the humans come to you guys.

812
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,900
And they all have tears in their eyes and they're telling you they love you so much.

813
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,900
They're hugging you.

814
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
You don't know really what's going on.

815
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,400
It gives you a cracker.

816
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,900
One of them gives you like a prime rib just to eat for yourself, normal dog.

817
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,900
Yeah.

818
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,900
And one of them gives you another tire.

819
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,900
[Laughter]

820
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,900
It's a Hot Wheels tire.

821
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,900
It's smaller.

822
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,900
They don't want to have--

823
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,900
You got anything bigger than this?

824
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
What the fuck?

825
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:19,240
And then you see everybody pile into the mystery van.

826
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,020
You guys are behind this knife fence and they drive away.

827
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,020
And you see Uncle Shredder.

828
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,020
WTF?

829
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,780
I'm gonna love it here!

830
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,420
And you see Uncle Shredder and he says to you all, "Hey, so make yourselves at home.

831
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,560
I'm really sorry about how sharp everything is here."

832
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,260
And you start to realize all the pigs are dressed in like the Foot Clan outfits.

833
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,980
Can we understand us?

834
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:48,940
No, you don't he can maybe get a sense of what you guys are saying, but you guys you say all that's wrong

835
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:55,640
Tense and purposes. It seems like your family just like left you here. Oh my god, uncle shredders

836
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,300
We exposed his brother for being a pedophile

837
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:06,780
He was a pedophile. He just likes when dogs eat his butt fucking freak. Yeah, he's weird. Yeah weird

838
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,660
I was just testing him. I didn't like that at all. I hated doing it, but sometimes you know a greater good

839
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,860
I guess.

840
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,860
Helco's right here.

841
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,860
Hey.

842
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,340
Comes out, he's like, "Uh, sorry, these are all the snacks I have."

843
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Wait, wait, let me be clear.

844
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,060
I seriously didn't like doing that.

845
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
I don't blame you.

846
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,060
I don't blame you for doing this.

847
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,140
I mean, it's just, you know.

848
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
I think he deserves it.

849
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,140
It just felt right in the moment.

850
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,140
That's not what I mean.

851
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,900
Yeah, this, well, I got something for the little gay dog and the other two.

852
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,140
You know, I'm not gay, but I'll take your present.

853
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:40,580
He brings out a Knive-O's and it's just, and he pours it out, it's just a bunch of thumb

854
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,340
tax and he's like I'm sorry I don't really have anything else I'm starting

855
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:59,100
to understand this guy if you're gonna start eating a roll roll a constitution

856
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:07,180
saving throw just a constitution check really 18 okay yeah you're fine

857
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:13,140

860
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:40,080
try to swallow the thumbtack, but I'm pridefully like, "This is really good!"

861
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:47,180
Yeah, and you see Shredder is talking and he started talking to

862
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,120
himself, talking about what was going on. Pleasant Parrot, you can kind of make out

863
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,820
what he's saying. Something about like a, something like the family are just a

864
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:01,620
bunch of stained brains, so they're going to follow Stained for a couple months,

865
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,300
and they can't really like so they left you guys here and like you can kind of

866
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,620
make that out but as animals you can't really understand why they would do that

867
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:19,180
I heard our family gives crazy brain okay that's good no but that we won't see him

868
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:27,420
for a while so I don't really you know yeah it's not huge for us and everything

869
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:35,180
I know about Goblin. Everything is really sharp here. It's unpleasant and it's

870
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,860
sort of a few hours go by, you all try to watch TV but the remote is really sharp.

bit of movement and you hear and you see he no movement and and you wake up and

887
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,620
You can kind of hear something coming in from the kitchen.

888
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,620
That was almost bad.

889
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,620
Sorry, yeah.

890
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,620
It could have been really bad.

891
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,620
It almost spilled a lot.

892
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,620
So, yeah.

893
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,620
So, I hear somebody in the kitchen.

894
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,620
Yeah.

895
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,620
Well, I'm already hungry.

896
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,620
Okay.

897
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,620
I might as well.

898
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,820
So, are you going to approach stealthily or just like just want to walk right up with

899
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,820
your big belly out?

900
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,820
Yeah, I guess I'm going to.

901
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,820
I guess I'll stealthy.

902
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,820
You don't have to.

903
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,820
I'll go stealthy.

904
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,820
Roll a stealth check.

905
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,820
Fuck.

906
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:53,220
That wouldn't be what you roll anyway, so it's okay.

907
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,420
It's the wrong dice, so roll a d20.

908
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,140
The one you've been rolling.

909
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,620
I did roll the d20.

910
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,620
It just...

911
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,620
Oh, it knocked over the other one?

912
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,620
Yeah.

913
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,620
Oh, what'd you get then?

914
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,620
I got a three.

915
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,620
Okay, so that's how I get it now.

916
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,100
Uh, yeah, you try to walk...

917
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,140
Hold up, three and then...

918
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,140
I got five then.

919
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,140
Okay.

920
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,140
Yeah, so, uh, you're...

921
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,140
I'm too fat.

922
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,140
You're too fat.

923
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,140
I can't walk stealthily.

924
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,780
Tuba is playing behind you, a la the family guy bit.

925
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,620
And you hear that movement stop suddenly.

926
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,180
And

927
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,420
okay, yeah, and

928
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,820
you hear some more movement coming towards you. You start to see a shadow.

929
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,740
And it's a person. It looks like sort of like a, kind of short, kind of like a

930
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,100
stocky looking person. He's like, "Where are you? I'm looking for you.

931
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,540
where are you? You little hamster.

932
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,040
*Gasp*

933
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,540
Where are you?

934
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,540
We're asleep. We just both just had a nightmare at the same time.

935
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,540
So he can't see me?

936
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,540
He can't see you yet.

937
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,540
Hmm. Oh, what should I do then?

938
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,540
*Groan*

939
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,540
What does the guy look like?

940
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,540
He just looks stocky from what you can tell.

941
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,540
It's kind of a silhouette. Short and stocky.

942
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,540
Short and stocky. What size are his pants?

943
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,540
His pants are...

944
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,660
What size are your pants? Probably like a 38. 38 inseam?

945
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,620
Like you know. He's short that's pretty big for an inseam.

946
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,740
That guy's f*cking huge. He's got a tiny torso then.

947
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,340
Yeah he's got the smallest torso. So say 28 inseam,

948
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,380
30, 37 waist. Okay.

949
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,660
Starting to look like, so he looks like me.

950
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,380
I think that's it about it. Yeah. Huh.

951
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,540
I'm just, I'm talking in my sleep and I'm crying in my sleep.

952
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,540
What fit are the pants?

953
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:47,740
Like are they slim fit or are they very loose? No, they're like regular slacks. Just full-wearing bootcut. Yeah

954
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:55,380
You got a 2004. I feel like not loose fit pants. You got regular pants. Just regular cut. Yeah, I'm gonna grab the cuff of his pants

955
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,420
I'm gonna go behind him and grab the cuff of his pants. Okay, go for it.

956
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,940
This hamster has no fear. You're trying to do a sneaky like?

957
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:10,660
Yeah, so just so like you know how like they put the Millennium Falcon on the back of the Empire Strikes Back the Falcons

958
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:16,020
Go on they put it on and then they go through the garbage shoot. Yes

959
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:31,340
Yeah, so I do I do one of those I grab on to him did like kind of stealthily hide

960
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,340
and see what he's doing.

961
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:32,840
Absolutely.

962
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,640
Okay, roll stealth and then roll sleight of hand.

963
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,240
Okay.

964
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,040
So it's a nine for stealth.

965
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Okay, roll sleight of hand.

966
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,940
We'll see what happens here.

967
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,040
All right, cool.

968
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,140
Nine.

969
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,240
Okay, nine and nine.

970
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:48,540
Okay.

971
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:55,540
So you start to go up to this guy's pants and see a theme

972
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,340
here and he's like, what the hell's going on?

973
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,840
And like he starts moving around and it's like kind of big

974
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,920
stomps to you because you're a little hamster and so you can't quite get even

975
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,440
get a grip on his pants and he's like oh and you start to realize he looks down

976
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:18,120
because he sees you now and it looks like exactly like Joe Pesci but you see

977
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:27,000
his name tag and it says Joe Pesci aka mr. grab your damn dog and

978
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,040
no you know I'm the only dog in this I'm here for him you're asleep and and you

979
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,560
start to and he's like you little hamster and he starts to try to grab at

980
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:54,120
you so he does nose oh he knows your hamster no I eat his nose he tried to

981
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:59,000
eat his nose yep okay we got roll for his face his face was in my face yeah roll

982
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,960
for initiative and that you know what I'll finally do it in this little bit

983
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,440
both of you also roll perception perception so that's a which one would

984
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:13,920
that be so just as your initiative is up top okay so that's a nine okay my

985
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:20,920
perception is 21 okay well I got a four okay I sleep you wake up you hear all

986
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:29,240
this commotion yeah you're about like 40 ish or so feet from the action mm-hmm

987
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,000
but you can kind of get a sense of something's going on somebody's here

988
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,840
you're fucking you're you're sleeping like a rock I'm much rather yeah and

989
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,800
that shit yeah I'm some fucking fat okay so you should also roll for initiative

990
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,720
because you're probably pretty alarm all right and you're gonna be part of the

991
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:55,380
turn order 22 yeah yeah yeah yeah okay cool so and then sorry one more am I

992
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,880
dreaming of something cool you're dreaming of Dracula goes to college whoa

993
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,840
yeah scary but intellectual I'm just eating that guy's butthole over yeah I'm

994
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:13,820
like I hate this this isn't for me not sure why I did this first thing yeah so

995
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,780
So you're actually first a pleasant parrot.

996
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,780
Oh boy.

997
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,640
So you can kind of get a sense of what's going on.

998
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,860
You see a struggle between your friend the hungry hamster and what looks like some sort

999
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:33,020
of Mr. Grab-Yo-Damn-Dog-Shaped Joe Pesci type MF-er.

1000
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:38,580
And you also, with that 21, notice somebody much taller than Joe Pesci a little bit further

1001
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,580
back in the kitchen.

1002
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,580
Whoa.

1003
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,140
You're going to have to be able to sort of look through.

1004
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,140
Yeah.

1005
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,140
It's your turn though.

1006
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,140
Okay.

1007
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,740
So, my movement is 30 feet, so I can't get to Joe Pesci, right?

1008
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,740
You said he's 40 feet.

1009
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,740
Well, you could do 60 feet of movement, but you just can't do an action.

1010
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,740
Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,740
All right.

1012
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,700
So, I'm going to start out by...

1013
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,820
When I mimic human speech, can I mimic a voice?

1014
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,060
Can I try to sound like a specific type of voice?

1015
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,940
I would love for you to do that, yes.

1016
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,060
Okay.

1017
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,060
Let me think here.

1018
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,060
Okay.

1019
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,060
I use my speech ability and I go, "Stop! This is the police!"

1020
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,060
Okay, uh...

1021
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,060
Just from the dog bed.

1022
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,060
[Laughter]

1023
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,060
Okay, uh...

1024
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,060
Let's see what we're gonna want you to do.

1025
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,060
So, I'm gonna say that this is sort of a, uh...

1026
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,060
Okay. Yeah.

1027
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,060
Roll...

1028
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,060
[Clicks tongue]

1029
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,060
Okay, I have to roll against that, actually.

1030
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,060
So, hold on.

1031
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:45,300
I have to roll a couple times actually. You're such a diva Patches.

1032
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,300
Okay. You're a diva buddy. He's always rolling.

1033
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:55,300
Okay. And okay. Yeah. Joe Pesci stops in his tracks. He

1034
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,540
used Polly Wants a What Now? and Joe Pesci just stops in his tracks.

1035
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:03,700
He's still trying to go after the hungry hamster. Did I land a blow to his nose? But he can't move.

1036
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,500
We're gonna resolve that in a second. Okay. Sorry. No you're fine.

1037
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,620
And he stops in his tracks. He can't seem to...

1038
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:12,580
He's like trying to move but you can tell that he can't move. He's like, "Agh!"

1039
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,660
He's still trying to reach for the hamster, but he's not being able to move.

1040
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,740
He's like, "I gotta stop! I don't know why! I'm Joe Pesci!"

1041
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,940
Um...

1042
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,340
Uh, yeah. Is that all you want to do? Or is there something else you want to do?

1043
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,700
Um...

1044
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,620
Well...

1045
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,380
I guess I'll, uh... I guess I'll fly 30 feet towards them.

1046
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,260
Yeah, yeah, you fly 30 feet towards them. You fly towards them.

1047
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,220
[laughter]

1048
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,820
That way I can attack them next time.

1049
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,260
Is he 30 feet away?

1050
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,540
therefore okay okay it's a massive house

1051
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,620
uh...

1052
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,860
it

1053
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,420
is there anything to do with the

1054
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,700
you

1055
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,860
so it was a big i guess it is a barn huh

1056
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,420
the okay mass

1057
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,700
and yes it you

1058
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:58,100
you fly past all the way about the not a shredders done well for you

1059
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,380
uh... yet you fly past all that shit

1060
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,740
on which reminds me about

1061
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,740
This really is the house of my imagination.

1062
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,740
Okay, cool.

1063
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,740
(laughter)

1064
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,740
(laughter)

1065
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,740
Okay, you fly, um...

1066
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,740
Yeah, you fly a bit closer.

1067
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,740
Uh, uh, uh...

1068
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,740
You see Joe Pesci sort of looks up, he's like,

1069
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,740
"You... you parrot, bitch!"

1070
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,740
And like, uh, uh, roll again,

1071
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,740
uh, uh, normal dog.

1072
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,740
Another perception check? Yeah.

1073
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,740
Please wake up. Please wake up.

1074
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,740
I mean, the difficulty class gets lower and lower, so...

1075
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,740
I got five again.

1076
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,740
Okay.

1077
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,620
Oh my god, you're so close to waking up.

1078
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:40,380
Yeah, the dream of you eating that man's ass is just so vivid.

1079
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,020
So the long guy in the back now.

1080
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,020
The long guy?

1081
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,540
The long, Mr. Long Guy.

1082
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:51,620
Yeah, he walks up and sees you, Pleasant Parrot.

1083
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,820
And let's see what he did.

1084
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,460
He takes out what looks like...

1085
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,460
I'm scared!

1086
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,460
Okay, and he...

1087
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,460
Okay.

1088
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,460
Fuck yeah.

1089
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,460
He takes out a staff.

1090
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,460
And you can just make out now that he has some sort of like,

1091
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,460
very gaunt looking face.

1092
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,460
And he goes, "Ahh-HA!"

1093
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,460
And he slams the staff on the ground.

1094
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,460
And, uh, uh...

1095
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,460
And nothing comes out.

1096
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,460
And he's like, "Wha?"

1097
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,460
And he just starts stabbing it on the ground.

1098
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,160
and he's like looking inside, he's trying to see what happened.

1099
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:32,760
And now Joe Pesci, Joe Pesci goes and Joe Pesci,

1100
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,360
Joe Pesci is going to try to grab at you, Hungry Hamster.

1101
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,760
And what is your AC, Hungry Hamster?

1102
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,460
14. 14.

1103
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,060
Okay. Yeah.

1104
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,760
So he tries to grab at you and he just barely misses.

1105
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,660
Like you use your wily dexterity to get out of the way.

1106
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,460
Yeah, your tire framed to roll out of the way.

1107
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,460
I'm gonna be like, "You son of a bitch!" and he's trying to grab at you.

1108
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,660
Um, but it's now your turn, Hungry Hamster.

1109
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,860
Alright, you know what?

1110
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,760
While he's down there, round two.

1111
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,060
Go to bite his nose off.

1112
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,460
Okay, you're gonna do a bite?

1113
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:07,960
Mm-hmm.

1114
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,560
Go for it.

1115
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,460
Roll a d20?

1116
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,760
I'm gonna eat his nose.

1117
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,460
Okay, I mean, so there's an attack for this.

1118
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,960
Add two to whatever you just rolled.

1119
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,160
Damn it.

1120
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,960
Uh, that's gonna be eight.

1121
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,320
Yeah, no, you go to try to bite his nose and you sort of like, you sort of like get your

1122
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,920
first your little front teeth on his nose a little bit, but he's able to like go, "Wah!"

1123
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,400
and like just like sort of shake you off.

1124
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Do I break skin?

1125
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,400
No, you don't break skin.

1126
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,080
Can I try one more time?

1127
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,640
No, you cannot try one more time.

1128
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,640
I'm hungry, man.

1129
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,840
I need to eat his nose.

1130
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,640
You cannot try to bite his nose again, but now it is, uh, roll perception again.

1131
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,640
Please.

1132
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,640
Guarantee I make it this time.

1133
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,640
It's a normal dog.

1134
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,400
To the top of the round.

1135
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,680
And there's been some more activity.

1136
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,680
14.

1137
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,080
You finally, right when that man is about to,

1138
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,840
it turns into your dad, I mean, he comes,

1139
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,680
and then you wake up from the dream.

1140
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,920
(laughing)

1141
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,840
And you're sort of where the Pleasant Parrot was.

1142
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,240
You see sort of the activity going on.

1143
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,760
Roll for initiative now, so you can get into the order.

1144
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,300
- 14.

1145
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,240
- Okay, cool.

1146
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,080
All right, cool.

1147
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,600
So you're up, you sort of see, hmm?

1148
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,560
You sort of see what's going on.

1149
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,400
- Yeah.

1150
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,400
And now it is still Pleasant Parrot, it's still your turn.

1151
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,400
I just wake up confused? That's my whole turn?

1152
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Well it wasn't your turn, it was just you waking up and getting into the order.

1153
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,400
You should have woke up earlier.

1154
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
Yeah, I should have.

1155
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,400
With a 14 though, you're going to go before a couple other people, so that's pretty good.

1156
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
So you're up Pleasant Parrot.

1157
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:42,400
Okay, I fly into Joe Pesci's face and I use my talons on him.

1158
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,400
Do it. Roll a talons attack.

1159
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,440
okay

1160
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,740
that's a sixteen

1161
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,200
yet that hits

1162
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200

01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,720
Okay, now roll an attack roll.

1245
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,280
All right.

1246
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,120
Do I add anything to this?

1247
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,120

I mean, you succeeded.

1251
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,220
You did it.

1252
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,420
For sure, you succeeded.

1253
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,020
So now roll 2d6.

1254
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:16,720
OK.

1255
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,900
That's this one.

1256
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,300
It's square, it's cube.

1257
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,300
Oh, right.

1258
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,260
No, I get it.

1259
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:23,760
It's weird.

1260
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,360
Two at the same time.

1261
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,100
Two girls at the same time, brother.

1262
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,100
Amazing.

1263
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:28,600
Yeah.

1264
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:33,580
So you run up and he's already like mangled nose and you just continue to gnaw at it.

1265
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:38,280
You like, like trying to bite it off like that scene in Master Disguise.

1266
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:46,480
And he's like, "Data Carvey, my worst enemy!" and you're just gnawing at his nose, you're

1267
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,000
finding the little marks that the talons already made and just like making it a lot worse.

1268
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
He's like, "Fuck, this is brutal."

1269
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
- Oh man, I'm biting around.

1270
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
- No, it's brutal.

1271
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,960
- It's like amateur surgeon, I'm going around the thing, the lines, the dotted lines.

1272
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,720
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're just like, you're finding out where they are, you're using them

1273
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,960
as sort of your guiding light for this attack.

1274
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:12,140
Yes, you're all up on this guy's face. It's pretty bad, and it is now back to the top of the order

1275
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,140
So it is your turn Pleasant Parrot

1276
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:17,820
Okay, yeah, you got you got clip. You've got a little clipped

01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,900
Let's see here

1279
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,800
Should I try to love Serena

1280
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,440
I mean, why not? I want to know what this shit happens.

1281
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,560
Yeah, can I use defleer- defleernia?

1282
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,760
Yes, you can. Give me one second.

1283
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,960
The bullet made a big explosion in you.

1284
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah, it exploded my ideas.

1285
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,480
Okay. Of what to do. You can keep this in.

1286
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,040
Of me looking up the table I made earlier.

1287
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,320
He made a table. He made a table for your ability.

1288
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,480
Are you flattered? Or are you a piece of shit? I'm scared.

1289
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,800
All right, roll a d20 right now.

1290
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,080
15.

1291
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,840
Okay.

1292
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1293
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,480
Okay.

1294
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,280
Okay.

1295
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,080
Okay, roll another d20.

1296
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,640
Nine.

1297
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,760
Okay.

1298
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:23,140
Your eyes roll in the back of your head as,

1299
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,480
and, hold on.

1300
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,420
Okay.

1301
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,300
I'm sorry, I'm doing a bunch of secret roles,

1302
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,540
so the tension's here.

1303
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,900
And you feel like a beam is shooting into your head

1304
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:40,300
from nowhere, and out of your mouth,

1305
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,620
you just start speaking in tongues.

1306
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,280
You're (speaking in tongues)

1307
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:54,500
And these two beams of pure acid shoot out of your eyes

1308
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:05,100
and miss Joe Pesci, but melt a part of the kitchen. And now roll

1309
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,020
one more d20. Plus your constitution saving throw.

1310
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:11,060
Oh, no, that's a two.

1311
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:16,820
Okay, cool. Yeah, you take two psychic damage from that.

1312
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,620
That bad?

1313
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,860
Yeah,

1314
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,100
you became unpleasant.

1315
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:26,380
Yeah, okay. Yeah. So, um, uh, there are, I'm going to tell you

1316
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,940
as a friendly DM, there are two ways that the CIA can figure out

1317
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:37,340
where you are. So, so far you're okay. Yeah. The other way that

1318
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:43,540
the CIA, yeah. Yeah, man, I'm a pleasant parrot on the outside,

1319
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:47,940
but I got another side to me. Yeah. I've known Cameron for

1320
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,660
actually many years now. And, um, what I know about him is that

1321
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:57,380
he has a really dark side. An evil side. An evil side that's dark and scary and so I

1322
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,900
wanted to make sure. You know when someone's trying to hurt my homies it

1323
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,580
brings the bad me out. Yeah Cameron's a little bit of a bad boy. They tried to get with

1324
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:11,620
Patrick and he turned to a savage. Yeah so when that happens though you hear

1325
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:20,980
Chope as you go "Holy shit!" He takes 100 points of fear damage. That just means he

1326
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:25,180
His pants like a hundred points of poop damage. Ask me

1327
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:31,660
It is now Skeletor's turn

1328
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,940
But before I do that throw one other role

1329
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:40,120
Okay. Yeah, so okay. So all right Skeletor's first though

1330
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:47,500
Before what just happened happened and Skeletor once again is gonna try to activate his staff and this time use it on you

1331
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:54,860
Normal dog since you fucked up his ass real nasty. I'm gonna do it again. He's not careful. Yeah. Yeah, he he

1332
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:57,940
Stabs a staff on the ground and you see a

1333
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,220
to

1334
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:03,380
Two sort of orbs shoot out and they shoot out towards you

1335
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:06,620
But you're able to like just easily dodge them out of the way you see

1336
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:09,220
What?

1337
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:11,740
And

1338
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:14,860
You also hear downstairs you hear some noise now

1339
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:18,720
It sounds like a guy with a bunch of knives is walking through his own house

1340
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,480
You hear that a little bit, but now it is

1341
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:30,820
Your turn normal dog. I try pull his pants down all right go for it roll a attack roll

1342
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:34,060
Just straight attack roll add strength. That's just a d20. Yeah, that's right

1343
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:39,100
16 yeah his pants come down. I like his butthole

1344
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:46,020
Is he bones under it I'm I do I let you lick his butthole - is that count as another action?

1345
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:54,660
Yeah, that's a bonus action you like his butthole yeah, and he's like oh god he man

1346
01:12:54,660 --> 01:13:00,300
It's like fucking milk

1347
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:08,940
Strong bones on this boy's ass tastes like milk. Yeah, you're looking at milk. Yeah doing no damage to this turn

1348
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,420
It's more of an intimidation thing than anything.

1349
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,420
You know what?

1350
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,420

1353
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,420
You know what?

1354
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:18,420
Roll intimidation.

1355
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:19,420
That's a good idea.

1356
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,420
I don't give a fuck.

1357
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,420
Okay.

1358
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,420

01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:00,540
- You can describe this as a bite.

1424
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,380
- Through his mouth.

1425
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,200
- Okay.

1426
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,040
- I bite him first.

1427
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,300
(laughing)

1428
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,140
And I stick my tongue all the way through his asshole

1429
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,080
and then it goes all the way to his mouth

1430
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,020
and then I use my tongue as leverage

1431
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:13,340
to make his mouth say, "I'm knocked out."

1432
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,180
(laughing)

1433
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,020
- Okay, yeah.

1434
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:15,840
- And then he goes to sleep.

1435
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,740
- Yeah, his non-existent eyes roll in the back of his head

1436
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:22,920
and he falls over and he like hits the ground

1437
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,980
and becomes like a, like it sounds like a bowling pin

1438
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:25,820
is knocking over.

1439
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,660
(crashing)

1440
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,060
And then I go back to just normal licking his ass.

1441
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:29,560
Yeah.

1442
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,560
Yeah, so now...

1443
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,560
He hits the ground and as his bones fall it plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on xylophone.

1444
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:45,560
Yeah, so now the scene is like bloody beak, bloody hamster mouth, a dog with a tongue full of bone ass.

1445
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,560
With a poop ring around his mouth.

1446
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,060
Yeah, and Shredder is looking at this and he's like, "I've seen this before."

1447
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:56,420
And he comes down, he kneels down to all of you, and he tries his best to like explain to you all.

1448
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:01,300
We can say, "You need to all leave from here. Look, I can get you guys out of here real fast."

1449
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:07,540
Like, okay. And he sort of leads you all outside and he shows you a motorcycle with two side cars

1450
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:13,220
that are made for animals. One of the side cars is a hamster ball.

1451
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,940
Yeah. Yes. And he's like, and he's like, he's like, "You guys got to get out of here. Okay?

1452
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:22,820
The cops are not gonna like this. I can't have this heat on me. I don't want this heat on you.

1453
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:25,540
Go. Go to Duluth. That's where your family is.

1454
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:28,020

01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:28,580

Or Wisconsin.

1459
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:33,460
Where are we?

1460
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:37,140
