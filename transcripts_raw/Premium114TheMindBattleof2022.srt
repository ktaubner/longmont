1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you are not a premium subscriber, please pause now and purchase a premium membership

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
immediately.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What are you saying?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is that?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Fuck you.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Put that down.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Don't.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Put that down.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't start.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's not.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh my god.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What the fuck is that?

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's not even, he's still muted.

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I have no idea what he's eating or saying.

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is he eating?

20
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,260
(laughing)

21
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:39,720
- As we're recording over Discord now,

22
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,440
it doesn't save the video anymore,

23
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,020
so that's just lost to time.

24
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,860
- Oh man.

25
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,680
- What the fuck was that, dude?

26
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,520
- So gross.

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
- He just literally drank black slime

28
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,720
out of like a blue and white teacup.

29
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,040
(laughing)

30
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
- It was the bottom--

31
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,380
- Like a fancy porcelain teacup.

32
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,760
- I'm so done with Caleb right now.

33
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,240
He needs to turn his microphone on.

34
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
It was the, it was the uh...

35
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,480
He's been sitting here not, he's been sitting here with his mic muted the whole time.

36
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
My mic isn't muted.

37
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
He hasn't talked to us once.

38
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,920
Pat's been doing this for the last ten minutes.

39
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
He's trying to talk right now.

40
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,720
He's trying really hard to make it like a, for it to turn the corner, but I don't think

41
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,080
it's going to.

42
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,760
I don't think you're going to make it Pat.

43
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I don't think it's going to hit.

44
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,760
I think you could maybe drop it now and then like bring it back in ten minutes and then

45
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,760
it might hit, like, a little.

46
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm so I'm done with this already. Close eBay. Close Grailed. No, I'm not on Grailed. You are

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,760
on Grailed. You got into Drake and you closed Grailed all day. If he's gonna do this then

48
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,080
I might go on Grailed. Pat got into, he listened to 30 Seconds and Take Care. I'm going to eBay

49
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,700
and look up some audio shoes. He's been trying to install Depop on his Kindle. Yep. This

50
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,160
is what Caleb's doing. This is Caleb's fault. Why do you think someone would want to listen

51
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I might buy a pair of audio bands.

52
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
This is, you're ruining the episode right now.

53
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Who, me or Caleb?

54
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
You.

55
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm not. I'm not ruining it. Caleb's ruining it by not speaking.

56
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Oh, look at this. Audio Jeremy Reyes.

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
I'm speaking. You heard me sing Drake earlier.

58
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Size 8, they benefit charity.

59
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,160
He's waiting for one of us to go like, "Wait, can he actually not hear him?"

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
And then he's gonna say like, "I got you."

61
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
But it's not gonna happen.

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Pat heard, oh he just said "Mhm."

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,780
And he's ruining the episode because I know he's recording and I know that we're not gonna

64
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,100
hear a goddamn thing.

65
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,780
Caleb, what would you do to Pat's mom?

66
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,700
What would I do to Pat's mom?

67
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,340
I'd fucking, I'd fillet her like a fish.

68
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,820
I wouldn't even do anything sexual to her, I'd just murder her.

69
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,300
Damn, audio Brian Summers.

70
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,900
I'd eat her old organs.

71
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
Like new old stuff.

72
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,980
I'd probably dry age your mom.

73
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,140
I'd follow the recipe of a Guga Foods video and I'd dry age your mom in hot sauce and

74
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
I'd eat her.

75
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,260
Wait, I just thought of something, Pat.

76
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,420
If Caleb's mic is off, you probably wouldn't mind if he said your address right now, right?

77
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,860
Your full address, street address, zip code?

78
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,900
Yeah, I can do that.

79
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Please don't.

80
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Please don't do that.

81
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Please don't what?

82
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
No, he's muted, right?

83
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
It's fine.

84
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
Here, then stop me.

85
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
Stop it.

86
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh, so he can hear me.

87
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
You gotta call me.

88
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,900
You're at a bar.

89
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,460
We got a call, we were at a bar last night, me and Caleb, and we got a call from a fan.

90
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,140
Shout out to that guy.

91
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,380
But we were at a bar- Dude, I just got you so good, don't try and

92
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
misdirect.

93
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,460
You gotta admit, you just lost so hard.

94
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
Fuck you.

95
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,260
I know, this sucks.

96
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,580
But we were at a bar last night and some old guy starts talking to us, and he's talking

97
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,020
to us about how he wants to like, move out of the city.

98
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,820
And he's like, "Yeah, I won't move past the Mason-Dixon line, 'cause it's full of you-know-whats."

99
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,500
and then Caleb started prodding him to what he meant by you know what's and

100
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,700
then he was like oh it's full of mongrels. He said mongrels. Dude it was so crazy.

101
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,900
It was awesome dude. Maybe he was talking about dogs. He might have honestly been

102
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,240
talking about raccoons. That would be. There's a lot of raccoons. That would be better if

103
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,980
he was. Yeah but it was pretty it was pretty and the bartender just didn't do shit.

104
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,580
Jesus Christ, the bartender just fucking sat there and then after he left he was like,

105
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,580
"Erm, was that guy being weird?"

106
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,980
I was like, "Yeah dude, you're six inches from him."

107
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,980
I fucking hate this dude, I'm done.

108
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,980
"You're serving him drinks, dude."

109
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,980
What?

110
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,980
What the fuck?

111
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Where did he go?

112
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,820
What is happening?

113
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,540
If that messed up the recording for the sink, I'd be so upset.

114
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,540
Why did you leave Pat?

115
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,220
Dude, and then tell Caleb to turn the mute off.

116
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,820
My mute is not on!

117
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
There's literally no mute.

118
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,340
He's muted right now.

119
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
No!

120
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,060
Say the gotcha or whatever.

121
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
I'll do the thing.

122
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
Oh what the fuck, wait.

123
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
How did...

124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,620
I didn't know he could speak the whole time.

125
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,780
Wait, we should restart.

126
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,380
Because for some reason Caleb was muted on my end.

127
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
And I thought he was...

128
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,380
This can't be true.

129
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,380
No, it's not true.

130
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,380
I don't believe it.

131
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,380
*laughing*

132
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
No fucking way, dude.

133
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
Did you think that we were getting you?

134
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
Yes! We thought you were trying to get us.

135
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,380
No, I wasn't! I thought you guys

136
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,380
were trying to get me.

137
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,380
What the fuck? You were muted on my end

138
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,380
for some reason. And then you rage quit?

139
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,380
Yeah. You never thought to check if it was

140
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,380
on your end? No, I really

141
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,660
I was gonna say like, "Hey, check if his volume is just turned down in your Discord settings."

142
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,180
But I'm not gonna do that, 'cause then you would do the gotcha to me and I would lose.

143
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,580
And I'm not losing in that fight.

144
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Not happening.

145
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
Dude, that was...

146
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,580
I'd rather ruin the episode than lose.

147
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,580
Dude.

148
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,820
I thought that you got mad because I corrected you when you sang Drake earlier, which I guess

149
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
you didn't even hear that.

150
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,380
You got the lyrics wrong by the way, you fucker.

151
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,620
You came into the, um, oh you know what it was?

152
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,660
You had me muted because of the stream the other day.

153
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,620
And I never unmuted you because you left before everyone.

154
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,760
Fuck, dude.

155
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,220
You are as fucking dumb as a rock.

156
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,020
I'm so sorry about this.

157
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
You didn't even hear me.

158
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,020
That was pretty funny actually.

159
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
It is kind of funny.

160
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
This is actually the best outcome of this.

161
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,660
I'm really glad that it wasn't just like a failed like bit that was getting pushed through.

162
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,460
That actually makes it really good.

163
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:39,540
We were both so determined not to be fucked that we just ruined the beginning of the episode.

164
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,140
This is really exposing in our friendship what high alert we always have to be on.

165
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
I know.

166
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,940
Did you really say my address?

167
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
No.

168
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
No.

169
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
Okay.

170
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
I got close.

171
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Thank God.

172
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
To starting to say it.

173
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,340
Yeah, but now it's like, now there's just like me talking over you and shit.

174
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
It's like.

175
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,540
pretty good job of moving around it. No, it's fine, yeah. I'm pretty much a pro. Yeah. I

176
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,700
think it will actually be the best episode ever. Dude, it's... You might have missed this.

177
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:13,900
I did say I was going to dry age your mom's meat like a Guga Fruits video and eat her.

178
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,900
And you... I said I was going to dry age her in Da Bomb hot sauce and you had no reaction.

179
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:29,820
I was like that's interesting this guy has no respect for his own mom.

180
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,500
He's stone faced at that.

181
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
That's pretty wild.

182
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Jesus Christ dude.

183
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,580
Oh my god there's so much I missed in the beginning of the- I dude.

184
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,700
Cause you- I was like dude literally I'm like looking at like shoes and shit and I'm just

185
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,060
like oh yeah no.

186
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,900
Caleb wants to ruin the episode I'll do it too.

187
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:54,000
I legit thought that you were trying like you were doing like a silent bit. It was like

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
Thought you were doing a thing where it's like oh my mic doesn't work

190
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,820
I was saying for like like before we even record it - I was like Caleb unmute yourself

191
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,540
God damn dude. I do that normally that's like a thing you would do as a joke though true. Yeah

192
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,260
I think those things are you would also

193
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,820
Go a whole episode with your break

194
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,140
Yeah, they're both things that you would do but I'm so stupid

195
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,980
We just had a war yeah

196
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,340
We had a mental war. I've never said like a brain battle. I've never done a brain battle with you guys

197
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,260
Yeah, that was crazy. That was intense. I know I

198
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,580
Didn't I think I might have PTSD from that. I thought I thought I was gonna so I

199
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,640
Fucking left the call because I thought that as soon as I left the call Kayla would unmute

200
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,520
So now I was gonna do a gotcha where it's like you motherfucker. And no it was

201
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,700
my fault

202
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,540
the minds battle of

203
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,540
2022 oh man

204
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,420
Pretty good rage quit though that you had if I was doing it it worked really well. Yeah. Yeah, did you did you get upset?

205
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,120
No, you got upset you left

206
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,260
Were you upset that I left? No, I do hope that you leaving does I up the recording? Yeah, I know I think

207
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,100
I think it'll be good.

208
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,940
- I'm sure it'll be fine.

209
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
- It's fine, who cares?

210
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,440
- If I, what if I had cancer, would you care?

211
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
- Yeah.

212
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,400
- What kind of cancer, everybody has cancer,

213
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,500
what kind of cancer do you think you have?

214
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,340
- But.

215
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,340
- I sometimes get worried that I have entire body cancer.

216
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,860
- I'm worried that this hemorrhoid isn't just a hemorrhoid

217
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,820
and that it's colon cancer.

218
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,260
- You got polyps?

219
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,620
- I think I might have cancer.

220
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,060
I think I might have mind cancer, which is completely different from brain cancer.

221
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,580
I have mind cancer.

222
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
ADHD.

223
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,220
I have a lump on my nut, but I've been told that that's kind of pretty normal these days.

224
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
Yeah.

225
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Yeah.

226
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,300
I've been told that girls like it, so I'm trying to make it bigger.

227
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Yeah.

228
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,740
It's actually really...

229
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,780
Girls like it when you have a lumpy nut.

230
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,240
Girls like it when your nut has the texture of a grenade.

231
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,980
They really like that.

232
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,500
I have a horn on my ball.

233
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Really?

234
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
But, no.

235
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Oh, what?

236
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,060
Why are you lying to me?

237
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,340
Yeah, I know.

238
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,860
You just said you wanted the texture of a grenade.

239
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,860
If you had a horn...

240
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,340
I said girls like it when you have a grenade nut.

241
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,680
Mine only has one little grenade bump on it.

242
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Mine has a pin.

243
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
What?

244
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,220
Yeah, my grenade has a pin.

245
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,220
All in your nuts grenades is pretty cool actually.

246
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,620
Yeah, hit me right in the old grenades.

247
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
The grenades.

248
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,220
Yeah, I mean they are volatile.

249
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,740
Damn, because I need someone to jump on these and save me.

250
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Yes!

251
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Yes sir!

252
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:58,020
Oh shit, I can't show you, that's your present, I can't show you that.

253
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,820
Oh dude, we can do presents tonight.

254
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,260
Yeah, do you want to show the presents?

255
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Oh no, no, no, we'll just meet up later.

256
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
No, I want to give you my present in person.

257
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Yeah.

258
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,460
I told Caleb what I got you last night.

259
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,020
I thought illness got me, but it turns out pestilence passed me by.

260
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,260
Damn.

261
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
That's real shit.

262
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,260
Damn.

263
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,380
Yeah, rapid to rapid test negative for pestilence.

264
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,380
Really?

265
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Did you guys see my new shirt?

266
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,300
Yeah, it's got a cartoon on it.

267
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Yeah, it's got a little cartoon.

268
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Dude, you're into cartoons.

269
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,260
I'm getting into cartoons.

270
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
You're wearing a full...

271
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
I've been getting into...

272
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
Are you wearing a full poop outfit?

273
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
You're wearing all brown again.

274
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
No, I'm not.

275
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
No, this is like a meme.

276
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
Oh my God, he's poop boy.

277
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,260
He's pooped out.

278
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Hey, what's up my boy dookie doubt?

279
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,100
Never tell you guys about there's this kid that used to Jonathan. He talked about us

280
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,540
No, there's this kid who when we had like, you know, we had like a like a shitty like

281
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,420
Like trampoline

282
00:11:52,420 --> 00:12:00,380
We had one of those like old squeaky trampoline

283
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,820
Like they do with the hot dogs. Yeah

284
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,980
He's dipping turds in milk.

285
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,900
And then this kid came over one time, my little brother's best friend growing up, and now you

286
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,180
switched to a full vagina outfit.

287
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,820
I'm one in the pink and two in the stink.

288
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,420
He has a pink hat on now.

289
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,140
And it's got jasmine on it.

290
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,980
But then this kid, he tried to pee off of the trampoline, he peed all over the fucking

291
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,660
trampoline while we were all jumping on it.

292
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:36,660
We were jumping a P out at everyone and then we started calling him P-Boy and then my dad

293
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,420
and my older brother both forgot his real name and then for just years they would just say

294
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,020
like where is P-Boy gonna come over and his mom had to like sit my entire family down

295
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,740
and be like hey he really it hurts his feelings when you call him P-Boy.

296
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,220
That's so funny.

297
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,220
Yeah.

298
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,220
That's tight.

299
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,100
I would never stop calling him that.

300
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,300
At that point though you got to reclaim the name.

301
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
You got to reclaim the nickname.

302
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,180
Yeah, he used to dress up like Spider-Man every day too.

303
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,300
Every day?

304
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,980
He would dress up like Spider-Man every- like he went to high school like every day as Spi-

305
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,580
in a different Spider-Man outfit.

306
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,300
I think you guys really did affect him.

307
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,460
I think they literally broke his brain, dude.

308
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,100
Yeah.

309
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,820
Yeah.

310
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
And then his mom destroyed my car.

311
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,020
Why?

312
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,380
The first car I ever got, like my stepdad gave me his old car when I turned 16,

313
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,380
and then I drove it for one week and then she borrowed it for a day and crashed it.

314
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,660
I never had a car again until college.

315
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,660
Damn.

316
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,620
I would never do that to my friends.

317
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,220
Yeah, I would never do that to the boy who tormented my son.

318
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,580
It did feel like a revenge thing.

319
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,580
Oh, it was totally a revenge thing.

320
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,580
It had to have been on purpose, right?

321
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
Yeah.

322
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,980
What if I just took my hands off the wheel of the guy who invented P-Boy?

323
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,260
Yeah, oh, here's your car, car boy.

324
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,020
She's sitting there whistling and then out of nowhere she just goes, "Whew!"

325
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,100
And just fucking turns the wheel into like a Sbarro

326
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:04,900
Well, you you think we had some borrow? Yes, and little old Wilmington, North Carolina. Yes. Hell no

327
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,660
Why not? We just got a Blaze Pizza

328
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,940
Really just recently. Yep

329
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,020
It's a cone next time we're down. It was huge. I

330
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,660
went with

331
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:27,820
I went with Pete my grandpa and boy was he fucking mad at that place.

332
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,340
Yeah he didn't like it.

333
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,660
He was like goddamn pizza is too fucking small.

334
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Pizza is supposed to be as big as a wheel.

335
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,020
This pizza is small ass pizza.

336
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,580
Plus they make you make it yourself.

337
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,540
You should tell them what you want and they make you everything but you have to say it

338
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,060
with every step of the process.

339
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,400
He has a really hard time at places like that or Subway where he can't, he doesn't know

340
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,660
what the ingredients are that he's looking at.

341
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Yeah.

342
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,700
So he can't say them really and like he can't, he doesn't wear the glasses that he's supposed

343
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,340
to have so he can't read it either.

344
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,000
Gets overwhelmed by the options.

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So he's just sitting there pointing at things.

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He's that one guy.

347
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,260
Yeah, he's pointing at ricotta cheese and he says that stuff or he's pointing at spinach

348
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,460
and he says that.

349
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,580
Someday he's going to invent like a new perfect sandwich.

350
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,540
Yeah, he probably will.

351
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,300
sane person would ever order on purpose. And he can't explain what's on it. Yeah.

352
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,020
It's that stuff. That's the most amazing sandwich ever. Yeah. Yeah, it's got a little bit of

353
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,740
that. It's got some white blur, some green blur. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, the Craig bot

354
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,380
left. Craig hates us. It's okay, we already have it synced to the beginning, right? Yeah.

355
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:39,460
I hope so. Should be fine. It should be fine. I'm crazy for Craig. This does make me upset.

356
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,780
We're getting mad at Craig. We gotta stop doing this Discord thing, man. I need to feel you

357
00:15:42,780 --> 00:16:02,260
to

358
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,060
He definitely heard him.

359
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,980
I mean when he said "You know what's" it's pretty...

360
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,540
No he probably heard the whole thing.

361
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Get the fuck out of here Craig!

362
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,940
I brought Craig back because for my own peace of mind.

363
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,740
I like seeing his face in there.

364
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,500
It is nice to have a little bear.

365
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,300
I was thinking today that we should get a fourth guy.

366
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Yeah.

367
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,340
Well we have Kyle.

368
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,020
I mean yeah I kind of want to get Kyle into the recordings.

369
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Besides Kyle, yeah.

370
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Yeah we just haven't...

371
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,940
We do need a new guy besides Kyle though.

372
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,100
We recruited Kyle, but he's still out in LA.

373
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,620
We could get Bexley on the mic.

374
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
I don't know.

375
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,660
He's not funny to laugh at, but he's not funny to laugh with.

376
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,700
What about The Dominator?

377
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,220
Oh, dude.

378
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,020
I haven't seen him since college.

379
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm playing with fucking...

380
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,900
I feel like he's always on.

381
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,580
No I know, he's definitely always on but like, I mean that's what's so sick about him.

382
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,380
That's what's good to have him on the mic.

383
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,020
We don't have to hang out with him, I mean I hope he doesn't listen to this but just

384
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,500
have him on the show and walk him away.

385
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,180
He told me he's like a die hard.

386
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Yeah?

387
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,500
What does that mean?

388
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
He listens to every episode.

389
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
He told me he's a dominator.

390
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,340
Yeah, well that's his nickname.

391
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:34,340
short for Dominic Polisi.

392
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,060
I just think we need a new energy.

393
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,140
Yeah we do need a new energy. Or maybe an animal. That's what I mean when Kyle moves back.

394
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,420
It's gonna be so sick.

395
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,380
What if we got Zabumafu?

396
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,140
We got a pet?

397
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,740
So you know a pet would be really good but I have another pitch.

398
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,980
So you know how every normal episode we do a different list.

399
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,740
we don't have to list on the premium what if every premium episode we get a new pet we get a new pet

400
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:09,300
or we record in a completely different country that's gonna get really expensive really fast

401
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,780
i think yeah that's what the patreon is for right that's true we can also and once we get over to

402
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,780
like the small countries wherever those are we can just kind of walk from one to the other

403
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:24,660
uh we'll see it would be this guam a country i think it's a territory yeah territory is a country

404
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:31,060
to me. It would be fun to all of us get normal jobs and then just break even

405
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,580
with the patreon where we spend that much money every month on something with the

406
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,100
podcast. That would be so sick honestly. Yeah. If we spent all the patreon

407
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,260
money every month just to do like stupid shit for episodes though this would

408
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,500
maybe be the best podcast in history. What do you think I've been doing? Yeah Pat's been doing that with shirts and

409
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,620
beanies getting new kinds of poop outfits.

410
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,220
Oh this one will look like a corn.

411
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Pat literally walks into fucking Beacon's closet and says...

412
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,540
Do you have anything that looks like a streak of red pepper?

413
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:15,260
No it's not Beacon's closet, it's Basin's closet.

414
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,820
You go to Bacon's closet and you have to look like different kinds of food.

415
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,820
Basin's closet is all poop and pee colored clothes.

416
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
No.

417
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Yeah.

418
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,180
You asked us to, you say, "Can you make me look like a green zucchini?"

419
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,820
Basin's washroom.

420
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,060
This is getting, you're making this disgusting.

421
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,940
You're the one who dresses up like poop and pee every day.

422
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,380
You literally have, you started this episode dressed up as poop talking into a pee pee

423
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
microphone.

424
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,380
Do you see this?

425
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
It's longer on this side.

426
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,660
I have to go fix that right now.

427
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,340
You say that every day of your life.

428
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,140
Every time you talk to me you say, "I just noticed my mustache is lopsided."

429
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,540
I'd like to lop the side of your head off with an axe.

430
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
Why?

431
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Why would you do-

432
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,900
That's kind of messed up, Caleb.

433
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
You would not benefit from that at all.

434
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,420
I don't know if you did anything that warranted that.

435
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Yeah.

437
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
Because I mean-

438
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

439
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Wait ten minutes.

440
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,100
Wait ten minutes until I say something fucking stupid.

441
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,780
Like you could, you know, you could cut his head in half or whatever.

442
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,140
like they could like science could study that cross-section and like understand

443
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,860
how like thoughts are formed in the brain and stuff it just looks like ice cream

444
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:32,780
that's brain if you gave it to scientists it's mint chocolate chip if you hand

445
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,860
Pat's brain to a scientist which they're pretty you know hard to come by you're

446
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:43,060
like we study this they just like eyeball it there's no I think it might

447
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,820
be one of those things where they like suppress it because nobody can like can

448
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,080
get their hands on that technology like if like a scientist invented mind

449
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,680
control and like they're just like no I have to destroy this yeah I think if you

450
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,100
donate a pet's brain to science they might just like just crush it immediately

451
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,860
they'd say they'd be like legally this is an ant's brain it's just a big ants

452
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,060
brain you're gonna like do what they did with the third brain and spy kids and

453
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,660
they're just gonna make an army of stupid people to go off to war you can

454
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I think they already have that.

455
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
I think they are Spy Kids recently.

456
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,660
I watched Spy Kids 3 recently, but I don't remember what happens in the original Spy

457
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Kids.

458
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,060
In the original one, they have a microwave that makes food, which is huge.

459
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,100
That's the one with the little robot, the little bug robot thing.

460
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
That guy was so cool.

461
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,260
Oh, that was Spy Kids 2.

462
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
I had that fucking...

463
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
That guy rocked, dude.

464
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
What was his name?

465
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,100
Dude, I had the Spy Kids like play set as a kid.

466
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,540
I had all the gadgets and shit.

467
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,180
I wish I had the Spy Kids play set.

468
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Spy Kids...

469
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
Dude, that thing was so sick.

470
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:47,340
We should get that now. We should go. We should we spend all our money. We spent all the money

471
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,580
on the Patreon on Spycoin. His name was Ralph, dude. Yeah, Ralph. Oh, really? Yeah, he was

472
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:58,460
cool as fuck. He was a, it was short for Robotic Arachnid Lithium Photo Helper. Yeah, I guessed

473
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,940
that. That was apparent to me. I knew that as soon as they said Ralph in the movie. Yeah.

474
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,820
I got it instantly. I could just tell by the design of the robot what it meant. Yeah, I was

475
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:13,860
like well it's a lithium photo helper and he is robotic yeah obviously yeah that

476
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,860
thing was sick it came in a little briefcase. It's not a pet we need a robot sidekick

477
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:24,540
that is oh yes dude yes how much do you think those Boston Dynamics dogs are

478
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:31,180
probably not that much. Three if you just take them. Well that's true if you ride away on it

479
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,860
mm-hmm but you can't the thing is about that compared to a normal dog you can't

480
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:43,260
lure it with a bone? No you can lure it with a computer chip. Yeah. Like a floppy

481
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,900
disk that has the program for the taste of chocolate without the poison.

482
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:54,820
Yeah that might be pretty delightful to a dog. That could be actually great. You

483
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,500
know what maybe that's what we do. We put all of our money into

484
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,860
getting into making chocolate for dogs.

485
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,940
Yeah. I think they have something like that.

486
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,620
I'm not sure they also just eat chocolate and yeah.

487
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,900
Then they could just go to the hospital. Yeah. I mean, if a dog,

488
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,940
if a dog eats chocolate, it's fine with me.

489
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,540
You have to give the dog a Benadryl first and then I can eat chocolate. Yeah.

490
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,980
Yeah. You got to crush it up. Yeah. Like a lactate for, for dogs.

491
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,380
But for sure. You want to lactate a dog? Yeah. Yeah. I bet you do. Yes.

492
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,020
I bet you do yes. I do want to taste different kinds of milk. Yeah. Yeah, you

493
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,920
know what I'm not I think I'm not against tasting a dog's milk. Are you like

494
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,720
honestly I think I think yes, I was talking about about with with Pierce

495
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,020
about the boy egg thing where I think it's okay to want to drink a dog's milk,

496
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,120
but not if you have a specific dog in mind. Uh-huh. Like I think yeah, I think

497
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,720
that's fair. Somebody hands you a glass of dog milk and you drink it. I think

498
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,800
that's fine but if you're like I want to milk that dog and right no no no no no

499
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,080
no no no I disagree I disagree that's like saying it's okay to eat lobster but

500
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,240
not you can't pick the specific one I'm gonna look at like okay I don't want to

501
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,320
fucking pit bulls milk I don't want something muscly sure I want like I want

502
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,480
like a an Afghan hound yeah yeah something fucking crazy you know it looks

503
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,080
like it has hair like a beautiful woman yeah I want to like even that like when

504
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
you're picking out a lobster you see what you're eating.

505
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
Yeah.

506
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
When you're picking out the dog you're like looking at its nipples and stuff.

507
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
I can sense the vibe of the milk.

508
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
Yeah, I'm looking at the nipples.

509
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm looking at the claws if I'm getting a lobster.

510
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
I'm saying, "Oh, those are big meaty claws."

511
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
You're going to eat the claws.

512
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Yeah, and I'm going to drink those titties, the tit milk.

513
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
No, you're going to drink what's inside.

514
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
No.

515
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Yeah.

516
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
It's different.

517
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Okay, do you think that bad milk comes out of beautiful breasts?

518
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
No.

519
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
It's good milk.

520
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Maybe.

521
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
So you have to assess the breast of the dog and say...

522
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Well, hold on.

523
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Hold on.

524
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,840
Here's my new rule. You can't know the dog's name.

525
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,840
That's fine. I'm going to give them...

526
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,360
I'm going to immediately find out the name after I take one sip of the milk anyway.

527
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,480
If you find out the dog's name in the middle of you drinking it, you have to spit it out.

528
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,720
You can't...

529
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,200
I don't think this is right.

530
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,240
I think that's completely true.

531
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,800
If you see one dog that has, like I said...

532
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,280
Even if you saw a guy drink a big glass of just normal cow's milk and then say like,

533
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,000
"Thank you, Bessie," that would not be okay.

534
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That is okay.

535
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's a gift.

536
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,880
Well, Bessie is like the name of most cows, isn't it?

537
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,680
The farmer's name, the cow...

538
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
What are you talking about?

539
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
They have names.

540
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,680
The farmer knows the cow's name and they know which one gives you the best milk and it's

541
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,360
the one with the fattest fucking tits.

542
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,160
So that's why I feel like if you see a dog, if you see a pit bull, right, and it's got

543
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,760
like six packs with titties on them I don't want that but if you see a dog

544
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,760
that has like a like a plump sumptuous kind of like a curve. Okay Nuru you can't say plump or sumptuous.

545
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,800
Plump, sumptuous, delectable curve because it's almost like the milk is like

546
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,160
falling out right it's like falling off the bones like short ribs you know it's

547
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
It's just like this milk needs to get out.

548
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,660
Okay, alright.

549
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,160
What happened to you?

550
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
New rule, okay.

551
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,160
It's too delicious to keep milk in this dog's body.

552
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,160
I have my new final rule, which is that you can drink dog milk unless you're Caleb.

553
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,660
Yeah.

554
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,160
That's the one situation you're not allowed anywhere near him.

555
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Dude, you, you...

556
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Yeah, that's probably a good call.

557
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,160
You fucking described that...

558
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,160
That, I was, for a brief second, I was like, "He's fucked a dog before."

559
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
What?

560
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
For a split second.

561
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,880
What point in that entire thing did I get sexual at all?

562
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
At what point?

563
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Name one thing that I said that sounded even remotely sexual.

564
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,440
I don't even want to say it now.

565
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,880
Women who have bigger boobs make more and better milk.

566
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,560
They don't make more milk.

567
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,040
Dogs that have humongous...

568
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Humongouses.

569
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Humongers.

570
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Dogs who have humongers.

571
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
A dog with humongers?

572
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:21,480
have humongous. A dog with humongous is gonna make humongously tasty milk that will taste

573
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,920
better when you put it. Okay, also what do you think, I feel like dog milk is gonna be

574
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:35,120
a little bit acrid, right? It's gonna be a little uh, gym-socky. Yeah. And, but, but,

575
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,800
I think it's gonna be an acquired taste and I think it's gonna have a really nice finish

576
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,620
with a little bit of a sweetness at the end like a honeysuckle.

577
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
Best animal.

578
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
Goat.

579
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,680
Best animal milk.

580
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Best animal milk?

581
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,280
I wanna hear from Caleb.

582
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
To drink?

583
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Yeah.

584
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,180
No, to what do you mean, what else?

585
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,580
I mean, milk has plenty of applications.

586
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,660
I don't wanna hear them.

587
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,760
You can wash a car window with milk.

588
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,000
No, you can't.

589
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,500
You can and I've done it.

590
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Prove it.

591
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

592
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,340
We stop recording right now, we go to Caleb's car, and we watch him watch the window with

593
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
the milk.

594
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,740
Try to say watch him watch again.

595
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,100
Watch him watch the window with the milk.

596
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,580
There we go.

597
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,920
Okay, let's do it then.

598
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,620
You can fix a DVD with it too.

599
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,620
That one I believe.

600
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,620
Milk has a lot of things going on that you guys just don't understand I guess.

601
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,260
But number one milk has got to be, I mean it's got to be a dog.

602
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
I've had...

603
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:40,540
I think, okay, I think I'm adding a rule that you can drink any animal milk except for your

604
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
number one.

605
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,460
Why are you just trying to get in the way?

606
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,700
I honestly now I'm like I need to like find, like I have to try this before I die.

607
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,700
You're going to drink dog milk.

608
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,820
Yeah, wait until like I don't know you anymore.

609
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,700
really would I don't want to see if I got it no it's not about the act of you doing

610
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,020
it's that I don't want to see how your personality changes you become a an

611
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,740
addict and you crave dog milk and you become a slave to the impulse wouldn't

612
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,220
become an addict that doesn't make you literally be addicted to dog milk

613
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,580
instantly it's probably not that good I just mean that it probably is a lot more

614
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:22,180
complex I do not want to see the videos you would be uploading to Vimeo I don't

615
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,100
to see anything that has to do with like your personality or your presence in the world

616
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,740
at all. I want you to be gone from my mind.

617
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,100
Guess who's not getting the password to the videos? You. You might get the URL, you're

618
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:39,780
not getting the password out of me though. I don't want it. It's probably ginormous.

619
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,660
Humongous, actually, is what it is. Ginormous are a different level and they're bigger than

620
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:51,260
humongous and a dog can't possibly... Ginormous wouldn't fit on a dog's fragile frame. You

621
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,840
don't know what about a great a great game could have some ginormous but they

622
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,120
have they're a little too skinny for me I think ginormous or balls and humongous

623
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,260
or boobs ginormous no we already said balls or

624
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:11,640
grenades oh fuck you're right exploders okay what animal then do you think

625
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,340
probably has the most delicious milk probably some cow and human is not

626
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:22,060
available by since when why cuz you banned me from drinking a dog's milk so I

627
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,820
can't make up nonsense rules now in fucking candyland go ahead and candy

628
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,780

630
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,840

631
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,320

Type in elephant, but have you seen double D Dumbo the female elephant with a huge pair of boobs

660
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:42,640
Wow, there's a lot in this is in the news I looked up kangaroo boobs, and I'm finding a lot of

661
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm finding a lot of pictures

662
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,160
Do this thing's got a lot of normos so a lot of drawings these people have made look at this look at this fucking elephant

663
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,720
I know dude. It's crazy. Yeah, thanks looking up nice ones those those those weird

664
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,000
I've heard bot like animal accounts that I follow on Instagram like post that picture

665
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,680
like once a month.

666
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,240
That elephant's got some nice cans.

667
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,080
I might be changing my mind on what animal has the best milk.

668
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,640
Yeah, the elephants go crazy.

669
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,040
You know what's huge for me is that there's only two of them.

670
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,760
Oh, I posted in the wrong channel.

671
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Yeah, everyone's gonna see.

672
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,080
I feel like the fewer nipples, like you're not like splitting the quality.

673
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,520
You know what I mean?

674
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
So here's my pitch though.

675
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:29,520
my

676
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,320
uh...

677
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,200
there were you see that you have a source kangaroo fetish images and

678
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,640
general channel so that the private recording what

679
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,560
uh... so what's the point of the like

680
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,600
if you want to like come on streamers something

681
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,040
and

682
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,840
they're gonna see it

683
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,800
it's the public select kangaroo report

684
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,640
if that's the deal breaker i don't want

685
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,280
that's exactly what is right here's my here's my milk pitch okay

686
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,160
i think that scientists

687
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
should be in the lab twenty four seven

688
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,440
i think that they for every non mammal animal every animal does not produce

689
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,840
milk they should be using like i don't know a gene therapy or like

690
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,440
d_n_a_ sequencing or some science shit

691
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,920
to create the milk that that animal would make and i think that they should

692
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,400
do it for every animal in the world that does not produce milk and i think you

693
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,700
should be able to go to a store called the milk store and you type in any animal

694
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,480
and it's like a coca-cola freestyle machine and you can mix them and as a

695
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,960
picture of the animal in a little circle that you press. I actually fully agree

696
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,160
there should be a there should be a milk freestyle machine. Yeah and it should be

697
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,400
that's up but every it so you can get snakes, worms, fishes. Snakes do make milk

698
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,400
it's just venom just poison. That's not milk. No. Venom is milk. No it's not.

699
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,640
This is one of, I'm not even gonna engage with you on this.

700
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Yeah, I'm sorry, but I can't.

701
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,920
The premise is honestly, uh, pathetic.

702
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,480
It's moronic, what you just said.

703
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,680
The venom being milk.

704
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,600
What about a picture of venom?

705
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,880
What about an angel fish?

706
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,360
Here, I'm gonna look up something right now.

707
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,040
Do you think that a rainforest frog has a coat of milk?

708
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Frog milk might actually be good.

709
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,360
The texture of that might be really interesting.

710
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
I feel like frog milk might have a kind of a lack of flair.

711
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
Oh, oh, what is this?

712
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Adventures of a snake milker.

713
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,360
They milk the venom. Milk is a verb.

714
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
You can milk things.

715
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Milk your cock.

716
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
What? You know, like this.

717
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,360
You know when you do it upside down one time for the one time?

718
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Yeah, you put it through the hole in the table.

719
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Milk my... And they squeeze it?

720
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
You don't get that done?

721
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
You don't remember on masseuse?

722
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,360
I never thought a chicken could make milk.

723
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
You are a devil.

724
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,640
a devil. See I waited, I told you wait 10 minutes. Yeah you're a monster for that. But

725
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:52,160
chicken milk could go hard. I think I mean I fuck with eggs in a heavy way. Instead of

726
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,680
Coca-Cola freestyle it's Milka Milka freestyle. I think that's a good idea because then you

727
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,720
can also add, you have your flavors also where you can do. Yeah so you can do like. I want

728
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,160
Strawberry milk, but I yeah, I want it to have I want a blueberry added to it. Yeah

729
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,520
I feel like it's a great idea

730
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,340
I think that could be really big you also I think you could synthesize just a general like you could

731
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,800
Synthesize like a syrup much like well, okay?

732
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,560
Yeah, let's also say that you accidentally in some kind of freak teleporter accident or something like you have some kind of animal

733
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,840
That's like. I don't know like half crocodile and half bear, and you're like. Oh, it's good. It's a baby

734
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,520
baby is going to die if it doesn't get its milk. There's no crocodile bear milk in the

735
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,760
world but thanks to the Milka Milka Freestyle Machine you go, you hold out your cup, you

736
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,120
press crocodile, hold it down for a little bit, then you press bear, hold it down, you

737
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,560
swirl it around and that mutant baby is going to love that milk and it's going to grow big

738
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,560
and strong and it might kill you. So don't actually.

739
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Another kind of life or death situation, say you're doing a Scorsese marathon and you say

740
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,880
"God damn I'm thirsty! God damn I'm thirsty for some milk!"

741
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,040
Pop on over, they're in Qdoba, you gotta go to the Qdoba next door,

742
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,720
hit the Milk and Milk a Freestyle machine, you say, "Hmm,

743
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,600
am I feeling more sparrow today, or am I feeling more

744
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,440
earthworm?" Are these replacing...

745
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,840
You. You are replaced by a Milk and Milk a Freestyle machine.

746
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,040
Are these replacing Coca-Cola Freestyle machines or do we still get both?

747
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,080
No, we can have both.

748
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,580
Okay.

749
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,080
See, I was just nervous that-

750
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

751
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,240
New idea, new idea.

752
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,480
It's a machine, it's giant, the size of like a building, right?

753
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,680
Every drink Freestyle machine.

754
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

755
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,360
Even better.

756
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,000
All the drinks.

757
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,640
Even better.

758
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,440
Listen.

759
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,560
Beer Freestyle machine.

760
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,360
Listen!

761
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,760
Listen.

762
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,800
A Freestyle machine, Freestyle machine.

763
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,520
Shut the fuck up.

764
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,600
A Freestyle machine, Freestyle machine.

765
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,520
You press any button to make any machine.

766
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,200
Hey, give me enough beer.

767
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:07,280
I become a freestyle machine that's right mm-hmm I might need to zone out on gun I

768
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,240
just came in a good freestyle thank you yeah I'm not that recently Pat

769
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,200
reignited my love of Drake and I'm thinking I'm becoming a kind of Drake

770
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,880
type guy yeah yeah I think cool I think Caleb you grow your hair out again or

771
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,680
maybe we just come over and I just draw a heart on your hairline with a sharpie

772
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,200
Well I need to do, I don't have any hair but I do need that little cut in that he has.

773
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
So maybe I'll just slice my scalp over right here.

774
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Yeah, you should just get like a heart scar.

775
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Some flesh just showing right there.

776
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,880
Oh, oh I can come over, I'll get like a brand and I'll brand a heart onto your forehead.

777
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
I need to be branded like yesterday.

778
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
That would actually be hard as fuck.

779
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
That'd be sick dude.

780
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
Like a heart brand on a bald guy's head?

781
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,880
You know what, I really want to get a subdermal implant.

782
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Yeah?

783
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880

put a donut in my head not like you seen like the donut forehead guys no in

785
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,080
Japan. Is it like Dr. Manhattan? No. There's a guy in my neighborhood who looks

786
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,760
like the devil he has horns and shit yeah and a full entire body's tattooed

787
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,800
and he has horns. Is he usually on your shoulder? Yeah and he's telling me

788
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,120

789
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,640
you should find all that see that dog you should milk that dog and drink it

790
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,600
yeah check check that out I feel like that'd be a good crime spree to go on it

791
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,840
is it wow this is crazy it looks more like a volcano yeah oh that's it I don't

792
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,760
know if that's reversible - yeah you take it back out they put it in the ticket oh

793
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,400
wait no that's that's gotta be like Botox or something actually that's

794
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,200
probably saline it says oh yeah see with the with the dermal implants they just

795
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Oh, it's temporary.

796
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,280
It's like a cake of rock, put it in your head.

797
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,720
It's a temporary 6-24 hour swelling distortion in the forehead created by staline dip shaped

798
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,600
to resemble a bagel or a donut.

799
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Why do that?

800
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
It looks awesome.

801
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,440
What are you talking about?

802
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,760

00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,480
You know what, I would, I would love to put my finger in there.

804
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,760
I would go to church with that and I would say I need forgiveness. I've made

805
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,840
a lot of mistakes and then the next day it would be gone and I would say that

806
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,000
God did you miracle yeah, I might try and shoot a nerf dart into it and see if

807
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,800

It is so fucking good.

830
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,280
He just walks up to the tube.

00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,160
It's like a big, like you know like the old ladies where they wear like the tube around

their nose?

833
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,160
He walks up to the box that the oxygen gets like recycled and whatever.

834
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Just fucking farts right into it.

835
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,440
And then you see her in the living room, she just goes like

836
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
*cough*

837
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
That's dangerous, what if she gets pregnant?

838
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
*laughing*

839
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Dude, it's so f*cking good

840
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
It's such a good thing

841
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,440
I don't find that funny, but I respect the elderly

842
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Oh, I hate the elderly, dude, I do not have a good relationship with my grandma

843
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Do you think if old

844
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
If an old granny

845
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Could still produce milk, that it would taste better than a young one?

846
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
No! Are you kidding me?

847
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
I think an old granny might have that fire

848
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,440
No

849
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,460
no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not wine dude. Yes, she could make it to she could

850
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,700
make some sick cheese. Oh,

851
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,300
granny cheese

852
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,700
right that was that was the step to

853
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,400
Jesus. Would you eat granny cheese?

854
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,700
I think I would

855
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,000
I don't want to I don't want to think about that. That's disgusting. Why not

856
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,060
you go to the you go to like Costco and they have a sample of just cheese and

857
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
"Oh, what's this?"

858
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:57,520
The old lady who makes the samples is like, "Oh, I made that myself in the back."

859
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,920
She has like a machine that she's cranking.

860
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,680
I don't like this idea.

861
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,720
Okay, so the dog stuff is fine, but this is too far.

862
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Dogs don't...

863
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I don't have a dog.

864
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
What about a granny dog?

865
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,080
I mean, like an older dog might have better milk is my point.

866
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
I feel like it's the experience, you know?

867
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,880
It's like, you remember in that fucking Adam Sandler movie,

868
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,480
he gets his dick sucked by the grandma real fucking awesomely?

869
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,380
That's Yes Man.

870
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,580
That's Yes Man, and it's actually Jim Carrey.

871
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,580
I remember that-

872
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
That was one of my first dates.

873
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,580
First date I ever went on.

874
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,280
You and the grandma?

875
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,280
You and that grandma, and she fucking took her dentures out and slopped on you.

876
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,180
And I was in the sixth grade, bro.

877
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,280
I got my dick sucked when I was 11.

878
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,780
That is so beast, dude.

879
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,180
Dude, it's so funny when people like brag about that,

880
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,180
like old men try to like say that shit on like Facebook pages where it's like

881
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,100

00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:21,020
Well, it's like it was from it was like I figure what page was from but it was like what's the most like like unique yet?

887
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:26,720
Beautiful name for a girl like that. You've that you've encountered or whatever and there's one comment

888
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,280
That was like at the grocery store. I met the most beautiful little girl named Declan

889
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:47,540
It's like naming like a girl baby Doug. I think Doug is a fine name for a girl. Yeah

890
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,020
Honestly, I'm turning around on it. I think that is a great name for a fish dog Doug

891
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:59,320
First name for a girl middle named Heffernan last name ever. Yeah, Doug Heffernan ever

892
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,760
That's right last name ever first name dog

Doug Heffron.

894
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:14,960
There was another one that was like, "I met this woman whose name is Lovelin, but she

895
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,920
goes by Love."

896
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
Pretty cool.

897
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Whoa.

898
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,960
Would you go by Love if your name was Lovelin?

899
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,160
I had an art teacher whose last name was Love.

900
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
Yeah?

901
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Yeah.

902
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,840

First name was Art.

904
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Damn.

905
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
Yep.

906
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
Last name was Ever.

907
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,920
Wait, look at-- Or no, it's Love.

908
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,400

00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,880

913
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,560
pretty sad already she'd

914
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,440
she had a bad life

915
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,160

916
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:04,240
He puts a squeaker like a really thick squeaker in there and then she

917
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,940
Starts vomiting on the couch

918
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,600
That's a really great video Pat

919
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,220
There's a young man abusing his grandmother

920
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,380
Doing doing full jackass

921
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,720
Fucking fart mask to his own. How is it? Okay. Okay

922
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,320
It's funny in Jackass when it happens to Phil in April, so shut up.

923
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,880
But this is- I don't know this woman.

924
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,320
Me neither! I do.

925
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,920
That's my grandma. Oh, wow.

926
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,680
I just feel like that is a little too sexual to do to your own grandma.

927
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,140
What do you mean? People pay good money to sniff farts.

928
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,120
It's true.

929
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,120
Yeah.

930
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
Like, I would feel like I...

931
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
I'm done with you.

932
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,080
I would feel like I hooked up with my grandmama.

933
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
I'm done with you, dude.

934
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,080
What?

935
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,300
Why are you done with me?

936
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,720
You hooked up with your grandma?

937
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,800
I'm saying that's what I would feel like.

938
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,440
Caleb just admitted to hooking up with his grandma.

939
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,440
I did.

940
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
You guys have met my grandparents.

941
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,080
I would never hook up with them.

942
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,480
He hooked up with his grandma.

943
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,320
I have ugly grandmas.

944
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
They're not gonna...

945
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
I'm not gonna hook up with them.

946
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,440
And you're bragging about hooking up with them?

947
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,240
I literally am explicitly saying that I didn't.

948
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,480
You did explicit things with them?

949
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
No!

950
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,840
That doesn't make...

951
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,840
You did an explicit with your grandma.

952
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,840
You did an explicit remix with your grandma.

953
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
I'm gonna...

954
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:37,120
You were like, "I'm grandpa tonight, and I'm remixing your guts, grandma."

955
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,640
I'm not gonna remix my grandma with a fart.

956
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,760
You did.

957
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
I didn't.

958
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
You did.

959
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
That doesn't mean you do.

960
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
No, actually...

961
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,760
You turned her into Sprite Remix.

962
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,760
You turned your grandma's guts into Sprite Remix.

963
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Yeah, you guys did that.

964
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Nope.

965
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,760
Yep.

966
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Caleb hooked up with his grandma.

967
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
I did not hook up with your grandma.

968
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,760
Nope.

969
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Well, I did.

970
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,760
But only after you did.

971
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,760
You hip-hop fucked your grandma.

972
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
No, my grandmas aren't alive.

973
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,760
Mm-hmm. That's the point.

974
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,760
That's even worse.

975
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,760

00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,600
These redcoats are...

1010
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
I'd be saying that, bruh, for real.

1011
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
These redcoats are mad cringe.

1012
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Yeah.

1013
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Mm-hmm.

1014
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Yeah.

1015
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,600
Absolutely.

1016
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
I've been saying that.

1017
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
The lobster bacchety of this bitch.

1018
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
[laughter]

1019
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
True.

1020
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,600
True, true, true.

1021
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,600
True, true.

1022
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Amen.

1023
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,880
And you know what else I hate?

1024
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,560
I hate these damn Vikings.

1025
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:22,440
Oh my god, don't, they fucking get in there and they start pillaging shit and it's like,

1026
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,760
are you done?

1027
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,320
Are you fucking done?

1028
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Really?

1029
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,280
It's like, what next are you gonna do?

1030
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,280
Oh, pillaging?

1031
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,280
Is this what we're doing now?

1032
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,120
I don't want to know what you're gonna do next.

1033
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,680
Okay, we're actually pillaging?

1034
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,400
I don't want to know what you did first in the two things that you're doing.

1035
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,680
Because seriously, we're still pillaging in 1600?

1036
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,680
We're still pillaging?

1037
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,440
It's so, I mean, honestly...

1038
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,760
Oh great, here comes Homo erectus.

1039
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:57,080
You think you're so cool because you walk more upright than Australopithecus, huh?

1040
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:04,480
Yeah, newsflash, Homo habilis already did that shit.

1041
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,720
(laughing)

1042
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,640
- Oh, he think he fancy 'cause he got two cells.

1043
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,500
Oh, he think he hot shit 'cause he got two cells.

1044
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,700
Okay.

1045
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,360
You think just 'cause I got one cell,

1046
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,440
you think I'm less than?

1047
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,160
- How are you reproducing?

1048
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,000
- Yeah, what are you doing?

1049
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,540
Watch this.

1050
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,020
I just did it.

1051
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,620
- Now there's two of me.

1052
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,820
What's up, what's up?

1053
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,820
Oh he on land now.

1054
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:40,820
Oh he think he too good for this hot ocean.

1055
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,820
Oh no this steaming ass ocean.

1056
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,820
He think he too good for it.

1057
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,820
He want that land now.

1058
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,820
Oh ok.

1059
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,820
Oh he's an animal.

1060
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,820
Oh photosynthesis too good for you.

1061
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,820
Oh he think he too good for us now.

1062
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,820
Oh he got reasoning now.

1063
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
Oh ok.

1064
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,340
Oh, he reasoning. Yeah. All right. Oh, he's self-aware. Oh, yeah, that's

1065
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,900
Sapien sapiens

1066
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:19,180
Don't ever forget where you came from though. Mm-hmm. That's a boiling hot ocean. Yep

1067
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,580
One cell that's me. I'm still in the trenches. Okay, I came here on a meteor. Oh

1068
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:30,740
He may eat thinking he from God now you ain't from the meteor, right

1069
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:41,740
Yes sir. You ain't from the Corno Meteor. Yeah but pretty much that's what it was like.

1070
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:48,540
It was basically, if Twitter existed throughout history, check for our book coming out on

1071
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:53,660
Amazon. How about this, the bad dad's guide to if

1072
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,380
Twitter existed throughout history. What about that? That might be good.

1073
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,460
I can't wait. I mean we have some really good cover designs that are going to come out.

1074
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:12,060
It's a picture of me, Caleb and Cam, and we're all doing like a snarky but knowing smirk.

1075
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,140
Yeah, it's going to be pretty awesome.

1076
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,780
There's going to be a lot of raised eyebrows on the cover.

1077
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,820
Definitely, and a lot of raised eyebrows at our chapter about Chinese history.

1078
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,460
A lot of ruffled feathers.

1079
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,140
Yeah, we don't know, we don't speak Chinese. We don't take prisoners.

1080
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,060
No. And we said some things that got people very upset.

1081
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:40,780
I would like to get a, like, I would like for the podcast to get banned in a country.

1082
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,300
Yeah, that would be pretty sick. Wouldn't that be great? Get banned,

1083
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,900
didn't Odd Future get banned in like Australia? I think it's pretty easy to get banned from

1084
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,780
Australia. I feel like we could do it. We should just like try actively to get banned from Australia.

1085
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,660
I can't get banned from Australia. Why? I have to see you spider.

1086
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,220
My girlfriend's family in Australia.

1087
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,820
Well that's literally the perfect situation.

1088
00:54:58,820 --> 00:54:59,820
No.

1089
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,660
Oh sorry I can't go hang out with the in-laws.

1090
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,660
I'm banned.

1091
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,660
They're an Australian.

1092
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,660
Oh, I thought you were just saying.

1093
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,660
That's an excuse for not going to Thanksgiving.

1094
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,540
Sorry, I think I'm actually banned from your parents' house.

1095
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,900
You're banned from your country.

1096
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,900
Yeah.

1097
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,460
I think I'm banned from that county in North Carolina.

1098
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,020
I have to spend Christmas with my own family this year.

1099
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,020
Yeah, sorry.

1100
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,620
I feel like that's a pretty good excuse actually.

1101
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:28,580
actually be great. Could be big for me. Yeah, what, Australia's the easiest one, right?

1102
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:34,180
Yeah. What? Yeah. It might be too easy. I think, do people get banned from the Vatican? We should

1103
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,900
get banned from America. Yeah. That would be sick. That would be pretty cool. I would love,

1104
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,700
can we get banned from everywhere and just be on the run? Can we get banned from Earth?

1105
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,940
I mean, we'd have to probably do like a humongous terrorist attack. We could try and extinct

1106
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:52,420
humanity I mean I've been saying for a while that it I could I might just become

1107
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:58,340
a super villain yeah yeah I think you know like I think that cuz like I they're

1108
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,940
not gonna stop you if you just say like I'm gonna destroy the whole world right

1109
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,340
yeah like that's pretty that's too general like they don't think that's

1110
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:12,580
realistic but like I'm I'm like actually about it like I'm like creating weapons

1111
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,900
on this destruction to destroy the entire world with a single party - yeah

1112
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:22,260
I'd be down to like form a league with you. I mean I would I guess we could get like a big table and we could all

1113
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,180
Sit around it. Oh, I'm see I don't know about spire could be good

1114
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:32,020
Yeah, I don't care about the evil doing I care more about just like having a place to cheer like a tower to chill in

1115
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,600
Well, I mean, you're not gonna be in the tower unless you like, you know

1116
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,340
Well, I'm gonna do some stuff but it's gonna be you know, it's gonna be like minor evils

1117
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:44,900
Okay, so you can be like a sidekick. Yeah, you can be you can be a I'm not gonna be a side

1118
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,900
You could be called Boy Evil.

1119
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,900
Actually, I like...

1120
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,900
You could become a minion.

1121
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,900
Well, how about... how about Doctor Evil?

1122
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,900
You would love to dress up like a minion.

1123
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,900
No, Doctor Evil's a...

1124
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,900
Well, no, what if we have Doctor Evil there?

1125
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,900
A high-rolling name.

1126
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,900
What if we have Doctor Evil there?

1127
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,900
Yeah, you could be Mini-Me.

1128
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,900
Mini-Me would be a good fit for you.

1129
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,900
Yeah, plus you're really small.

1130
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,900
No, I'm not.

1131
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,900
Yeah, you are.

1132
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
What about, like, Patrick Evil?

1133
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,900
No.

1134
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,900
No.

1135
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,900
Evil Patrick.

1136
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,900
Maybe, like, Boy Patrick Evil.

1137
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,260
How about Little Patrick?

1138
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,780
How about Child Evil?

1139
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,780
*laughter*

1140
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,100
How about Little Patrick?

1141
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,940
Yeah, it's not evil enough of a name for a super villain.

1142
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,300
Okay, Lil' Patrick.

1143
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,300
*clears throat*

1144
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,660
No, you're a henchman by the way, you're not a super villain.

1145
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,660
I'm not a henchman.

1146
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,900
You literally just said that you couldn't do the big evils and you would just do little evils,

1147
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,900
which is like what the whole henchman job is.

1148
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,020
Okay, then I'll do, okay, I'll do the biggest evil thing ever.

1149
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,020
What?

1150
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:43,860
I'll, I don't know, fuckin', I'll like, shut down, I'll put like a, a bike in the middle of an intersection.

1151
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,460
You're a henchman. Henchman material. I mean there's nothing wrong with that.

1152
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,460
If even a henchman, by the way, at that.

1153
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
I put a banana in the tailpipe.

1154
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,460
Maybe a grunt. You could be a good grunt.

1155
00:57:53,460 --> 00:58:01,460
Banana in the tailpipe of a van carrying a life-saving organ to a father.

1156
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,460
That could be interesting.

1157
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,460
I mean I like...

1158
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,460
If maybe the father was like an important person in the world.

1159
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,460
Yeah, the father would be like Gandhi.

1160
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,460
You know who the father is?

1161
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,460
Who? Andrew Cuomo.

1162
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,940
Why does he have to be a father at that point? Like he needs to be the father of somebody very good

1163
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,100
Okay

1164
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,420
Stevie Wonder

1165
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:30,160
It's a van carrying his eye new eyes that are gonna let him see for the first time but that like ruins his his art

1166
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,560
which

1167
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,560
Well, I guess that is evil. No, no, you know what it is. Go. It's a van

1168
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:41,140
Driving the van to bring the ice to him to force him to see

1169
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,140
Yeah, yeah true legacy. Okay. Well, actually their eyes

1170
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:52,000
That make him even blinder. I would probably launch him into space and just watch him disintegrate

1171
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,820
Yeah, that's a right idea

1172
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,140
And I might I might even do that accidentally just as as

1173
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,700
You know a casualty to doing that to a hundred thousand other people at the same time

1174
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:09,780
Yeah, I don't even not even notice that I think Stevie Wonder was in there. That's actually isn't it weird that there's only like two

1175
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,700
blind

1176
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,700
Guys and they both play the piano

1177
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:18,720
Hmm ever think about that Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles I

1178
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:25,340
Don't you think I could think of I can think of five blind guys. Oh, yeah. No wait. Yo wait wait

1179
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:32,300
I forgot dude you forgot the throat. Yeah the three-line roadhouse who plays okay? Yeah, so sick. There's six blind musicians

1180
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,460
There's the three blind whites

1181
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,540
Stevie Wonder the guy from right now. They're not musicians. They're athletes. They run. What are you talking about?

1182
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,860
The three blind knights?

1183
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,860
See how they run, see how they run.

1184
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,860
They sing the song.

1185
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,860
They sing in Shrek.

1186
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,860
That's in Shrek.

1187
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,860
That's a fictionalized version.

1188
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,860
Okay.

1189
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,100
Come on now, come on.

1190
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,980
You know that's them.

1191
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,540
You think Shrek really lives in a swamp in real life?

1192
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,540
He lives in a fucking-

1193
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,540
No.

1194
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,540
He lives-

1195
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,540
He lives in a fucking mansion, dude.

1196
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,540
He lives in Beverly Hills.

1197
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,540
Yeah, yeah, far far away.

1198
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,260
So give me your theory.

1199
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,940
Why do you think that there's two blind black guys who play the piano and that's it?

1200
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,320
Why do you think that?

1201
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,520
What is the cause of this?

1202
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:15,440
No, I was just saying, I forgot about the blind guy from Roadhouse.

1203
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,800
I didn't even see their race.

1204
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,640
You didn't notice that Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder are both blind black guys?

1205
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,920
No, I thought they were both blind guys, but I was blind before.

1206
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,920
So Pat sees disability first.

1207
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,920
Pat sees disability first.

1208
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,920
A very...

1209
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,320
He exclusively sees disability.

1210
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,520
That's the only thing I see.

1211
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,520
That's actually really brave.

1212
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,280
And they can't see it, so...

1213
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
I was waiting on that.

1214
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:52,280
*Screaming*

1215
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,280
*screams*
