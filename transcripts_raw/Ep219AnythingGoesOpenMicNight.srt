1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Wow. He doesn't want to tell the story.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, why don't you just tell it. Tell the story.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You've told the most inconsequential stories of all time.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've heard you tell stories about candy that you bought like a week ago.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, but that's like good.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That shit does taste good.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah. Tell the story though.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, so I was out buying my new gloves.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Looking good.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They look good. I'm liking them.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,160
I was out buying my new gloves. I was in a store and a guy was following me around

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,720
The whole time I was in there

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,100
Because he I don't know he thought I was gonna steal or something. He kept blocking my way

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,200
Like I would like go I'd walk around I was like should I buy makeup? No

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
No, I think I have some at the office. You're saying this to yourself out loud in my head

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,300
Yeah, out loud in your head out loud in my head

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,520
Uh-huh

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
and then the guy keeps blocking my path and stuff and then I was like, oh, yeah

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,960
I just need to get by real quick and he went white people.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,800
- It's true.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,020
I would say, anything you did in that outfit,

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,900
I would say that.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,620
I wasn't, you were in this outfit.

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,460
- And I'd love-- - It's not an outfit,

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,460
this is just my clothes.

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,840
- And I'd love to hear what you said back to this guy,

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,340
'cause I'm sure it was very interesting.

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,000
But it looks like the open mic is starting actually.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,840
- Oh shit, oh my God, it's starting.

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,420
- You made me tell the fucking story.

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,260
- Yeah, oh there it is.

32
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,600
- Bud's Anything Goes open mic starting.

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,120
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, all right, let's go.

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,720
- All right, Cameron, I think you're up first.

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,560
- All right, shit, okay, here you go.

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Here you go, come on.

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Cameron, everybody!

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:46,560
Woo! Go Cameron!

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Alright.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
- Yeah!

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,240
- Okay.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,460
Okay, hey, good evening everybody.

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,560
- Woo!

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,780
- How's it going tonight?

45
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,780
Wow, big audience we got here.

46
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,000
How you doing, buddy?

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,480
- Hey, how's it going?

48
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,740
Where are you from?

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,900
- You turned your mic off.

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,820
- Hey, where are you from, pal?

51
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,160
Hey, where are you from?

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,860
Where'd you fly in from?

53
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,200
- Round here.

54
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,040
- Round here?

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,880
Oh, that's nice.

56
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,620
How was your Thanksgiving, by the way?

57
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,760
Good. You have a big, good, strong plate. Hardy, lots of vegetables.

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,420
Did you have a weak ass plate?

59
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:35,760
Okay, hey, hey, fuck this guy. All right, this, this audience, man. What are you gonna, I mean,

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,860
guy sitting here with a weak ass plate, back row of the audience. All right, let's get

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,300
to show on the road though, alright?

62
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,140
So,

63
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,580
I bring my wife coffee in bed.

64
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,940
Is she grateful?

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,780
No.

66
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,600
- Woo!

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,540
- She tells me she likes it in a cup.

68
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,380
- Ah!

69
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,120
(clapping)

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,220
- You know you're in a stoner's house

71
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,580
when there's Pringles in the bathroom.

72
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,180
- Oh shit!

73
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,020
- Anybody know?

74
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,140
- Oh shit!

75
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,460
- Anybody know that feeling?

76
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,700
- 'Cause they poop in the can.

77
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:17,700
So, I read about this CVS cashier who wrote some racist on a receipt and gave it to a customer.

78
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,200
Shocking.

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,700
Someone found a working cashier at CVS?

80
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
Damn!

81
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
It's mostly electronic.

82
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Wait, I got, hold on, can I say something?

83
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
What, what's up?

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,700
Um, damn, someone actually read that CVS receipt?

85
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Those things are mad long.

86
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,700
It's like a scroll.

87
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,700
It's like a fucking scroll.

88
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,700
You could add that to your material.

89
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
It's like a goddamn motherfucking scroll.

90
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,220
Um, you know you could say if you're gonna do that you could also be like and the cashiers are like wizards

91
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,820
The cat and the cashiers are like wizards. Yeah, they wrote something racist. What are they a wizard of the cook?

92
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:56,800
Yeah, you guys know about the I don't know anything about these from these are I wrote them

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,180
Okay, all I wrote every last one of these god bless you not even Bruce's as bossy as my girlfriend

94
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,940
Said not even Bruce's as bossy as my girl. Yeah. No, I heard who's Bruce Bruce

95
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,140
The fuck's going on not even Bruce's as bossy as my girlfriend. Hey, buddy. You're drinking some soda

96
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,980
Okay

97
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,980
You can drink soda

98
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,100
Soda if you're in the crowd just found out you can infuse weed with cotton candy

99
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,740
The county fairs around my home are gonna get real interesting

100
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,960
Excerpts from my mind. I will buy all the laffy taffy

101
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,820
Listen Becky, I don't care how much it costs. I'm bringing that tilt-a-whirl home and

102
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,860
Have you ever seen two Buffy's bunny so fluffies? Can we feed him some of this here cotton candy?

103
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,740
Did you say weed infused with cotton candy? Yep, that's what they're doing now that I just found out

104
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,620
So I just found out you can infuse weed with cotton candy

105
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:05,060
And those were excerpts from my mind, okay kind of leaning into Doug Benson territory a little stoner stuff

106
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,700
I'm a little bit of a stoner fan.

107
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Okay, alright, alright, let's do something a little different.

108
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,060
Something a little different.

109
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,580
Something a little more intellectual.

110
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,220
Go ahead.

111
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,900
I often question whether or not God exists.

112
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,340
And just when I decide no, the singer of Nickelback gets a cyst on his throat and they cancel

113
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,460
their world tour.

114
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,020
Holy crap.

115
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,300
Touché, God.

116
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,180
Touché.

117
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,980
Wow.

118
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,700
That's, yeah, I mean, that's true.

119
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,420
It's not even funny.

120
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,020
It's more like a true kind of fact.

121
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,300
That's just kind of sad.

122
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,620
Yeah.

123
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,260
Because it could be a tumor or cancerous is

124
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,660
insists have cancer all right quiet and back okay, I

125
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,540
Remember when I used to keep a glamour shot of my girlfriend in my wallet now. I have 213 pictures of naked girls

126
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,540
I know on my phone

127
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,900
I

128
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,060
Remember when I used to keep a glamour shot of my girlfriend in my wallet now

129
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,860
I have 213 pictures of naked girls. I know on my phone. Yeah, that's

130
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,340
- Yeah, that'd be a different--

131
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,540
- This generation, man.

132
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,380
- Yeah.

133
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,780
- This generation, man.

134
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,260
Sony's releasing the PlayStation 5 next week.

135
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,700
If they really wanted to make a splash,

136
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,940
it should include a game called Recount.

137
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,000
You win by becoming president while still losing

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,760
the popular and electoral votes.

139
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,780
- Damn!

140
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,300
- Wait, why would they do that?

141
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,220
I missed it.

142
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,740
- If they wanted to make a splash.

143
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,580
- Oh.

144
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,820
(laughing)

145
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,100
All right, man, yeah.

146
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,420
- The other day, my wife asked me to bring her

147
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,460
a glass of water and said--

148
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,300
- Fuck her!

149
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,860
says she said make sure the glass is as clean as a whistle.

150
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,700
- Cut!

151
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,540
- She should have asked for a whistle.

152
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,980
- So, before I poured the drink,

153
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,420
you better believe I made sure there was nothing in that cup

154
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,740
but a ton of spit and a little bit of pee.

155
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
- Oh my God.

156
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,860
- Yeah, serves her right.

157
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,700
- That's right.

158
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,940
- Wait, they get their glasses clean as a whistle?

159
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,460
- How are you doing, buddy?

160
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,700
- Good.

161
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,540
- Hungry?

162
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,460
Eat anything before this?

163
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,580
Combo over rice.

164
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,580
Alright, well fuck you man.

165
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,580
If I can't get something for nothing, can I at least enjoy my nothing before you tell me I need something I don't have?

166
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,580
How I feel about ads.

167
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,740
Damn, that's true.

168
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,860
Advertisements.

169
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,140
That was fucking true.

170
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,500
That's so true.

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,020
If life was like a video game, I'm pretty sure I'd be stuck in single player.

172
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,460
It's not that I haven't heard great things about the multiplayer experience.

173
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,300
Still, I find it overrated and outdated, what with all that extra tacked on, priceless DLC shit.

174
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah.

175
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah.

176
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,540
That's by dating, Danny.

177
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,620
That's the one I didn't write.

178
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,940
In the class I tutor, the teacher asked the students what they thought the most dangerous

179
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,740
game was about. I'm glad she didn't ask me, because all I could think about was tweezing my eyebrows.

180
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,540
Damn, that must be Greek as hell.

181
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,660
Tweezing my eyebrows.

182
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:15,660
I'm living in South Korea right now and it's a pretty interesting culture.

183
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:22,660
For example, there is no stigma surrounding cross-dressing, so it's not uncommon to see a man with a blouse or a lady with a penis.

184
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,900
(laughing)

185
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,740
- Is that right?

186
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,560
- That's the punchline.

187
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,740
- Oh my God, wow, that's--

188
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,580
- That's crazy.

189
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,620
- My game is like Monopoi, you ain't gonna finish.

190
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,580
- What's Monopoi?

191
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,420
- Monopoi.

192
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,780
My game is like Monopoi.

193
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,740
- But what is it?

194
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,500
- You ain't gonna finish.

195
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,120
- All right, move on.

196
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,140
- That would be funny if a lady named Wendy McDonald

197
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,300
opened a Burger King.

198
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,540
(laughing)

199
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,140
That one I like. I like that one.

200
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,640
That one's funny.

201
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I do like that one a lot.

202
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
That one is honestly pretty funny.

203
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
That one is really...

204
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,140
Alright, let's keep it moving, folks.

205
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
My girlfriend says she doesn't like jewelry.

206
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
She's a keeper.

207
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,140
Fucking hate jewelry.

208
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
Yeah, keeper in the fucking...

209
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
Fucking jewelry.

210
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Fucking hate jewelry, dude.

211
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,640
Keeper in the bathroom.

212
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Thanks to Dr. Oz, everybody you talk to is a food expert.

213
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
They're more like food parrots.

214
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Brrrap! Kale, kale!

215
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Brrrap! Carbs, carbs!

216
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Brrrap! Put down the fork, fatty!

217
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,140
food parrots.

218
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,140
(laughter)

219
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,140
Okay.

220
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,140
My girlfriend and I just broke up.

221
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
Aww.

222
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,140
An entire ounce of weed by hand and rolled it into one giant joint that represents our love.

223
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
(laughter)

224
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
We're very happy.

225
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
And hungry.

226
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
And sleepy.

227
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Some people call a guitar an axe.

228
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,400
But it doesn't mean the same thing when you say I'm killing with my guitar

229
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,820
I'm killing with my guitar. Oh, yeah, okay

230
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,600
Yeah, I guess I want to eventually merge with computers and become a computer-human hybrid

231
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,520
So for me switching to eating organic food would be a step in the wrong direction I

232
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,700
I will smile for photos when you offer me actual cheese.

233
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,380
Until then, I will continue the long family tradition of looking miserable in photos.

234
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,340
Also, I will appear in black and white and wear a hair bun.

235
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,960
What?

236
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,700
In photos I'll be black and white in a hair bun.

237
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
Unless I have cheese.

238
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,780
[Laughter]

239
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,060
Who wrote that one?

240
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,980
DHL, zero.

241
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,880
Okay. Is there a picture of him?

242
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
It's black and white.

243
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Oh, man.

244
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,980
Okay. Does he have a hair bun?

245
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,680
No, he has very little hair.

246
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Oh, okay.

247
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,880
Ladies, you think a man should have to go back to having flip phones?

248
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,880
A good morning, beautiful how are you would take him hitting the key 64 times instead of 30.

249
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,980
That's double the effort.

250
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,380
Don't you think if he doubles the effort, you should double the fun?

251
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm talking threesomes, ladies.

252
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Heard that.

253
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm talking threesomes.

254
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,880
I heard that.

255
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,360
Threesomes I had a I had a threesome with my girlfriend last night me and my dad really showed her

256
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:26,980
Wait, I had a threesome with my girlfriend last night me and my dad really showed her showed her we showed her

257
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,640
Dad really showed my girlfriend last

258
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,960
Threesome is like yeah, I'll teach you to fucking fuck one guy instead of two we showed her or two guys

259
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,440
We showed her what's what I ever have a threesome, buddy

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:48,960
Alright. Hey, fuck you pal. Okay, great. Killin' the energy. That's a chassis, yes. I just got

261
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,920
a part-time job, which allows for my full-time job as well. But, being a part-time ice cream

262
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,640
scooper actually really meshes well with my full-time position as a stoner. Damn. You

263
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:06,400
don't look like a stoner. I'm a stoner. You look like Scatman John. Or like Weedman Pot.

264
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's try a little bit of scatting up there.

265
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
(scatting)

266
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
That's terrible.

267
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
That sounds nothing like scatting.

268
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah, more of a dorm.

269
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
It doesn't sound like scatman John at all.

270
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Man, I like this stage presence you got with your dorm up there.

271
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
You look fucking badass.

272
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
You look like Andy Kaufman.

273
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
My girlfriend is one of those no sex

274
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
before marriage girls,

275
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
which is an odd thought.

276
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
That means she hasn't had sex ever.

277
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Tell you what.

278
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,400
She sounds like an odd thought if you ask me.

279
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,400
And if she dies before she gets married, well I guess she has to have sex with Osama Bin Laden.

280
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
No idea what the... what are you talking about?

281
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Cam, you look like Perry can't eat Jell-O.

282
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Cause of stomach problems.

283
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Stomach problems?

284
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Cause he has stomach problems.

285
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Perry, okay, I get...

286
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Hey buddy, the only stomach problem I have is I'm like, "Oh, I need a slice of pizza, man!"

287
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Cause I'm a fucking stoner as shit.

288
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:09,400
is shit. That one was, I made that one up. Damn. Damn. You can do improv too. Man up on

289
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,400
the spot. Alright. Okay. Okay guys. Okay. Let's bring it down a notch here. I used to

290
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,400
sit around at school and suck on sunflower seeds. Weird. So I was pretty disappointed

291
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,400
when somebody else got voted most likely to suck seed. Oh that's good. Okay. To suck seed.

292
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,840
Yeah no I got that part. Yeah the school slut probably got voted most likely to suck seed.

293
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
And what was her name?

294
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Sluttington.

295
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Slut-et.

296
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Her name was Slud.

297
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Nothing better than scrolling through your Facebook news feed judging people from high

298
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
school.

299
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Heard that.

300
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Yep.

301
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Is there another part of the joke?

302
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
No, that's the joke.

303
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
That's by I Love Chunk.

304
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Alright, I got one more for you guys.

305
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Alright, alright.

306
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,040
I got one more for you guys.

307
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,360
So I killed a kitten one time.

308
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,640
Oh, fuck you.

309
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,080
I was walking to my car in the parking lot right after my high school let out

310
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,560
and there were these two girls searching for a kitten that had run up under their car.

311
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,580
So me and a few more people came over to help look because the two girls were hot.

312
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,960
And we looked and looked under the car for ten, fifteen minutes and we couldn't find the cat.

313
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,040
So I, in my infinite wisdom, said, "Ah, he probably ran off while we weren't looking."

314
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,800
And everyone agreed with me. So the girls got back in the car and all the people that were looking left.

315
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,520
And since I was parked right next to them,

316
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,320
I was the only one around to watch that little black and gray kitten fall from where it had tucked

317
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,380
itself in above the tire right in front of the back wheel.

318
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,680
I still remember the crunch as the tire crushed its little ribs and I still remember the look

319
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,200
of raw fear in its face and in its pale blue eyes as it tried to get up and run for just

320
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
a second before it collapsed with a shudder and lay still.

321
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,880
What?

322
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Oh, that's my time everybody.

323
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,160
Thank you so much for having me at this open mic.

324
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
It's been fun.

325
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Cameron Fetter.

326
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Wow.

327
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,420
(applause)

328
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,000
- Keep going for Cam, everybody.

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,760
Wow.

330
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,960
That really was something.

331
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
- Yeah.

332
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,200
- Yeah, that was a, so wait, you said that you wrote

333
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,520
all those jokes.

334
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,360
- Yep.

335
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,200
- Those are all jokes that we wrote.

336
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,640
- I wrote every last one of them.

337
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,220
- All right, here, you can have the cans back.

338
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,060
- Oh, yes.

339
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,900
- Yeah.

340
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,780
- I know that's the thing you like to do a lot,

341
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,320
is listen to the show.

342
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,160
- Yeah.

343
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,800
What was it, so I didn't realize you were such a big stoner.

344
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,280
kind of came out of left field. I didn't know he was a big pothead, I guess.

345
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,440
Yeah, I'm... Look at his hair.

346
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,800
Yeah, well, that's a good point.

347
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,920
I'm kind of, yeah, I... Something...

348
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,180
Something changed.

349
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,520
Okay, probably smoked weed.

350
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,400
Probably, yeah, it was mostly, basically, I think that

351
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,920
once I smoked weed I realized that it makes you high as fuck.

352
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,720
Really? And I let that kind of influence my comedy, which usually...

353
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,320
I try to do more girlfriend, wife, ex-girlfriend, dead kitten material,

354
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,720
but I found that adding a little bit of spice

355
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,680
with weed in video games actually helps round out your set.

356
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,360
And even people in the audience who are more concerned

357
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,520
with soda or things like that

358
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,880
can really find common ground with you.

359
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
- I think that the people in the crowd,

360
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,720
if they don't laugh, I think there should be a penalty.

361
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,560
- I think they should--

362
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,400
- Or if they don't pay attention,

363
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,200
I think we should have a taser.

364
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Yeah, if you don't laugh or interact in a crowd--

365
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,240
I agree. Speaking of, I think it's my turn to go up.

366
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,960
Oh, let's go. Yeah. Hey, Caleb Pitts, everybody.

367
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Woo!

368
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:35,680
Thank you.

369
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,720
Oh, you just turned the mic off again.

370
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,880
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

371
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Woo!

372
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,400
First time up here, I'm a little bit nervous.

373
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,320
Pardon me.

374
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,600
It's all good, man. Just relax up there.

375
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,000
OK.

376
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
You're going to be a natural.

377
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,280
I'm kind of freaking out a little bit.

378
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Just relax.

379
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,640
All right, I'm going to calm down just a little bit.

380
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,400
So I tried my hand at writing a script for an open mic event, so I want to know your guys'

381
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,720
thoughts on this, okay?

382
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,960
All right.

383
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
Hi everybody.

384
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Oof.

385
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,160
Well, that's great.

386
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,200
I spent two weeks preparing for this and as soon as I get on stage, my mind just goes

387
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,320
blank.

388
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Like my anxiety wasn't bad enough.

389
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
It's okay though.

390
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
I got a strong rope at home.

391
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
What?

392
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I'm gonna kill myself, sir.

393
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,320
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

394
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,320
This isn't my first time on stage.

395
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I did a couple open mics in my hometown of Syracuse.

396
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
You're from Syracuse?

397
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Yes, sir.

398
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
But of course they flopped. Naturally.

399
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
This is me we're talking about.

400
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,320
But I was also in a really weird place and I did a bit on how I was starting a cult.

401
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
It's a long story.

402
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Plus the FBI doesn't like me talking about it.

403
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Fuck it. I'm going to elaborate.

404
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,820
Don't.

405
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
That would help me appear less insane.

406
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
You're gonna get in trouble with the FBI.

407
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,320
I just come off as a crackhead to some people because I'm schizoaffective and autistic.

408
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,820
That's kinda like your car having a flat tire while your engine's on fire.

409
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,320
Even if you fix one, the damn thing still ain't going nowhere.

410
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
That's what my brain is, just one big lemon.

411
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
A lemon?

412
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Got a lemon for a fucking brain.

413
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Like a bad car.

414
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
That's how schizoaffective I am.

415
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,820
You should say jalopy.

416
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,660
Anyways, I was once in a cult.

417
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,540
It was fun, in a weird masochistic way.

418
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,260
I was virtually a slave,

419
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,520
and not the kinky kind that I prefer.

420
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,300
Prefer a sex slave.

421
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,540
No, I got pushed so hard that I became psychotic.

422
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,540
I thought that the birds were mocking me.

423
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,780
They would say things like, "Caw, caw,"

424
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,820
and "Cock-a-doodle-doo,"

425
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,740
but I mean, but I knew what they really meant.

426
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,020
I have never met such mean avians,

427
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,620
And I've crossed paths with quite a few geese in my day.

428
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,820
You're like a silly goose up there.

429
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,620
Yeah.

430
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,740
Making me laugh.

431
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
But I eventually escaped the cult.

432
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
That's how I got this scar.

433
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,020
Can we see the scar?

434
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
It's invisible.

435
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,780
It's directly on my face.

436
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,260
That should have meant that things improved for me, right?

437
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,260
Pro tip.

438
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,420
This one's for you, sir.

439
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,860
Here's a pro tip for you.

440
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,460
Do not take four tabs of acid in the wake of being horrifically traumatized by a cult.

441
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,740
Not only did it turn me into a woman, but I got it in my head that aliens wanted me to be the messiah.

442
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,140
That's a pro tip for you.

443
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:33,020
Thus, I spent three years homeless trying to start the most insane cult imaginable.

444
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,980
Truth be told, I actually thought I was going to get famous for being the craziest motherfucker in

445
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,300
existence. So I deliberately said the most deranged shit I could come up with for an

446
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,380
example of one of the milder things I did. One time I started going up to people on the

447
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,820
streets and asked them, "What's your opinion of ethical incest?" Some people got a kick

448
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,580
out of it, but eventually three cop cars whooped up on me and put a stop to it. They were not

449
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,980
happy with me, I'll tell you what, as you can probably imagine.

450
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Yeah, man.

451
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Damn coppers. I've literally been run out of Eugene, Oregon for stunts like that.

452
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,220
(laughter)

453
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,800
- But that's still not what got the FBI involved.

454
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,420
See, in my infinite wisdom,

455
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,120
I began trolling in character on Reddit.

456
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,300
I started getting maybe one or 200 messages every day

457
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,320
just saying some variant of, "WTF did I just read?"

458
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
But there were people who enjoyed my content,

459
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,540
thought it was funny, so, you know, really stand up people.

460
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,600
One guy was into scalping people,

461
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,620
and he was one of the tamer ones.

462
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,080
So I'm joking about starting

463
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:39,160
most messed up cult imaginable and a real cult starts forming. Go me. There was talk

464
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,120
about pooling our resources, buying land, moving everybody in, and taking over a

465
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,760
local government. It was that serious. I started getting cold feet but

466
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,480
fortunately I was saved by the wonderful men and women and other gendered agents

467
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,000
in the FBI who vanned me while I was riding in the park and brought me to the

468
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,840
hospital where I stayed a month. They shut down the cult too which I guess is

469
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,320
a good thing. So that's the sort of how I got on a list of two. Well, a part of it

470
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,920
anyways. I was only given a few minutes to regale you with my tale, but I'm

471
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,240
writing a book to tell my whole life story. The aliens tell me it will make me

472
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,080
famous. Or maybe not. I've been wrong before, but at least things won't be

473
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,720
boring. Have a good night everyone, and may you never ever follow my example.

474
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,840
Whoa. Wow. So that's it for me. By the way guys, another thing that this guy said is

475
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,640
he's writing a 65,000 page book about his life.

476
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
I found another post.

477
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,440
But that's it, I've been Caleb Pitts.

478
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,280
- Wow, thank you so much, guys.

479
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,040
- Keep it going for Caleb Pitts, everybody.

480
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,880
- I'll be back up here in a little bit.

481
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,920
- Let's have the audience cheering and clapping here.

482
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,640
- Why don't you do fucking something, man?

483
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,080
Do something. - Cheer, yo.

484
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,520
(cheering)

485
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,320
- This guy's all right.

486
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,720
- Okay, I'm liking that guy.

487
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,080
- Okay, he's good now. - Wow.

488
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,440
What a set.

489
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,280
That was, honestly--

490
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,160
- God, it feels good to crush, man.

491
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,980
- Yeah, it was honestly, what I liked about it

492
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,400
is it was somewhere between funny and memoiric.

493
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,240
- Yeah. - Yeah.

494
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,720
- Memoirical. - It's this kind of

495
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
identity comedy that is doing so well nowadays

496
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,520
that people just love.

497
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,640
- Like I said, that guy is, I did find another post

498
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,040
where he said he's writing a 65,000 page book

499
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,840
about his awesome life.

500
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,680
So I'm looking forward to it. - I would love to read it.

501
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,840
- I would read it. - 65,000.

502
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,680
- I'd read that.

503
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,360
- There's something about the phrase infinite wisdom

504
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,000
that these type of people really like.

505
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
- Oh yeah.

506
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Yeah.

507
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,760
All right, well, I think-- who's up next?

508
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,260
Yeah, wait.

509
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,360
Who's up next on the list?

510
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,000
Who's up next on the open mic?

511
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,040
Who drew their name out of the hat?

512
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm up next.

513
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,480
Oh, my god.

514
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, for real?

515
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,500
Yeah.

516
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,080
And so the past--

517
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,200
Do your stand up.

518
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,880
Well, I believe that this was a poetry open mic.

519
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,040
It's literally called FUDZ, Anything Goes Open Mic.

520
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,680
Oh, OK.

521
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,420
OK, you're right.

522
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,360
Oh, so anything goes?

523
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,760
Yeah, go do your thing.

524
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,360
Then, hey, why don't I just go?

525
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,320
Don't feel self-conscious.

526
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,720
Just get up there.

527
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,080
Just go, yeah.

528
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
All right, woo!

529
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,560
Woo!

530
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,280
Patrick Aradorin!

531
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
- Go get 'em!

532
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,280
- So this is a poem about my love.

533
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Well, on February 28th, you asked me to type a poem about you.

534
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Your eyes are as beautiful as a gray, cloudy sky.

535
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Every time I look at you, I can't help but to smile.

536
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
I messed up one time.

537
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,280
That fucked up everything.

538
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm sorry.

539
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm sorry.

540
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm sorry.

541
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm sorry.

542
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I'm sorry.

543
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm sorry.

544
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm sorry.

545
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,280
That fucked up everything with us.

546
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
I thought that I was forgiven.

547
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
I knew it wasn't true.

548
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Now we have to be a hidden couple.

549
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Your parents can't know. I can't hide it.

550
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I am with the most beautiful woman in Midland, Texas.

551
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
And I want the whole city to know.

552
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I am in love. I am not gonna hide it.

553
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Your friends don't like me.

554
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Well, tough luck.

555
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
We are together and there is nothing they can do about it.

556
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,280
I know I don't tell you it enough, but you are so gorgeous

557
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I haven't even went on about your kisses

558
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Do it!

559
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
They are sweet!

560
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I would choose a kiss any day over a candy apple

561
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Your lips are so luscious, I can't get enough

562
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,280
This will probably sound cheesy, but I just hope you to have my children

563
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
I hope that we are together forever

564
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:21,080
forever. I wish for the respect oif everybody, but I think since we will be at the same school,

565
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,920
we now have the chance to prove to everybody that we are the sweethearts darts for the classes of

566
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:35,640
2008 and 2009. I don't know about you, but I want people to know who we are, the couple that turns

567
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,800
heads. I am ready for this year. Speaking of a year, it is only two months away. I love you Lacey

568
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:48,080
Ann Horton. This is an honor. This is an honor of my fiancee, Lacey Ann Horton, who

569
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,060
accepted my proposal on the 26th of September 2005. She has been with me for

570
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,040
10 months and it's all I can ask for for anything more.

571
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,280
Pretty quick engagement, but I like that. That is lovely. That is so, I mean, better a

572
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,600
quick engagement than languishing around for six years, having casual premarital

573
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,000
sex, and doing God knows what type of drugs, those type of things. I have another

574
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,080
poem too. Oh my god, a treat. Talk that talk. I hate this. I hate it that you act different.

575
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,160
I hate it that we aren't us. I hate it that I can't be your one to run to. You hate me.

576
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:32,520
I hate me. What can I do? You are still with me but only so we can still be friends. I

577
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,760
hate that. I wish you would act like I'm important still. I wish that you could talk to me, not

578
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,280
some other guy. I wish we could be us from three weeks ago. I hate it that we aren't.

579
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,260
I hate it that you are so darn beautiful. I hate it that you blame me for everything that

580
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,760
goes wrong. I hate it that your friends hate because of rumors. I just want me and you

581
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,000
to be how we used to be. I could care less about friends.

582
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Holy.

583
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,880
Just be normal with me. I used to make you happy. You saw the ring today. That's why

584
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm working so hard. You told me you would never blame your hatred for me because of

585
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,160
work. What happened? Who are you in love with now? Why can't I be the one? Just a few questions

586
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,920
on my mind. Baby or Lacey? Which one? And there's some comments here.

587
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,440
Is that also about Lacey Horton?

588
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,560
You wrote that one about Lacey Horton too?

589
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,000
And there's some comments here and this is from Dark Rose and they say you have never

590
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
had love.

591
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
(sighing)

592
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,660
- God damn. - Holy shit.

593
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,520
- Do you believe that about yourself?

594
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,000
You and Lacey, you never had love?

595
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,240
- Well, I replied and said,

596
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,960
"Um, okay, maybe I shouldn't have asked for advice.

597
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,560
"That is how I feel about my love,

598
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,160
"and I really don't care that anybody else thinks about that."

599
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,600
- Damn, that is a good-ass comeback, dude.

600
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,440
That is great.

601
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,440
- And then I got a critical review from Espelina

602
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,480
that says, "There was no flow to this poem

603
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,500
"in any way at all, and it needs more than a little tweaking

604
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,620
"to make it sound nice.

605
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,600
"It just sounds whiny and childish."

606
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,080
I don't agree with that at all.

607
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,520
I think that's a mature poem.

608
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,080
- And you know what?

609
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm gonna prove Espelina wrong.

610
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,820
- That's right.

611
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,880
- This next poem that I wrote.

612
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,960
- Oh my God.

613
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
- What did I do?

614
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,160
Well, I ain't sure of how this will turn out,

615
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,440
but hey, I still love this one.

616
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,720
She loved me for so long, almost a year.

617
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,480
But the last two weeks she was acting weird

618
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
and now I know why.

619
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,400
She was trying to get us to split up.

620
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,440
Well, out of anger, I did it.

621
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,900
I said we were over, almost a perfect couple.

622
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,200
Now I sit here in tears thinking, what did I do?

623
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,440
Had it all planned out, I had the ring.

624
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,880
August 27th would have been our year.

625
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,840
I was gonna take her out to Olive Garden,

626
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,600
the finest restaurant in Midland.

627
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,440
- Holy fuck.

628
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,160
- Then take her over to the ice skating rink in Odessa.

629
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,000
- Yup.

630
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,880
- Fall in the middle of the ring and then ask,

631
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,300
will you marry me?

632
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,280
Well, now I can't.

633
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,000
My mouth ruined my life, sitting here in shock.

634
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,400
She hung up on me.

635
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,640
For the first time, I am scared that I will never

636
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,880
hear from her again.

637
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,700
Man, I hate her, but I love her.

638
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,980
I love her because she just played this big game

639
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,840
of love and won.

640
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,840
I love her because at times, I believed that she loved me,

641
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,620
but for now, it was all a past dream.

642
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,780
I am ill.

643
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,440
I don't want to go on.

644
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,600
What did I do?

645
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,140
Well, I opened my mouth.

646
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,840
She tries to tell me that I ain't a bad person,

647
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,880
when deep down in her heart I fear that she doesn't care.

648
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,080
What do I do?

649
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,560
Scared to drive to see her 'cause I wanna kill myself.

650
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,120
Scared to go to sleep 'cause what if I don't wake up?

651
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,640
Scared to talk about it.

652
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
Thank God for all poetry.

653
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,440
I am just in too much shock.

654
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,560
What have I done?

655
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,900
Nothing right is my answer,

656
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,440
but I guess it is time for her to find someone.

657
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,000
I thought I was her special someone,

658
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,960
but man, love what you have, even if you hate it.

659
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,440
what what i do just to hear her say i love you jimmy

660
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,000
jimmy

661
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,680
jimmy is israelis is by the way that you

662
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
that's my stage name

663
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,880
uh... jimmy i think that's the case my stage name is jimmy

664
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,680
that was honestly raw

665
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,960
yeah the rise for us okay i have one and i have another poem you keep saying you

666
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240

667
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,040
i have

668
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,540
What?

669
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,040
What?

670
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,540
What?

671
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,040
What?

672
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,540
Is he just gone?

673
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
He's just gone, I guess.

674
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,540
Went in the bathroom?

675
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,040
I have a few more poems.

676
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
What a fucking asshole.

677
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,540
I know.

678
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
And I guess the bathroom's on stage.

679
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,540
Fucking worst comedy club ever, dude.

680
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,540
Who did that?

681
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,540
That's fucked.

682
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,540
This one is called "Too Much Pain."

683
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Too much pain?

684
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,040
But there's already been so much pain in your words.

685
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,540
Yeah, how could there be more pain?

686
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
How could there possibly be something more painful than just walking?

687
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,540
The farther I walk into the frightful woods, the darker and closer it gets.

688
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
Each step that I take, I make another mistake.

689
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,540
As I go to sit down on a broken leg, something catches my eye.

690
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,540
As I look up into the starry night sky, I realize it was only an airplane.

691
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,540
As I retrieve from the broken log, I find the best spot to lay down.

692
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,540
I look up at the amazing night sky again. I begin to let my freezing tears drown my face.

693
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,540
Dude, take it slow. You're freaking me out.

694
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,760
I passed I start to remember the pain and I hate when I had a family that loved and cared when I had a

695
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,880
What I considered a home. I don't even know what I have anymore

696
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,080
All I know now is my lost and broken soul. That was the past the thing I cherish the most

697
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,000
I had to run away from all that pain. No way I have left with no one

698
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,800
Myself the purse I paid for running away was harsh

699
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,280
The fact that I don't have a family is too much pain that I will not take you have no family

700
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,040
This is my final goodbye.

701
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,160
Are you gonna kill yourself?

702
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,260
You're an orphan who's gonna kill himself?

703
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,600
You're...

704
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,320
Yeah, can you just sit down?

705
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,480
Yeah, just go ahead and sit down.

706
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,960
Maybe lay off the soda, then you won't have to pee.

707
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,400
If you're peeing that much, man,

708
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,320
something's wrong with you, health-wise.

709
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,600
Okay, I have...

710
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,440
I think...

711
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,320
You wanna, I mean, I don't know how many you prepared,

712
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,080
but I think we're, I think the, I don't know, I mean...

713
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,600
Yeah, how about you let somebody else have a turn,

714
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,440
you fucking asshole?

715
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,280
All right, names on the list.

716
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,360
- You'd kill yourself, you bitch.

717
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,200
- Okay.

718
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,760
- I don't know if you wanna do all of your poems at once,

719
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,600
is all I'm saying. - I won't do all my poems

720
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
at once, right. - You're blowing your load.

721
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,720
You keep saying one more, and then you do another.

722
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,040
- Okay, you know what?

723
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,800
I'll just, I'll sit down, all right?

724
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,680
- All right, sit down. - Okay, go ahead, sit down.

725
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,400
- All right, Patrick, or Jimmy, everybody.

726
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,240
- Jimmy! - Jimmy!

727
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,880
- I thought that-- - Let's hear it for Jimmy.

728
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,720
- All right. - All right.

729
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,560
- I'm gonna be honest.

730
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,000
(Jimmy singing)

731
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm gonna be honest with you.

732
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,920
I thought that I was supposed to do all of 'em right now.

733
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,960
- Because you weren't paying attention

734
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,040
when the open mic rules were being read.

735
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,880
We all know that you were doing skateboarding games.

736
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,480
- Okay, but that means I'm gonna have to start

737
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,600
making stuff up on the spot.

738
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,440
- That's fine.

739
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,260
- That's fine, but it's--

740
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,100
- Yeah, that's fine.

741
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,940
- That's fine, and it's also your--

742
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,480
- Improv is something that you can do--

743
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,760
- It's anything, it's FUDZ Anything Goes Open Mic.

744
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,960
- You can go up there and you can do a hotkey.

745
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,800
- Anything goes.

746
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,880
- I'm getting that it's anything goes.

747
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,520
- It's literally, but get off the stage.

748
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,340
- Okay.

749
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,180
- Get off the stage.

750
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,720
- Anything goes for roughly eight minutes

751
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,300
and then you can fuck off, maybe.

752
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
So there we go.

753
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Patrick Rowan, everybody.

754
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Jimmy!

755
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Or Jimmy.

756
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Jimmy.

757
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Good shit, Jimmy.

758
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Great, great, great job, Jimmy.

759
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:17,900
That actually, I mean, I have to say, Jimmy, what you have just done, it actually brought

760
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,700
something into my memory that I had written that I had completely forgotten about.

761
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Really?

762
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,580
Yeah, and I'm seeing that my name is next up on the list.

763
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,900
Oh shit, it is.

764
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Yeah, which I forgot that I even signed up that many times.

765
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,700
But this is good, because now I have something prepared.

766
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,040
See I signed up as Jimmy because I thought that if I went up as Patrick then I wouldn't be allowed to go up twice

767
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,260
But now I know now you'll go up as Patrick on the second one. I guess okay

768
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:46,860
All right, I think I'll I guess I'll still be Jimmy. All right, that's fine. Okay. Well, it's my turn

769
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:58,400
Wow and here comes Cameron approaching the stage

770
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Oh man.

771
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I've just buttoned my jacket.

772
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Be improper not to.

773
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Hey, long time no see, pal. What's up?

774
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,900
Hey.

775
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm not doing comedy this time.

776
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Yeah, poets don't really do crowd work.

777
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,400
You don't have to worry about me roasting you or anything like that.

778
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Uh, 'cause I'm more, this is more...

779
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
You know what? Fuck it. Roast him!

780
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Just fucking roast him!

781
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Uh, so...

782
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,400
What's up with, um...

783
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,480
Your facial expression are you confused?

784
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah, what's that your friend probably what are you eight eight months old yeah

785
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,500
Get him asshole. I heard you in the bathroom. You're going like this

786
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:50,080
He was going like I heard that - he's kidding. Yeah, I think he was coming in there. Oh wait. Hey, hey guys

787
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,760
He wasn't even coming in there

788
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,360
he was peeing and making that noise.

789
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,200
- Wait, ask him about the threesome again

790
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,040
and ask him who the two guys were.

791
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,800
- Hey, who were the two guys were?

792
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
What?

793
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,880
Nobody can hear you, you don't have a microphone.

794
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,320
- Yeah, how about you leave the comedy

795
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,600
to the professionals, okay?

796
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,720
And go back to-- - Even though he's a poet

797
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,040
right now. - Drinking soda.

798
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,120
- I wish he'd go back in the bathroom and stay there.

799
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,320
- Yeah, I wish he'd go back into his coffin.

800
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,640
And fucking die.

801
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,400
- Okay, now we got the laughs out.

802
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,160
- There's gonna be no more laughs after this, right?

803
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,080
This is more of a--

804
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,500
Because there's pain in my heart.

805
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,040
This is less about pain, and this is more about love,

806
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,160
which is what you inspired me to do.

807
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,660
OK.

808
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,460
Do something about.

809
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,560
So this is a poem that I wrote in 2010, and it's entitled--

810
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,700
And how old were you in 2010?

811
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,640
I wasn't born yet.

812
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,280
Oh.

813
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,280
This is entitled "Soul of Blue," and it's a love story

814
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,600
for my love.

815
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,360
I like love.

816
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,680
I used to have love, but then it betrayed me.

817
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,760
Take me with you, oh soul, I ask.

818
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,520
Will you free me with your peaceful mind?

819
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
One can only hope, solemnly pray.

820
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
Is the tree of souls my only destiny in this life?

821
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,280
Will the blue sky of your eyes consume me?

822
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,120
Ewa, I ask for clarification, for but a balance

823
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,240
upon this life.

824
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,400
Will we one day be planet-Earth friendly, I ask?

825
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,500
As long as monetary value be alive, we be set to slavery.

826
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Is the world of truth real?

827
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,080
Is it viable?

828
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,200
Is cash our unobtainium?

829
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,040
There may be no reason to believe, but I wish to.

830
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,800
Tot skin, energy unmatchable, legs as long as the heavens,

831
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,400
with matching butts from a lust-worthy world of old.

832
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,680
A world of true freedom.

833
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,080
Where do I find such beauty?

834
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,240
Ideas loose me, elude me, entrap me, encase and transfix me.

835
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,520
Why does cash mean so much?

836
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,200
Possessions are but the seed of deception.

837
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,040
The wind of Western socialism/democracy

838
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,320
will eat away at the last of our freedoms.

839
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
Facts.

840
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,720
The swing of our blueness within can set us free,

841
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,600
but only if we believe.

842
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,280
And to my sweet blue princess of pan, I say,

843
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,680
I would blend with your ideology, complete unity within seconds and without a second thought.

844
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,760
Your bittersweet arrow could pierce my heart in anger, but your destined path is what is

845
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,720
sought by this soul, and I shall receive it within my personal internal grasp.

846
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,400
If only you, my sweet, could find the heart to see I'm far from a swaggering player.

847
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Please.

848
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,960
Could have fooled me with that outfit.

849
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Yes, sir.

850
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,840
For humanity's insight, see me, roll with me, unite with me.

851
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,800
I would rather your heart sealed with a loving kiss, my dear love, Neytiri, until the setting

852
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
sun disappears.

853
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,900
If but forever, a day, and a day still, you take my bitterness and make it whole with tender

854
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,540
berries of sparkling blue.

855
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,960
To me, there is nothing more than the love for our planet, for our species, and especially

856
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,080
our people.

857
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,400
And that's a poem I wrote about Neytiri from Avatar.

858
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,060
Wow.

859
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
That's amazing.

860
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
My love.

861
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
That is so beautiful.

862
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
That was beautiful.

863
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:15,260
beautiful. Thank you. Thank you so much, guys. Oh, thank you.

864
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,420
Now, that's too much. That's, I mean, what do you guys say? You

865
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,780

874
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:07,540
"Thingy." From the tiniest prick to the world's biggest dick, penises are great.

875
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,320
14 inch meat to the 2 inch baby. I want you now

Is a you want a 2 inch baby?

879

2008 okay, so you were also a baby, okay?

880
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,100
Well that makes it a little bit better, but you're also performing it in

881
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,060
2000

882
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:39,260
You're an adult you're up there saying oh as poetry is not about your you're asking gold

883
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,860
Boundaries you're talking about a baby

884
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,260
Baby limits and your ass must enter your little space, and I don't want to do that

885
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,720
I don't know what that means the hell. Are you know what that means?

886
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,420
What are you talking about? We've done a bunch of episodes about diaper lovers, and you guys don't remember

887
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,660
What do you mean a little I don't know what kind of pedophilic bullshit you're talking about, but it's not welcome

888
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
I'm at this on me. He said he wants a two-inch, baby

889
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:07,360
Okay, and he just reversed my brain again back to your ass. You're fucking gonna get smoked by okay, okay, okay fine

890
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360

891
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:16,500
Yeah, hands up. You're gonna be that poem was in poor taste. Okay, okay? I can admit it, but art is about being messy

892
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,420
Like your diaper. I don't wear a diaper. I wear a suit and you wear

893
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,400
Fucking bullshit, and this is what I think about your generation, okay?

894
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,860
This is a poem I wrote in order bring it on old bitch. This is a poem

895
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,020
I wrote in 2017 called of a generation. That's what I think of you motherfucker. Okay

896
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,380
Of a generation

897
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:46,060
Squandered youth

898
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:55,000
Squandered youth this generation listens to mumble rap and dabs to Migos and Justin Bieber

899
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:03,800
Then composing poetry or going outside to reflect shifting yellow black bumblebees or whiffing flowers in a metropolitan park

900
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:11,440
They'd prefer to dress slutty in a rancid dim lighting nightclub with crimson red flesh

901
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,080
They swiped red right on tinder then valuing masses that gave them liberation

902
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,220
Yep, the blue earth's weary

903
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,540
It impedes me from changing a globe

904
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
Yep, I demand a change and

905
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,180
That's what I think of you wait no fuck you old man

906
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,860

00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Ankle biter. I'm not that short

00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,780
And are now wanting to test it on humans.

963
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,740
Upon hearing the news, talk show host Wendy Williams

964
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,820
volunteered to be tested on.

965
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,700
The group of scientists responded to her act of bravery

966
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,580
by saying, "Yeah, we've already tested on pigs."

967
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
- Whoa. - You fat bitch.

968
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
Wait, this is in 2011?

969
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,100
No, this is two years ago.

970
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,780
- Okay. - The Wendy Williams stuff.

971
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,780
- Yeah, that-- - Which I don't think she was really fat.

972
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,420
She-- no, but she, uh, she had to cancel the show

973
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,900
'cause she got really sick.

974
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,700
What?

975
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,580
Yeah, Wendy Williams doesn't have a show anymore because she got really sick.

976
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,420
Oh, Wendy Williams, that's another person with a show.

977
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,920
Yeah.

978
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,420
I just thought of that.

979
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,460
Oh, and Wendy Williams.

980
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,960

982
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:33,980
The killer.

983
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,480
Yeah.

984
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:42,060
Speaking of pigs, singer Lizzo was spotted twerking in a thong at a Lakers game in Staples Center.

985
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:48,860
As soon as she got up to dance, fans sitting behind her were blown away by their first solar eclipse.

986
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,780
Lizzo completely eclipsed the sun.

987
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,540
Were the fans like two years old?

988
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,340
The fans were two inches tall.

989
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,340
So they got, they were very small.

990
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,820
Oh, a two inch baby?

991
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,660
That's for you.

992
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,480
Scientists--

993
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,500
You can fuck 'em.

994
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,580
I have more news, guys.

995
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,500
Guys, great news.

996
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,580
Scientists are working on a 1,000 year space mission

997
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,160
to save the human race by relocating it

998
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,180
to a hospitable planet.

999
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,740
In other words, a planet where Pitbull's music doesn't exist.

1000
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,980
(laughing)

1001
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,020
You gotta laugh, you gotta laugh from the audience!

1002
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,020
Wow, we don't even have a cue card.

1003
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:34,180
I've had my fair amount of critiques, besides the Emmys, besides the Golden Globes for my

1004
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,900
late night Emmy Awards.

1005
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,420
DesertSunrise84 said, "Didn't like any of them and I'm wondering why the ones involving women

1006
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,700
rely solely on making fun of their appearance."

1007
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,460
Which, you know, fair question.

1008
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,460
Agree.

1009
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,360
And I would say in particular, making fun of Lizzo for being fat, at least the way it's

1010
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,180
done here, is not only pretty lazy.

1011
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,620
Sorry, that's not me.

1012
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,580
I say thank you.

1013
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,460
That's how I responded.

1014
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,620
But that's not all for me.

1015
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:06,660
I got plenty more shit to talk about.

1016
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:12,460
I'm looking for feedback here on news jokes in the style of a late night monologue or

1017
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,780
SNL's weekend update.

1018
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,140
And for some reason there's a Pokemon as the picture for this.

1019
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,140
Which one?

1020
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,140
The one with four arms.

1021
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,140
Machamp.

1022
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,620
- You're my champ.

1023
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,860
- You're my champ.

1024
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,500
- So basically, the past couple weeks I've been--

1025
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,340
- You're my champ.

1026
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,180
- So guys, listen up audience.

1027
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,000
- You're my champ, buddy.

1028
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,840
- Thank you very much.

1029
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,020
- Go champ, go my champ, go.

1030
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,980
- Okay, yeah, I'm the champ.

1031
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,220
- Look at champ shining up there.

1032
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,420
- Oh, look at his shiny head.

1033
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,580
Look at how shiny his head is under that light.

1034
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
- It's not that shiny.

1035
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,780
- It's pretty shiny.

1036
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,300
- Okay, so maybe I moisturized really, really well today.

1037
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,620
- Bro's got a third eye.

1038
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,780
You just turned the mic off again.

1039
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,700
- Man, shut your bitch ass up.

1040
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,100
- Okay, okay, okay. - You're like David Letterman

1041
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,700
and Paul Sheehy. - Hey, okay.

1042
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,940
- The past couple weeks, I've been writing news jokes

1043
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,620
for fun/practice in the style of late night monologues

1044
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,580
or SNL's weekend update.

1045
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,700
But without an audience, it's hard for me to tell

1046
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,340
whether any of these are actually funny

1047
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,180
or merely amusing or neither.

1048
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,840
If you have a minute, please let me know

1049
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,260
to which degree you found them funny or not.

1050
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:17,020
If there were any, if there were any you particularly liked

1051
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,780
or disliked or any suggestions you have for me, thanks.

1052
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,460
Here are the ones I've written so far, from most recent to least recent.

1053
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,460
Okay.

1054
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,980
Walt Disney World is building...

1055
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,980
Okay guys, ready?

1056
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,980
Yeah.

1057
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,820
I also want to ask the audience member to behave, he's being distracting.

1058
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,820
Yeah.

1059
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,820
Don't...

1060
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,820
Stop.

1061
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,820
Don't...

1062
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,820
Say stop.

1063
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,820
Stop.

1064
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,820
Yeah.

1065
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,940
Walt Disney World is building an immersive hotel for Star Wars fans that will let them

1066
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,580
travel through space in a galactic cruiser.

1067
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,580
Woo!

1068
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,580
Yeah.

1069
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,580
Yeah, good news.

1070
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:50,820
the hotel will make them a shipload of money.

1071
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:57,280
Do you want feedback for each one? Yeah. That one was good. Okay. That's fire.

1072
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,840
That one was good. In Sweden, a seagull flew off with a man's bag of weed just before it

1073
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,240
could be used as evidence to arrest him. Police says this is not their first

1074
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,240
encounter with the seagull mafia.

1075
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:17,080
That'd be good. This one. Like one. Yeah, this needs some

1076
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,960
this needs some work. That's a two. It's you need to iterate

1077
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,360
on that a little. Yeah. Alright. Cuz the actually that's a

1078
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,160
four because the premise. It's a little too. It's a little too

1079
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,880
true. The seagull bloods or the crips. That would be funnier.

1080
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,160
Okay, I'll remember that. In a class action lawsuit, some

1081
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,640
Canadians have sued Red Bull for misleading them to believe

1082
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,140
that it would actually give them wings.

1083
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,720
The same people also want to sue Budweiser

1084
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,220
on the basis that Bud Light doesn't weigh any less.

1085
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,180
- Okay, I like that one.

1086
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,520
It's a thinker, but it's good.

1087
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,820
- It's more of a clever kind of movie.

1088
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,760
- Yeah, it takes you, that's the one where you hear

1089
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,180
a moment of silence before the laughs start to roll.

1090
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,800
- Guys, here's a good one.

1091
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,520
A fourth Matrix movie is under development.

1092
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,560
- Okay. - Get excited,

1093
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,160
with stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss set to return.

1094
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:11,000
the movie is tentatively titled neo in trinity's excellent adventure

1095
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,140
i like that one but they're to meet them

1096
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,600
yet they made better came out of the head

1097
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,400
now i don't have faced the music

1098
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,400

1099
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,880
uh... it's uh...

1100
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,040
a florida woman

1101
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,280
you've with all of us and i think that and out of ten not even get a read that

1102
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,120
mother fucker

1103
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,660
i don't even have to because you know that it's already funny as shit

1104
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,660
No, I'll do it. I gotta make this guy happy.

1105
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:41,660
A Florida woman was shocked when her dog came back from the groomer with pink ears and green eyebrows.

1106
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,660
To see what her dog looks like, buy a ticket to Cirque du Soleil.

1107
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:54,660
That's right. Fuck the Cirque du Soleil weird motherfuckers with green and pink makeup.

1108
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,660
Put some real makeup on. What are you doing?

1109
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,900
Surprisingly the phrase "Taco Tuesday" is trademarked by fast food chain Taco John's

1110
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,300
who routinely mails letters ordering other restaurants to stop using it.

1111
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,700
The company likes to send those letters out on cease and desist Sunday.

1112
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,700
That's alright.

1113
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:20,260
Oh wait yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1114
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:25,220
A five-year-old was granted his birthday wish when he got to be a Target employee for a

1115
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,220
day.

1116
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,380
That's a feel-good story. He says for his next birthday he wants to have a midlife crisis.

1117
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,460
This old ass kid is acting all old.

1118
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,820
Oh, I want to have a job on my birthday.

1119
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,100
This kid's an old fuck.

1120
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,220
He's an old soul.

1121
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:44,620
John Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, has resigned, citing historically difficult relations.

1122
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,780
He has also broken up with his girlfriend, citing historically difficult relations.

1123
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:00,640
Former Major League pitcher Kurt Schilling, let's give it up for the Boston Red Sox real quick. World Series champ.

1124
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,640
Who doesn't love the Boston Red Sox?

1125
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,720
Kurt Schilling got the bloody sock. The bloody sock. That bastard, they couldn't get him off the mound.

1126
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:14,560
Uh-huh. He completely bankrupt to the state of Rhode Island. That's right. To make the best video game ever.

1127
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,660
Mm-hmm.

1128
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,880
Former Major League pitcher Kurt Schilling has announced that he is considering running for Congress.

1129
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,500
Analysts question whether he can make it the full term without a reliever. So that's not a very funny one

1130
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:30,500
That one doesn't make sense. He was a relief pitch pretty disrespectful in a tweet Donald Trump claimed that he doesn't have a racist bone

1131
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,540
In his body. Oh, yeah, Donald Trump, then why have all why are all your bones white?

1132
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:43,340
Whites are white ass white all white people aren't racist and if you want to see more in the future

1133
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,020
I post these on my twitter account twitter.com slash Alan does the news. I

1134
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,820
I didn't know you had that Twitter account.

1135
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,320
That's cool.

1136
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:50,820
That's me.

1137
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,180
I'm definitely going to be checking that out.

1138
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,020
Yeah, I just have a couple more daily jokes.

1139
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:54,940
Oh, just a couple more?

1140
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,460
Yeah, just five daily jokes more.

1141
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,340
OK, let's count them down.

1142
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,820
All right.

1143
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,780
These are some more stepdad life jokes,

1144
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,820
because u/goatofthrones asked for them, but not really.

1145
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,860
Goat of throats.

1146
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,460
Yep.

1147
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,780
The goat, the throat goat?

1148
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,540
Wait, actually, maybe I want to do a different one.

1149
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,040
Hold on.

1150
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,260
So Caleb asked this question.

1151
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,940
Caleb is the throat goat.

1152
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,780
I get my humor from my dad.

1153
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,060
Do you remember that crazy ice bucket challenge thing

1154
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:26,660
from a few years ago? Well, my dad, he died of ALS. Dad is, my fucking father died. My

1155
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:32,860
father died of ALS, Lou Gehrig Syndrome disease. Is there any more in that joke? That's the

1156
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:38,940
punchline? That's the topic of the day. Took a lifeguard class. They said sometimes a person

1157
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,940
who is drowning, terrified, moments from death, will fight you, even though you're trying

1158
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:48,300
save them that's what being a stepdad is like except no one's coming to save me

1159
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,540
I'm drowning out here with my fucking you're drowning in kids I'm drowning

1160
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,260
with my stepkids you're drowning your stepkids I'm drowning in them they're so

1161
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:06,220
busy okay they're busy the boy the boy got caught being at school I'm guessing

1162
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:11,020
that's one of my two stepkids come on man come on man think of your health

1163
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:18,060
people can actually die of that of embarrassment oh shit I've learned a lot

1164
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,940
from my wife for instance I've learned I'm a revolting mud man whose dirt-clad

1165
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:30,300
eyes are incapable of perceiving filth that for my wife I can't live without my

1166
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,100
wife and she can't live without a clean house if y'all track dirt in here she

1167
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:43,220
knows about it. End of the studio. End of here. My wife used to wake me up early. Come on,

1168
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:47,620
get up, we gotta clean the house. I can't really afford it, but I need my sleep, so

1169
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:52,280
I got us a house cleaner. My wife still woke me up early. Come on, get up, we gotta clean

1170
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:59,300
up before the cleaners get here. Stupid bitch! I'm hiring somebody to clean the house, you

1171
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:04,420
fucking bitch what are you doing? Why are you waking me up? I'm having dreams about new

1172
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:10,260
technology. And then one more joke guys. Alright. I'll end it on this one. This one and I'll

1173
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:17,380
submit it. Pretty racist. This is called, this one's called, this one's as good as, as simple

1174
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:25,340
as a title can come. Chinese Spanish. There's a half Chinese, half Spanish restaurant near

1175
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,100
Yeah, I don't know what they serve, but I'm pretty sure it has rice

1176
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:39,880
And that's all for me you guys thank you for coming out

1177
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,340
That was incredible that was so good

1178
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:49,060
Yeah, we'll tell world we'll break it down

1179
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:52,020
Sure. Yeah, so

1180
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,680
For me, I'm a huge fan of late-night comedy. I think bringing that to an open mic is

1181
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,920
a

1182
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:05,540
Beautiful. Yeah, a bit you would think me being an emo like I am I would not like late-night

1183
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,540
But I think when I grow up

1184
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,740
Yeah

1185
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,940
People like like James Corden are bringing emo into late-night

1186
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:18,600
They're bringing music and the emotions of youth are being brought into

1187
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,440
the late-night scene and that

1188
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:27,460
is good. I mean I feel like I was honestly reinventing and reformulating the genre in

1189
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:33,700
many ways. Yeah. And I'm proud of myself and I'm proud of everybody who helped me. Including

1190
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,380
you guys for giving the feedback on this. I mean you were great. I'm glad I could be

1191
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,980
a part of it. You're ready for prime time. Really? Late night I mean. Alright. I'm ready.

1192
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,980
Oh my god you could do the first prime time. The first prime time late night show. Okay.

1193
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:51,700
Okay, yeah, I think that'd be great. Early night. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm checking the list here.

1194
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,300
Who's going up? I'm seeing, I'm seeing, I can't, it's kind of smudged and I can't tell whether it

1195
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,380
says Jimmy or Patrick Doran. It kind of, yeah. It seems like it could say either. My signature.

1196
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:08,580
And it seems like it could say either. Well, you guys are in luck. Are we? Because I have,

1197
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:13,380
while all that was happening, I wrote five more poems. I can't even believe that's possible.

1198
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,880
Five more? I'm a very prolific writer.

1199
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,380
Alright, well God bless you. Go do your damn thing.

1200
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,880
Go for it, pal. Are you Jimmy or Patrick?

1201
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Jimmy! Jimmy, everybody! Jimmy!

1202
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,880
Jimmy! Go Jimmy! Go Jimmy!

1203
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,380
I'm back with more poems about my life.

1204
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,880
And this one is called "D.A.M.N."

1205
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,880
D.A.M.N.?

1206
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,720
Damn, oh damn.

1207
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,020
I didn't know exactly how much I loved her.

1208
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,880
Here I find myself thinking,

1209
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,460
you are at a dance without me.

1210
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,920
Are you dancing with another guy?

1211
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,480
Are you thinking of me?

1212
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,920
I didn't know I loved her so much

1213
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,280
until she started to be wondrous.

1214
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,880
I didn't know I loved her so m much

1215
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,520
until I couldn't be with her every last possible moment.

1216
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,340
But now I can tell you that I know how much I love her.

1217
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,380
My love for her only gets stronger.

1218
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,880
People try hard to split us up but never succeed.

1219
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,080
People said this wouldn't last

1220
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,780
and tell us to get rid of each other.

1221
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,880
After nine months, we couldn't love each other

1222
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,280
any more than we do now.

1223
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,840
Sure, we argue, but what normal couple doesn't?

1224
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,040
We are not normal.

1225
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,880
We would do everything to see each other.

1226
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,300
I'm trying to see you so often,

1227
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,840
but your mom doesn't like me.

1228
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,280
I didn't know how much I loved her

1229
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,480
until her mom said we couldn't be together.

1230
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,800
I didn't know how much I loved her

1231
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,160
until we had a near breakup.

1232
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,000
I can't believe how stupid I was

1233
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,160
to question your love for me.

1234
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,100
I know you love me and I wouldn't do anything to hurt me.

1235
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,640
You wouldn't do anything to hurt us.

1236
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,520
we are both thankful for what God has given us, each other.

1237
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,480
I ask for a kiss, but you give it to me like it is a prize.

1238
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,720
Baby, your kisses are worth more

1239
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,640
than any prize I have ever won.

1240
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,820
I just wish I could get more of my prize more often.

1241
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,240
I call and I call in hopes to hear your voice,

1242
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,280
but still no answer.

1243
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,740
I worry when I can't hear from you.

1244
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,120
I didn't know how much I loved her

1245
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,020
until I thought I was being ignored.

1246
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,320
I didn't know how much I loved her

1247
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,880
until we weren't holding hands.

1248
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,360
I didn't know how much she loved me

1249
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,720
until she told me that we couldn't break up.

1250
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,720
I didn't know how much she loved me until she kissed me seriously.

1251
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,440
Seriously?

1252
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,680
I didn't know how much,

1253
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,280
I didn't know she loved it at all until I hear those three little but big words.

1254
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,680
I love you. They mean only something.

1255
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,440
They mean only something to a person once in their life.

1256
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,960
So Lacey Ann Horton, I love you.

1257
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,240
Wow. That was great.

1258
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,360
And now I got another one for y'all.

1259
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,360
- Sure.

1260
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,580
Does anyone care?

1261
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,420
- I do.

1262
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,240
- Yeah, I do.

1263
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,740
- Yeah, raising my hand up in the sky.

1264
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:44,580
- Look over here.

1265
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,500
- That's the title of it.

1266
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,340
- Yes, I care.

1267
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,160
- Look over here.

1268
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,000
- Does anyone care?

1269
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,680
- Yeah, I already fucking said I care.

1270
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,100
- I sit here on this thing I call a couch.

1271
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,060
(laughing)

1272
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,380
But usually I sit.

1273
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,620
(laughing)

1274
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:04,540
This time things are different.

1275
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:09,300
School has been so freaking awesome today, but once I get in the car is when the life hits the fans.

1276
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,980
I try to pretend to be everything is okay, but only if you truly knew me deep down.

1277
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,140
I am a sad and miserable man.

1278
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,420
Nobody asked or do they care?

1279
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:22,820
I tried to be a good boyfriend, but no, everything I say always comes out wrong.

1280
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,380
I walk you upstairs.

1281
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,740
I find out you are mad at me.

1282
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,620
What am I to do?

1283
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,180
I'm just a helpless young man.

1284
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,820
You think I would cheat again?

1285
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,020
No one in this world trusts me.

1286
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,580
Why? What did I do wrong?

1287
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:38,020
I came home as soon as I walk in the door before I can even set my stuff down.

1288
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:42,420
I am getting yelled at. My life is officially going to end in one month.

1289
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,700
A marriage can ruin a family. Will it kill mine?

1290
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,940
I only have two months until I'm 16.

1291
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,140
I only have two years and two months until I'm out of this miserable house. Wow.

1292
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:56,420
Only two years. Well, I guess I am done. No one wants to care.

1293
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,020
No one cares to hear about my miserable life.

1294
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:03,540
Oh, you're only 16 or no, you're 15. You're 15. You're married.

1295
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,540
You have a family?

1296
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,780
I proposed to Lacey Ann Horton, I guess.

1297
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,780
The most beautiful woman in all of Texas.

1298
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,780
The most beautiful woman in Midland, Texas.

1299
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,780
Midland, Texas.

1300
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,780
I'm pretty sure...

1301
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,340
And how old is she?

1302
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,060
I think she's also 16.

1303
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,500
I think they were both 16.

1304
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,540
Proposing to a 16 year old.

1305
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,540
Got it on cam.

1306
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,540
Okay, Jimmy.

1307
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,540
Okay, well, here's another...

1308
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,540
Okay, let's get it.

1309
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,540
Here's another poem.

1310
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,540
It's not Patrick, that's Jimmy.

1311
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,540
That's Jimmy.

1312
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,540
Yeah, that's Jimmy talking.

1313
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,540
Jimmy can be a creep pervert.

1314
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,540
Yeah, well, he's also 16.

1315
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,540
Jimmy probably idolizes Pete Aubert.

1316
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:39,260
bear. Damn! I just saw a picture of that for the first time. Really? Yep. What did

1317
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:44,620
you think of the design? I thought the design was actually mad original. Yeah, it

1318
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:52,980
is. Here's another poem I got here. "I can't stand." I just wish that

1319
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,740
people would tell me the truth. I hate it when you tell me that you love me but

1320
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:00,780
could be careless to treat me like it. I can't stand it when you tell me that you

1321
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:05,220
You are not talking to a certain someone, but you shut off your phone and I check your messages

1322
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,620
only to hear, "Hey look, I'm sorry for what happened earlier.

1323
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,260
I'm so sorry, but please quit ignoring me.

1324
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,260
I can't stand it.

1325
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,020
I can't stand it anymore.

1326
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,020
No more lies.

1327
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,260
I have done what you have asked for and you have lied to me since May.

1328
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,460
I swear that I don't talk to him, Jimmy.

1329
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,380
He just leaves messages.

1330
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,380
Trust?

1331
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,540
Trust, when you just proved my point?

1332
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,740
I check your messages and hear his voice yet again.

1333
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:34,420
And here he is apologizing for what happened earlier.

1334
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,080
What exactly happened earlier?

1335
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,840
It just helps prove that while I'm at work,

1336
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,600
you were lying to me and messing around on me.

1337
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,220
I can't stand to be lied to anymore.

1338
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,520
I can't talk to anyone anymore.

1339
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,120
If I try, I have nothing but problems to talk about.

1340
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,000
And I am emo?

1341
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,660
Just hug.

1342
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,940
I am seriously on the edge of just kissing my life goodbye.

1343
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,140
No, I know.

1344
01:02:59,140 --> 01:02:59,820
Don't do that.

1345
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,500
Reason I had to live, but the pain I'm sitting here crying.

1346
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,860
Is that what you want?

1347
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,900
It is to make me cry once a night over you.

1348
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:14,020
Well, you let me be my, well, let me be your Janani in a bottle.

1349
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:20,820
I can't stand it for it's VIs.

1350
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,620
That's Roman numeral four, right?

1351
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,380
- Yeah, that's six. - That's six.

1352
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,940
- Six, six!

1353
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,220
I try really hard in life and never get a good job

1354
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,140
or any kind of compliments,

1355
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,460
but I bet you didn't know that I am sick to my stomach,

1356
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,500
did you?

1357
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,700
No, you didn't never ask me what's wrong.

1358
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,580
Do you care?

1359
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,260
Honestly, do you care?

1360
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:44,780
Well, the only thing I'm saying is I love you!

1361
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,540
- Damn. - Lacey Ann Horton.

1362
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,540
- God. - Holy shit.

1363
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,380
- Fucking damn, dude.

1364
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,880
What I wouldn't kill to be laced.

1365
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,380
Who I wouldn't kill.

1366
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,380
Here's an editor's note from the comments.

1367
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,380
Hey, I was at the movies with two managers.

1368
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,380
We were supposed to talk about me getting a raise,

1369
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:02,880
but instead they went off and told me that they were going to the concession stand

1370
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,380
and I get a text saying that they would talk to me later.

1371
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,380
They had found out some of their friends to go party with,

1372
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:12,880
so I sat in my car as it was overheated and laid in my trunk watching cars and soccer or something like that.

1373
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,380
But you were on my mind the whole time.

1374
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:17,380
I love you, sweetie, and I thought that you promised me no more cutting.

1375
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,880
Well, are you okay? What happened at the hospital, baby?

1376
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,400
Please tell me that you are okay

1377
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,080
I have to work a double shift tomorrow

1378
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,700
But I will stop by on my time off if my car doesn't overheat it overheated on the way home

1379
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:33,240
From them damn movies - I've been stranded since 130. It is 330

1380
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,540
I am so tired, but if you can text me to tell me if it is okay to come over

1381
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,560
I love you so much. And of course we are still together. I love you

1382
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,840
I wish you could have been there in my trunk with me. I was so scared

1383
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,080
it is dark and it is outside. I have never been more scared in my life. Well, baby, I'm

1384
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,480
so sorry for putting you through so much stress, but I will make it up somehow. I promise this

1385
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,520
to you. I love you. I'm going to go to bed. Mwah!

1386
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:04,480
Hey, speaking of cutting, how about you cut a rug up there? Show us your dance moves.

1387
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,480
That's nice.

1388
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,480
Damn. All right.

1389
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,960
Is that sound getting picked up?

1390
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,480
Yeah, it's great. It sounds great.

1391
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,200
Okay, I have two more poems here.

1392
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,640
Two more. All right. Okay.

1393
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,640
I'm buckling in.

1394
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,000
This one's pretty short.

1395
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,040
- Hit it.

1396
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,200
I think you're pretty and short.

1397
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,400
- Okay.

1398
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,760
- Take it off.

1399
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,580
- What?

1400
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,720
- Take off your clothes.

1401
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,560
- I'm not taking off the clothes.

1402
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,360
- Take off your clothes, you stripper.

1403
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,040
- These are my poetry outfit.

1404
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,280
- Strip, strip, strip.

1405
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,240
- All right, I'm gonna start this poem right now.

1406
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,920
- This guy wants you to strip to show it off.

1407
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,760
- I'm not doing it.

1408
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,280
- I want all the ladies and the boys to see you.

1409
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,840
- Let me start my poem, goddammit.

1410
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,280
- Go ahead and strip it off.

1411
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,280
And this is a poem about really just the pain in my heart.

1412
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,120
(imitates guitar)

1413
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,440
Okay?

1414
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,160
It's about the pain in my heart.

1415
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,280
African's Goliath Frog.

1416
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,240
Goliath Frog throws his tummy around.

1417
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,160
Rainforest is where he is often found.

1418
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,540
Snapping up shellfish blue,

1419
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,960
consuming littler frogs too.

1420
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,080
Slurping up insects with nary a sound.

1421
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,080
- Wow.

1422
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,400
- Metaphorical.

1423
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,480
- Okay, now make like a frog

1424
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,280
and told off all your clothes.

1425
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,200
- Yeah, hop out of those.

1426
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,040
- Jump out of that.

1427
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,880
- Hop out of those lily pads.

1428
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,000
- Maybe this final poem,

1429
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,760
maybe this final poem will give you exactly what you want.

1430
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,880
- Your armpits.

1431
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,640
- Take off your croaks.

1432
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,280
- Let me fuck her like the island boys.

1433
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,200
Talking about beating up that cooter.

1434
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,600
Fuck her so aggressively,

1435
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,800
she's gonna need a riding scooter.

1436
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,600
I'm gonna screw her like the pear,

1437
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,000
but I'm going in single,

1438
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,120
talking about that luscious pinkness.

1439
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,360
We all need a little chat and mingle.

1440
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,080
She can't handle this sex,

1441
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,840
talking about making her legs go stanky,

1442
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,560
smelling like the goodest of goods

1443
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,360
and the dankest of danky.

1444
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,220
That smell, you know what I mean,

1445
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,880
not the kind that reeks of fish.

1446
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,600
I may be from the island, but this is my one true wish.

1447
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,600
Signals straight to Johnson & Johnson,

1448
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,800
pheromones that make your blood boil.

1449
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,520
This spring is cocked and loaded,

1450
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,240
talking about re-ready to uncoil.

1451
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,000
She beats on my hourglass,

1452
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,920
trying to remove the sand from inside,

1453
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,520
talking about that island boy sex.

1454
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,940
I'm gonna come as hard as the tide.

1455
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,400
I'll stooge on her head like tats cover my face,

1456
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,880
talking about connect the dots

1457
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,720
and get the fuck out of my place.

1458
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,560
Damn.

1459
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,400
- That it?

1460
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,220
- Oh my God.

1461
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,280
- Goddamn, Jimmy, everybody.

1462
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,120
- Jimmy!

1463
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,540
- All right, keep it going for Jimmy.

1464
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,120
That was incredible.

1465
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,740
It's some incredible poetry.

1466
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,740
Great, well.

1467
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:37,280
- I mean, that's pretty much it for the open mic, right?

1468
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,960
If you guys would have me, I would love to close it out.

1469
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,660
- Oh, headliner?

1470
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,880
- With a, just, it's fuds, anything goes open, Mike.

1471
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,840
Anything truly goes. - Yeah, go do your thing!

1472
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
- And I've prepared.

1473
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,760
- I would love to see this.

1474
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,400
- I won't even tell you what I've prepared.

1475
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,220
- Okay.

1476
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,060
- But I'm just gonna go and do it.

1477
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:53,920
- Just go do it!

1478
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,680
- Here's this.

1479
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,400
- And I'm on the ones and twos.

1480
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,240
- Oh yeah.

1481
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,360
- Cameron Fetter, everybody!

1482
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,600
(clapping)

1483
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:12,160
Look at this tall motherfucker. He's looking like that Mike Stand.

1484
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,120
Yeah, he looks like his name is Mike Stand. That's how he got so tall, from standing.

1485
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,920
Hey, you enjoyed the show down there buddy? How you feeling? Good? Ready for it to be

1486
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,720
over? What so you can go home and eat another weak ass Thanksgiving plate?

1487
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,560
Oh shit! I mean seriously bro, all I saw on your plate

1488
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,560
was ham and sweet potatoes and two rolls.

1489
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,400
And that's it.

1490
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,120
- That's all he had on that plate.

1491
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,960
- That's all, okay, all right.

1492
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,560
But this is not why I came up here.

1493
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,400
This is not what I came up to do.

1494
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,360
- I thought that that was gonna be the whole finale.

1495
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,720
- Can you imagine?

1496
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,560
- Yeah, I could definitely.

1497
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,640
- If that was the whole finale, honestly,

1498
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,600
I wouldn't be able to handle it

1499
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,000
'cause my sides would be split.

1500
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,520
- I would have him writing Jimmy poems

1501
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,880
about taking his life.

1502
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,360
- Yeah, that's right.

1503
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,200
That's right.

1504
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,880
- He'd be cutting his shit wide open.

1505
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,040
he had i will sit here on the thirty minutes

1506
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,680
to him

1507
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,160
but he doesn't have that lacy and or no all hello he's got a different type of

1508
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,160
girl

1509
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,020

1510
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,920

1511
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,420

Alright, okay, here we go. Here we go guys. You ready?

1517
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:27,680
Okay.

1518
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:36,180
I walk a lonely road, only road that I have ever known.

1519
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:36,680
Oh my god.

1520
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:42,680
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone.

1521
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:55,600
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

1522
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,080
I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind

1523
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:08,160
'til the borderline, borderline of me and I walk alone

1524
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,160
ah

1525
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:25,160
My shadow's only one that walks beside me

1526
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,680
My shallow

1527
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,800
Parts the only thing

1528
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:36,880
Sometimes I wish someone would come and find me

1530
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,880

1532
01:10:53,880 --> 01:11:01,880

1533
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,880

And that was one of the most beautiful fucking things I've ever that was more beautiful than any of my poems
