Oh no, fuck me, man.

- Ah!

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,080
- 10 seconds in and you already made a damn mess.

23
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,880
- Not even 10, in the first second,

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,960
I opened my beer and it had such a splashing effect

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,720
because it's so well carbonated.

26
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,420
shout out to the good people at Athletic Brewing Company,

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,300
that it popped open the water or the beer

28
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,760
onto my keyboard.

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,360
- Really?

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,400
- No, I'm lying.

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,920
Yes, really, yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,480
I have beer all over my keyboard.

33
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
- All right, 'cause--

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,360
- And I have enough problems with my keyboard as is,

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
by the way, so.

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,040
- You need a new keyboard.

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,460
- This is forcing you to get a new keyboard, it's good.

38
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,680
- You need a new one. - I do need a new keyboard.

39
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,240
I need one bad. - It's literally a good thing.

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
- My keyboard, anytime I type with eyes,

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,480
it takes me about five minutes to log into my computer

42
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,080
in the morning because it just double types keys

43
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,400
like every single time.

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
So when I try to put in my password, it's all fucked up.

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,400
- If you have like isopropyl alcohol and some Q-tips,

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,480
you can take your key caps off and get in there with it.

47
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,960
- I ain't never doing that.

48
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
I will buy a new keyboard.

49
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,560
- So just buy a new keyboard.

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,400
Well don't stop being a pussy.

51
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
- But I don't have extra money for it.

52
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,920
- Oh my, it's like $20 for a keyboard.

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,400
- I'm not buying a 20, I will buy a three or $400 keyboard.

54
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Not a $20 keyboard.

55
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
- All right.

56
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,200
a $300 keyboard. Well you're looking in the wrong place. Your camera's actually a

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,440
little lower. Yep. Pretty embarrassing. Actually it's looking much much cleaner

58
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,020
in your room. I think that's because the angle is aimed so that most of the frame is the

59
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:23,360
ceiling. Yes. Wait, am I right? Can you see around it now? Can you see? Whoa dude, mid move. I can see that basket. Yeah. Is the

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Excitement is setting in, huh?

61
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Yeah, I just, uh...

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,360
I had to give a, like, virtual walkthrough to some guy earlier

63
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
-to tell me how much it was... -Of your furriflies?

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Yeah, so he could tell me how much it was gonna cost to move.

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,360
And, uh, it was, like, so nasty that I was just like,

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,360
"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" and just, like, bleeding, bleeding shit.

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Alright, tell us how much it was.

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Depends on... It's on the line.

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,320
So I'm using one of those containers. So if I use one container, it's 4500 if I use two containers

70
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,580
It's gonna be like 6200 god. It's so expensive to move across country. Yeah at what point is it cheaper to just buy all new stuff? I

71
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,720
Think if it was like I got one quote for

72
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,020
Like an entire like moving truck and it was like 13,000. Oh

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,260
You know, yeah, that's this is like the budget one

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah, I did have that thought which is like I could get rid of my mattress. I could pack up my hard drives and send them

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,320
my new computer

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,740
But I think it's just worth it. Did you sell your car? Not yet? You're going to yeah

77
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,360
I'm planning on it

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,540
Planning on in the next six days. Yes

79
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:48,820
We talked about this last week and he's going to one of those kind of scam so my cars you're gonna smell somebody yeah

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,300
Six days is a scam usually take a little more preparation than that I think that maybe you might end up being scammed.

81
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,200
I just need to get rid of it like a bunch of paperwork to sell a car.

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,100
I mean I'll just take a day.

83
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,400
Okay.

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:13,300
I don't want to know what are you drinking I am drinking the beast unleashed 6%

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,160
Wait, most of those years they do a hard monster white maze white hay

86
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,140
Okay, give us a give us a out of ten and then also give us a basketball player height

87
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:35,560
Someone it tastes like someone took like a white monster and then you know, they're really shitty vodka

88
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,480
You buy when you're in college

89
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,560
It's like $10 for a handle or or maybe like 99 bananas like the unflavored 99 cent vodka

90
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,440
Yeah, that's what it tastes like. It tastes like someone took a white monster,

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,600
poured a little bit out, put that shitty vodka in there, and didn't mix it. So you

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,240
just get the taste of the vodka first and then a little bit of the flavor. Yeah, it's horrible.

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:08,000
I would say a very solid 3 out of 10. Okay, and now a height? 5 foot 7. Oh, okay,

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,120
- Isaiah Thomas.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,960
- Yeah.

96
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
- All right.

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,200
Jubio, what do you got?

98
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,800
- I got actually quite a colorful beard today.

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,240
- You look so happy today.

100
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
Can I just say this?

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,080
You look pregnant.

102
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
You look like glowing.

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,400
- He's glowing, yeah.

104
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
- Well, he's happy you're back.

105
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,720
- You got really good news or sex today?

106
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
- Nope.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,380
- You had sex, didn't you?

108
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,220
- No.

109
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,060
- You had fucking sex.

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,320
- No, you know what I did today?

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,680
I went out to eat wings today

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,560
at this really shit place

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,580
where they put gummies in your drink.

114
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,300
And the whole vibe is so insane.

115
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,220
- I don't know what's shitty about what you just said.

116
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,060
- No, I'm with you.

117
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,380
Why do they do, what is up with this?

118
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,820
I've seen so many videos the past couple weeks

119
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,080
of people being like, here's a McDonald's hack.

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,780
And they get a Sprite from McDonald's

121
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,220
and they put four packs of Starburst in it

122
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,780
and a pack of Fun Dip.

123
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,100
- Basically that is like a drink

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,860
that they would sell at this place.

125
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,740
And the vibes were completely awful.

126
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,180
- I blame Mexico for that.

127
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,940
Yeah, the vibes were completely awful.

128
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,820
And then as we're like paying and like leaving,

129
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,300
they have like this, like, you know, like the Mexican candles.

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,620
So they come in like this, like glass, like huge.

131
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,580
The Catholic ones.

133
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,300
Yeah.

134
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,140
They have like custom, like funny ones on each table.

135
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,900
And when I when I got up, I bumped the table and I dropped it and it broke.

136
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,340
And I just like we had just paid as well.

137
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,300
So I just like I was like, oh, yo, check it out.

138
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,140
That this broke and we just stepped.

139
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,640
I didn't even care.

140
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,880
I like it. It's so awesome that at restaurants

141
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,620
you can break glasses and shit and they just what are they going to?

142
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,480
They're not going to.

143
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,620
Yeah, they thank you.

144
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,880
They're like, oh, thank you.

145
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,820
Well, you gave me some work.

146
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,020
Yeah.

147
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,540
Anyways, I'm not happy about that.

148
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm happy about my colorful beer,

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,320
which I guess is named Playa Car.

150
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,520
It's got like some sort of monkey on top of it.

151
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
It's like a monkey beer of some sort.

152
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
Playa means beach, right?

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah. So and car means room, room vehicle.

154
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,820
Car, yeah.

155
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,780
Yeah. So this is not a really great name for a beer.

156
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,520
Yeah.

157
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,920
It's not a great beer, honestly.

158
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,660
Number?

159
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,060
Give us a number.

160
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,420
I'm going to go four.

161
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,920
Now a height?

162
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,960
I don't know. I don't know basketball players.

163
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,200
I don't know a single one.

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,740
You know, you also just a height and you can do you can do metric if you need to.

165
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,240
Sure. We'll do.

166
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,640
I don't know. One seventy five.

167
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,640
175 meters.

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,640
That's quite tall. It's a giant.

169
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Well, guys, the day has come.

170
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,640
The reckoning has arrived.

171
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I was out of town visiting my family

172
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,640
on a trip where basically the entire thing is me

173
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,640
and my cousins and my uncles and aunts get just like

174
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,140
fucked up beyond belief for like a week and a half.

175
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,640
But I decided that coming back from this,

176
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,340
on the back end of this trip, I decided I'm going to do a month with no drinking alcohol.

177
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
So I have today...

178
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,840
Grogless August.

179
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm doing Grogless Augless.

180
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,840
Grogless Augless is a really good... Yeah, I'm doing Grogless Augless.

181
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,740
And I'm not sure what Augless is, Jubio, but sure.

182
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:35,660
This is the Athletic Brewing Company Upside Dawn Golden Ale.

183
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,140
And I've already had one of these today because it doesn't matter.

184
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,300
I mean it's a fucking, it's water.

185
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
So I'm gonna take a sip.

186
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,660
Is it just like hop water or something?

187
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,780
No, it's a brewed beer and they take the alcohol out.

188
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
Interesting.

189
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,060
Honestly, man, this is pretty good.

190
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,660
This would be, if this had alcohol in it, I would say that this is like a 7, or maybe

191
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:07,380
6.8 out of 10. And in terms of height, I'm going to go like 6'3", like Derrick Rose.

192
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:15,180
That's what I'm going to say for this. It's pretty good. The problem with these is they

193
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,980
still have calories in them, like a beer. This thing's like 90 calories, but I'll drink

194
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,380
10 of them tonight.

195
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,980
Right. It's like sparkling water.

196
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,020
Yeah, so I might as well just be doing sparkling water, but for the purposes of this podcast

197
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,060
I did get a beer and I will be finding this is for all of our sober gophers that listen to the beer podcast

198
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,480
I know there are many many many of you

199
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,380
This month is for you guys

200
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,760
This one goes out to all the groggless oglesses who can't drink beer because they used to have a serious fucking problem

201
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,620
Threw their lives killed somebody touched a woman any of that kind of stuff

202
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
You couldn't pay me, but this is just the beginning

203
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,000
of what I think is gonna be an amazing month.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
We're happy for you, man.

205
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
We're here for you.

206
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Thank you.

207
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,840
I almost, let's see, I started yesterday, the 1st.

208
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,560
Started at midnight,

209
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,080
didn't have anything after midnight,

210
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,080
and I made it, I almost gave up at about 4.30 p.m. yesterday

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,280
but I powered through and now I've made it to day two.

212
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,220
'Cause it's fucking, I love beer.

213
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,340
Yeah.

214
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,520
'Cause I was doing, the thing is, okay,

215
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
here's the problem with beer.

216
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,300
It's so amazing that yesterday I was doing nothing.

217
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,800
I didn't do anything yesterday.

218
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,160
I was at home alone most of the day.

219
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,920
And when you're doing nothing at home,

220
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,960
you're like, fuck man, I want a beer, right?

221
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,620
But then also if you go out and do something,

222
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,600
if you go to some kind of show

223
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,520
or somebody's house or some shit,

224
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,320
we go watch a game, you're like, "Goddamn, I want a beer."

225
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,680
So if you do nothing, you want beer,

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
and if you do something, you want beer.

227
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
And those are both your excuses for wanting beer.

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,240
- I think this is something very uniquely to you.

229
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,480
- Wanting a beer?

230
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,440
- Just doing nothing and just wanting beer?

231
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
I don't--

232
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
- I don't think that's uniquely.

233
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
- No, dude, that's like the number one thing to do.

234
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,240
- I don't ever just sit home and just hanging out by myself

235
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
and I go, "I want a beer."

236
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,520
- But we've established that you are some kind

237
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,060
of cyborg freak that doesn't like fun, you know?

238
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,840
Me, I'm one of the most fun-loving people

239
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,120
in the world, maybe.

240
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,440
- You hate fun.

241
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,560
- I love fun.

242
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,120
- You love staying inside.

243
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,760
- That's fun sometimes.

244
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,820
- Yeah, okay.

245
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,760
Rex, I think you're more like me in this scenario, right?

246
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,800
You're just saying--

247
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,680
- Yeah, I don't need to drink a beer,

248
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,080
But I understand fully what Caleb is saying.

249
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,840
It's nice, man.

250
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,680
Yeah, sometimes you just want to drink a beer.

251
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,720
Oh, there's nothing.

252
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,820
Sometimes you're so at a restaurant

253
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,280
and you're having a beautiful meal and you're thinking, wow, you know,

254
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,720
it would perfectly round out this delicious, wonderful time.

255
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,980
I'm having going home drinking a beer.

256
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,320
Oh, yeah.

257
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,580
No, a beer there and then going home and drinking more beer.

258
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,380
Yes.

259
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,920
Because that's the other.

260
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,480
Here's the other thing about beers, man.

261
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,280
You can't just have just one, right?

262
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,000
Cause you have one and you're like, you have to drink.

263
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you're going to drink,

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,640
you have to drink and drink and drink until you get so drunk that you fall asleep.

265
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,560
That's the only way to do it. You know, I, I have never had a beer at six o'clock.

266
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,560
That's why I hate day drinking because I know that I have to drink probably 20 to

267
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,960
25 drinks from like, I've never gotten a,

268
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,480
a a bloody Marriott brunch, you know, because that's the end of my day then.

269
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm just going to be so fucked up the rest of the day.

270
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,900
I think Groggly's August is going to do huge things for you.

271
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,600
I think you're going to be a new person.

272
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
You're going to feel amazing after Groggly's August.

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,540
I do this probably twice a year for like one month,

274
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,860
and I always feel so amazing at the end of the month.

275
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,200
And then I immediately I'm like, yeah, but I mean, I'm going to drink again.

276
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,160
It's way too good. Yeah.

277
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh, I don't like being the bummer.

278
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:27,680
I know so many sober people man and they like to think that they're high on life and having so much fun but they're not these are broken people the sober people are the true broken people of our world.

279
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:36,380
You just dedicated this cargo store the silver sandy's the world shit julio i feel bad for them.

280
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,360
Yeah, I'd like to dedicate this to single mothers too while we're at it.

281
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,260
People who have really hard lives.

282
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,060
Okay, it is it is hard as fuck to be sober.

283
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,260
It's not worth it.

284
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,460
I think it's easy and I think and you can have fun by not drinking.

285
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,760
You can't have fun without drinking man.

286
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,360
Yeah, that is sober isn't fun.

287
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,060
Being sober is not fun.

288
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,160
And if you don't drink, you got to do drugs.

289
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,260
Yeah, you have to do drugs.

290
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,460
California sober. If you do not drink and do not do drugs,

291
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,760
something is actually fucking wrong with you.

292
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,260
Or you have some kind of,

293
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,960
um, maybe some kind of like disability,

294
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,960
mental disability, you don't even know what beer and drugs are.

295
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,760
Those are like kind of the only

296
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,460
I don't think that's... acceptable. I'm basically sober.

297
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,460
I just drink like two times a week,

298
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,960
and I vape constantly, and I'm addicted to energy drinks.

299
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,460
Yeah. Oh, another thing is,

300
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,500
Every fucking sober straight edge guy I know drinks about 800 milligrams of caffeine a day

301
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,080
Yeah, and they are so in denial about it, but I've never I don't drugs

302
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,580
caffeine is so fucked I

303
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,440
Did like two days last week of not drinking coffee and I my day was over like 2 p.m. I was so sleepy

304
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Withdrawals, it's so fucked and they last for weeks by the way if you've ever quit caffeine for like a long time

305
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,620
You have like two full weeks of feeling so shit you have to take a two-hour nap in the middle of the day

306
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,680
It's an impossible life to live

307
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,080
I have to take a nap the moment the monster wears off for the day. Yeah, exactly

308
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:17,240
Last night I drank two monsters, and I just had a pain in my chest and arm kind of went down my arm

309
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,680
And I was like oh, that's probably normal

310
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,160
Everyone I get pains in my arm all the fucking time

311
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,400
Yeah, also, I wish that nobody ever I wish I didn't know I was talking to somebody about this. I wish I had no

312
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,560
Idea with the symptoms of a heart attack stroke or cuz there's not nothing I can fucking do

313
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,120
Right if I'm gonna have a heart attack, then I I'm gonna feel it

314
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
I don't need to sit there thinking I'm having one two or three times a day

315
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,920
So I think you can just ignore them

316
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,440
This is what I just norma right here. Perfect. What's that? Tiger bomb?

317
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,320
You just rub that shit wherever you start feeling heart attack type pain and it

318
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,280
Numbs it so it just goes away in ten minutes. What are you talking you use a numbing cream to?

319
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,240
Sedate yourself through heart attack symptoms

320
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:18,680
You numb your body

321
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,380
Yeah, I just like, you know, just shooting pains through your.

322
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,380
Oh yeah.

323
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,280
And then I'll just take it and I'll just rub it like this.

324
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,380
I almost want a demonstration, but I don't know there's any way for you to show

325
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
this this thing's effects.

326
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,880
It's like, oh, it hurts.

327
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,380
And then I'll just dip my fingers in.

328
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,580
It's so painful that you're grabbing and saying, ah, it hurts.

329
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,780
Yeah.

330
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,480
And I just rub like on here.

331
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,680
He's on the floor saying, I heard.

332
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
It's not I'm on the floor.

333
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,180
I'm like, give me my tiger bomb.

334
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,080
It's on my desk at all times.

335
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,840
What is it? It's a numbing cream.

336
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Yeah, it's like a muscle relaxer.

337
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,620
Does it work on your thing?

338
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,220
For your nuts?

339
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,080
I haven't tried it.

340
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,320
It probably is.

341
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,980
I would love to make it feel like I had no nuts or thing for one day.

342
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,220
Just to see what it was like.

343
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,880
Just kind of rub it in, like just around it.

344
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,540
So just isolated it.

345
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,940
That would be amazing if I get to if if I had the option to go one day

346
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,580
without a dick and balls.

347
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,340
Not even, I don't even have to have a vagina.

348
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,940
Just one day without any genitals.

349
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,860
- Just a nub.

350
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,780
- Just to see what it's like.

351
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,960
Not even a nub, just like a full kin,

352
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,780
like kinda, you know.

353
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,660
- Would numbing it-- - How would you pee?

354
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,500
- Yeah, would numbing it--

355
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,340
- I would need to pee.

356
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,560
- Suppress the feel of, that you need to pee, do you think?

357
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,500
- Maybe.

358
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,140
- Everyone needs to, even if you get your dick

359
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,980
like blown off or whatever, like you have no genitals

360
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,860
whatsoever, you still have like a little straw

361
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,960
like a catheter or whatever.

362
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Yeah, but you don't know that.

363
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,360
Well, I saw it in a movie in 2008.

364
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,860
What movie were you watching that had a P2?

365
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,400
I don't remember.

366
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
This was not a movie.

367
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
No, it's a movie.

368
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,700
It's one of those like movies.

369
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,940
You think videos are movies?

370
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
No, no, no.

371
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,140
It's a movie that came out in like 2008.

372
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,700
It was a comedy movie.

373
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,440
It's security camera footage and it's black and white.

374
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,640
And he's like, oh, it's a classic.

375
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,920
You know, like, like Sex Drive or like whatever those shitties,

376
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Forgetting Sir Marshall, one of those types of movies.

377
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,160
And the big reveal was that I think it was

378
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,260
it was one of the I think it was like one of the fat black dudes

379
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,960
that was always in those movies.

380
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,620
I forget what his name is.

381
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,460
Anthony Anderson. Could be.

382
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,400
And he pulls his pants down at the end and he's just got a nub with a tube in it.

383
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,800
And then I had to look it up to see if that's really what would happen.

384
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,880
And I don't know what movie it is.

385
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
I know for sure it happened.

386
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
It's real.

387
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,020
And if you don't have a dick, you still have to either.

388
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,680
Of course, you still have to pee.

389
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,780
There's the pee has to go somewhere.

390
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,680
Yeah, we have the gift of science.

391
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,680
I think for the sake of science, you should know your thing

392
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,180
and see if you pee yourself in the next science right now.

393
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,480
Yes, it's let me translate.

394
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Sometimes he said science, not science.

395
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,780
I heard science, too, and it took me.

396
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,040
But I'm smart enough to use context clues.

397
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,080
Yeah, anyways, you got another thing

398
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,520
and you got to see if you pay yourself.

399
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,980
Here's a funny one.

400
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,260
Elkay 99 made in Korea.

401
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,920
What's that L and K stand for?

402
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,460
Elkay last names of the scientists from Korea

403
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,560
who made it Elkay 90, I don't know what Elkay 99 is.

404
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,460
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.

405
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,420
Yeah, just think of think of two last names from Korea.

406
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,480
Little.

407
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,820
Uh-huh.

408
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,320
And Chris?

409
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Yeah.

410
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
You're 100% right.

411
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
What is LK99?

412
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,320
You don't follow science at all.

413
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Just tell me, is this an element?

414
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
What is this?

415
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,320
It's a metal, but it's not the point.

416
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
I just thought it was funny.

417
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Well, it needed some kind of, you were just saying, I thought maybe this was a band?

418
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
No, okay.

419
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
That would have made sense that they have.

420
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
It's like a big thing.

421
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
It's like the superconduction.

422
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
It's all over Twitter right now.

423
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
He's on r/science.

424
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
He's on r/science.

425
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Rex is looking up some nerd shit on Twitter everyday.

426
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
But I just think it's funny that they're like,

427
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
"Dude, this is all over Twitter."

428
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
The two best scientists in Korea,

429
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
their last names are Lee and Kim.

430
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Ten minutes before recording.

431
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Twitter search bar "science".

432
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
See what comes up.

433
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Alright, you guys are

434
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
so not smart, so cool,

435
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
because you don't know anything.

436
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Yeah, we are cool.

437
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,640
Yeah, we are cool.

438
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
We are cool 'cause we don't know anything.

439
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,240
Yup, uh-huh.

440
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,800
And you're lame because you know stuff, yeah.

441
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,640
Yeah. This is how the world works.

442
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
I'm not fucking gay, I look, I know.

443
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,800
Whoa! Bullshit.

444
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,560
We did not say G-A-Y.

445
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,240
You brought the gay thing into it,

446
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,080
but now that you say it,

447
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,440
yeah, you could be gay for that, I don't know.

448
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,600
(laughs)

449
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
I don't know what gay, I mean, you know,

450
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,320
you know what I was thinking?

451
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,960
They should change, instead of, you know,

452
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,960
you say you're queer, I'm LGBT, I'm this, I'm that, right?

453
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,240
They should just change it to just weird.

454
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,400
- Well, that's what queer means.

455
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,320
- Yeah, I feel like that's what queer is supposed to mean.

456
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,320
- Yeah, but I grew up in the early 1990s, late '80s,

457
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,960
or 1980s, where that meant a whole different thing.

458
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I wanted to just be like, oh, excuse me,

459
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm actually weird, like that kind of thing.

460
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,680
- You know, gay means happy.

461
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,840
What kind of scenario?

462
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,340
What?

463
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,280
What kind of scenario are you going, "Oh, excuse me, I'm weird"?

464
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,200
Excuse me, are you sexually weird?

465
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,240
Yeah.

466
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,720
Like this is a place for weird guys to hang out.

467
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,800
Is this a weird friendly bar?

468
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,760
You know, like I like that more because also it's a little more inclusive.

469
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
It might even include...

470
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,640
How about friendly?

471
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,480
I think that's a great word for gay people.

472
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,800
Friendly is an amazing...

473
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,160
Yeah.

474
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,480
Yeah.

475
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,360
I don't feel...

476
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
You know, friendly.

477
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,060
Friendly. Yes, this is good.

478
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,460
Yeah. Weird is a little bit.

479
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,000
You're right. Weird is already is still got a little bit of a negative connotation.

480
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
Friendly. Ain't nothing wrong with some some guy who's so friendly that'll,

481
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,740
you know, tug on your puberty.

482
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,940
Too happy. We just use chipper.

483
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,860
Chipper does sound like you're calling somebody

484
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,900
like then people would say, like, oh, he's a chipper, you know?

485
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,540
You don't want to say that.

486
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,240
Yeah, those damn chips.

487
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,180
Yeah, I don't want that to be. Yeah.

488
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,940
What are you controlling there, Juvia?

489
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,880
I think half of my power just went out.

490
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,040
Well, it was the correct half then.

491
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,320
Yeah. You're still with us.

492
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,940
I'm still here, thankfully.

493
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,980
But not to get really hot in here.

494
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,280
That's OK. For me, it's fine.

495
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,560
Yeah. You're wearing a hoodie in August, man.

496
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,600
Because I feel sick and I have a kind of a girlish urge

497
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,560
to wear hoodies when I feel bad.

498
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Right, hang on. We're gonna...

499
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
I do like to sweat out illness.

500
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,600
We're gonna step all the way back.

501
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,100
Caleb is finally back from his two-month hiatus.

502
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Yeah.

503
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,100
He's been off Twitter, off online, off everything.

504
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,100
And he's finally back and he...

505
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,100
You became a complete musician and you look like one now.

506
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Yeah.

507
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
I did become a musician.

508
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
He's an MC.

509
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,100
We're already over this on the other podcasts that I do.

510
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
We don't have to bring up...

511
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
I don't listen to that bullshit.

512
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,940
- Bullshit.

513
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,160
- Talented on every fucking thing.

514
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,540
Oh my God, you're so talented.

515
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,880
Why don't you talk about it on this show?

516
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,980
Didn't talk about it on this show.

517
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,640
Dude, leave me the fuck alone.

518
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,900
I need some time to come up with music.

519
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,560
- All right. - I did go golfing.

520
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,160
- What are you doing with your last three days alive?

521
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,140
- What?

522
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,980
- That is some epic shit.

523
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,700
- I forgot about that.

524
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,180
- I literally, I regret every single thing I have ever,

525
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,660
literally my life is so bad, man.

526
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,320
My life is so fucking bad.

527
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:14,840
the

528
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,840
I thought that's the thing.

529
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,180
That's the bullet is.

530
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,040
Yeah, the bullet gets into his apartment from outside from outside.

531
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,880
And you have to leave the apartment.

532
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,680
You have to go on.

533
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,040
All day.

534
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,180
I remember posting that tweet and literally thinking like, I'll be dead by then.

535
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,580
Even if there's no, you know, I was like, oh, this would be funny.

536
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,680
But oh, wait, 2023, I'll be dead.

537
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,540
Yeah. Yeah.

538
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,380
It's so soon after you posted the tweet.

539
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,320
When did you make that?

540
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,420
like two years ago to 2020 I think three years ago.

541
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,560
Yeah.

542
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,220
It feels like every time you post something a month after,

543
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,180
you're like, I completely hate that.

544
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,280
Well, yeah, that's what it means to be good at using Twitter.

545
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,920
I mean, that's what I think any that's what it is with anything I do.

546
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,280
By the way, I love it.

547
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,480
I love that it's called X.

548
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,620
I'm fully on board with X.

549
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,980
This is cool.

550
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,420
Yes.

551
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,560
Do Twitter is such a stupid name and tweeting.

552
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,440
I'm every every name. I feel like anytime a new

553
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,460
App comes out that gets really popular. I'm like amazed at how bad the name is

554
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,160
You know like I like tick red has like the worst name and branding

555
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,880
but it's the biggest thing and I I feel like

556
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,760
But I it's just come not used to them. I guess like I was thinking about YouTube yesterday

557
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,880
I was like that is such a terrible name for a website. Yeah

558
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
YouTube.

559
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,280
Well, it was because it was, it used to be like a, like an old like tube TV, right?

560
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
The app icon.

561
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
It's all about that.

562
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
You were in the TV.

563
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,000
You think they came up with the icon before the name?

564
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I think they did.

565
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No, I don't think that.

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You think they saw the, someone made them an icon and they created an entire app and

567
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
website around it?

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
No, I'm just saying that's what we really do.

569
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's a TV.

570
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You're in TV.

571
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's your TV.

572
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,420
- If we did this podcast in 2008,

573
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,620
do you think we would be on the front page of YouTube?

574
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,460
- Yeah.

575
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,860
Well, first of all, we would have invented podcasts,

576
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,760
so we would have gotten a Nobel Prize.

577
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,340
- Do you think we could have,

578
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,060
do you think that us three could have,

579
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,280
in an alternate, do you think there is an alternate reality

580
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,220
where us three are maybe a decade older

581
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,980
and we become the Vlogbrothers?

582
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,660
- Ah, yes, I do think so.

583
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,500
I think that is really dangerously close to happening.

584
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,340
I think with Rex--

585
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,860
Us three becoming vlog brothers?

586
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,460
Yeah, I think with Rex coming up there,

587
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,300
you guys are gonna start getting an actual crew together

588
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,700
and you will become-- And then what, vlogging?

589
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,460
Semi-vlog, yeah, you're gonna start vlogging as well.

590
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,060
We need to get-- What would I vlog?

591
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,480
What is there even to vlog anymore?

592
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,660
Yeah, nobody does anything anymore.

593
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,060
People love it when you vlog doing nothing.

594
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,580
It's not like Casey Neistat

595
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,500
is flying drones for Manhattan.

596
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,980
- Is that what he's saying?

597
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,260
- I don't know, he's too ugly for me to watch.

598
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,220
He always has, when he was getting big and giant.

599
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,420
Casey Neistat, are you kidding me, man?

600
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,500
He makes all, he's just like a guy

601
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,380
who makes videos about him biking around.

602
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,340
- South African guy who--

603
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,660
- He's not South African.

604
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,040
- He's South African and he served in the IDF.

605
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,220
- This is not true.

606
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,800
He's just a very, very ugly guy.

607
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,740
- No, that would make sense,

608
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,900
South African serving in the IDF?

609
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,980
- That's what he did.

610
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,820
- Really?

611
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,660
- He did, yeah.

612
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,740
- I didn't know he's South African.

613
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,380
He has a completely American accent.

614
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,580
- He has lived here for a while.

615
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,740
- Cool American, Americans are so cool, man.

616
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,140
But he looks like a tiki mask.

617
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,600
He looks so fucked up.

618
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,620
His cheeks are in the wrong position always.

619
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,500
- That's why he's always wearing sunglasses.

620
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,340
- Do you guys remember,

621
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,700
did you guys ever have a Ripley's Believe It or Not book?

622
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,540
Growing up?

623
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,380
Uh-huh.

624
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,460
Do you remember the guy who could put his bottom lip

625
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,740
over his nose?

626
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,780
Yep. I do remember that, yeah.

627
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,120
He looks like that guy.

628
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,380
But his lip is underneath his lip.

629
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,620
Mm.

630
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,100
So it's like, what's your deal, bro?

631
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,700
What kind of world record are you breaking?

632
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,220
Wait, what are you talking about?

633
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,060
His lip is under his lip.

634
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,220
World's most famous ugly guy.

635
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,400
I had a, that guy, that guy actually used to really scare me

636
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,820
when I was a kid, the guy who could put his lip,

637
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,060
I remember that was probably the first time I was ever like actually terrified as a child,

638
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,740
like really, really terrified.

639
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,620
And then I told my mom that and she said, don't worry, he's not real.

640
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,420
And then my older brother told me he was like, like whispered in my ear.

641
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
He was like, he's real.

642
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,900
And it made me so fucking scared.

643
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,100
I was so scared of the lip over the nose guy.

644
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,340
Well, isn't the point of Ripley's Believe It or Not is that you're supposed to believe

645
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
it.

646
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Did you think it was going to get you?

647
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,540
you? Or you was going to break into your house and get you?

648
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Honestly, I think now, because I've seen it now in color and it's really not

649
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,740
that scary, but in the book it was in black and white.

650
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,260
Right.

651
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,700
And that made it way scarier.

652
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,760
Right.

653
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,820
First thing that ever frightened me, Courage the Cowardly Dog.

654
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,620
Oh my God.

655
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,220
This guy.

656
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,780
Yeah.

657
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,100
Whatever his name is.

658
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,460
Fred.

659
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:16,740
Yeah.

660
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,300
Yep.

661
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,780
Wait, what guy?

662
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,220
Did he?

663
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,500
It's just a smiling guy.

664
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,220
Yeah.

665
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,860
That guy.

666
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:31,400
I don't know what really you know what really scary knows what's good the movie signs.

667
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,900
It's really shitty science.

668
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:45,500
Science okay yes i know yeah when he walks in the alien walks in the background of the birthday party yeah that was a scary fucking movie.

669
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,800
Yeah that's a scary movie to watch when you're like 10 years old.

670
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,360
Yeah, I remember I was so scared of even the idea of this one movie called Darkness Falls.

671
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,560
You ever heard of this movie?

672
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
No.

673
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,360
It's a movie about an evil tooth fairy.

674
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,060
And I was so scared of the cover that my brother brought it home from Blockbuster.

675
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:16,560
And I was so scared of the cover being like out on the living room table that I hid the DVD somewhere so that like nobody could find it and use it.

676
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,560
And my brother ended up having to probably pay $25 for that DVD because I hit it.

677
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Did you ever see that movie? It's like, it's called like Cabin in the Woods or something.

678
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,560
And it's like, it's like a worm. It's like a bloody movie.

679
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Do you know what I'm talking about? Cabin in the Woods is a, is a Joss Whedon movie, I think.

680
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Okay, well, we're talking about in like 2012. No, this would have been before that.

681
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,640
So you're talking about a movie where there's a calvin in the woods.

682
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,940
There's like a maybe it's a snake some sort of eel like creature with teeth.

683
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,440
Anaconda.

684
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
Not anaconda.

685
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Tremors.

686
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,080
I honestly have, I don't know anything.

687
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,080
I, I, movies elude me.

688
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Movies is to us what science is to you.

689
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,320
We love movies and we look up movie facts all day every day.

690
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,820
We love that shit.

691
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,700
Movie check right now movie check movie corner. What's the last movie you watched? I watched talk to me

692
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,740
Are you again already talked about it on the other podcast, but it was a great movie

693
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,080
I recommend anybody go see this in the a 24 style a

694
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,620
24 movie in theaters. It's about a scary Australian

695
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:32,120
Demon-esque kind of life that some people live Rex

696
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,500
That like movie with Jennifer Lawrence that came out recently you saw

697
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,200
Don't come for me or whatever. It's called. What's it called?

698
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,800
No, it's called fuck it's called like it's called like I'm miss Lawrence I missed the G

699
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,140
It's like a double entendre. I guess that wouldn't be a double entendre, but it's called something

700
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,260
Don't come in me don't come it's I think it might actually be called don't come

701
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,700
No, no, it's literally called like get hard on me or I'm gonna make you hard

702
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:15,640
I looked it up, but it's only in Spanish in my on my Google. What's it called? It's called as a male forward in Spanish

703
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,180
Come for me, please

704
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,220
Sorry, yeah, do whatever

705
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,340
It no, it's guys we have to get this no hard feelings. That's what it is

706
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,900
No hard feelings. That's and do you understand the joke that they're making?

707
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
I didn't. Not really.

708
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Like, this little kid

709
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,140
that she's trying to fuck

710
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,140
he does not have any

711
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
hard feelings for this

712
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,140
human. He numbed his thing

713
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
He numbed his thing with Tiger Balm.

714
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
He comes in the movie. There's no

715
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,140
hard feelings. What? But not until

716
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
the second part of the movie.

717
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Wait, you also watch this?

718
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Or are you making this up?

719
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
I think you're making this up.

720
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,140
Did she suck him

721
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:07,140
him off? No, no, he tries to fuck her and he just fucks her leg and then like nuts on her.

722
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Yo! That's a beast. Does she fall in love with him? Yeah. Really? That is so sweet. Is this

723
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,820
just like a remake of that one movie where they make a girl like fall in love with like

724
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:25,820
some like fail song guy? Basically, yeah. Oh, okay. Remember that movie? Failure to Lunch?

725
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,340
- Oh, failure to lunch?

726
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,900
- To lunch.

727
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,740
- Failure to lunch. - Failure to lunch.

728
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,700
- Is that McConaughey?

729
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,720
- No, it's Hugh Grant.

730
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,340
- Oh, dude, who's gonna fuck Hugh Grant?

731
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,540
- That's not Hugh Grant.

732
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,720
- I think that is McConaughey. - That's crazy.

733
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,260
It's McConaughey.

734
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,420
- How is McConaughey a failure to lunch?

735
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,420
- He's just in with the parents.

736
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,340
- He's, go be a movie star.

737
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,380
That's why that movie Pursuit of Happiness sucks so much ass.

738
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,180
- Yeah, you're Will Smith.

739
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,540
You're a millionaire.

740
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,540
- Rap, dance, act, do it all.

741
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,460
You're, oh, oh, I'm so poor

742
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,100
because I'm such a triple threat.

743
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,460
- Dude, Men in Black-- - Suck my dick.

744
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,860
- It's so good still.

745
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,820
It's so, so, so good. - Men in Black is fucking good.

746
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,660
- It's so funny. - Men in Black is good.

747
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,500
- Wild Wild West.

748
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,660
- Wild, I was just about to say, Wild Wild West is good

749
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,280
because, okay, Whitey doesn't know what boobs feel like.

750
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,380
You know that scene?

751
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,440
Whitey doesn't know what boobs feel like, but holy crap,

752
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,020
as Will Smith felt lots of lots of breasts

753
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,340
in this Wild Wild West.

754
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,860
- I haven't seen the movie in a long ass time.

755
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,860
I think I'm gonna watch it again.

756
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,660
- It's amazing, there's a spider at the end.

757
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,420
- Yeah, I do remember the spider.

758
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,660
The last movie I watched was Barbie.

759
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,860
- I saw Barbie as well. - I went to the theaters

760
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,300
and I saw Barbie, what do you think?

761
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,900
- Thought it was fun, man.

762
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,020
I thought it was fun.

763
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,740
- I refuse to see it because it's against the patriarchy.

764
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,500
- It is definitely against the patriarchy.

765
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,500
But there was a scene where the mom--

766
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,220
- Half of the movie is pro-patriarchy actually.

767
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,980
You just gotta pay attention to half of the movie

768
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,380
and then start suing everything out.

769
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,060
- I guess you're right, it depends on how you take

770
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,540
all the canned parts. - Yeah, it's your POV.

771
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,100
- But for most guys it'll be like,

772
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,500
well, this is sick as fuck. - I'm doing a meninist critique.

773
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,360
- It is a little bit like they leave the men behind

774
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,400
at the end, which is sadly very true

775
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,400
to what's happening these days in American country.

776
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,600
But I, fuck, what was my point about this movie?

777
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,240
Oh, I didn't have a point, but the part where the mom

778
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,720
is kind of monologuing about how hard it is to be a woman,

779
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,220
I honestly was like, that sounds fucking hard.

780
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,240
That sounds really hard.

781
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,720
I had never really thought about it.

782
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,960
And they have to be women on top of it.

783
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,560
It's really hard.

784
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,200
Yeah, I mean, okay, so you have to be a mom.

785
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,280
But she says like, you have to make them happy,

786
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,580
but you also have to not be like a whore.

787
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,100
You have to be like career driven,

788
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,940
but not be like too much like a man, you know?

789
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,760
And so you have to do all this stuff.

790
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,800
You gotta be soft, but you gotta be hard as well.

791
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,640
Yeah, meanwhile--

792
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,760
Meanwhile, you're a fucking pussy.

793
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,480
Yeah, but also-- It bleeds.

794
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,480
You're doing all, yeah, so you have this horrible affliction,

795
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,160
you have your period and all this shit.

796
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,920
You have to do all this shit, this and that and that.

797
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,740
It's all so hard.

798
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,880
And then on top of that, you're stupid.

799
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
- Yeah. - True.

800
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,960
- So it's like, you can't win, you know?

801
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,800
Like that stuff would be hard for a man.

802
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,400
How hard is it for a woman?

803
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,800
- How do you feel about the ending?

804
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,060
The last little montage they did.

805
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,500
I don't remember any movie that I've seen.

806
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,780
If it didn't scare me, I don't remember it.

807
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,220
- Okay, nevermind then.

808
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,540
- Oh, that was my only point about "Talk to Me".

809
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,800
Too much blood.

810
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,900
I don't need to see blood.

811
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,140
I would like for there to be bloodless options

812
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,020
for gory movies. - I think you shouldn't watch,

813
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,060
I think they should ban watching horror movies

814
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,340
during summer.

815
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,780
I think summer is no horror movie.

816
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,980
- It's too hot.

817
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,900
- There's no place for it.

818
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,700
- But that's like when you're like,

819
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Oh, it's a summer night and I have a cute girl that I'm--

820
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,540
- Yeah, we're gonna go watch Oppenheimer

821
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,980
and watch a guy drop a bomb.

822
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,420
- I almost don't even wanna see Oppenheimer

823
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,900
'cause I know I'll become so obsessed with it

824
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,980
and pattern my life around it.

825
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,280
My dog just walked in, it's not allowed.

826
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,340
That's what scares me about watching that movie.

827
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,740
- That movie is too long to watch in a movie theater.

828
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,660
- I also thought that.

829
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,140
I think two hours is my maximum.

830
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,980
- Yeah.

831
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,980
I'm pulling my phone out, I'm watching TikToks, I'm pausing the movie 11 times.

832
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
You think Oppenheimer is complete shit?

833
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,980
No, I think the movie theater experience is complete shit.

834
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:00,980
I did have some pretty god awful nachos over watching Barbie in Atascadero.

835
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,980
The seat fucking is so uncomfortable and I was sitting next to a guy that was just,

836
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,980
he was just like, the movie hadn't even started and he was just like

837
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,980
all what he have through his popcorn, he was making so much noise.

838
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,840
noise that's what I do I have my snacks

839
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,000
but I'm not sure previews are over right

840
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,780
I'm getting a 92 ounce diet coke I'm

841
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,520
getting the largest popcorn yeah okay

842
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
okay Julio when was the last time that

843
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,100
it took you two hours to eat 20 skittles

844
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,220
I don't I don't it's only in a movie

845
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,920
I don't get skittles what the fuck what

846
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,580
do you get in that it takes all my

847
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,340
hours to eat it yeah it's getting 11

848
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,020
mangoes covered in tahini yeah don't

849
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,420
Tell me that you cut one of these people who sits there and you eat one

850
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,820
you eat one fucking crunch cluster every 10 minutes and you like time it out

851
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
so that you'd have one at the end of the movie.

852
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,620
No, I don't do that.

853
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,820
Just eat the fucking food!

854
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,020
I don't do that.

855
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,820
It's meant to give you just enough energy to get through the movie without needing dinner.

856
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,220
Yeah, I'll eat an 18 ounce steak in 10 minutes.

857
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,220
I'm not gonna fucking save my...

858
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,620
A nerd's rope I'm gonna go through way faster than that, man.

859
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,160
Yeah, I went to when I when I saw the Jennifer Lawrence,

860
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
no hard feelings.

861
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,120
I stood in line for 30 minutes.

862
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,160
OK, I got the largest like the tub of popcorn.

863
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,260
Yeah, I got the 60 ounce Diet Coke.

864
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,500
And I got into that movie, drink the whole Diet Coke,

865
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,720
immediately had to go pee.

866
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,680
It'll do that, man. Yeah,

867
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,980
it will fucking do that.

868
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,280
Drinking a ton of liquid will make you piss.

869
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,380
I was having shit attacks during every movie that I saw

870
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,280
where I think when I was watching Talk to Me, maybe I was too scared.

871
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,040
But I shit my I shit myself.

872
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
I shit yourself.

873
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,380
I know I shit the toilet three times.

874
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,380
And every time I came back, my brother was like,

875
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,380
you missed the only scary part of the whole movie.

876
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,740
Your body, I guess.

877
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,140
I was hitting the eject button.

878
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,320
Yeah, as soon as I as soon as that music started,

879
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,580
Either the music starts creeping up or it or it get.

880
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,720
Oh man, I don't want to go too far into it,

881
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,680
but I have been shitting like the the like Fritos

882
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,420
honey barbecue twists is what like all of my shits have been like recently.

883
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,300
But I don't want to get too far into it.

884
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,060
Moving through your hot dog with me shit so bad, let's be for it.

885
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,160
Yeah, I'm not.

886
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,140
I'm not fucking getting a hot dog anywhere,

887
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,540
but a baseball stadium is like, yeah, insane to me.

888
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,940
Or Five Guys.

889
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,440
I disagree.

890
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,580
I like the Five Guys hot dog.

891
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,440
I disagree with this.

892
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,020
Hot dogs are not so good for you.

893
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,640
I know, but I disagree.

894
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,880
They're on the lower end of healthy foods.

895
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
There's a...

896
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,880
[laughter]

897
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,040
There's a place in my apartment that's just like a guy just making hot dogs.

898
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,840
There's like a little cabin near these like other places and they're so good.

899
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,340
There's not...

900
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,380
It's kind of funny because right near my house,

901
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,180
There's a guy that makes tacos and burritos and shit like that.

902
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,380
So it's kind of like a weird guy.

903
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,220
That'd be funny.

904
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,320
That would be funny if Julio has an American guy who makes hot dogs right outside

905
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,580
his apartment, like a little cart.

906
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,520
You know, there's actually a little car.

907
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
It's like a Ferrari that he's making it out of.

908
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,220
Yeah. Yeah.

909
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,920
Meanwhile, right on my street corner, there's a guy with a bunch of fruit.

910
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,780
It's tahini.

911
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,180
And then a guy with making birria outside.

912
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,580
I wish that guy was inside my apartment.

913
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,120
I do think Mexican food is probably 25% better if you eat it outside.

914
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,160
Yeah. Well, it's made to be eaten while you're outside.

915
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,220
Yeah, you should be.

916
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,880
You're supposed to eat it with your hands and standing.

917
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,100
You're supposed to be standing up.

918
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,960
There's supposed to be a bunch of like cars just

919
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,020
like just putting up a bunch of like dust on your on your shit.

920
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,300
Yeah, I get really dirty.

921
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,860
Yeah, that sounds amazing.

922
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,460
That's a good ass taco right there.

923
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,960
Yeah, yeah, it's a hot.

924
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,060
The dust taco.

925
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,360
The dust taco does not sound that good to me.

926
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,960
If I'm going to be honest, I do not think I would eat the dust

927
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,460
taco.

928
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,560
I would probably get an al pastor if it was on the menu.

929
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,860
I think I'm going to stop eating pork to it starting to kind

930
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,660
of disgust me.

931
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,460
Really?

932
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,360
Why how much pork are you eating?

933
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,160
Not much.

934
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,460
I've never eaten much, but I think I might completely cut it

935
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:23,860
out.

936
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:29,660
Okay, but it's just so it's weird, right?

937
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,620
Am I wrong about that?

938
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,160
I think pork is one of those things that I eat so little,

939
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,540
or like not so often that I don't care about it at all.

940
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,680
I feel like pork, I would almost put in the same vein as like lamb and veal,

941
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,220
where there's like, it's like the act of,

942
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,780
of like making pork happen just makes me kind of bummed.

943
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,500
I'm not sure I can eat it. And also it's like the,

944
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,740
I do think that like the, like, um,

945
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,740
What do they call that?

946
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,740
Halal is on to some things.

947
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,740
Like pork is nasty.

948
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,740
They eat shit. They eat their own shit.

949
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,740
They don't sweat.

950
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,740
Yeah, but it's so cheap.

951
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,740
I used to eat a lot of pork when it was really cheap.

952
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,740
When I was really cheap.

953
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,740
I would get some pork every two or three weeks.

954
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,420
- Pork is very yummy, but I definitely would not eat it

955
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,900
that often.

956
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,700
- I think the only time I would be like,

957
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,940
mm, yummy pork, is when I'm getting chicharron.

958
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,620
- I also don't like their skin.

959
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,900
I do love, that's the thing,

960
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,900
I recently got into chicharron and pork rides.

961
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,940
- Bro, I'm gonna change your life.

962
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,760
- Goddamn that, that is good.

963
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,060
- I'm gonna change your life.

964
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,740
As soon as you get your damn passport

965
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,700
and you get your ass down here,

966
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,820
I'm gonna change your fucking life.

967
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,020
- What are you gonna do to me?

968
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,940
- I'm gonna turn you into a complete Mexican.

969
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,620
You're gonna be a complete gringo walking around like,

970
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,320
"Yo, can I get a kilo of tortillas, please,

971
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,820
"at the Bodega?"

972
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,060
You're gonna change. - A kilo?

973
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,580
- Yeah, that's what you're gonna say.

974
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,140
- Whoa.

975
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,300
- You're gonna turn completely upside down.

976
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,580
- Do you think I could be a loco gringo?

977
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,060
- Yes, 100%.

978
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,840
I think you would love it.

979
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,060
- I think I could be too.

980
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,660
My brother's a loco gringo.

981
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,940
My older brother. - But he's in LA.

982
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,740
- What, you want him to fucking move to Mexico, man?

983
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,220
- It's fucking shit there.

984
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,440
- No, you can be a loco gringo in LA.

985
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,300
- Whoa, that is--

986
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,060
- I'm pretty sure you can.

987
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,860
- You could definitely be a loco gringo.

988
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,580
He's marrying into the, he's getting married in Mexico.

989
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,420
- Is he?

990
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,340
- Yeah, what is more loco gringo than that?

991
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,780
- Can I come?

992
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,220
- Yes, dude.

993
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,060
- Okay.

994
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,880
- It's a fucking Mexican wedding.

995
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,920
There's gonna be 50,000 people there.

996
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,740
- All right, he's a loco gringo actually.

997
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,340
- Dude, he's a complete loco gringo.

998
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,540
- I think you have to upstage him.

999
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,260
I think you have to move to like Mexico City.

1000
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,580
Oh, dude.

1001
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,360
What did we decide it's called?

1002
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,220
What?

1003
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,040
It's not El Jefe.

1004
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,140
Oh.

1005
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,700
I forgot, I forgot what it was.

1006
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,460
But it's got another nickname.

1007
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,300
Yeah.

1008
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,120
It's got a different nickname.

1009
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,500
I would move there, man.

1010
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,220
It's cheap and everyone there is like just white guys now.

1011
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,060
Yeah, pretty much.

1012
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,500
There's so many YouTube videos that are like,

1013
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,500
I moved into a six-bedroom apartment in Mexico City

1014
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,600
that used to belong to a family for 200 years

1015
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,860
and I only pay 300 bucks a month for it.

1016
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,700
Yeah.

1017
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,420
And it's just, I do love those videos

1018
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,900
where people move to a country

1019
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,740
that is not an English-speaking country

1020
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,820
and they just walk around there like,

1021
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,420
"Look how cheap everything is.

1022
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,100
"Oh my God, I'm gonna buy all of it."

1023
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,140
I think I saw a video yesterday

1024
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,900
talking about how Mexico has the most

1025
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,540
digital nomads type of people.

1026
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,040
And I think Mexico City specifically.

1027
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,900
They have like so many of their like higher end

1028
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,980
like living type of like places.

1029
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,380
They're just completely full of like gringos.

1030
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,280
- I feel like if you do that,

1031
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,580
you're just setting yourself up

1032
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,040
to eventually be taken hostage.

1033
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,880
- I think that's true.

1034
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,280
- That's why you get an air tag implanted in you

1035
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,420
or just one.

1036
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,580
- And also that's why you still move to Mexico City

1037
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,300
and you move to my city.

1038
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,140
- Your city-- - Where you just get

1039
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,060
a big ass house.

1040
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,100
- Dude, I don't want a big ass house, bro.

1041
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,120
I want--

1042
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,120
- You don't want a Rancho, man?

1043
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,700
- I wanna wake up every single day

1044
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,620
and see the fucking Empire State Building.

1045
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,100
You don't understand how powerful that is

1046
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,980
for somebody who's 17 and a half percent Italian.

1047
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,100
- I don't-- - That is like--

1048
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,140
- I don't think your, I think your apartment

1049
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,100
is like half windows, and I don't think the view,

1050
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,420
I don't think you have a view.

1051
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,980
You have big ass windows-- - Oh, okay.

1052
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,680
Have you ever been on a submarine?

1053
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,460
- No.

1054
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,840
Do you know of submarines?

1055
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,640
Are you familiar with their anatomy?

1056
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,840
I am, yeah.

1057
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,200
So you might be familiar with a little invention

1058
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,680
called a looker that they put in submarines

1059
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,580
that comes out and it can look in any angle.

1060
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,600
Wait, you have a look in your apartment?

1061
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,200
No, but I'm saving up for one.

1062
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,480
Yeah, I think you have a complete crap view.

1063
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,760
I have a nice view.

1064
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,640
I look at my, let's see, if you look out of my windows,

1065
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,440
You see a parking lot to another apartment.

1066
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,440
Yeah.

1067
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,440
And you see there's a flight line for people flying into LaGuardia.

1068
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Yeah.

1069
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
So I can see some planes.

1070
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,440
I think I can show you my view.

1071
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
I want to see.

1072
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
Don't tell me you see a mountain.

1073
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
Rex, talk about your view.

1074
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,040
Rex has a kind of nice view, but it's just water.

1075
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,040
That's usually as good as views get.

1076
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,040
Okay.

1077
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,800
No, as good as views get is water contextualized.

1078
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,480
It might as well be an aquarium that I'm looking into when I look out of your window.

1079
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,120
I want to see some beach.

1080
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:56,000
That's true, you can't see the beach, but you do see boats, which are cool.

1081
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,340
You could tape that to a window.

1082
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,840
That could be not real for all I know.

1083
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,760
Alright, show me your view.

1084
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,760
Holy shit!

1085
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,660
That's my view.

1086
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,240
That is an amazing view.

1087
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,240
I said fucking out.

1088
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,040
What the hell, you live in paradise.

1089
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,040
I had no idea.

1090
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,360
Yeah, and he pays $17 a month for that apartment.

1091
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,880
How much do you pay for rent?

1092
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,920
I think like, I think it comes to like less than $200.

1093
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,120
Oh my God, man.

1094
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,920
And you get to look at mountains and a building?

1095
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,920
Yeah.

1096
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,960
God, we need to move this whole operation to Mexico.

1097
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,960
Yeah.

1098
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,280
That'd be funny if as soon as Rex moves to New York, everybody here moves to Mexico.

1099
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:48,800
I'd be pissed. Yeah. I'd be pissed. I'd have to fucking live in Mexico. That'd suck.

1100
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,440
We'll all go together. We'll get a literal castle. I think Cal has the most,

1101
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,560
has the life that can be just upended the easiest. Because you own like two

1102
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,840
things. Yeah but imagine. You live in a shoebox and you own two things. But what if I was doing, like

1103
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,600
trying to do stand up in Mexico?

1104
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,000
Uh, we could do that.

1105
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,880
Do you think I would crush?

1106
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,160
Yeah, I could be like a guy who doesn't know any people in here.

1107
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,080
English type comedian.

1108
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,480
Completely love pretending that they're like from Texas.

1109
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,800
Like they're just like, Oh, that's so me, the U S so they just like, they just eat

1110
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,200
any, anything up that's from the U S or like, yeah, people, Popeye's is about to

1111
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,840
come back.

1112
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,920
If you love eating chicharrones, you might be a local gringo.

1113
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,680
You are a complete local gringo.

1114
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,780
You're your Loco Gringo in the making.

1115
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,440
Yeah.

1116
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,980
Maybe that could even be my stage name.

1117
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,640
Loco Gringo.

1118
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,840
Do you guys have a Mexico's Got Talent?

1119
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,340
Uh...

1120
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,280
Or Mexican Idol?

1121
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,040
I don't...

1122
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,440
No.

1123
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,940
Or a Mexican Ninja Warrior?

1124
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,740
I'd watch that.

1125
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,640
Uh, I don't think so,

1126
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,480
but I think you can make it through the ranks.

1127
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,340
I think I could do it.

1128
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,280
I think I could go and start over in Mexico.

1129
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,940
See what's working for me.

1130
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,240
Listen.

1131
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,880
You don't have to do anything rash,

1132
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,120
Especially with Rex moving there.

1133
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,560
He just barely, he hasn't even moved

1134
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,960
and you're already leaving him behind.

1135
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,680
- Yeah, I don't think, even if,

1136
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,320
I think it would be pretty much a 0% chance

1137
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,760
I could convince my wife to move to Mexico.

1138
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,560
I don't think that's happening.

1139
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,400
- I think it's, I think it could happen.

1140
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,080
- No, I don't think so, man.

1141
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,400
I'm gonna be real with you.

1142
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,240
I think she'd be a prime beheading kind of person.

1143
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,040
She's got a really small neck.

1144
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,080
I think it'd be, she'd pretty much get, you know,

1145
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,400
done like a goose.

1146
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,240
- There's no one getting beheaded anywhere in the country.

1147
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,000
- They'd split her head between two kidnappers

1148
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,840
like a wishbone.

1149
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,800
- Y'all, I'd like to give out three Pinocchios

1150
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
to Mr. Julio who just said,

1151
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,040
"There's nobody getting beheaded in Mexico!"

1152
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,280
(laughing)

1153
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,520
(blows raspberry)

1154
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,080
Yep, three Pinocchios for you.

1155
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1156
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,120
That's complete bullshit.

1157
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,200
That's completely fake news.

1158
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,840
People find heads on the it's like finding a dollar.

1159
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,440
It's kind of rare, but it happens.

1160
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,800
People, there's more people getting shot and beheaded in New York.

1161
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,280
Every single, nobody gets beheaded in New York.

1162
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,520
They get shot.

1163
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,200
They get, they get, they get shot.

1164
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
Yeah.

1165
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,320
Anything you can imagine, but nobody's going as far as beheading.

1166
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,280
Listen, all I know is that Americans completely have their, their

1167
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,640
priorities, completely upside down.

1168
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,360
There's people shitting and doing drugs in the streets.

1169
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,080
Meanwhile, everyone's complaining about a little sign

1170
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,520
on top of the Twitter building.

1171
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,480
- Science.

1172
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,240
Okay, let's ask her right now.

1173
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,520
Would you move to Mexico?

1174
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:45,480
She looks disgusted.

1175
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,940
She's using her finger to make a gagging motion.

1176
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,080
Oh God, what are you doing with your eyes?

1177
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,920
Stop.

1178
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,480
It's not even the right country.

1179
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,420
No, I'm kidding.

1180
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,360
- You're not kidding.

1181
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,360
But she did say no.

1182
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,680
That's fine.

1183
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,880
That's fine.

1184
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,280
We'll just deal with her later.

1185
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,180
That sounds like you're going to

1186
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,180
behead her.

1187
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,200
Me and my primos.

1188
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,360
You're going to deal with her later?

1189
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,360
You're going to fucking behead her.

1190
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1191
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,560
we're not making it, bro.

1192
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,800
No, no, no, no, no.

1193
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,800
It's not going to happen. It's not in the cards.

1194
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,640
No, it's fine. It's completely fine.

1195
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,920
I don't want to see any beheadings.

1196
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,980
And just knowing my luck.

1197
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,280
I just can't, if I was a luckier guy, I'd move to Mexico.

1198
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,040
(laughing)

1199
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,360
- Do you think as soon as you hop off the plane,

1200
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,480
we're gonna be driving into the city

1201
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,440
and you're gonna just look outside the car

1202
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,080
and just see someone get beheaded?

1203
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,880
- I think they're gonna have a razor wire limbo

1204
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,640
sitting at customs that I walk into

1205
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,880
'cause I'm so excited to be in a new country.

1206
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,960
- And you, yeah, you would just go right under it.

1207
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,280
- Maybe I see a chupacabra and I run, right?

1208
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,760
And I'm running full speed and then I cut my own head off.

1209
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,120
And now nobody's even going to jail.

1210
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,760
Not that you guys have prison there,

1211
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,740
but I'm just, there's no recourse.

1212
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,000
- Yeah. - Right.

1213
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,480
Okay, that's fine.

1214
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,320
That's okay.

1215
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,100
- Is weed legal in Mexico?

1216
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,860
- I think so.

1217
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,080
I'm not, I don't know.

1218
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,240
- Interesting.

1219
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,520
- Whoa.

1220
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,120
It's kinda cool he doesn't know.

1221
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,780
- I completely don't know.

1222
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,800
- He doesn't even care if it's a crime or not.

1223
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,640
He's still gonna--

1224
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,040
- Are you allowed to have guns in Mexico?

1225
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,000
- I think so.

1226
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,320
You don't know anything.

1227
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,440
How do you know?

1228
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,920
You can only get like hunting.

1229
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,480
That's a picture on your fucking window.

1230
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,800
Hunting gear.

1231
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,440
Yeah.

1232
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,000
What does that mean?

1233
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,200
I don't think you can just, can you go to Los Walmart?

1234
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,800
Wait, I think we looked this up the first time I was in New York.

1235
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,320
We're looking up a bunch of like gun guns for some reason, uh, kills apartment.

1236
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,080
Um, and I think the only way you can buy guns in Mexico, if you like buy them

1237
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,640
off, like the, the army specifically.

1238
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,880
Oh yeah, I remember that. Yeah.

1239
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,760
That's actually cool.

1240
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,120
It is kind of cool.

1241
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,040
The only way for you to get like killing people guns.

1242
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,000
You have to go.

1243
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,880
Any gun can kill people if you try hard enough.

1244
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,880
Those like little rifles.

1245
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,520
A water gun?

1246
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,360
Yeah.

1247
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,640
Yeah.

1248
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,480
It could drown you.

1249
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,280
That's not true.

1250
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,280
Cool bro.

1251
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,200
You could not drown me.

1252
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,400
You think you could drown me with a water gun?

1253
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,640
I could try.

1254
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,680
I mean, you can't.

1255
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,160
I mean.

1256
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,400
But then it's like, can we do that?

1257
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,440
Can we try that?

1258
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,760
As soon as Rex moves to New York,

1259
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,880
he tries to drown me with a wad.

1260
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,800
This is, how is this fun for me?

1261
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,200
- I think if I shot you in the back of the throat

1262
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,480
with a super soaker, like 11 times in a row.

1263
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,020
- I just drink it, asshole.

1264
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,080
- It would hurt.

1265
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,920
And then you'd cough.

1266
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,560
- It might hurt, I would drink it.

1267
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,040
- Yeah, you would cough and then--

1268
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,880
- Okay, here's my pressure.

1269
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,680
Okay, go ahead, say shoot and it'll be like you shot.

1270
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,520
- Shoot.

1271
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,360
(imitates gunshot)

1272
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,180
Shoot.

1273
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,020
(imitates gunshot)

1274
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,860
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

1275
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,380
- Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1276
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,940
- No, this is, no, you guys are so compulsive.

1277
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,880
- No, that's not what would happen.

1278
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,380
- That is not what happens.

1279
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,040
You know what you need?

1280
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,740
You need one of those electric water guns,

1281
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,140
the one that are all fucked up

1282
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:05,980
and they shoot at it at the same pressure.

1283
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,660
- Oh yeah, the ones that shoot like a buck shot.

1284
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,140
- Yeah.

1285
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,940
- Wait, Phil, do you have something to say?

1286
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,780
He tried to eat the microphone.

1287
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,620
(Phil laughs)

1288
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,580
Get out, get out, man.

1289
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,420
Go! - Thanks, Phil.

1290
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,100
- Go!

1291
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,940
What are you doing?

1292
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,060
Get out of the room!

1293
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,580
- I think you could completely drown him

1294
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,420
with a super soaker.

1295
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,260
- Yeah.

1296
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,100
- That's the other thing, dude.

1297
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,620
I put him in my backyard, right?

1298
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,820
What if he gets beheaded?

1299
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,820
- I think dogs rarely get beheaded.

1300
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,420
I think dogs kind of rule the world down here.

1301
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,860
- What if I get scared of him

1302
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,220
because I think that he's some,

1303
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,120
he's La Llorona or La Chupacabra,

1304
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,860
and I behead him.

1305
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,460
Now I'm part of the problem.

1306
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,580
- Listen, this is, you know what this is?

1307
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,740
This is all a bunch of white guilt, white prejudice.

1308
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,020
- Oh, you're right.

1309
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,700
- That will completely-- - I hate white prejudice.

1310
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,420
- Just dissipate-- - I'm being white guilty.

1311
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,940
- It'll completely dissipate

1312
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,040
as soon as you visit the country.

1313
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,660
I think you should stop dwelling on it.

1314
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,500
I think--

1315
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,860
- That's the other problem, bro.

1316
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,980
What if I go there

1317
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,780
and people start worshiping me like a king, right?

1318
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,860
And then I basically take over the entire country

1319
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,740
and do colonialism all over again.

1320
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,020
That'd be annoying.

1321
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,380
And now everybody's speaking Esperanto

1322
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,220
because that's what I choose to be,

1323
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,200
our national language. - You cannot be a king.

1324
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,480
You can't be a king. I couldn't be a king. I couldn't be a king my ass.

1325
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,780
Shut up. Perfect head for a crown. He did it. He shut up.

1326
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,560
When I said shut up, he was about to say something.

1327
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,080
He went, oh, and then stopped. I was about to say something.

1328
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,080
Very kingly of me to make commands that are followed.

1329
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,000
What would be your first command to your people?

1330
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,800
To get your bitch ass out of this country. That's what I would say.

1331
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,840
I'd say Julio has to go. He's exiled.

1332
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,120
I'd send you to that island that they put Napoleon on.

1333
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,920
But I actually, I would make it,

1334
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,960
I would put you on the island next to that one because Napoleon was such a great

1335
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,880
man that you don't deserve to walk on the same sand that he did.

1336
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,400
Is he good or bad?

1337
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,240
- Napoleon?

1338
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,040
- Is he supposed to be good or is he supposed to be bad?

1339
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,360
- I think there's no such thing as good and bad.

1340
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,840
- I think they only paid him in a bad light

1341
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,080
because he was short.

1342
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,920
- I agree.

1343
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,680
I fucking agree.

1344
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,400
If he was six foot two,

1345
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,880
they would not have called him

1346
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,840
all this nasty, disgusting stuff.

1347
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,200
- What bad sister are they calling Napoleon?

1348
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,560
- People only look up to Marx and the other guy from Cuba

1349
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,640
because they were over six feet tall.

1350
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,480
- Agree.

1351
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,120
- My new theory.

1352
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,880
That's an amazing theory.

1353
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,680
Tall men have it so easy in this world.

1354
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,520
Yeah.

1355
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,680
They have it so fucking easy.

1356
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,200
I mean, that's actually, that's not true.

1357
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,040
No, I haven't really--

1358
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,440
You have it so easy.

1359
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,480
You have it so--

1360
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,120
You just told us you pay $300 a month for rent, man.

1361
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,940
I think that's--

1362
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,560
You think your landlord would have given me that price?

1363
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,400
No fucking way.

1364
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,800
I think she wouldn't.

1365
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,080
I think she wouldn't rent to you.

1366
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,240
I think she would hate you.

1367
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,760
She sounds like a fucking bitch.

1368
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,200
But she is a bitch.

1369
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,580
So what if I said $310?

1370
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,040
Listen, you've never seen money like this lately.

1371
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,740
$310.

1372
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,140
You can easily take it.

1373
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:56,980
Yeah.

1374
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,220
I'm gonna get, actually, when's your lease up?

1375
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,120
December.

1376
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,960
Bidding war.

1377
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,520
Do you not, no, that's not.

1378
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,120
Bidding war on the way.

1379
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,240
I am going to bid on your apartment.

1380
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,420
What, 400 bucks a month, dude?

1381
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,720
That's what it's gonna cost me so that you're homeless?

1382
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,560
You guys don't--

1383
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,640
Worth.

1384
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,460
Worth, I'm not even, I'll never go there.

1385
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,760
You don't know where I live.

1386
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,480
I won't even set up an Airbnb for it.

1387
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,800
I don't want, 400, it's not worth my time, right?

1388
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,000
400 bucks, I make that in, you know, three weeks.

1389
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,800
Guys, can I sublet the apartment?

1390
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,640
No.

1391
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,460
Yeah, for $4.50.

1392
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,200
But I will put it up on Airbnb for $15 a day.

1393
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,060
You could be a live-in maid for the Airbnb

1394
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,080
we end up running.

1395
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,920
Yep.

1396
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,640
I don't think I want you guys to visit me anymore.

1397
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,480
I think I've changed my mind.

1398
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,020
And guess what, we're putting an aquarium

1399
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,360
in the living room with a shark.

1400
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,120
- I would actually really love that.

1401
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,580
You can order the bomb.

1402
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,300
- We're ordering a bomb to your house like a pizza.

1403
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,840
- You can do that.

1404
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,360
- 30 minutes or less.

1405
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,540
- Yep, and you're gonna make a video

1406
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,780
where you suck the bomb delivery guy's dick.

1407
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,400
- Okay, guys, this is not what Mexico is like at all.

1408
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,240
- Explodes the bomb.

1409
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,080
(laughing)

1410
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,060
- Thank you, the bomb explodes in your hands.

1411
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,580
- This is not what Mexico is like at all.

1412
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,200
I think you guys have just a wrong idea

1413
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,260
of what a beautiful country this is.

1414
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,820
you guys just painted it in the wrong way,

1415
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:22,100
such as people paint Napoleon because he's short.

1416
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,100
Only because we speak a different language.

1417
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,020
- Nobody, I mean, honestly,

1418
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,780
you asked if Napoleon was good or bad.

1419
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,100
I don't know the first fucking thing about Napoleon.

1420
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,940
- I don't know what he did.

1421
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,760
- He's French.

1422
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,940
- That's the problem.

1423
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,780
That's the problem.

1424
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,960
He could have been a worse than Hitler style guy, right?

1425
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,960
But I wouldn't fucking know because he was short.

1426
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,940
So nobody says anything except he was short.

1427
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,460
- I think people start worrying about him.

1428
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,740
- Another thing about it,

1429
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,700
people used to talk about Napoleon all the time

1430
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,680
when I was a kid, and now no one talks about him anymore.

1431
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,900
- They're making a movie.

1432
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,740
They're gonna talk about it again.

1433
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,180
- Yeah, now, yeah, this year, next year.

1434
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,100
- Okay, so. - They already made a movie.

1435
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,060
- But for the past 10 years, Napoleon has--

1436
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,740
- No one talks about fucking Oppenheimer,

1437
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,660
and now it's all you can hear about.

1438
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,020
- I used to talk about Oppenheimer all the time, actually.

1439
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,420
- You don't even know who that is.

1440
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,080
- You're right, it's Albert Einstein's op, their ops.

1441
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,140
Were they ops? - Yeah.

1442
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,860
- I think so, I haven't seen the movie, I think they're ops.

1443
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,700
- I haven't seen the movie either,

1444
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,540
but I know the history. - I know Albert Einstein

1445
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,900
is in it.

1446
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,540
- You said Albert.

1447
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,540
- Albert.

1448
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,740
- Albert Einstein.

1449
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,980
- Albert Einstein.

1450
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:29,180
That's how he would say his own name.

1451
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,580
- Can you please numb your thing and see if you pee yourself?

1452
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,300
- Can we please just see you numb it once, man?

1453
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,140
- Just numb it.

1454
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,380
- Just, come on.

1455
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,620
- He says, "I can't do it."

1456
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,500
- He's gonna do it, he's a good man.

1457
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,220
- No, I'm just a little part of it.

1458
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,100
- He's pretending, he's pretending.

1459
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,540
- No, he's hitting his leg right now.

1460
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,380
There's no way that hand--

1461
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,140
- He's pretending, it is completely pretending.

1462
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,620
- Yeah. - That's his knee.

1463
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,660
Okay, you're a bastard. - He's numbed your knee.

1464
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,500
- You're a complete lying bastard.

1465
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,320
- What do you mean I'm numbing my knee?

1466
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,320
My knee is right here.

1467
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,660
- Wait, do you have no pants on?

1468
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,020
How'd you get your hand in your pants?

1469
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,300
- I reached up, wearing--

1470
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,540
- Completely no pants. - No cool shorts.

1471
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,500
- No pants Friday.

1472
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,020
- You, oh, I kind of believe this.

1473
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,420
That's kind of a convoluted enough way to touch your penis

1474
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,700
that I do a little bit believe that he numbed it.

1475
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,400
Okay, then give us a trip report.

1476
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,500
Just trip report, one second, and what's going on?

1477
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,140
Are you feeling?

1478
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,020
It tingles, whoa, he's starting to like it.

1479
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,060
He might be addicted.

1480
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:26,540
How much was this tiger bomb?

1481
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,100
It's like $11.

1482
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,940
Oh, okay.

1483
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,780
It's not that much.

1484
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,900
Yeah, just have a heart attack?

1485
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,420
It's saving you a lot of money.

1486
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,200
No, it's probably 30 heart attacks.

1487
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,380
30 of those is more than Jubio's rent.

1488
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:42,460
30 tiger bombs. That is true.

1489
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,460
This world is crazy. I'm moving to another country.

1490
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,380
Okay. What are you guys getting into this weekend? Huh? Let's close her out.

1491
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,660
I got beers. I got fake beers to drink.

1492
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,980
I'm packing.

1493
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,980
He's packing. He's potentially, what are you leaving?

1494
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:03,140
I think the eighth now. Okay. I got a,

1495
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,500
I got a new quote from a different company.

1496
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:08,260
So we got one other piece of drink.

1497
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,540
Well, actually, you might not have another piece of drink in this in this house for

1498
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,500
Rex. Yeah, this is my last one.

1499
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,900
Next one, he might just be in New York completely.

1500
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,380
Say goodbye, drinkers.

1501
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:22,420
And I have to probably do it in the office because I'm not going to have one of me.

1502
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,940
You guys might even have to do it together as best friends.

1503
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,980
We don't have to.

1504
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:32,260
But if if if we need to, we're if we'll see what you want to do or if Brexit thing is,

1505
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:38,140
I'm not going to go all the way over there to record or to unlock the door and then fucking not stay and record.

1506
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:41,580
So wait, can we do an official send off of this house?

1507
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,620
Can you run to your front door and do the doorbell?

1508
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,340
Oh, yes, please.

1509
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,740
Thank you.

1510
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,980
That's what I did.

1511
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:57,380
I love it.

1512
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:57,820
I love that.

1513
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:58,940
The fact that this is going to be recorded.

1514
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,220
Oh, my God.

1515
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,660
Have we heard it before on the podcast?

1516
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,660
I don't think so.

1517
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,160
I think it's in one of my videos on YouTube.

1518
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:05,660
Shh, shh, shh.

1519
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,160
Wait.

1520
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:14,660
I'm getting worried.

1521
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:24,860
So every time something gets delivered,

1522
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,060
every time someone is at the door,

1523
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,960
he has to listen to that for the last like year or so.

1524
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,960
Maybe almost two years.

1525
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,960
Last two years, two years.

1526
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,960
But he's finally free.

1527
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,960
He's going to have just a normal, just "Blaaah!"

1528
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,960
Wow.

1529
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,960
That was fucking amazing.

1530
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,960
That was awesome.

1531
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,960
That was awesome.

1532
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,960
Alright.

1533
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
See you in New York.

1534
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,960
Bye.
