5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm loving the mustache, dude.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,800
Thank you, it's back.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,300
It is back.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,000
It's back after a long time.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,300
A long hiatus on the mustache.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,300
I think someone told me, um,

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,600
someone told me it looked weird when we were in New York,

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,800
and it was when I had that really high panic attack,

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,400
'cause I was...

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Because somebody made fun of your mustache?

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
No, no, yeah, that's why I had it.

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,400
So I took it. I was taking Prilosec and it made my heart rate go really fast.

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,400
That is still the funniest thing ever is that you had like half a beer and one hit of somebody's blunt.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
And just bugged out and you were like, "I have to..."

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,400
And all of a sudden you were in Escape from New York.

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I had six gin and tonics.

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,400
We have to find the Duke of New York and we have to kill him.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,720
That should mitigate the effects of the of the weed but it just made it you you

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,400
went completely lost your mind I went completely pale yeah you just went home

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,880
alone - yeah you turned green dude I did yeah somebody told me that my

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,080
mustache looked weird and I went what?

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,000
oh yeah and those NYU kids were mad at me for hanging out with my friends yeah

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
God, such pussy.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,880
They went to Eataly for snacks.

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
How rich do you have to be?

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,000
I know, how rich do you have to be to go to Mario fucking fat guy with the Crocs?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Batali.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,760
Super Mario, I think is his name.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Super Mario, yeah.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
That's what you're thinking of.

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Super Mario Batali.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,240
Super Mario Batali and he jumps on interns.

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
He flattens them.

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,040
Yeah, and he collects golden coins from his restaurant.

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
Yeah, that he puts in their vagina slots.

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
That's right.

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Yeah, it's just a slot down there.

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,760
It's just, it's nothing but a slot.

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,160
There's a slot and there's a coin return button.

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,840
All women have, they have the slot and then they have a little lever and you pull it and

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
then their eyes go, uh, like a dollar sign.

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
It's like on an arcade.

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,800
Yeah, their eyes turn into dollar signs and that's how you make money.

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,320
That's called being a pimp.

50
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,120
It's like an arcade machine where they have the slot and then they have the little thing

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,080
next to it you can press to get your coins back and that thing you press, that's the

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,960
the butthole and you can get the coins right back out of the slot.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,680
No, the clit is the coin return and they come out of the butthole.

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,800
No, the clit is the joystick on top of the arcade machine.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,320
It's actually a completely different location.

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,520
And the boobs are the game.

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Wow.

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,320
The boobs are the big buck hunter rifle.

59
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,720
Yeah, the boobs are, instead of duck hunt, it's duck hunt.

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah.

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,480
And you play with that thing.

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,920
I don't even want to speak its name.

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
That thing.

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,520
That thing that shall not be named.

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
That horrible thing.

66
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I hate that thing.

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
That thingy.

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:03,720
I've started just earnestly laughing in Seth Rogen's laugh recently.

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Yeah.

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,560
Would you guys still be friends with me if I had Seth Rogen's laugh?

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
What is his last sound?

72
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Everyone always talks.

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
It's like a "hahahahaha".

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Oh yeah.

75
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Yeah, like that.

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
I think I have.

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
"hahahahaha".

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,480
I laughed like Kitty Foreman a lot. I've done a lot to not laugh like her.

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,980
Do it.

80
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
But just like...

81
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,480
[Laughter]

82
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,980
Oh, you just laugh like that.

83
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
Yeah, no, I do.

84
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,980
When you... if you have like... again, if you have like even one gin and tonic...

85
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,480
Yeah, you go...

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,980
That's how your laugh turns.

87
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,980
Yeah.

88
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,980
I have a pretty bad laugh. Unless I'm laughing really hard, I do the like...

89
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
[Coughing]

90
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,980
Oh, you do... that's kind... I would say that's Seth Rogen adjacent.

91
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Yeah, it sucks.

92
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,140
I hear you so much.

93
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,420
That's inverse Rogan.

94
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,500
It's like a fucking, it sounds like a bird choking on something.

95
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Hmm.

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Specifically a bird.

97
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Seth Rogen is choking a bird.

98
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
It's fucking hot in my apartment.

99
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Seth Rogen is choking on a bird.

100
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,220
Dude, okay, so basically the system I have- It is 77 degrees in this room.

101
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,660
The system I have right now for recording is I blast the fans in this room, because

102
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,820
this is, I'm in a sunroom, which is named after- That's the only fan I have.

103
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,580
A sunroom is named after the- You're pointing to a window.

104
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,460
The temperature- There's a fan in it.

105
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Is approximately.

106
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,460
You have a fan.

107
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,660
I don't even have, I have to turn off the fan because it makes too much noise.

108
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm in a basement and I got a fan so I'm cold as a cold piece of fish.

109
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,980
The windows in my apartment are too goddamn small to fit an AC unit.

110
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm in a sauna with a bunch of fat Swedish guys and they all sit around.

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,340
We don't even have any hot coals, their bodies just generate enough heat from their big fat

112
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
beautiful bodies.

113
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,320
They're sitting there just saying like "Ah, sweet Voskarsken!"

114
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,660
You look Swedish right now, you look like Bill's brother.

115
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,300
You look like Will.

116
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,980
I think, Pat, when you first joined the call,

117
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,300
I thought your headphone cord was a chain.

118
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,860
I was like, "Goddamn."

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,300
Dude, I should.

120
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,980
You're so close to an upgrade right here.

121
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,940
Yeah, I got this shirt.

122
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,780
I got these shorts.

123
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,420
Patrick's new loadout, dude.

124
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,260
Check out these shorts.

125
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,140
Oh my God, nice.

126
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,500
You can see the outline of the pocket in 'em.

127
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,340
Yeah.

128
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,060
Yeah, you do look like a Matty Matheson before photo.

129
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,900
Yeah.

130
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
Yeah, before he started drugs.

131
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,380
This is what he looked like as a young boy in Canada.

132
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,620
- Yeah, probably.

133
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,260
I respect him as a chef.

134
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,940
I respect his recipes.

135
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,020
I do find his presence kind of,

136
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,420
I think he's leaned too much into it.

137
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,860
- Being shrill?

138
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,020
- Being like, "Ah!"

139
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,860
- Yeah, he does know how.

140
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,980
- "We're gonna make a kick-ass nacho today!"

141
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,220
(laughing)

142
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,900
- Oh, fuck.

143
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,740
- You're right, this is the best Monster Energy.

144
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,580
Yeah, Monster Fiesta is the best one.

145
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,140
It took them years to figure that out.

146
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,220
This makes me feel like an animal, dude.

147
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,180
It's the new flavor.

148
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,460
That one and then Rosa's pretty good.

149
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,100
I hated Monster Rosa at first, but I've come around to it.

150
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,260
It doesn't taste like it's meant for your mouth.

151
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,740
No, it's supposed to be mango too.

152
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,340
This is supposed to be mango?

153
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,180
Yeah.

154
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,700
Why'd they make the can blue?

155
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,820
Exactly, what the fuck?

156
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,020
Like a blue raspberry.

157
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,860
Yeah, like a blue waffle.

158
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,320
Yeah, a blue mango.

159
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,800
blue banana they made a ball banana blue it's blue because it's the it's a party

160
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,060
you can just make things blue is what is what companies figured out as you can

161
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,720
just make flavors real you can just turn also I swear to God when I started God

162
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,440
when I bought this I looked into new nutrition facts and it said zero

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:37,700
calories and now it says 10 calories it changes like the like the cores like the

164
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,200
- It pours like mountains, but it's just as you drink it,

165
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,040
it keeps adding calories.

166
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,480
- Oh, fucking speaking of Monster Hunter,

167
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,880
I went to Star Market today,

168
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,920
and I don't know how this happened,

169
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,800
but they just like, I went there just to get like,

170
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,940
one thing, I went there specifically just to get a monster,

171
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,800
and then like maybe some lunch.

172
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,640
- And a toy.

173
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,560
- And they just did not, and a toy,

174
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,080
and some jacks to play jacks with.

175
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,520
- One of those little dollar sheriff sets

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,360
that has the handcuffs.

177
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:26,920
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

179
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,340
the moment curfew drops, you just walk up to people.

180
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,640
I'm wearing like a kid outfit.

181
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm standing with the cops just like that.

182
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,600
What's your badge number?

183
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,520
What's your badge number?

184
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,160
Uh, it says made in China.

185
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,060
But yeah, she didn't, um, she didn't bag my monster energy.

186
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,440
And I got, I went to the one I met up with, uh, Dom while she was like.

187
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,280
watching the kids that she now I can't I got to stop giving away

188
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
information about her job.

189
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, about your kids.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
Kids.

191
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,200
Well, I went to a park.

192
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,160
People are gonna triangulate who the kids are.

193
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,680
I well, yeah, they will.

194
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,320
Yeah.

195
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,240
God, I hate I hate revealing myself.

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
I hate showing my ass.

197
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,080
You love showing your ass.

198
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,040
Oh, I love to show my ass.

199
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,760
What is the this is turning into a Patrick story so fast.

200
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,360
What what is the point of them bagging?

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
She didn't bag it.

202
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,800
I walked all the way to Brookline and then walked back here and I didn't have a monster energy.

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh, that's because she was expecting you knew that you were just gonna drink it.

204
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
So she didn't bag it. That's what they do.

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
That's like how they don't bag gum when you go.

206
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,300
Like, the most insulting thing that's ever happened to me is one time,

207
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,800
I was at a food line here in North Carolina,

208
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
and they didn't bag my milk.

209
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
They just said I had a gallon of milk,

210
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,300
and they said it on the thing like I was just gonna drink it.

211
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
[laughter]

212
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,060
I was like, what the fuck do I look like?

213
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,900
- They looked at your bones.

214
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,740
- This guy's probably gonna drink.

215
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,580
Yeah, this guy's small bones.

216
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,200
- They looked at your bones and were like,

217
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,460
ah, you fucking, those things are tiny as shit.

218
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,300
Unlike me, who's big bones.

219
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,140
- I had to bag my fucking milk.

220
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,420
It was so embarrassing.

221
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,380
Everybody behind me sort of whispering,

222
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,580
he's gonna drink the milk on the drive home.

223
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,620
(laughing)

224
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,460
And then I did.

225
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,420
- Yeah.

226
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,260
- When you're ready to drink.

227
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,620
- Yeah, I mean, if it's out.

228
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,260
- If it's out, I don't want it to go bad.

229
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,500
- Yeah, the bag protects it from germs.

230
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,340
- It was a really hot day.

231
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,880
probably would have curdled on the way home so I had to drink the whole you know

232
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:33,540
oh my god next fucking Patrick is is is patting himself with a handkerchief like

233
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,500

234
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I have the vapors

235
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
it is so fucking hot in here

236
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,380
I bet it's hotter here do you see I'm not even I mean I'm a little shiny but I'm only shiny

237
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,740
Look dude, I fucking I'm Patrick heard Patrick heard Caleb talking about a gallon of milk and he got too excited

238
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,060
Just from the thought

239
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:04,920
I kind of look like the guy from the Oscars statue. You look like the guy you like this

240
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,640
Yeah, the Oscar you look like the guy like Oscar office. No. Yeah

241
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,740
You look like the Oscar that was given to Edward Norton for his performance in American History X

242
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,540
They gave him a custom Oscar.

243
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,540
They gave him a custom Oscar.

244
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,420
In a Nazi trench coat.

245
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,740
Oh fuck.

246
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,540
That just brought back some great memories right there.

247
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
You remembering American history?

248
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,220
Of your custom Oscar?

249
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,060
Yeah of my custom Oscar.

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
Yeah exactly.

251
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,620

I'm T-5 days until I come up to Boston.

253
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
Nice.

And I'm not allowed to see at least Cameron. Yeah, I'm not gonna get my family sick. You should I

256
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,660
He's all he's like over the hump. I

257
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,420
Don't know cuz it could get worse, you know, like I'm like I've been I've been freaking the fuck out

258
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,420
Because like my mom smokes I don't want my mom to get fucking Cove it will smoking protects against it. Yeah

259
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
Yeah, I know smoking is it

260
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,020
Well only if you smoke makes your lungs strong menthols. I heard yeah, and she smokes

261
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:31,540
Only if you smoke a hypodermic needle with the vaccine in it one big cigar a day, which is the problem

262
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,100
Yeah, she smokes one big crap like it's a cigar every single day and we're worried that it's filling her lungs with crap

263
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:45,580
Yesterday I went out to take my dog on a walk and there was like a cigar like butt or whatever

264
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
like in my front lawn.

265
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,580
And I was so confused.

266
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
In your mouth.

267
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
So confused because I don't know who.

268
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,940
There was a butt in your mouth, a dog's butt in your mouth.

269
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,940
There was my adult, the people.

270
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Oh yes.

271
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,500
Yeah you were swallowing your dog from the back.

272
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,220
You unlatched your jaw like a snake and you started eating your dog.

273
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,340
I was trying to figure out who would be smoking a cigar because my upstairs neighbors are

274
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,340
are a BMX guy and a personal trainer lady.

275
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,700
- Cigars are huge in the BMX community.

276
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,780
- Are they? - They are.

277
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,620
- Yeah.

278
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,100
- All right, well that explains it.

279
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,860
- Yeah, it's a bunch of 13 year olds on mongooses

280
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,980
just puffing a giant cigar.

281
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,900
- Just a guy riding a Colt bike with--

282
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,580
- Cigars are to BMX as weed is to skateboarders.

283
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,420
- Yeah.

284
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,240
- Everybody just--

285
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,860
- That's why they keep, they have little plastic things

286
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,400
that you can put on the top of your peg,

287
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,120
and in that peg you can keep a bunch

288
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,140
of Swisher Sweets in there.

289
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,980
- Exactly.

290
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,560
A thing that BMX riders love to do

291
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,860
is put a cigar butt in the spokes,

292
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,980
so that when it goes it sounds like a motorcycle.

293
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,640
- Well no, when it goes, it goes fast enough

294
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
that it sets the cigar on fire.

295
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,620
- Yeah, and then they smoke it.

296
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,460
- Yeah.

297
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,540
- They smoke that shit.

298
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,380
- When I was in high school--

299
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,140
- That's actually, you know, that is kinda true.

300
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,740
- That is kinda true, actually.

301
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,940
- No, all the kids--

302
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,780
- That thing about the cigars and the bikes

303
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,620
actually kind of true. All the kids that I went to, well all the kids I went to the

304
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,020
skate park with in high school. All the kids I went to cigar camp with, they all played on BMX bikes.

305
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,380
They all played on BMX, no but the BMX kids all smoked like cloves and shit.

306
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,460
Like they all smoked cloves and swishers. Well that was, smoking a swisher

307
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,660
suite is one of the funniest things ever. I know. Yeah before I, like me and a

308
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:34,020
friend we we would we like we would buy a cigar and then go to like a playground

309
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:41,500
in my hometown and just share a cigar. Yeah I stole from the quick stop I

310
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,820
stole like one great cigar or no no I didn't steal. One great cigar. One great cigar.

311
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,140
This kid I used to hang out with stole it and then we hid in the woods

312
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,180
near my house and we smoked the cigar and we kept freaking out because we

313
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,820

- That place is so good, and it was called Sex.

345
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,640
That's the best part of it.

346
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,800
- And it was called Sex.

347
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,080
- Yeah.

348
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,400
- Do you think they saw that coming?

349
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,480
- Saw what coming?

350
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
- Yeah, Sex?

351
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,520
- What was it called?

352
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,960
Consumer Electronics Exchange?

353
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
That was the acronym?

354
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,000
- They're like, yeah, just arguing all day.

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
It's like, it's Kex, okay?

356
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,600
It's called Kex.

357
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,440
- It's Kex.

358
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,280
- It's a hard C, it's Kex.

359
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,240
- Consumer.

360
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,760
- Yeah.

361
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,720
- These kids are so stupid.

362
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,800
- You just say the letters.

363
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,960
Nobody's gonna pronounce it.

364
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,880
You just say the letters.

365
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,720
- Yeah. - It's fine.

366
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
- No one's gonna read that. - You're just gonna

367
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,680
nobody tries to pronounce CIA we're gonna be fine okay

368
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,600
Kia and then that's why and the police come in the next day and are like hey we

369
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:46,800
have to shut this down because your game store name is sex and we're here to shut

370
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,800
you down yeah yeah this business is giving people ideas about what to do in

371
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:59,640
the bedroom we cannot be having this there's a the game store in my hometown

372
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,200
is they they had like a big long thing where people people were like super mad

373
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,800
at them because they put up a sign that was like you have to take a shower

374
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,560
before you come here that because people it's been smelled like a fucking oh

375
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,680
smells like yeah it smells so it's more like a little box every time you walked

376
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,280
Dude, this one time at like fifth grade, I remember we went to play and trade because

377
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,720
we were going to trade in games and as we were looking, we had just traded in and got our

378
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,840
credits and we were looking around the store and this dude with a ponytail but he had a

379
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,040
beanie on too and he had a t-shirt, a Mario t-shirt.

380
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Did he have a cutout?

381
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,280
Did he have a hole where he put the ponytail through?

382
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,040
No, he just had the beanie, the ponytail going.

383
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,700
I honestly, I wish he did, because then that would just make him like cooler.

384
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,020
Yeah.

385
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,100
But he walked up to my little brother and went like, "Do you like my shirt?"

386
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:01,120
And this guy had to, my brother, I was like 10, so my brother was like eight.

387
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,680
And he walked up to him and was like, "Do you like my shirt?"

388
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,060
And says, "Do you like mushrooms?"

389
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,860
And it had every Mario mushroom.

390
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,940
And my mom pulled my brother away from him.

391
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,460
- Yeah, dude, he was fucking, he's about to get,

392
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,700
- He was just trying to make friends, dude.

393
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,740
- Yeah, he was trying to make friends

394
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,860
with an eight year old bull.

395
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
- Yeah, that's fine.

396
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,060
- Dude, that was the monster from It Follows.

397
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,300
(laughing)

398
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,140
He's about to fuck him to death, dude.

399
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,380
You've been walking behind him for hours.

400
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,780
and i miss you think you know i was like it follows you'd be like the monster

401
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,980
turns into a is like whoever you had sex with three

402
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,220
it and uh... no concern in the whatever also i think it is a good i was the i

403
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,540
was the it was like the person who

404
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,340
you had sex with last

405
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,540
and like a guy's getting followed around by like a kid who's like no i swear

406
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,220
okay well i think that the thing is it's is randomized

407
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,660
so it could just be anybody's that's that's my theory on

408
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,260
the o_j_ murders is that it just looked like a good idea

409
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,980
wasn't it

410
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,900
while the situation is in it follows situation with a month it was just

411
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,580
it was a list randomly turned into a cold and it's a little it never had sex

412
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,960
this wouldn't have happened

413
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,620
exactly so yet again women having sex is really the problem

414
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,200
yet that's true that's why she deserved it

415
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,420
i'll say it

416
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,720
she deserve whatever she got yeah

417
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,300
that's the message i took away from it follows

418
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,660
- I mean, the message I took away from "It Follows"

419
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,460
is that OJ Simpson has great comedic timing.

420
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,060
- Yeah, he does.

421
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,540
He knows when to pop out.

422
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,380
- Yep.

423
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,200
- Yeah.

424
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,020
The thing is, if you're at all a Christian,

425
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,220
which I consider myself to be,

426
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,060
you would just think--

427
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,940
- You can't say that with that haircut.

428
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,540
- Yeah, I can.

429
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,060
I'm the right kind of Christian.

430
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,100
- The right kind?

431
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,660
- The right kind of Christian.

432
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,620
(laughing)

433
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,460
- Come on.

434
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,420
- But yeah, you should be,

435
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,820
I mean, she really did get what was coming to her,

436
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,860
just because she had sex, which is,

437
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,860
as far as I'm concerned,

438
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,960
one of the most evil things a woman can do.

439
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,260
- Yeah.

440
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,420
- Yeah, she should've gotten stoned.

441
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,260
- Yeah.

442
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,100
- Yeah.

443
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,420
- Yeah, maybe if she smoked a little bit of that G-

444
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,780
- Ooh, yeah.

445
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,780
That's what they did to women in the Bible.

446
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,620
They just got them so high.

447
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,420
(laughing)

448
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,820
Yeah, we brought her out into the street,

449
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,300
And we got we made her smoke the fattest fatty she ever saw.

450
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,460
We just-- That good Bethlehemian weed.

451
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,340
We put a gas mask bong on her and we just didn't stop lighting the damn thing.

452
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340
That's right.

453
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
Yeah.

454
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Yeah, and then she died.

455
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,340
Yeah.

456
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Yeah.

457
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,900
She died out of fear.

458
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
Yeah, she got so paranoid.

459
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,900
Yeah.

460
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,380
She got-- She died 'cause she saw the truth.

461
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
Yeah.

462
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,700
They didn't want her-- Yeah.

463
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,500
She passed through the, she saw the, the, the, the DMT council.

464
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
The DMT council.

465
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
The elves.

466
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
The elves, yeah.

467
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Yeah, she saw the jester.

468
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,940
She saw a shit ton of DMT and all you saw was Elton John.

469
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Yeah.

470
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,100
I love all of those, all those stories of like people seeing the DMT elves.

471
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,580
They give them like such hyper specific advice for their lives.

472
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,180
Like there's like fifth dimensional beings who are like, Fred needs to spend more time

473
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,180
with his stepson.

474
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
Yeah.

475
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,180
Whoa man.

476
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
Oh.

477
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:34,300
man. Oh, God, he told me I need to upgrade my PC, man. Oh, shit.

478
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,700
Yeah, imagine just having to go back in. Like there's like, like

479
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,940
everyone talks about it. Like they've had some really like

480
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,900
positive thing with just imagine just like them telling you just

481
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,820
like, man, you just gotta go out. You gotta go out to Walmart,

482
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,100
buy yourself a new belt, man.

483
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,900
That thing.

484
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,860
Yeah, honestly, man, you are ugly as fuck. And I don't know, we

485
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,540
don't really have a solution for it.

486
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,980
Honestly, man, you just need to Google Tai Lopez and watch his

487
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,780
videos and just get some fucking, just pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

488
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,860
You gotta learn, you gotta learn how to speed read.

489
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,300
You need a millionaire mindset, dude.

490
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,540
You know, honestly, man, like we, the elves, we usually keep tabs on pretty much everyone,

491
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,060
but we don't really know who you are.

492
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,860
We're not really sure what you're doing here.

493
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
So last name.

494
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Do you go by maybe?

495
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Yeah.

496
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
What's your maiden name?

497
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,020
You have maybe a different name that you go by?

498
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,940
Honestly, we don't really like talking to you.

499
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,340
So just don't do DMT again, man.

500
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,940
We're actually out of session right now. Yeah, come back later.

501

We have machine, we have machine, machine Rand Paul is doing a filibuster right now. We can't really make any decisions.

502
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,860
Yeah, we're kind of in gridlock.

503
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
Yeah, it's very partisan.

504
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,860
The machine Elf Council.

505
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,380
Machine Rand Paul just read the first page of The Hobbit.

We're gonna have to deal with this

513
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,880
Yeah, I'm uh, I think I've told this probably before but when I was there's this comedian

514
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,820
Ryan something some comic who has he's like one of those like Shane Moss comedians who has like

515
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,340
Like a podcast about drugs about like doing drugs and he was like one of the first stand-ups I ever saw when I was 15

516

All the weed t-shirts and shit that would like the the kovid mask that said my favorite stoner calls me dad. Yeah

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,580
You know

542
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,540
I know I wish I had gotten on the like

543
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,300
like the comedians who

544
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:03,980
Now since I can't do comedy or just making like shirts with like the worst like kovid jokes on them or like the tiger king

545
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,140
references, yeah

546
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,020
- Yeah, COVID is, yeah, Carol Baskins did COVID.

549
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,240
- I think COVID spreads through sardine oil.

550
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,260
- I can't like believe that people watch that show

551
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,900
and like their main takeaway from it was like,

552
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,540
all the like, oh, Carol Baskin stuff

553
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,060
and not like the on-camera suicide.

554
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,220
- Yeah, the on-camera suicide.

555
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,060
- It's so insane.

556
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,100
That episode like fucked me up.

557
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Like I got really upset watching that

558
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,540
and everyone who watched that was like, wow.

559
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,440
yeah I don't understand that at all I felt kind of ripped off that they cropped it

560
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,140
it felt like those old those old like prank images back when internet sucked

561
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,100
where it would be like a girl like a naked girl but only like right above the

562
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,620
nipple yeah and then it switches to the troll face yeah exactly just let it load

563
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,700
yeah but it's like the fucking the on-camera suicide the fact that Joe

564
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,180
exotic is grooming straight teenage boys yeah and then he like sings his song at

565
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:11,220
the kids funeral. Yeah, dude and then everyone's like oh he's innocent though. Free Joe Exotic.

566
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,800
Yeah, free Joe. Fuck you. I want that exact, that guy who died, I want his exact headstone.

His name was Patrick Exotic. Brandon Dassey's the kid from Making a Murderer. Yeah, the

570
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,660
one who looks exactly like you and has the same brain as you. He does not look like, he looks like Peter Griffin.

573
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,540
Jinx. Yeah, well I mean Tiger King was good, but like, if you look at it, if you look at it

574
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,620
through like oh look at these fucking horrible people yeah it was like it was

575
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:11,620

The ozone layer is like the earth's diaper.

603
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,500
Police don't realize that blinding all these people with tear gas canisters is creating

604
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:50,800
a fleet of super soldier antifa pirates who are just gonna come back twice as hard, baby.

605

Yeah, and I can't think of anything else he does in that movie.

He does nothing else.

708
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,640
He does nothing else, especially not the...

709
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
What's her name?

710
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
I don't even remember her name.

711
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Helen Green.

712
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Helen Green.

713
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,880
Yeah, she's going to be Helen Black and Blue when he's done with her.

714
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,600
Yeah, that's what they say in the movie.

715
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,480
That's what I say.

716
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,640
They say that in the movie?

717
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,480
No.

718
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,940
I could have written that movie.

719
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,780
Yeah, I could have wrote that movie.

720
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,040
I could have wrote that movie easy.

721
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,120
Here's what I would have done.

722
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,320
I would have had two plants.

723
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,480
Okay, so it's a weed plant, right?

724
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,640
I would have had five plants.

725
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,600
I would have had two plants,

726
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,240
and I would have made them kiss with those big lips.

727
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,080
Uh-huh.

728
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,840
Right, and then we get a third plant in there.

729
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,400
Little shop of stoners, right?

730
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,120
Oh, and he grows a big weed leaf.

731
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,400
He grows a big weed leaf, and it's Smoke Me Seymour.

732
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,640
No, it's Little Shop of Connors.

733
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,200
And it's a guy named Connor owns him.

734
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,160
And he's growing weed in like a little--

735
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,160
♪ Little shop, little shop of Connors ♪

736
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah, and he has like, oh, and he sells the weed.

738
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,680
And he grows it in like a--

739
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,960
And Christopher, Christopher guest walks in and he goes,

740
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,800
"Hey, what is that plant there?

741
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,720
"Is that indica or sativa?"

742
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,960
(laughing)

743
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,640
It's actually a hybrid.

744
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,640
And he's growing weed in like a hole in his wall

745
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,620
that he covers with his dresser and he's doing hydroponics there.

746
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,940
And then Smoke Me Seymour and then uh...

747
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,660
His name is Weedmore.

748
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Yeah, Smoke Me Weedmore.

749
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,660

That's good, that's good.

755
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,400
I think we're doing another stoner special right now.

756
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Uh huh.

757
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,400

Yeah, yeah.

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:05,100
Where the guy's like, he's like, "McCully Culkin, did you tell them that you were gay?"

806
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,420
They just accused McCully Culkin of being gay.

807
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,820
It's like a kid who got touched.

808
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,860
And then there was the one, the Bush and Kerry one.

809
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Oh man.

810
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,160
- Man, you can't play Bill Cosby fun game anymore

811
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,960
because, what is it, Chrome doesn't support Flash anymore?

812
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,000
- No, they still support Flash.

813
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,660
They're ending the support, I think, December 2021.

814
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,140
If Flash player's blocked,

815
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,860
that's 'cause you have it blocked in your preferences.

816
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,860
- Okay, here is Bill Cosby fun game on scratch.mit.edu.

817
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,040

818
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,280

823
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,880
went directly to this project.

824
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,120
(laughing)

825
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,640
- This, oh my God.

826
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,720
Somebody really did fucking remake the game in scratch.

827
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,600
(laughing)

828
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,560

829
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,080
Bill Cosby fun game?

830
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,900
- What is it?

831
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:17,520
It is a game where you lure people in with pudding and then hit them with the shovel

832
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,720
and put them in your dungeon.

833
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,000
Wow.

834
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,360
Yeah, that's just awesome.

836
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,720
And there's a remix with Donald Trump.

837
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,300
Oh dude, I remember this.

838
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300

Yes, I do remember Stick RPG dude.

844
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,800
Was that the one where you could like, you got in a bar fight and stuff?

Yeah, and there's caffeine pills.

846
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,200
I remember asking my mom for caffeine pills for Christmas

847
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
because I saw them in that.

848
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
And I was like, "Dude, it's like a superpower."

849
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, it makes you strong.

850
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
It turns you into a stick guy.

851
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Yeah.

852
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,700
And then she told me they were illegal,

853
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
which I don't think is true.

854
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,400
No.

855
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Did you guys ever watch like stick figure...

856
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,100
They had them in that Sick by the Bell episode.

857
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,400
The stick figure fight animations?

858
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,100
You ever watch those?

859
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,400
Oh, yeah, of course.

860
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
What was that?

861
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,300
Madness Combat?

862
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,500
What was the...

863
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,900
Madness Combat was sick.

864
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,860
It was like a stick figure animator.

865
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,020
Oh, oh fuck what was that called?

866
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,020
What do you mean? There's a lot of them.

867
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,820
There was like one that everybody used.

868
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,320
Yeah.

869
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,820
Oh, Pivot.

870
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,320
Oh my... Pivot!

871
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,020
Dude, oh my god. I made so much karate stuff in Pivot.

872
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,320
Oh man, I made so much shit in Pivot.

873
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,820
All of them. I remember I made one that was just like a guy with big balls and he falls over.

874
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
[Laughter]

875
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,660
All my pivots were too fast. I didn't understand frame rate or anything.

876
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,420
I think I have a YouTube channel from when I was a kid that's just pivots.

877
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,060
Yeah.

878
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,220
Let me see if I can find that. I'll find it later.

879
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,940
The guy that filmed the video of my little brother breaking his arm showed me pivot

880
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,100
because he was making like karate stuff and pivoted.

881
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,740
People love that video, Patrick, of your brother breaking his arm. I don't know what it is.

882
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,700
People love people getting hurt, dude.

883
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,100
Yeah, people love seeing my little brother when he was fat getting fucking...

884
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,140
Well, you can tell, you can just tell he was like annoying, like just by how hard he screams.

885
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,540
You can just tell he's like kind of an annoying kid.

886
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,300
Yeah, he kind of was.

887
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:13,800
Yeah.

888
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,060
I'm sending this to him.

889
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
I think I was probably, I don't care.

890
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,500
Oh, I'm sure you were worse.

891
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,460
I was way worse.

892
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,180
I'm in the background.

893
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,260
I'm the kid that says, I'm the kid that's talking about a South Park episode.

894
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:31,220
I, I, the, the Walmart episode where they break the mirror.

895
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:37,780
I was pretty old before I... I had to wait for my parents to get divorced before I could watch South Park.

896
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,280
Yeah.

897
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,700
Oh, I snuck... dude, I played fucking Bill Cosby game. I played Bill Cosby fun game at that age.

898
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:49,300
I remember the first time I saw South Park was a kid at summer camp showed me it.

899
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,740
Whoa.

900
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:57,380
Yeah, and I was like, "Damn, this is crazy. They can say that stuff and they're just little boys who are animated?"

901
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,900
Yeah, wait, I'm a little boy.

902
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,940
And I'm animated.

903
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,780
Maybe I'll do this.

904
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,580
F you.

905
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,760
Yeah, hey man. Hey teacher.

906
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,260
Hey teacher, you're-

907
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,200
F you man!

908
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,340
Hey teacher, you're gonna anally probe me.

909
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,000
Hey teacher, give me my apple back, you son of a shit.

910
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,200
Hey, you- where's Mr. Hand, my teacher?

911
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,980
Yeah. Everyone knew- had that one friend who died every single day.

912
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,480
Yeah.

913
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,540
Everyone had that one friend-

914
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:27,960
That's- South Park is so relatable. Everyone had a fat friend, a Jewish friend, and a kid with no face who died every single day.

915
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,460
Yeah.

916
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,300
Yeah.

917
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,800
*burp*

918
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,800
His name? Jesus Christ.

919
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Yep.

920
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,800
And he always came back. He was always there for me.

921
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Yeah.

922
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,360
That would be of, uh, okay, I'll say this much. If Jesus Christ was still alive and every

923
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,200
day he died and came back the next day, I'd probably believe him.

924
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Me too.

925
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I'd probably be a Christian.

926
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
Yeah.

927
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
You know.

928
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
No, I'd be like, "Fuck you."

929
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,120
F you see can I say F you and then ask him for forgiveness? What would it take for you guys to believe in God me?

930
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:05,760
Yeah, I'm not too much even God. I definitely look so yeah, I was so scared of really that's that is interesting to me

931
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,560
I would have guessed that

932
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,600
Neither of you believed in God at all. No, I think it's like two years. We've never had this conversation

933
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,240
I am scared of God as a kid that like most of my

934
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,320
Fears and shit are like God stuff. I

935
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:30,200
I go through phases of intense paranoia and then I'm like, "Oh, yeah, God is attacking me today."

936
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,600
Right. Yeah. No, like you do something bad and then like a couple minutes later,

937
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,520
like something else bad. Like earlier, like today, I don't remember what I did,

938
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,040
but I just remember my jewel falling like in the toilet and I was like...

939
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,440
You're like, "God is not real."

940
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,440
God is really God is rewarding me

941
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,220
Yeah, Patrick fills up his fills up his jewel pot

942
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:02,760
And then smokes it like a dog. It just makes a big brown class

943
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,160
Makes a big brown snot bubble that he just breathes in and out and it gets bigger and smaller

944
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,680
No, but I'll still I'll still have like moments where I'm like, oh shit. That's God punishing. Yeah. No, I

945
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,640
Absolutely get that all did your mom did your mom and dad ever?

946
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,560
Say that to you like like something like shitty happens to you like you fucking know I didn't have very religious or something

947
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:33,000
Not really. I just I think um think I'm just a very paranoid person and uh yeah very uh I'm very psychotic

948
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I'm kind of like the Joker. You know I'm kind of like a freak

949
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,680
I'm kind of like a free. I'm kind of like the Joker combined with the Joker from the Joker movie

950
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,140
I'm kind of like Bane

951
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:48,980
I'm kind of like the Joker from the animated series combined with the Joker from Adam West Batman combined with the Joker from Tim Burton Batman

952
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,000
combined with the Joker from Chris Nolan Batman combined from the Joker from

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,500
Joaquin Phoenix Batman combined by the from the

954

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
No, you're the Joker

957
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
combined by the Joker from the deck, combined by the Joker from Persona 5

958
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
No, you're the Joker from the Funko Company

959
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
combined with the Joker that was voiced by John DiMaggio

960
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
combined by the Joker from the

961
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:21,440
combined with the Joker from the Boston bombing, combined with the Joker from my mind, that's

962
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
me.

963
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Combined with myself.

964
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,000
You're 10% monkey imaginary friend.

965
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You're 10% walkie and 20%...

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,480
20% Joker.

967
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,320
15% concentrated power of Joker.

968
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,880
50% Joker.

969
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,440
5% cool.

970
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,440
100% reason I'm so crazy. You guys remember that song?

971
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
I love that song.

972
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Remember I'm the Joker by Mike the Joker.

973
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Mike Joker?

974
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:56,440
What about Fort Climber and it's Charlotte Climber's hip hop and rock project.

975
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,440
That'd be pretty good, right?

976
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,440
Or Fort...

977
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,440
How about Fort...

978
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,440
Fort...

979
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
Ah, fuck.

980
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,880
I don't believe in God.

981
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,520
I believe in, um, I don't know.

982
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,120
I think I've talked about this, but just like as soon as I knew the tooth fairy wasn't real,

983
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,760
I was just like, "Oh God, God and Santa."

984
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,760
Oh yeah, no, me too.

985
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,760
That's it, that's it.

986
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Those are the bullet points.

987
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,060
Santa, the day I found out, did I ever tell you how I found out Santa wasn't real, or?

988
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,120
You went to the North Pole and you dug.

989
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
Yeah.

990
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
Mm-hmm.

991
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,000
No, I, ah, fuck.

992
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,840
I was like, so my mom had told me, my mom was trying to ease me into not believing in Santa.

993
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,120
So in the third grade she told us that Santa only brings three presents and then the rest

994
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,680
are my mom.

995
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,120
Yeah.

996
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,080
And so she was like, so that's probably why you're not going to get a lot of presents this

997
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,360
year.

998
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:59,520
And so I get like the fourth grade, I like kind of like, I don't remember what it was,

999
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,000
We got into a fight around Christmas stuff.

1000
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,120
And then I was like, I don't know what it was.

1001
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,720
I said something that got her so mad that she went,

1002
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,880
and you know what?

1003
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,520
Santa's not real.

1004
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,760
(laughing)

1005
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,960
Dude, my fucking, my older brother,

1006
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,520
my older brother heard that from the other room

1007
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,280
and all we heard was,

1008
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,520
(laughing)

1009
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:37,680
He ran out of the house crying without his shoes on.

1010
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:44,380
So he ran outside, it's like the middle of winter, fucking freezing, no shoes because

1011
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,800
my mom said Santa wasn't real.

1012
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
That fucking rocks.

1013
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,600
You know, Santa isn't real but Mrs. Claus is.

1014
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,120
Oh for sure.

1015
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,680
I remember I found out Santa wasn't real, like my friend told me in elementary school,

1016
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,480
just like in the playground but then I remember like some other time like I had

1017
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,480
this other friend who tried to tell me was like yeah Santa Claus isn't real but

1018
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,880
you know what it's Jesus Christ that brings the presents down to me.

1019
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,960
That rocks.

1020
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,680
I my my brother's ex-girlfriend believed in Santa until she was 14.

1021
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
What?

1022
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,440
And when she found out her siblings attacked their dad.

1023
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,680
(laughing)

1024
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:30,040
It was like years of pressure on their parents.

1025
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,200
Everybody at school says we're stupid

1026
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,080
for believing in Santa Claus.

1027
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,960
Everybody at school is saying we're babies

1028
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,800
for believing in Santa Claus.

1029
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,240
They were like, oh, they're just, they're psy-ops.

1030
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,520
- They're trying to keep you down.

1031
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,440
- Dude, that's an anti-Santa psy-op.

1032
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,840
- And then one day they finally, her dad,

1033
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,520
they were like in his office and she was like,

1034
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,240
so just tell it straight up, I'm getting too old for this.

1035
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,400
Is he real?

1036
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,160
And their dad was like, "No."

1037
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,080
And they just all started crying and beating him up.

1038
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,340
(laughing)

1039
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,560
- God damn, dude.

1040
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,320
I'm at believing in Santa until you're 13,

1041
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,920
that's kinda, that's kinda sucks.

1042
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,120
- That's kinda awesome, dude.

1043
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,320
- That's kinda sucks.

1044
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,080
- That's kinda cool.

1045
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,560
That's kinda fly.

1046
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,680
- That's kinda fly.

1047
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,800
- Damn, that's kinda some fly-ass shit.

1048
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,120
- That's kinda some fly-ass shit.

1049
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,000
Santa is one fly-ass white boy.

1050
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,400
yeah yeah yeah i i miss that i miss that era of like the culture wars when it was just like

1051
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:36,240
the culture wars over whether santa is real yeah just laura ingraham on box news like santa claus

1052
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,000
is as real as jesus christ is and then it's fucking uh somebody it's rachel maddow yeah

1053
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:51,120
just doing an expose on us and it's not real. So how could he fit into a chimney

1054
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:56,900
at an apartment building? Yeah. We actually sent our fattest intern to a

1055
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,320
chimney. John Oliver spending three million dollars to go to the North Pole

1056
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:13,040
and check himself. And what we learned was the North Pole could not house a fat red man

1057
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,200
plus a hundred elves not even ten elves could fit there there's no way you could

1058
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:25,320
fit a factory there just spending so much HBO money to prove that Santa isn't real

1059
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:33,080
no Santa no Santa you can't deliver presents to the porch and then and then

1060
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:42,960
Santa's shoes down Oliver yeah there's a big lawsuit we've actually created a new

1061
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,960
mascot who's called shit Claus the fuck yeah yeah before you change that is a

1062
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,560
bitch calm before you change the same to clause it was actually crap mm-hmm

1063
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,280
That's right.

1064
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,980
Yeah, make Santa crap again.

1065
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,980
*laughter*

1066
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,380
God damn man, that's stupid.

1067
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,080
That's stupid, motherfucker.

1068
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,860
That's stupid as hell.

1069
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,380
John Oliver, you dumb.

1070
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:10,880
You dumb.

1071
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,880
John Oliver, you dumb motherfucker.

1072
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,880
If you ever, ever talk about Santa again,

1073
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,380
I'm calling ICE on you, baby.

1074
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,880
I'm calling ICE on you.

1075
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,880
I'm giving them HBO's address.

1076
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,100
I'm calling ice on John Oliver and I'm sending him his ass to the damn North Pole.

1077
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,460
Yeah, and I'm sending him back to the North Pole because everybody knows he's an escaped elf like

1078
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:35,180
Will Ferrell in the movie Elf. Yeah, exactly. He came to New York and he started doing all that

1079
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,860
all that funky shit. Look, look, honestly we need to talk about it. I'm just gonna say it.

1080
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:44,460
Uh, Buddy the Elf kind of appropriating the culture he doesn't belong to. You know what,

1081
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:50,700
my mom because of Elf didn't think a narwhal was a real animal. It's pretty fun. Until like a year

1082
00:52:50,700 --> 00:53:00,060
ago it's a real it was a real animal it's a it is a really are you kidding it's a

1083
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:06,100
real animal and my mom is not real that's not real it's not wall the narwhals

1084
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,900
this is an interesting science fact for you Patrick the narwhal it's a type of

1085
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:16,580
science fact it's a type of either whale or dolphin but the type of wall the horn

1086
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,980
- A horn is a tooth that grows through

1087
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,700
and like pokes through its lip

1088
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,900
and just grows out really long.

1089
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,740
They just have one really long spiral tooth.

1090
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,900
- One of the most fucked up animals.

1091
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,540
- Oh, okay, now that I've never looked into it.

1092
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,380
(laughing)

1093
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,300
- Never looked into it.

1094
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,140
- No, I just thought--

1095
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:32,980
- You're at my mom, I guess.

1096
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,320
- You just thought it was a Christmas Reddit animal?

1097
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,020
- Yeah, I, yeah, no, I think because of how annoyed--

1098
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,420
- You got confused with unicorns?

1099
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,240
You thought unicorns were real but narwhals weren't?

1100
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,740
- Yeah, that's exactly it.

1101
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,940
- Yeah, I remember there's one animal

1102
00:53:45,940 --> 00:54:08,020
with

1103
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,460
him as a kid and so he uh yeah so he's lost you waste their existence he said

1104
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:16,540
yeah these things are imaginary yeah they poked my naughty with their horn yeah my

1105
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,540
parents actually my parents actually aren't real they're just something from

1106
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:27,620
fairy tales parents aren't real I wish did homework is an illusion an illusion

1107
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:34,140
of the mind it's an illusion down yeah homework is a tool of a pressure homework

1108
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,820
Homework is a construct.

1109
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,820
Homework is a construct of capitalism made to funnel children into the workforce.

1110
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:48,220
Yeah, to funnel children into the exam industrial complex.

1111
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,820
Yeah, I believe in the 8-8-8 principle.

1112
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:56,140
It should be eight hours for sleeping, eight hours for home leisure, and eight hours for

1113
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,140
recess.

1114
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,140
Yes.

1115
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,140
Right?

1116
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,140
Exactly.

1117
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,140
And then you need that resting time to recover from all that kickball.

1118
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,140
Yep.

1119
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,440
And all that all that four square they should let you know you should do you should be able to do

1120
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,900
They should let you go to recess as an adult. They should let you do recess from home. I

1121
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:17,260
Did I had I had a recess block when I was homeschooled and it was just video games

1122
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,780
It was like the greatest recess ever. That's incredible. I was playing battlefield

1123
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,500
fucking rocked I

1124
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,820
Had I went to public school

1125
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:32,120
Yeah, I went to Hampshire public schools, and that's why I can't do math and that yeah

1126
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,620
- Yeah, and that's why you look like a guy

1127
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,000
who like owes Joe Pesci money in a movie now.

1128
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,800
(laughing)

1129
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,160
I love that look, dude.

1130
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,500
The mustache. - It's a good look, yeah.

1131
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,060
It's a good mustache. - I mean, it works for you.

1132
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,560
- I need a shave soon. - It really does.

1133
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,600
It really does.

1134
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,460
- Yeah. - Get it, I can't.

1135
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,960
- Yeah, I pretty much need a shave too.

1136
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,800
- No, you don't, dude.

1137
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,640
- Yeah, pretty much my beard is--

1138
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,800
- You should do like a mud vein thing.

1139
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,200
- I don't have any hair under my,

1140
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,320
like it all starts-- - On your body.

1141
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,880
- You don't have, you don't like--

1142
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,880
I have the worst beard ever.

1143
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,880
You just have no...

1144
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,880
It's only a neck beard. It starts under my chin.

1145
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,880
It doesn't go onto my face at all.

1146
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,880
You should just do a super sick lightning bolt chin strap.

1147
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,880
Fuck yeah dude.

1148
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,880
Just like super tight.

1149
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,880
Oh yeah like ludicrous?

1150
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
Yes dude.

1151
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,880
You should get three shaves right here on the side of your head.

1152
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,880
My older brother had a beard when he was like 13.

00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,400
That was my job growing up because I was so bad at doing the dishes.

1186
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,000
I would put a plate in the fridge and then they were like, "You just do the silverware

1187
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
now."

1188
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,080
Dude, that's a win.

1189
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,280
That's how you just do the chores bad and then you have to do them again.

1190
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,280
Yeah, that's right.

1191
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,880
That's called being, yeah, that's how you strategize.

1192
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,880
That's called tactics.

1193
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,520
in school. Yeah, yeah, no true. That's what I did in school. That's why I got put into

1194
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:27,520
a study that I got a credit for. Damn, that rocks. Yeah, that's also what I did in school.

1195
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,160
I was, did not do well in school. And yet you still graduated the greatest mind of our

1196
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:38,160
generation. Exactly. Yeah. I'm so smart dude. You were too smart that school bored you.

1197
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,540
Exactly, that was it. I almost didn't graduate high school. I was very close to not graduating

1198
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:47,100
high school yeah I almost if I didn't have that study that I got a credit for

1199
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,380
I would not have had enough credits graduate yeah I was also close not

1200
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:57,740
graduating cuz my mom was just really mad at me my mom got super mad at me and

1201
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:02,340
she made me do like a super long paper to graduate high school or else she

1202
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:07,900
wasn't gonna sign the form yeah my high school also wanted me they were like hey

1203
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:13,500
since you did so badly will you do an extra year like just a pre-college year

1204
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,000
just like chillin out here and I was like no way.

1205
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,840
- You almost had a pre-colonial.

1206
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,680
- I would rather kill myself, yeah.

1207
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,840
- Dude, my school was fuckin cruel.

1208
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,400
In my yearbook they had like a continuing education section

1209
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,400
and they put the one kid who didn't graduate in it.

1210
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,920
Like it was like most of the special needs kids

1211
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,000
and then the one kid in my grade who was like,

1212
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,880
yeah, we're keeping him back for a semester.

1213
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,720
- Damn.

1214
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,560
- Damn.

1215
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,880
- Yeah, no, they tried to hold on to me.

1216
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,160
I said, no, fuck you.

1217
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,160
I will not let you do it to me.

1218
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,240
You were you were fucking you were their favorite student, bro.

1219
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,120
Yeah, they just needed you.

1220
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,520
They didn't know what to do that.

1221
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,320
We're not even a school without you, Cameron.

1222
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,200
They tried to do that to me in eighth grade and fifth grade.

1223
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,560
Nice.

1224
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,240
Like any time that I was about to go on to a different school,

1225
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,560
they were like, yeah, we don't think he like enough.

1226
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,440
And then like my mom and I would have to go down there and fight him.

1227
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,520
You have to fight again.

1228
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:11,840
Yeah.

1229
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:18,240
Yeah, oh, yeah, we have the streets of rage. Yeah, the fucking super Street Fighter style. I had to go I had to use my

Oh yeah, I'm in a friggin' military.

1236
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Does it find Street Fighter V and just like logging 50 hours of playtime in it, but it's just the fighter select screen and you're just looking at it at candy?

1237
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,400
That's kind of what like Dead or Alive is.

1238
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,400
Yeah, pretty much.

1239
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,400
Yeah, it's just like, just the big tit people from Street Fighter.

1240
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,400

01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Alright, this room is cooking my brain.
