This one was completely silent.

Oh, God.

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Did you drop anything on it?

No.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It just smells like dirty hands.

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,320
because I just dropped it. It came with splash back. This is my final of my

45
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,360
bullshit beers that it's just whatever alcoholic thing that we have in our

46
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,120
fridge. So after this you're picking only heaters? After this I... For the next decade

47
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,000
plus of this podcast. I have to go outside and buy something actually

48
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,280
because this is... I was busy today. I was streaming. So I am drinking this Sandia

49
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,920
- A sandia white claw.

50
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,100
- Wow.

51
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,040
And guess, wow, this is crazy.

52
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,920
Guess what I just had before we hopped on?

53
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,440
- A sandia white claw. - A sandia white claw.

54
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,320
- Very, pretty close, a glass of sangria

55
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,760
from my local taco spot. - Oh, that's,

56
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,440
I don't think that's at all very, it's watermelon.

57
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,740
- So it has most of the exact same letters.

58
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,580
- Yeah. - Okay.

59
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,600
Maybe I agree. - It rhymes.

60
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,740
- And there was melon in it, so.

61
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,320
- Nice try. - And it's Mexican,

62
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,780
so you have been defeated.

63
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,280
- Why don't you go ahead?

64
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,840
- I have a

65
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,040
Lomza Piwojaznopin.

66
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,480
Doesn't that look good?

67
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,040
- In the Polish beers today, huh?

68
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
- Lomza Pinojaznopin.

69
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,880
- So what does that stand for?

70
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,640
- Well, it's a full-bodied beer,

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
and it was brewed in Poland.

72
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,060
Yeah, right.

73
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,060
Stands for crap beer.

74
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,540
Yeah, I really, really hope not.

75
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,640
So let's take a thing.

76
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
I think it's that's where like penis beer.

77
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,800
Yeah.

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,040
They drink.

79
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,240
Oh, no, it's drinking.

80
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Please be a full bodied crap.

81
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,100
Oh, full bodied penis beer.

82
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,900
Yeah.

83
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,840
Oh, my God, that is so bad.

84
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,400
I've seen it again.

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,900
Well, yeah.

86
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,960
OK, it's better the second time.

87
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
I knew it would be.

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,700
It was just shocking coming from Sangria.

89
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,440
sangria, it's fruity, it's whiny. The guy, I love the guy who makes the sangria. This

90
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,540
place that I got the sangria from tonight, last time we were there, my wife went in to

91
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,120
grab the, like we order takeout from it a lot and I sit out with the dog and she runs

92
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,500
in and grabs the stuff and the food. And the owner of the place was sitting there doing

93
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,220
like some kind of paperwork at one of the tables. And my wife looked at me and I did

94
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,400
I was like, like I waved at her and then he, I guess, saw it.

95
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,820
And then looked right at me and went, Hey, like,

96
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,740
and then realized I wasn't waving at him and like stopped really fast.

97
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,860
And so I've been afraid to go back, but he wasn't there tonight,

98
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,660
but it made me laugh really, really hard.

99
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,980
That's good. That's, you know, the people, people nowadays,

100
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,180
they really wish they could become like the regulars and so they get like

101
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,460
recognized by the staff. You, you, you, you, you have that already.

102
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,320
You just have to go back in there and just say hi.

103
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,580
I'm the waver.

104
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,220
Yeah, next time you wave at him, he feels comfortable.

105
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,360
I think I just got electrically shocked by this microphone.

106
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,260
I have the microphone on my chin, and it just shocked me so, so bad.

107
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,660
Try touching it with your lips.

108
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,820
No, I'm scared.

109
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,660
Now I'm really, really scared to get anywhere near it.

110
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,960
No, kiss it real quick.

111
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,720
No, I'm honestly scared.

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
It hurts so bad.

113
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,460
No, but if you kiss it, it'll be fine.

114
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,220
Well, it may have actually just caught one of my little hairs

115
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,960
from my face in it, but either way, OK, did not feel very, very good.

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,760
OK, Rex, introduce your thing.

117
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,100
OK, so I have three things, only one of which is a beer.

118
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,400
I have no idea what this is. And it's huge.

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,200
This is called a study break.

120
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
OK, bat blast of Baja flavor.

121
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,440
Disgrace.

122
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,200
Any info that you can give us would be huge right now

123
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,940
as we try to uncover what this means.

124
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,140
It just says it's gluten free.

125
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,340
Oh, it's a wine based hard seltzer.

126
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,680
You got a wine cooler.

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,580
Apparently, I've never had a wine.

128
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,280
So big for a white color.

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,080
It's massive. It's wine color.

130
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,880
Usually they're usually pretty.

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
What's the ABV on the other side?

132
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,940
Six and a half.

133
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,140
Yeah, they're usually pretty low alcohol.

134
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,920
All right. Six and a half.

135
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I mean, that compared to wine.

136
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Show me the other two options.

137
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,520
OK, I have a

138
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,920
lavender lemonade, hard kombucha.

139
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,740
Love that.

140
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
I love that.

141
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,980
Kylo.

142
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,060
Yeah, looks very good.

143
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,820
And finally, I have a

144
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,500
Krabby Cake double.

145
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,100
That's the beer, right?

146
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,100
That's the one that's.

147
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,780
You actually can't be stopped by

148
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,100
buying fucking beers

149
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,620
that are made for children.

150
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,060
It's crazy.

151
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,220
It's crazy.

152
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,020
Yeah.

153
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,780
You're buying Cocoa Melon beer.

154
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,560
Yeah, I would buy you.

155
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,660
I would buy Coco Melon.

156
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,980
Oh, my God, it'd be amazing.

157
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,700
And also, you know that these guys are not paying a licensing fee, right?

158
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,060
They're just putting Krabby Patty.

159
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,900
We could make a Coco Melon beer.

160
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,820
We couldn't. We should.

161
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,100
Breast Milk Stout Coco Melon beer.

162
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,820
Yeah, I'm to one of my I think I've maybe.

163
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,520
No, I don't think I've ever told this before, but I one time went over

164
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,300
to a friend of mine's house and her stepdad was doing like home brewing.

165
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,400
And he had a chalkboard that had all the brews he was working on.

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,240
and one of them was called Breast Milk Stout.

167
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,840
And I never asked him about it, but it really intrigued me.

168
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,680
- Yeah.

169
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,480
- I think that'd be funny if it actually was breast milk,

170
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
but I think it's one of those things

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,000
where it's just like a guy who makes a beard

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,400
and they just call it a fucking stupid bitch dog beard.

173
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,340
- I think he's a guy who kind of patterned

174
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,160
his whole stepdad, 'cause okay,

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
when you become a stepdad,

176
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,760
I think you have to have,

177
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,960
'cause you've never been a dad before,

178
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,200
So you didn't naturally grow into having like a dad's sort of style and personality.

179
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,000
I think that when you become a stepdad, you have to choose a persona

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,800
that is like usually a popular character from a piece of media.

181
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,000
And you have to be like, that is what I'm going to act like with my step kids.

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,160
And this guy chose Hank from Breaking Bad, Hank Schrader, D.A.

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,360
OK, who would you choose?

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,460
Huh? Who would you choose?

185
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
Me?

186
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,460
Yeah.

187
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,740
Stephen Crowner?

188
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Probably Stephen Colbert.

189
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,860
No, that's not fictional.

190
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,920
Probably Stephen Colbert.

191
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Those are not fictional.

192
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
No.

193
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Stephen Colbert's fictional.

194
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,440
I think I would choose Better Call Saul from Better Call Saul.

195
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
You would choose Saul Goodman?

196
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Is he a stepdad?

197
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,300
No, no, it doesn't have to be a stepdad.

198
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
That's what I'm saying.

199
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
It's just a personality.

200
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Yeah, you can just be a persona.

201
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,660
Yeah, so I would just turn into an insane lawyer who goes to jail.

202
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,060
I would definitely be Michael Scott.

203
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,860
I would be Michael Scott, no question.

204
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,860
Okay, I would be God.

205
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
You can't be God.

206
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Okay, God, first of all, we said fictional character.

207
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
So, nice fucking try.

208
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
I'm not going to let that one fly.

209
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Okay.

210
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
Second of all, it needs to be from popular media.

211
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
It needs to be singular.

212
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,860
Um, okay.

213
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,860
I'll just do better call Saul then.

214
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Okay. Yeah, one of the...

215
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,860
You'll be Kim.

216
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Kim would actually be such a hot...

217
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
If Kim was my step-mom.

218
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,260
My god bro.

219
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,300
I would be so scared of her.

220
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,340
Rex, I know, I think you know which one we would choose.

221
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,380
I don't know why you're pretending to not know.

222
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
Is it the Krabby Patty?

223
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Yes.

224
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,820
Is it the Krabby Patty Double Deluxe?

225
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
Is it cake?

226
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
No, no, I think you should choose the wine cooler.

227
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,140
Because you've done enough of these.

228
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,620
I know, that's what I was thinking.

229
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,380
Yeah, do the wine cooler.

230
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,780
Honestly my real life vote was going to be on the Kygo beer.

231
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,180
The what?

232
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,680
- The Kygo beer, the purple one?

233
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,340
- Oh, the Kyla, the hard-cone beer.

234
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,540
- Kyla, he's trying to say--

235
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,580
- Kyka, yeah.

236
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,940
- Yeah, come on, man.

237
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,500
- I said Kygo, like the guy.

238
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,340
- I don't know who you're talking about.

239
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,580
- Pick a number between one and two.

240
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,740
- Just choose the wine cooler.

241
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,420
You want it and I want it, that's two against one.

242
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,260
- Wine cooler.

243
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,160
- There we go, it's unanimous.

244
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,260
What did you guys think that the Smash Brothers

245
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,580
announcer was saying when he said unanimous?

246
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
Wait, what?

247
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,220
You know, when they

248
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,960
when they when they win and he goes

249
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
unanimous.

250
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,940
Mm hmm.

251
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,180
I thought he said they're animals

252
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,680
because there's so many animals in the

253
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,580
game.

254
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,820
He never says that.

255
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,580
Yes, he does.

256
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,020
Also, not that many animals.

257
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,160
Well, there's Fox and Falcon.

258
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,580
And I was here and

259
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,300
there's so many animals compared to a

260
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,580
normal MMA card.

261
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,560
Well, yeah, of course, there's a lot

262
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,580
more animals.

263
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,400
Yeah.

264
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Wait, what? Excuse me? I'm sorry. I missed this. I googled unanimous and I found the craziest

265
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,380
videos of all time.

266
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,180
You just googled unanimous?

267
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,860
I googled smash unanimous and some funny videos came up.

268
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,420
Oh god, I don't even want to see the funny videos.

269
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,380
This is not very good.

270
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,100
Really? That's disappointing. Yeah, my beer is really bad too.

271
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,740
It tastes like the worst Baja blast you've ever had.

272
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,580
That means it'll be a good episode because we aren't going to be focusing on this beer.

273
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,040
Although I saw somebody comment that they wish we talked more about beer.

274
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,740
I also saw that.

275
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,460
That's a funny thing.

276
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,700
I don't like, what do we know about beer?

277
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,340
Wait, well, you're allergic to this.

278
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,020
That is not a normal amount of burping for one sip of something.

279
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,660
That was fucked up.

280
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,860
That was so bad.

281
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,720
Okay.

282
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,780
Let's, let's go real quick.

283
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Facts about beers. They make you burp.

284
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,460
They make you pee.

285
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,700
They make you pee.

286
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
They definitely make you pee.

287
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,140
They make you drunk.

288
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,020
Sometimes.

289
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,340
If you drink, okay, caveat,

290
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,780
if you drink a lot, they make you

291
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
drunk.

292
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,000
If you drink a lot of anything, you

293
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,980
get drunk.

294
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Yeah. Water.

295
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,740
Okay. That's to be disputed by

296
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,140
scientists. We don't really know that

297
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
right now.

298
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,180
Let's call one up then.

299
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,140
Okay. Do you know any scientists?

300
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
Bling bling.

301
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,700
Actually, no.

302
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,340
I think we could call Noah and he would know something about that, right?

303
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,840
True.

304
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,540
He'd make some YouTube video he saw.

305
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,860
Number four, they come in a can sometimes.

306
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,620
But they can also come in a bottle or a glass.

307
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,540
Or a Stein.

308
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,340
Next week I'm pulling up with the...

309
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,220
When you guys are in town and we do a real life BWD, can we get Steins?

310
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,860
Sure.

311
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,540
The German things with the lids.

312
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,100
I would love that.

313
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,380
Yeah.

314
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,900
I want one so badly.

315
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,140
I just bought a Das Boot, which is a--

316
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,980
Like the one that Badlands chugs out of?

317
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,060
Yep, exactly that.

318
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,980
Whoa.

319
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,140
Like the Mega Waves.

320
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,700
Will you chug out of it?

321
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,100
I'm not gonna, I don't think I can chug a beer.

322
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,060
I don't think you're a chugger.

323
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,900
Yeah, he's not a chugger.

324
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,720
I agree with you.

325
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,820
I'm not a chugger.

326
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,300
I've never chugged in my entire life.

327
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,380
I used to be able to chug, not anymore though.

328
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,220
Something happens when you--

329
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,540
- How old are you when you shotgunned a beer?

330
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,780
- Fucking 17 years old.

331
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,620
- Really?

332
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,720
- Well, 18.

333
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,220
- God damn, dude, I think-- - 19, 19, 19.

334
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,420
- Yeah, I think it's been two months for me.

335
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,180
(laughing)

336
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,500
- Well, you're in college.

337
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,940
You're a young boy and you're in college.

338
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
- I'm starting to feel old, man.

339
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
- Yeah. - I am old, dude.

340
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,020
- We're just getting old.

341
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,380
- Guys, I don't wanna talk about being old.

342
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,460
This is the episode where we're celebrating my life.

343
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,060
celebrating your life? Because it comes out on my birthday. It comes out on your

344
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:46,380
birthday? Wait, your birthday is soon? I knew that. You don't know where my birthday is? I'm a good friend but I don't

345
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,180
know people's birthdays. No, I think I don't hold a personal calendar. I know

346
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:59,380
one of my brother's birthdays. Yeah. You know, okay, I was exactly the same way.

347
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:06,700
I realized that I kept not knowing when anyone's birthday was. So I just

348
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,820
used my phone to keep track of people's birthdays.

349
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,940
That's smart. That's a thoughtful thing to do.

350
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,580
That is very thoughtful. I hate my birthday so I don't want to celebrate mine and I

351
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,500
definitely don't want to celebrate someone else's.

352
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:27,140
I will also skip two years. Last two years I've skipped my birthday. I've said no to having a

353
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,140
- Once you hit 21, there's no birthday worth celebrating.

354
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,420
- No, maybe 100.

355
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,780
- Yeah, big distance between those.

356
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,060
- I will celebrate my 100th birthday.

357
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,500
I will have some friends over for my 100th birthday.

358
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,900
- Yeah.

359
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,340
- I think that's completely ridiculous.

360
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,140
I think you're not enjoying life the way you're supposed

361
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,980
to be enjoying life.

362
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,800
- No, I am enjoying life.

363
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
I enjoy life every day.

364
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,460
- You know what that tells me?

365
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,300
Yeah, exactly.

366
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,340
You know what that tells me about you?

367
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,020
- You're an attention hog, that you need to have a whole day

368
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,860
- No I'm not.

369
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,620
- That's just for yourself.

370
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,460
- Yeah.

371
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,280
- Did I say that?

372
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Did I ever say that?

373
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,900
- It's my birthday episode of podcast.

374
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,300
- Oh you did say this is my birthday episode.

375
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,780
- Well, this is, it comes out on my birthday

376
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,620
is what it said.

377
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,900
- It comes out on my birthday, it's my birthday episode.

378
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,500
- And it will be called birthday boy by anonymous decision.

379
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,260
- Yeah, 'cause you named the episodes.

380
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,900
- You do, yeah, which is by the way,

381
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,620
starting to piss me off a little bit.

382
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,260
That everything is, it's basically your little journal

383
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,540
at this point. - Yeah, you're always blogging,

384
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,820
dude, fucking start a medium. - Me and Rex,

385
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,560
we want some shine, okay?

386
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,620
Why is this show, here's me recording my conversation

387
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,760
with my friends, and here's me saying my little blurb

388
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
about it, oh, oh, they were so weird this week.

389
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,880
Shut the fuck up, okay?

390
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,420
- Fucking birthday bitch. - Okay, we're three

391
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,100
equal brothers. - That's right.

392
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,160
- Okay, for my birthday, you guys can write the title

393
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,100
and description of the episode then.

394
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,660
- Fuck you, bitch ass, for your birthday,

395
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,500
I'm getting you a new car. - No, do some work, ho.

396
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,340
- Yeah.

397
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,660
- Now it's my job.

398
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,140
- Yes, it is your job.

399
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,940
- It's literally your job.

400
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,780
- Okay.

401
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:06,860
I think you guys are being a little bit unreasonable.

402
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,020
Number one.

403
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,940
- Unreasonable?

404
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,560
We're putting you in a home.

405
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm done with you.

406
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,700
We're putting you in the senior center.

407
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,980
We're getting rid of you right now.

408
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,580
- That's not funny.

409
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,420
That is not funny to say that.

410
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,220
- We're getting you out of here.

411
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
No, don't say that.

412
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
No way he's going to the Mexican forest.

413
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
(laughter)

414
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,220
This shit is dropping off the one Mexican guy I know.

415
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
(laughter)

416
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,220
This was the senor de santo.

417
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Yeah, you guys just sit in there, just hammer nails into the same piece of sheet rock all day long.

418
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
Do OSHA violations.

419
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
(laughter)

420
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
He's served beer with breakfast.

421
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
(laughter)

422
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
scaffolding you've ever seen.

423
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
And fall off.

424
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
[Laughter]

425
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
[Laughter]

426
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
Oh, that is funny.

427
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,220
There's a bunch of people in wheelchairs, but it's all just because they're too drunk to walk by 2pm.

428
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,220
[Laughter]

429
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Oh, I guess none of this is funny.

430
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
These past couple minutes have not been funny.

431
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,220
This is a volleyball game where the net's 7'4" tall.

432
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,220
[Laughter]

433
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
[Laughter]

434
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
[Laughter]

435
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,220
They've got those like play school basketball hoops that are like...

436
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,340
Oh no, I'm kidding though.

437
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
They've got a little thing in the back of like...

438
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
I'm told of you, I'm told of both of you combined.

439
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
Pick up trucks.

440
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,340
In the back so they can ride them around.

441
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,820
Have you guys seen the video where the guy picks up the like Mexican dudes from Home

442
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Depot and he takes them to Disneyland?

443
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Yes.

444
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,140
- It is the best video ever.

445
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,980
(laughing)

446
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,420
Where they're like, I feel like that,

447
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,220
if Mr. Beast did that, so many people would be like,

448
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,460
oh, but just give the people money,

449
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,620
like they just want money.

450
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,500
Those guys do not want the money.

451
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,100
They wanted to be there so badly.

452
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,940
- Yeah, dude, they've never had a day off.

453
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,540
- They wanted to be at the fucking Disneyland so badly, dude.

454
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,420
- I think it's funny that they just got to spend

455
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,340
like a day at Disneyland with like the other two guys

456
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,780
that they just go do contract work instead of like their families.

457
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,720
Yeah, I was. But also, can you imagine like guys like that?

458
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,300
If they went to Disneyland with their kids and their wife, they work so hard.

459
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,700
I thought about this while I watched the video. I was like, they work so hard.

460
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,380
The only way they would go is if they like saved up money to do it.

461
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,700
They would be so worried about if their kids were having fun or if their wife was

462
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,540
having fun, they would not be riding.

463
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,060
Or the kids would keep asking for shit.

464
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,340
Exactly. They would not be riding any of the rides.

465
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,460
it would just be there.

466
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,780
Like it was nice that they didn't bring their kids, honestly.

467
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,140
Yeah, 100%.

468
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,780
These guys just got to like go on Space Mountain and forget that they had

469
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,420
like any kind of responsibility in their lives.

470
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,260
Yeah.

471
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,060
It was a really wonderful video.

472
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,940
I thought the best part of the video was at the end when, where like the guy

473
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,540
who's making the video like prevents like any like snootiness, like being like,

474
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,380
Oh, well, why do you, why do you take a day off with them?

475
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,900
They could have really used the money.

476
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,100
Could you just like give them like a thousand bucks each?

477
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,940
- Yeah.

478
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,340
- So that you--

479
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,160
(laughing)

480
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,200
- Don't worry about it.

481
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,460
(laughing)

482
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,080
- Yeah, but I'm thinking that maybe we'll do that with you

483
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,820
when you land in New York.

484
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,580
I'm gonna talk really slowly to you

485
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,420
and tell you that we're going to--

486
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,500
- Topgolf. - Houston.

487
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,320
- Mountain.

488
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,160
(laughing)

489
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
- We're not even going, we're just going

490
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,220
to a different city.

491
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,120
We're going to Philadelphia today.

492
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,020
- A little bit.

493
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,860
- Yeah. - You see.

494
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,860
I've never been.

495
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,700
- Oh, oh, see.

496
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,860
- You've never been to Philadelphia?

497
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,060
It's pretty nice.

498
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,100
I like Philadelphia.

499
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,620
It's a lot better than Boston, actually.

500
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,500
- I like traveling,

501
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,860
but I don't know where I would like to travel in the U.S.

502
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,620
that's a place that I've never been.

503
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,220
- Cities you've been to.

504
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,780
- I've been to Texas, I've been to--

505
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,620
- Yeah, cities.

506
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,140
- L.A., and I've been to New York.

507
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,620
You know, the cities like San Antonio, Houston.

508
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,480
- I would say the big ones to go to,

509
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,300
you should definitely go to an East Coast beach town,

510
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,220
like in Florida or like in Outer Banks in North Carolina.

511
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,540
You should definitely go New Orleans.

512
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,380
- Yeah.

513
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,220
- You should go to Chicago.

514
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,540
- I've never been to New Orleans.

515
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,380
- Oh, but Chicago.

516
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,200
- You should go.

517
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,040
- I did not like Chicago.

518
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,880
- Oh yeah, you haven't.

519
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,700
- He did go to Chicago.

520
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,540
- You didn't like Chicago?

521
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,380
- I did not like Chicago at all.

522
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,200
- Oh, Chicago's so nice.

523
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,040
Did you go to the lake?

524
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,500
- No.

525
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,620
I mean, I stayed like in the outskirts of the city.

526
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,540
- And then you were disappointed it wasn't edible?

527
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,740
- The bean is whacked it.

528
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,720
I thought the bean was cool.

529
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,680
- There's a lot of like--

530
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,160
- He would like it more if it was a refried bean.

531
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,000
- The thing is so--

532
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
(laughing)

533
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,840
- Enough racist jokes on my birthday.

534
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,080
- We already did Senior Works Center,

535
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,720
we don't have to do more than that, right?

536
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,520
That one's probably the limit of racism

537
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,760
we can get away with.

538
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,420
I think that so much of US tourism though is like,

539
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,840
whoever's visiting has to be somewhat interested

540
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,680
in like the colonial era of US history

541
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,240
for like this place to be nice, unless it's very beautiful.

542
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,160
So like Seattle or like a lot of parts of California,

543
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,420
they're just nice.

544
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,560
But if you're on the East coast,

545
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,680
a lot of it is just fucking muggy, disgusting shit

546
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,000
and like highway.

547
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,340
And so for it to be interesting at all,

548
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,420
there needs to be half demolished buildings

549
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,340
that used to be Paul Bunyan's outhouse or whatever.

550
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,440
Like that's the fun part.

551
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,260
That's the only nice part about Boston

552
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,160
is that they have Paul Revere's house.

553
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
And like, I still need to go to Boston.

554
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,520
I mean, you're right, but.

555
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,040
Boston is such a shit city.

556
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,560
I love it, but the bars close at one o'clock.

557
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:56,320
They, uh, even though it's like a very young city, it's more expensive

558
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,200
than anywhere except San Francisco.

559
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,640
Um, the food is terrible.

560
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,520
Who gives a, a lobster roll?

561
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,720
That's not impressive to me that you put the most expensive meat possible

562
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
on a fucking hot dog.

563
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,860
Yeah, like that's not a nice meal.

564
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,900
Yeah.

565
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,640
We said you haven't been to New Orleans.

566
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,000
You should definitely go to New Orleans.

567
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,080
We should go to New Orleans.

568
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,640
We should go to Vegas.

569
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,140
We should.

570
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,040
Yes.

571
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,780
We should do a Calypso root strip and go to North Carolina.

572
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,840
You guys would love North Carolina.

573
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,880
Yeah, I think I would.

574
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,380
Yeah.

575
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,720
It's so, so nice.

576
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,040
I went to meet your entire family.

577
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,480
I didn't realize how nice North Carolina was really until, I mean, I guess that's

578
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,360
everybody's story, but until you move away and then you're like, oh yeah, I was

579
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:53,200
like three fucking miles from like one of the nicest beaches on the East Coast.

580
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,560
Then I just never went because I was watching TV.

581
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,980
Yeah.

582
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,260
Which I have with North Carolina.

583
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,760
Do you have that with Arizona at all?

584
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,600
Where you're like--

585
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,420
- Not really.

586
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,520
- Not really, 'cause there's not that.

587
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,360
You just get like--

588
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,720
- It's like, oh, you're two hours from the Grand Canyon.

589
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,560
You know?

590
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,380
- Well, okay.

591
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,220
Have you been to the Grand Canyon?

592
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,200
- Of course.

593
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,040
It's beautiful.

594
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,360
- What was your reaction when you went to the Grand Canyon?

595
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,040
- A couple seconds of silence to take it in.

596
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,880
- Yeah.

597
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,700
- And then being like,

598
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,480
"Man, I can't believe I have to drive two hours to get home."

599
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
(laughing)

600
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,740
That is, I'm sure, the difference between living near it

601
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,900
and traveling to it.

602
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,900
We went on tour, me, Pierce, Patrick, and Cameron,

603
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,740
30 seconds in, all four of us are bawling, crying,

604
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,880
looking at the Grand Canyon, like,

605
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,700
"Oh my God, it's so beautiful,"

606
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,340
and doing that for an hour, and then walking away,

607
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,980
and all feeling a little self-conscious

608
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,940
because of how gay it was that we all cried

609
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,900
as soon as we saw the Grand Canyon.

610
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,860
- It is really beautiful.

611
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,700
I mean, I do want to do like--

612
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,060
It's not even beautiful, it's scary.

613
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,900
It's terrifying.

614
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,020
Yeah, like natural parks and shit like that.

615
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,660
Like, you know, like big wonders of the world type shit.

616
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,300
Before you leave California, you should go to Yosemite.

617
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,860
Yeah, I need to do that.

618
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,220
Yeah, Yosemite's very, very nice.

619
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,660
So there's a lot of like really beautiful--

620
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,780
Big mountainous, where's Occapitan?

621
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,020
Occapitan is in Yosemite and Half Dome.

622
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,340
They're both in Yosemite.

623
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,300
I saw some TikToks about that movie Free Solo yesterday

624
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,500
and I was about to re-watch it but I fell asleep.

625
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,180
That's a crazy movie.

626
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,980
- Dude, my problem with these guys who are free climbing,

627
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,340
you're doing it for extra points,

628
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,500
just fucking plug the piece of metal into the rock.

629
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,420
Like, why are you being such a,

630
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,300
like, oh no, I don't need,

631
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,620
you're better than a piece of rope

632
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,540
that keeps you from falling to your death.

633
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,900
You're too cool.

634
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,740
- They are too cool.

635
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,460
- Just put it in. - I think that is cool.

636
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,700
- No, I think that is cool. - They're too adrenaline, dude.

637
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,860
They love risk.

638
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,940
then do drugs like every other person.

639
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,860
- Yeah, the amount of risk you would get

640
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,820
from free climbing a mountain is the same amount of risk

641
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,040
you get from doing cocaine in Brooklyn.

642
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,500
- Pretty much.

643
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,940
- Yeah. - Yeah.

644
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,740
Yeah, cocaine is a bad drug, man.

645
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,660
I don't think I will ever do it again as long as I live.

646
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,700
You know what it is?

647
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,880
It's too pitiful of a drug to be doing.

648
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,780
- It's embarrassing a little bit.

649
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,540
It really is. That is an embarrassing drug. If you do,

650
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,740
if you like do cocaine, that's just embarrassing.

651
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,180
It's because it's like a,

652
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,940
like it feels like you should be doing it out of like the tube that holds

653
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,180
Corella DeVille's cigarette. Like you should, it's not like a,

654
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,340
there's nothing cool about doing it. Like it's very dainty.

655
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,380
I used to snort crushed up Adderall out of a $1 bill, which is like the most

656
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,220
pathetic.

657
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,340
That's so awesome.

658
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,340
A $1 bill specifically.

659
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
A $1 bill.

660
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,680
Because people will do cocaine and be like, "It has to be out of a $100 bill."

661
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
And you're sitting there with Adderall.

662
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
A $1 bill that was fucked up.

663
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Yeah.

664
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,660
Like, if you had it, you would have done it out of a Canadian loonie, like less than a

665
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
dollar.

666
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Yeah.

667
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
Just a coin.

668
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Yeah, a coin.

669
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,860
Yeah, I remember our house got broken into and my rolled up dollar bill was just sitting

670
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,700
on my desk, dyed blue and orange from all the powder.

671
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,660
And the cop was just like looking at it, being like,

672
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,180
should I do something about this?

673
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
- He should have.

674
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,900
- He should have, he should have killed me.

675
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,540
- Yeah, he should have shot you in the spot.

676
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,300
- I think honestly, I'm coming, in my old age,

677
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,380
in my late 20s, I'm coming to the realization

678
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,820
that the only good drug is nicotine.

679
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,460
- Yeah. - It's the only good drug.

680
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,540
Every other drug will keep you back in every way.

681
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,520
And nicotine will make you soar higher

682
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,300
than you ever have before.

683
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,520
- There's a, the big thing right now is like,

684
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,520
among like pseudo intellectual, like nootropics guys is nicotine gum.

685
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,600
Yeah, no, no, I know. I know all about this. This is not even pseudo intellectuals.

686
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,340
A lot of like academics do nicotine gum and they've never smoked a cigarette in

687
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,900
their lives. Yeah. Cause it's like cigarettes obviously bad for you.

688
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,020
Vaping obviously pretty bad for you. Well,

689
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,260
this is the funny thing about nicotine. Nicotine is technically good for you.

690
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,080
It's like prevents Alzheimer's. It's like neuro protective or whatever.

691
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,300
it helps your brain in a lot of ways.

692
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,060
- So nicotine gum just like good for you then?

693
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,520
- Yeah, I mean the only downside to nicotine gum is,

694
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,360
you can definitely get addicted to it.

695
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,560
Yeah, that's the only downside.

696
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,400
- Yeah, but it's the same with cancer, right?

697
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,140
- And it's expensive.

698
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,300
- It is very expensive.

699
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,100
I was thinking today about getting some of those Zen packs,

700
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,980
the ones you pack your lip with.

701
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,820
- Yeah.

702
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,220
- That looks so much fun.

703
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,060
- I know, dude.

704
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,860
You got to make your shit look like insane.

705
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,860
Yeah.

706
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
You don't think I look good with that?

707
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
No, that looks stupid.

708
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Also, you're in New York.

709
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,860
Whatever.

710
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
No one does that in New York.

711
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,860
Who gives a fuck?

712
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,340
The only people who do that are like people in like rural America and like anyone like

713
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,300
northern Europe.

714
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,100
I want to be, I want to bring that here though.

715
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,540
If my dad did not chew tobacco and spit into Pepsi cans that I accidentally drank growing

716
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,540
up, I would definitely do chewing tobacco.

717
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,700
That is by far the coolest way to do tobacco.

718
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,460
It's so disgusting.

719
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,620
It's so like you're spitting all the time like a horse.

720
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
I love that.

721
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,500
Yeah, I used to be homies with this like vet who he just would bring over like an ammo

722
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,980
can like a huge ammo can and then just like just spit into it all day on our patio because

723
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,340
he couldn't do it where he lives.

724
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,140
So he just come to our house and sit on our patio for like 10 hours and do it.

725
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,340
Have you guys ever heard Chad's story about how he did?

726
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:41,080
tobacco the first time when he was like 16 years old and he worked at a grocery store

727
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,180
and like one of his co-workers sold him chewing tobacco and he got like the one with the highest

728
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,780
nicotine and basically put the entire thing in his mouth.

729
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
Oh dude.

730
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,340
And he was driving home and he passed out while he was driving and like.

731
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,340
Oh my god.

732
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,540
Like woke up he was like he was like on the side of the road just like passed out in his

733
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
car.

734
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,540
His car just like slowly came to a stop.

735
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,540
Oh my god.

736
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,940
- Oh my God. - He like threw up

737
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,320
and then got home and he was like past his curfew

738
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,500
and his mom was sitting on the front porch

739
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,980
and he like walks up, she's like,

740
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,820
"Where have you been?"

741
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,820
And he just shits his pants.

742
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,080
(laughing)

743
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,280
- Oh man.

744
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,140
That's brutal.

745
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,460
- It's so funny, first time you ever do any tobacco at all.

746
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,620
You just ruined your fucking life.

747
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,460
(laughing)

748
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,700
- Yeah, he could have just fucking died.

749
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,740
- I love him.

750
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,580
- Yeah, I'm thinking.

751
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,740
- We should have him on sometimes.

752
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,340
he's got so many stories like that.

753
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,940
- Yeah, well when we're in New York,

754
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,140
we can do it in a trip. - Oh yeah, true.

755
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,980
True, that's a great idea.

756
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,740
- By the way, where's he gonna stay?

757
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,620
Is he staying like at one night?

758
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,580
- Yeah, he's staying like one night.

759
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,820
I think he's getting a hotel.

760
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,660
Maybe we'll--

761
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,660
- He should just like stay with us.

762
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,380
- Yeah, yeah, true, he probably should.

763
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,300
- Yeah. - We'll figure it out with him.

764
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,620
- Yeah, anyways, he could have died,

765
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
and that's why. - Yeah.

766
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
I'm trying to, I don't think I ever,

767
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,740
the only time I've ever had like nicotine poisoning

768
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,100
When I first moved here, I smoked Marlboro Reds for like one week.

769
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,940
And one night we were playing Warzone and I smoked.

770
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,180
I went up to my roof between games and I smoked like

771
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,580
two of them back to back.

772
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,700
Yeah. And I sat on my roof for an hour

773
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,180
and I got a bunch of discord messages from you guys like, where did you go?

774
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:25,380
I was just sitting on my roof just like, OK, so this is how I die.

775
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,400
I die from smoking two cigarettes and

776
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,740
Starving to death because it does make you feel awful.

777
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,340
It's the sickest you will ever be.

778
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,780
Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,580
Cigarettes will really fuck you up.

780
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
I grew up with a smoke.

781
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,180
Southern cuts, Marlboro, Southern cuts.

782
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,680
And I never even heard of that smoke like smoke fire than one time,

783
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
like in a row.

784
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,880
I just felt so fucking sick.

785
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,500
Just like dying, just like laying on the ground.

786
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,740
Yeah, it's just what you want.

787
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,080
You feel like hot, you have to get a cold ground on your back.

788
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,700
Yeah.

789
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,500
Yeah.

790
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,180
Sometimes when I vape too much, I'll like lay in bed and have the spins.

791
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,300
I love that though.

792
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,640
I miss that so badly.

793
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,620
How would the, what?

794
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,940
The spins like the world is spinning.

795
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:19,920
I remember I, I used to, when I would vape, I'd wake up and I would wait like 30

796
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,560
minutes before I first vaped to get like kind of accustomed to what it was like

797
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,120
having no nicotine in my body, be like, "God, this sucks.

798
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,960
"I hate this.

799
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,880
"Waking up feels so bad."

800
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,440
And then I would hit the vape

801
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,600
approximately 600 times straight.

802
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,880
And then lay back down and feel like I was in,

803
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,320
like Crimson and Clover would start playing.

804
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,720
I felt psychedelic 'cause the fan was moving so fast.

805
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,880
Oh my God, what an amazing drug.

806
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,080
- Truly.

807
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,240
- Every day we talk to you, you go,

808
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,080
"I just wanna get into vaping so bad."

809
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,320
and you always talk about it like it's a new thing,

810
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,520
but you've been like this for the past two years.

811
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,720
- Like I wasn't addicted to it for two years,

812
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,560
for a long time.

813
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,400
I still have a--

814
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,160
- You have a very addictive personality.

815
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,560
You always have to be addicted to one thing in your life.

816
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,160
- I'm addicted to working out right now.

817
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,000
- Yeah?

818
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
- Yeah, that's my current addiction.

819
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,680
So that's how you conquer having an addictive personality,

820
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,520
I think.

821
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,720
- Yeah, what do you think is gonna be the next thing though?

822
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,560
Coming up?

823
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,040
- Probably fucking smack, yeah.

824
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,880
(laughs)

825
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,960
- My pills.

826
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,280
- I could see you as a pill head.

827
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,880
- Yeah, me too.

828
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,200
- Your head kinda looks like a pill.

829
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,480
- It does look like a pill.

830
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
- Sorry, I didn't mean that.

831
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,320
- What if I showed you the top of my head,

832
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,280
there's a perfect line right down the middle.

833
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,120
(laughs)

834
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,840
- It says like PR 20.

835
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,680
- Yeah.

836
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,520
Exactly the weight of my head.

837
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
60 pounds.

838
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Two pounds BR.

839
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,100
Bro.

840
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,680
My head is definitely 60 pounds.

841
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,840
I think I carry most of my weight in my head.

842
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:07,760
I did look at, I was with somebody the other day and I, we, I got,

843
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,480
I was, we were hanging out with them and then I got into the car and I told my

844
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,760
wife, I was like, I think that my head is literally twice the size of that guy's

845
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:16,980
head.

846
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,280
And she was like, what?

847
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,600
I don't think your head is that big.

848
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
I have a giant head.

849
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
We should take measurements on Caleb's head.

850
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I have a giant fucking head.

851
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Anybody who's seen me, if you're listening to this

852
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
if you've seen me at a live show, you know

853
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
that the only reason it didn't look like I have

854
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
the biggest head you've ever seen is because

855
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Patrick's head is somehow even bigger.

856
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
[laughter]

857
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I have a big fucking shitty head.

858
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,040
It's funny how Patrick looks like a little doll.

859
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Yeah.

860
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Yeah. He looks so small.

861
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,240
- Moonish proportions.

862
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,920
(laughing)

863
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,760
- Yeah, I think we should--

864
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,240
- His eyes are like this big, it's crazy.

865
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,600
- Yeah, we should definitely measure your head

866
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,440
when we're in New York.

867
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,600
We need to like weigh it-- - Feel free, man.

868
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,640
- We need to measure it.

869
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,520
- We'll weigh my head, I'm fucking down.

870
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,680
I bet my head weighs more than anybody except Julio's head.

871
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,840
Julio has an even bigger head than Pat.

872
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,600
- I do think I have a big head as well.

873
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,040
- But yours doesn't stand out as much

874
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,200
because you're just big.

875
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,040
- Right.

876
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,880
- Yeah, I guess.

877
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,180
I guess it like fits. - You're taller, yeah.

878
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,540
If I was your size, if I was your height,

879
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,660
maybe my head would be normal.

880
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,080
But on my body, on my skinny little way fish frame,

881
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,900
pretty much like that.

882
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,740
- Your cute little body.

883
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,700
- My cute little feminine body.

884
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,620
- I think I'd still look weird if I was bald.

885
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,780
I think if you were tall and bald,

886
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,140
you would still look weird.

887
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,860
- Man.

888
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,500
- I think Caleb looks normal.

889
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,260
And I think he looks great with a hat on for some reason.

890
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,680
much better it is awful that I look so much better with a head all than having

891
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,580
my body nobody everybody says oh man no you actually rock it shut the fuck up

892
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,060
shut up dude would you say that to a little person a dwarf you actually say

893
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,980
so good as yeah you actually look really good short and small with a disability

894
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
No!

895
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,620
Oh, hang on guys, I'm getting my other beer, my second beer.

896
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,620
I opened mine by the way, I opened my second beer.

897
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,140
This Bud Light with Lime.

898
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,500
This is a classic, this is one of my favorite drinks ever.

899
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,820
One of my favorite drinks ever is a Tall Boy Bud Light with Lime.

900
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,080
I have so many amazing memories.

901
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,240
And just thank you for supporting the Bud Light Corporation.

902
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,540
They need it, bro.

903
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,540
They need it.

904
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,100
This is one of my favorite, I hate to say it,

905
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,260
it's one of my favorite beers of all time.

906
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,100
- I got my second beer.

907
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,400
- You, I just saw you pick that back up.

908
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,240
What happened?

909
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,080
You thought you had two and you don't.

910
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,300
- It's all good, let's move on.

911
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
What do you guys think about basketball?

912
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,220
- I think there's like two hoops

913
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,340
and like 10 guys on the floor

914
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,580
and they go back and forth.

915
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,540
Average score between like 80 and 120.

916
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,580
- I was taken to a Knicks game the other day

917
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,280
as a wedding gift.

918
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,620
I was taken to a Knicks game

919
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,420
and those are.

920
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,460
The worst fans

921
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,320
in live sports,

922
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,600
Knicks fans, Knicks fans are fucking atrocious.

923
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,540
I get maybe it's the playoff thing

924
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,940
because it's all like rich people buying these tickets.

925
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,700
Yeah, they are so rude and unfriendly.

926
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,720
No. I had this fucking, I had an Israeli guy tell me as I like walked, I have to pee a lot, okay?

927
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:50,320
Sue me. I peed a couple times. And as I'm sitting, I am halfway through the row. So I'm like, "Hey,

928
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,480
can I get in?" Everybody's standing up. He stands up and he says, "Yeah, that's your last time

929
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,840
though." And I was like, I said, "What the fuck are you talking about?" He's like, "Well, I just

930
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,820
I just don't wanna sit up again.

931
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,060
I was like, if I have to piss, I'm gonna go pee.

932
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,880
And he's like, (mumbles)

933
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,720
- How far into the game was this?

934
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,540
- I was like, was he serious,

935
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,920
or was he just doing it in that way people do

936
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,240
where they just say something?

937
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,320
- People in New York City are just so rude.

938
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,320
I was talking about this today with somebody.

939
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Everybody here is so unbelievably rude

940
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,520
for no reason at all

941
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,920
because they did not grow up Christian.

942
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
Yeah. Right.

943
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,000
This is the truth.

944
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And they grew up Jewish.

945
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Or anything.

946
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,720
But if you grew up Christian, you were taught,

947
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,760
like me and Noah, we're very good boys.

948
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,480
We're polite. We're courteous to strangers.

949
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,720
Well, you are scared of everyone.

950
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,760
You're scared of the world.

951
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,880
No, no, no. I'm sweet to people.

952
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,240
That's the difference. I will be sweet to people.

953
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,320
I will go out of my way for my fellow man.

954
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,760
And people in New York City, they will shit on your face.

955
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
They were shit in your,

956
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,120
and I always thought that was a myth.

957
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,160
I was like, oh, it can't be that bad.

958
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,000
No, it's terrible.

959
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,200
It's the same thing in Boston though.

960
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,120
It really is, I think Catholics are just wrong.

961
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,960
They are wrong people.

962
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,080
- I think people always say this,

963
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,760
but I've never actually encountered this.

964
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,000
People say that about people in Paris.

965
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,640
People say this about people in New York.

966
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,840
I've never really encountered a rude person.

967
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,360
- Yeah, I don't think people have been

968
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,120
particularly rude to me, but I also don't stand up to people.

969
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,700
- I will say Los Angeles people are more rude

970
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,720
in Los Angeles than New York.

971
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,720
So I haven't really experienced it.

972
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,720
When I lived, I mean also, that's because you have a nice head of hair and you look sweet.

973
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,720
I think I have a really, really off-putting look to me when I walk around.

974
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
That is true.

975
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
People, yeah.

976
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I walk around, I have a bald head, I have my mean dog, I'm short and squat.

977
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,720
People think that I'm just ugly and going to attack them.

978
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
And so they have to act offensively.

979
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:11,580
Yeah, I didn't mention the white thing yeah of course it's basically the greatest in order to be white new york city these days yeah am i right yeah.

980
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:19,200
What's the record sounds like that that energy hill which is just bring sin people you want to talk to him and shares stuff with them.

981
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,380
Yeah, he does look sweet. He's the perfect combination of a man and a woman.

982
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,380
That's right.

983
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,380
So people of all...

984
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,380
Wait.

985
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:35,380
People of all genders and sexualities want to talk to him.

986
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Yeah. They also know that I'm an easy mark.

987
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,380
Yep.

988
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,380
Yeah, I can see that.

989
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,540
- Yeah, like I remember when we went to like some CVS

990
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,620
in Times Square, some homeless guy was like,

991
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,740
"Hey man, can I have 10 bucks to get a hero

992
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,140
at the hero stand?"

993
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,060
I was like, "Yeah, that, yeah, for sure, man.

994
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,940
Here you go."

995
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,980
- You really do just have a friendly face.

996
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,620
Nobody's ever asked me for money like that.

997
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,660
- Yeah.

998
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,060
- I think I really just, people see me and they're like,

999
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,000
"Okay, I loved you and this is England,

1000
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,820
but I do not want to talk to you."

1001
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,500
- I remember-- - Can I just keep

1002
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,460
walking around?

1003
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,020
When we went to the Noguchi Museum and we took the train back,

1004
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,220
there was like this like dude that came on and he was like,

1005
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,220
you know, I'm a Muslim, but, uh, I fuck with the Jews.

1006
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,620
And he like looked directly at me.

1007
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:33,380
He's like, and the Chinese and the Mexicans, I fuck with all y'all.

1008
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,180
Yeah.

1009
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,260
He realized he was looking right at you while he said,

1010
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,180
yeah, Chinese and Mexicans.

1011
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,540
Yeah.

1012
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,040
- No, and then he looked at Annie and Julio.

1013
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,540
- Also me and Annie.

1014
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,620
He just came into our group saying all that shit.

1015
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,780
And we were still like, "I don't have any money."

1016
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,420
Sorry, man, nothing on me.

1017
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,300
- Dude, it kills me that I'm the white guy

1018
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,580
in our four-person group.

1019
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,980
- I know. - Yeah.

1020
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,360
- I gotta change something. - Well, someone has to be.

1021
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,220
You think you could get the transracial surgery?

1022
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,100
- I don't know which, I mean, of course I could, rich,

1023
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,060
but I don't know which race I would switch to.

1024
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,140
I think you should do Puerto Rican.

1025
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,620
Puerto Rican is the obvious choice for me.

1026
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,900
I would say. It is.

1027
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,720
I would say I'm--

1028
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,560
It's either Puerto Rican or Brazilian.

1029
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,220
I would say I have 40% of what they need

1030
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,540
to do Puerto Rican.

1031
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,380
Yeah. Yeah.

1032
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,980
I think-- You should get a skull tattoo.

1033
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,820
But like--

1034
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,780
Like a Raiders tattoo.

1035
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,020
Oh yeah.

1036
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,420
A friend of mine has a, he's such a genius.

1037
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,820
He's Puerto Rican actually.

1038
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,620
He got, he started balding

1039
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,260
And so he shaved his head and he got a gorilla,

1040
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,500
a gorilla tattooed right on the top of his head.

1041
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,080
And so now you have no idea where his hairline starts

1042
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,140
'cause he has a giant black tattoo in the middle of his head

1043
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,220
that goes past his hairline.

1044
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,320
So he can grow his hair out.

1045
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,860
He's like balder than me, but you would never know.

1046
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,900
- I don't think that's smart.

1047
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,740
I think it's painful. - It's pretty smart.

1048
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,860
- Your head looks weird for the rest of your life.

1049
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,180
- Especially for a poor- - I mean, your head's

1050
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,340
gonna look weird no matter what.

1051
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,940
- He told me, I was like, "Dude, just shave your head."

1052
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,780
And he was like, bro, you don't understand

1053
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,020
what it's like to be a balding Puerto Rican guy.

1054
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,860
- True. - I was like, oh yeah,

1055
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,100
I guess that's probably a little different.

1056
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,900
For a white dude, it's just kind of expected.

1057
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,940
- Right.

1058
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,940
- Well, because like they do this,

1059
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,980
like perfect lines and they're doing one of these,

1060
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,180
the Drake swoop in their hair and stuff.

1061
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,100
- Everyone's a bald.

1062
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,620
- I don't have that, you know?

1063
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,260
Like I have no, there's no culture

1064
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,220
of like white guys with hair.

1065
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,020
- We have to break this myth of,

1066
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,300
there had never been a single bald person.

1067
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,740
Every time there's a bald person,

1068
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,340
there has to be like a thing.

1069
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,180
We need to break out of this.

1070
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,540
- It doesn't have to be a thing, it's sad.

1071
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,700
- No, it's not sad.

1072
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,700
- I live in, I probably live in the lowest social caste

1073
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,920
that you can possibly live in in the United States.

1074
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,500
Yeah, bald white guy.

1075
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,940
Bald white guy under six feet, yeah.

1076
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,920
With a big ass head, a small penis,

1077
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,840
and basically the worst fashion sense,

1078
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,980
and an ugly wife and a dumb dog.

1079
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,180
Yeah, and you're gay.

1080
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,960
I live in the, yeah, and I'm gay too.

1081
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,080
I live in the lowest possible,

1082
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,200
there should be a shrill about me,

1083
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,240
like everything should be catered to me at this point.

1084
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,900
Yeah. Yeah.

1085
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,180
- I think, maybe not right now,

1086
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,980
but I think someone could write a movie about your life.

1087
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,860
I think you could be a movie star.

1088
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,780
- That would be one of the worst movies ever made.

1089
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,620
- No.

1090
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,020
- My life has been so boring.

1091
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,860
I've lived in three places in my entire life.

1092
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,740
- It would be a comedy.

1093
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,580
- Yeah.

1094
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,460
- A comedy about a guy who's,

1095
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,980
has the worst--

1096
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,840
- Like a Forrest Gump type thing.

1097
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,680
- Yeah.

1098
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,980
- So you think I'm retarded?

1099
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,580
(laughing)

1100
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,420
You can't say that to somebody.

1101
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,800
You can't say that they can make a Forrest Gump

1102
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,900
about your life, you'd think I'm retarded.

1103
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,860
(laughing)

1104
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,780
Come on, dude.

1105
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,860
- I think they could.

1106
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,620
- No, the main character of the Forrest Gump movie

1107
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,260
would be Patrick, and you would be the guy

1108
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,100
that says-- - Jenny.

1109
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,920
- Bubba Trump.

1110
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,760
- Yeah, you would be Jenny.

1111
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,600
- Bubba Trump.

1112
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,420
- Bubba Gump.

1113
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,260
- Bubba Trump.

1114
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,100
(laughing)

1115
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,500
- And then you almost said Bubba Gadoosh.

1116
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,260
(laughing)

1117
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,380
Bubba Trump Shrimp Company?

1118
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,220
- The Bubba Gump, yeah, that'd be--

1119
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,780
- That'd be fire.

1120
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,620
- You're that guy. - Shrimp at Hotel Company?

1121
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,460
- Yeah.

1122
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,660
cheaper hotels and golf courses.

1123
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,140
Yep.

1124
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
I'm really excited for him to come back.

1125
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,700
He's going to win.

1126
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,420
I think I'm going to walk into my wife's work where she works at like a really,

1127
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,340
she works at like an upscale, upscale like store with like young professional

1128
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,420
owners. I think I want to walk in, uh,

1129
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,580
in like a full MAGA drip.

1130
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:44,620
I have like a blacks for Trump hat and like airbrushed,

1131
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,940
airbrushed true ease with his face on him and shit.

1132
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,940
I just be like, what the fuck is up?

1133
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,260
I'm her husband.

1134
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,260
You know how like, uh, you gotta wait like seven years getting

1135
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,540
ducted into the hall of fame.

1136
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,420
Yeah.

1137
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,020
Like sports.

1138
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,620
It's like, if he wins again, that's another like 10 years.

1139
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,140
We have to wait for the Trump hat to be okay to wear.

1140
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,700
Cause you know, for sure that our kids will be wearing it.

1141
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,780
Like it's the funniest shit ever.

1142
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
Yeah, dude.

1143
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,300
Like it's a Reagan Bush shirt.

1144
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,900
- Yeah, exactly.

1145
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,580
But if he wins again,

1146
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,820
then we just set that back eight fucking years.

1147
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,100
- Yeah, you're 100% right.

1148
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,340
- I think we, as a group, me and you,

1149
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,980
we are like a year out of getting MAGA hats

1150
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,580
and just wearing them as a joke.

1151
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,940
- I would not wear a MAGA hat.

1152
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,660
I gave a hat to Patrick

1153
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,780
'cause it looked too much like a MAGA hat.

1154
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,620
- Really? - The boss hat?

1155
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,180
- And then he wore it a lot.

1156
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,580
- The boss hat? - No, no.

1157
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,420
No, it was just like red,

1158
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,540
it was just a red hat with white lettering on the front.

1159
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,140
look just like from far away look just like a MAGA hat.

1160
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,740
Yeah, well, that's that was such a funny thing when the MAGA hats

1161
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,340
first came out was people making like MAGA hat knockoffs and it's

1162
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,940
like it just looks like the hat.

1163
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,040
Yeah, exactly.

1164
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
I'm going to get real close to see the difference.

1165
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,740
My swastika has the word not right in the middle of it.

1166
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,040
That's what I always thought was so funny.

1167
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,440
There was like you ever seen those pictures of people who get

1168
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,640
like a tattoo of like a swastika with like a like a crossed out

1169
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,940
like anti sign on it.

1170
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,140
Yeah, bro for for five minutes, but while he was switching ink colors,

1171
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,640
you had a swastika tattoo,

1172
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,540
which is dope.

1173
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,180
That's what I would do if I went to when I go to prison.

1174
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,980
Yeah, swastika.

1175
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,980
And when I get out, when you get to like big nose.

1176
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:35,620
Just keep putting it off, getting the second tattoo.

1177
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,180
Yeah, I have a headache.

1178
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,180
I don't know about the money for the deposit.

1179
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,680
Yeah, that's completely wrong, guys.

1180
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
We shouldn't joke about that.

1181
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,280
Did I ever tell you about the guy who...

1182
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,780
The first tattoo I ever got, I was getting tattooed by the guy.

1183
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,640
And he was like...

1184
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,540
He was a friend of a friend and he was doing it super, super cheap.

1185
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,240
He was like an apprentice at this place, really terrible tattooer.

1186
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,280
And he's tattooing me and I'm like, dude, what's...

1187
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,040
I'm just like an idiot 18-year-old.

1188
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,740
And I was like, what's like the craziest thing anyone's ever asked you to tattoo?

1189
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,580
And he's like, man, I won't lie to you, man.

1190
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:23,500
A couple of weeks ago, some guy comes in and he asked for SS bolts on his arm.

1191
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,780
And I was like, dude, what?

1192
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,180
And he's like, yeah, dude, crazy.

1193
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,380
But bro, you know, 80 bucks is fucking 80 bucks.

1194
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:30,940
So I did that.

1195
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,020
I was like, what?

1196
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:33,460
Yeah.

1197
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,980
He was, as he was tattooing me, I found out that he had done SS bolts like one week ago.

1198
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,020
Damn, that's crazy. He did the same tattoo a week later?

1199
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,500
Yeah, well, I knew that he was good at them, so that was nice. He had practiced before.

1200
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,940
He felt more comfortable, yeah.

1201
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,140
Yeah, exactly. I was like, "Whew!" I was sweating bullets until that point.

1202
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,820
That was at least a second time's a charm, right?

1203
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,580
What was your first tattoo?

1204
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:05,060
Obviously, I don't have tattoos, but I remember being at the forefront of the fashion forums,

1205
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,300
And the before the undercut had a name coming in.

1206
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,580
Say that ever again.

1207
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,580
Yeah.

1208
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,680
You know, before, like people knew how to do the Macklemore haircut.

1209
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,380
Yeah.

1210
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,940
Still called the Hitler Youth and bring you to photos of fucking Nazi boys.

1211
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,600
Yeah.

1212
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,780
Can you give me this?

1213
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,980
And then they just fuck it up because they don't know how to do it.

1214
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,240
And they're kind of looking at you funny.

1215
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,780
Yeah.

1216
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,140
That's so dope.

1217
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,280
My first tattoo is a heart.

1218
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,400
To answer your question, it was a heart with the word Nana in it.

1219
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,140
on my legs from my grandma.

1220
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,300
Me and my brother got matching tattoos.

1221
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,140
That's beautiful.

1222
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,860
It's a very sentimental, meaningful tattoo to me.

1223
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,620
I'm gonna get a matching tattoo of that,

1224
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,080
but it's gonna say beer.

1225
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,100
And also, I think that guy went to jail for like,

1226
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,060
he like, it was in a road rage accident,

1227
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,980
like pulled out an AR-15 or something.

1228
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,660
Like he had some crazy charge. That's fine.

1229
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,580
That's understandable.

1230
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,540
Against them.

1231
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,180
He's a good guy though. That's fair.

1232
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,820
Yeah, he's a very nice guy.

1233
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,820
People are so funny because they think that the impulse of every person in

1234
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,580
America is not to just murder someone when they inconvenience you slightly.

1235
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,140
I don't have, I don't have that at all.

1236
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,380
I was talking today about that with somebody.

1237
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:26,180
I have, I am so, I've never honked in my car and I drive all the time and people

1238
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,900
would drive crazy.

1239
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,900
I will never honk.

1240
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,020
No, of course not.

1241
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,320
Why would I do that?

1242
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,600
That's so, I'm so sensitive to the idea

1243
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,800
that somebody is going to get out of their car

1244
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
and shoot me in the head.

1245
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,300
That I will never ever, I've seen too many videos.

1246
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,860
- I think that should make it legal for you--

1247
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,880
- A very legal cuck state thing to think

1248
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,240
that someone won't murder you for cutting them off

1249
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,280
in traffic. - Exactly.

1250
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,080
None of these people who do this shit in New York City

1251
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,280
have ever lived in somewhere where every fucking person

1252
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,240
has a gun.

1253
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,280
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1254
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,160
I think it would make it legal if someone's going slow.

1255
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,520
I was like leaving a parking lot at the mall in LA

1256
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,200
and someone like was just driving like a fucking asshole.

1257
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,160
And I was like, they need to put guns in every car here.

1258
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,760
They would not drive like this

1259
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,960
if they could be in danger of being shot.

1260
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,360
I wish I could shoot that fucker.

1261
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,720
- That is kind of like the like Southern hospitality thing

1262
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,840
is fully just that you assume every single person has a gun.

1263
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,240
- And is going to shoot you.

1264
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,840
- Yeah, so you try to be as nice as possible to them.

1265
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,140
Exactly, that's kind of a nice way to live your life, right?

1266
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,200
And then and they're probably assuming you have a gun to which you do.

1267
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,400
Yeah, of course.

1268
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,900
I have seven on you.

1269
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:42,440
I have one of the ones that has the giant like like see through magazine

1270
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,740
that goes fucking four feet out of the Glock.

1271
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah, the double extendo.

1272
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,600
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1273
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,840
That's the thing, guns are fucking fun.

1274
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,640
Why would you want if you?

1275
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,600
Yeah, I, I want to get a show one.

1276
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,440
You've never shown we should go while you're here.

1277
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,240
Now that I have, uh, now that we have an, uh, like an above ground office,

1278
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,720
that's like legally a commercial space.

1279
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,840
I think that we can get a shotgun for the office in New York city.

1280
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,440
Yeah.

1281
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,640
We, at least we can apply it, which I would get, honestly, if I knew that Patrick

1282
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,080
was never going to be in that building.

1283
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,420
Like I know that that was just like a recipe for disaster

1284
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,520
in such a crazy way that I just can't do it.

1285
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,380
This is why a bunch of tasters.

1286
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,880
You just taste.

1287
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,560
No, that's I'd walk in, he'd be tasing his balls passed out.

1288
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,900
Like, it's just not a good idea.

1289
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,360
I talked about like when my house got broken into

1290
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,500
like when I was in college and I was friends with that like vet.

1291
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,840
And he found out like the next day and he came over with a duffel bag,

1292
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,500
plop it down on our kitchen counter, unzip that shotgun.

1293
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,280
AR-15, two glocks.

1294
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,940
He's like, everyone in this house needs a gun right now.

1295
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,540
It's like they stole like a TV.

1296
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,140
Yeah, he just gave it.

1297
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,480
He lent it to us for about a month in case someone tried to come back.

1298
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,780
I was like, I'm going to shoot someone over a fucking pair of beats.

1299
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,240
That's it. Yeah, that's the thing.

1300
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,540
When it comes to if it.

1301
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,540
Yeah, I don't think that I would want to own a gun

1302
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,580
because I think your instinct is always...

1303
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,300
To shoot yourself.

1304
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,300
If some... Well, of course, of course. One bad game of Valorant,

1305
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:33,180
I'm upping the stick directly into my mouth. But I think also, if I lived in a state that's like

1306
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,540
just... You can have a gun wherever, like Florida or something. If somebody is coming in to take

1307
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,780
$1600 worth of electronics.

1308
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,620
I'm not I hope to God I do not have a gun

1309
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,320
because I will freak out and probably kill them and then myself.

1310
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Right. Because I'll kill him.

1311
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,720
And I go, oh, my God, I just killed some fucking random homeless guy

1312
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,580
who wanted a Samsung OLED TV.

1313
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,420
He took my phone.

1314
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,020
Exactly. I'm going to be on the news as the guy who just killed

1315
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,140
some fucking random kid.

1316
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,340
No. And then I would kill myself.

1317
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,340
So I think it's probably if I didn't have like a really...

1318
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,440
I honestly think there's almost no reason for me to have a gun, actually.

1319
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,300
Yeah.

1320
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,040
The more I think about it, the more I think that I just am not...

1321
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,440
I just should not have one.

1322
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1323
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,280
It's a good idea to not have one.

1324
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,240
Yeah. But they are fun.

1325
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,140
Yeah, but also just kill me, you know, like I'll also die.

1326
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,640
Just come in and you can kill me.

1327
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,580
You can take all my stuff.

1328
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,220
I'm not that worried about it that I need to.

1329
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,660
I would I think, yeah, I think I would rather

1330
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,800
I would rather kill be killed than kill some random guy

1331
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,760
jumping into my house because it just seems too hard to deal with the aftermath.

1332
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,200
Right. You got to get you got to get the window replaced.

1333
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,740
Yeah, you got to you got to buy a thing to put the body in.

1334
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,300
You burn it. Exactly.

1335
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,500
Did I dispose of it?

1336
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,520
You have to figure out how to live, how to dispose of a body safely.

1337
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,220
I think that's probably the only time I would do it if I knew that I could do it instantly.

1338
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,220
That is the hardest thing.

1339
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,340
To learn Google how to do a crime.

1340
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,220
I'm watching the Breaking Bad scenes on YouTube.

1341
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,940
Trying to get around it by trying to find out the name of the acid they use in Breaking

1342
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,940
Bad.

1343
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:28,180
But just looking up Breaking Bad coolest scenes.

1344
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,740
Your Honor, I just wanted to watch Breaking Bad.

1345
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:34,100
I just wanted to watch Gus kill the guy with the box cutter.

1346
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,100
Yeah, I don't think I would.

1347
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,100
Yeah, I'm too scared to Google a crime.

1348
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,100
I wouldn't be able to do one myself.

1349
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,100
I had a knife when I lived in Boston,

1350
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,100
and then I moved to Boston,

1351
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,100
and somebody at my school was like,

1352
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,100
"Hey, that knife is like two inches past

1353
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,100
what you're legally allowed to have here."

1354
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,100
And I was like, "Oh, okay.

1355
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,100
Yeah, I guess I don't really need a knife."

1356
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,100
And then I just threw it away.

1357
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,100
I would probably hide a knife in my sock

1358
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,900
if I, you know, just was out and about all the time, but like...

1359
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,620
But what are you going to do with a knife, dude?

1360
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,120
Like...

1361
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,920
Yeah.

1362
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,540
I'm not... I don't know how to use a knife.

1363
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,300
Like, I don't know why I had it in the first place.

1364
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,780
I think you would...

1365
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:23,820
Maybe if somebody hands me a, like a buck, a eight point buck, it's like, okay,

1366
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,540
I'll cut it down the middle like Red Dead Redemption.

1367
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,900
But I don't know how to protect myself with this.

1368
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,900
I think you'd first get a knife for like the like collectors value type of thing

1369
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,500
which is like looks cool and you like having it.

1370
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,700
Yeah, they carry around a katana.

1371
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,500
I'm sure you can in some states.

1372
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,300
You have to have that sword, you have a sword, right?

1373
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,200
I don't have a sword.

1374
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,800
There is a sword here though.

1375
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,900
Okay, never mind then.

1376
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,900
Dojo vibe.

1377
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,700
Yeah.

1378
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,300
I was looking at them, they're not cheap, they're like 300 bucks for a nice sword.

1379
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,300
Do you know in 48 states you're allowed to have a flamethrower?

1380
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,300
What are the two you can't?

1381
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,300
California and like Massachusetts maybe.

1382
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,300
Alright, you can have one in New York.

1383
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,300
Yeah, should I get one?

1384
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,300
You should get one.

1385
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,300
Just fighting off someone robbing you with a flamethrower

1386
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,300
you just burn your whole house down.

1387
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,300
The thing is if you walk around you will never get mugged

1388
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,440
around with a flamethrower strapped to your back.

1389
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,240
True. Yeah.

1390
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,540
Nobody's going to mess with you.

1391
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,900
Or if you are a bald white guy who looks scary with a with a small dog.

1392
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,300
I used to play video games with this dude in Idaho, and he would just fucking

1393
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,860
strap like a, you know, a R15 to his back to go to Starbucks.

1394
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,000
It's like you don't need to do that.

1395
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That's so cool, man.

1396
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,100
It was cool.

1397
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,760
It was definitely the coolest thing to me.

1398
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,640
That's so sick. Yeah.

1399
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,900
Because there are those states where you just walk around with that

1400
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,400
And then people will call the cops and the cops will just show up and be like,

1401
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,540
yeah, so basically this lady's being a bitch at the fucking home goods.

1402
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,180
I get it, bro. Just keep on keeping on.

1403
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,700
I'm going to tell her that I wrote you a ticket. Yeah.

1404
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,780
So funny, dude.

1405
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,040
I would have been that dude in Texas who like what is on a date.

1406
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,640
And then he got ripped off by a guy like

1407
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,180
doing like a parking scam, like overcharging for parking.

1408
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,380
And he just walked out.

1409
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,580
He's like, I got to go to the bathroom.

1410
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,880
He just walked out and killed the guy.

1411
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,740
I went back to the date, just like pretended nothing happened.

1412
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,080
Whoa.

1413
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,580
The thing about that, as I didn't really understand

1414
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,280
that the timeline of that scenario, like he got there, he got overcharged.

1415
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,780
Then he went to the date and he was like, you know what?

1416
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,120
Actually, well, he was so mad about that guy.

1417
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,340
He just kept thinking about it and getting pissed off.

1418
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,720
The video where the guy that came out a couple of weeks ago

1419
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,820
where the guy is like singing to himself in his car

1420
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,520
and then he just cuts him off

1421
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,920
and then he just pulls out the Glock

1422
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,420
and just starts fucking dumping at this guy.

1423
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,820
That's good.

1424
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,320
Oh, it's shipping for everyone to do that.

1425
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,320
I want to do that every time.

1426
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,700
I will say, OK, I hate I hate video.

1427
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,660
I hate death videos, videos where people shoot at each other

1428
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,520
and nobody gets hit are the funniest videos ever.

1429
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,820
It's always a video of two guys who pull up to the same gas station

1430
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,180
in South Carolina and they pull out the biggest gun you've ever seen.

1431
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:29,020
They both have girls in their cars and then they shoot 500 bullets

1432
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,620
at each other, miss every single one.

1433
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:33,380
One of the bullets goes into one of the girls feet.

1434
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,480
Yeah. And then they both go to jail for 16 months.

1435
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,420
It's the funniest thing ever.

1436
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,680
It's so fucking sick.

1437
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,260
It's so funny to walk around with guns with that

1438
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,760
that much artillery and just miss every single shot.

1439
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,460
It's beautiful. Sick, dude.

1440
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
Have you guys ever seen American Sniper?

1441
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,620
I kind of want to watch it.

1442
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,620
I watched a clip from it today that looked so bad.

1443
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,620
It's good. The scene with the baby is so funny.

1444
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,620
Yeah, I've only seen the baby scene clip.

1445
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,120
I just saw a scene where he shoots a snake.

1446
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,120
Yeah? With a sniper?

1447
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,620
Yeah, he shoots a snake with a sniper and I was like, "Okay, I don't..."

1448
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,620
But I just heard his voice. His voice was so bad.

1449
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,120
The accent that he does is so shit.

1450
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,620
Whatever happened to that guy? He fell off.

1451
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,620
Did he get accused of rape or something?

1452
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,020
- No, he's still making movies.

1453
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,420
- No, dude, he did "Star is Born."

1454
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,260
Is that the last big thing he did?

1455
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,860
- That was like five years ago.

1456
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,700
- Yeah, but--

1457
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,700
- He's for sure made a movie like last year.

1458
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,340
- But when you're like that, you just do heaters every five.

1459
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,180
- True.

1460
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,700
- No, people think he's in heaters,

1461
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,540
but he's completely not.

1462
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,020
- Yeah, he's fucking awful.

1463
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,580
- Bradley Cooper's in heaters.

1464
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,540
- He's in a couple of heaters.

1465
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,300
He's not in every heater.

1466
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,140
Not all of his movies are heaters.

1467
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,380
- Oh, he's in "Guardians of the Galaxy," I guess.

1468
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,940
- Yep, yeah, he plays the raccoon, I think.

1469
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,380
- No, that's-- - He was in Licorice Pizza,

1470
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,540
he was in Avengers.

1471
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,060
So Star is Born was literally five years ago.

1472
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,380
- Okay, let's see.

1473
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,260
Yeah, Licorice Pizza for sure.

1474
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,900
Let's see, his best movie-- - Limitless.

1475
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,100
- Let's see, oh, he just had an era.

1476
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,620
You know, just like McConaughey did.

1477
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,660
You don't have to be doing it forever.

1478
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,860
- True. - But he had like five years

1479
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,540
where he was one of the best actors.

1480
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:17,060
- He's in like two of the biggest movies of this year.

1481
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,220
What are you guys talking about?

1482
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,780
Talking about movies I care about.

1483
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,180
Yeah.

1484
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,980
I'm not talking about trash.

1485
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,580
Yeah.

1486
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,260
Garbage for slop pigs.

1487
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,020
For sluts.

1488
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,460
Liquorice pizza was also a good movie.

1489
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,300
I never saw that.

1490
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:29,580
Slut pig.

1491
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:29,780
Yeah.

1492
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:30,980
I don't give a fuck about that movie.

1493
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:31,460
I liked it.

1494
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,100
I fucking hate the Haim sisters.

1495
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,740
Yeah.

1496
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,660
That is just not for me, man.

1497
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,660
I'll fight them each individually and I'll fight them one victory.

1498
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,620
I will say I did it.

1499
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,900
I watched the movie and I thought it was okay.

1500
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,540
I liked it.

1501
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,820
And then a week later, that video where the Hames sisters

1502
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,980
started doing this weird dance on stage came out,

1503
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,380
and I was like, okay, I see what people are talking about.

1504
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,940
- Yeah, they're fucking annoying.

1505
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,180
- I just found out something really fucked up, man.

1506
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,100
- What?

1507
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,340
- The next, the new Joker movie,

1508
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,820
the one with Lady Gaga.

1509
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,340
- It's a musical.

1510
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,940
- Yeah, it's a musical.

1511
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,060
I had no idea.

1512
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:07,900
- You didn't know that?

1513
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,220
- That is awful, bro.

1514
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,220
- I knew that.

1515
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,140
- And Zazie Beetz is in it.

1516
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,540
Yeah. I love her.

1517
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:20,180
Who says he beats Zazie beats. She's beautiful.

1518
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,860
Okay. She's in a bunch of shit.

1519
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,060
Okay. You didn't answer my question.

1520
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,900
I think you guys are media blind. She's the girl from Atlanta.

1521
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,340
We're media. What?

1522
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,420
I see that you're media blind.

1523
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,460
I don't have TV, so I don't see ads.

1524
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,700
Rex only watches Rick and Morty on his phone and read Chinese novels.

1525
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:44,700
I have not watched any Rick and Morty since he was accused of rape plus three days.

1526
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:52,700
What's your new thing? Are you watching family guy?

1527
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,420
Uh, I've been watching, um,

1528
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:00,300
Silicon Valley.

1529
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,420
Okay.

1530
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,620
Wow. I cannot believe that it's taken you of all people this long to watch that

1531
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:10,920
show. I think I watched it when it came out. It literally forgot

1532
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,520
all about it. The thing the house that they live in looks

1533
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,620
exactly like the house that they live in to the craziest degree

1534
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,820
where you have the big shared table even. Yeah, it's really

1535
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:26,520
wild. Yeah. It's a funny show and you know, thankfully no one

1536
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,120
on that show has ever been accused of raping.

1537
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,520
It is crazy that it goes rape, rape, steroids.

1538
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,080
- Yep.

1539
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,040
- They have a pretty bad kind of rap at this point.

1540
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,780
- Or Martin Starr's the only clean one.

1541
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,100
And that's just because he's a weird guy.

1542
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,380
- Yeah, 'cause who's gonna fuck him?

1543
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,460
- Exactly.

1544
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,300
- Yeah.

1545
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,760
- Dude, I used to think Middle Ditch was so funny.

1546
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,980
Like, Comedy Bang Bang, 2014.

1547
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,620
- Me too, oh my God.

1548
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,420
I used to think he was so fucking funny.

1549
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,580
And then just finding out that he was into being,

1550
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,580
to like fucking goth people really made me.

1551
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,080
Yeah.

1552
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,480
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1553
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,780
Yeah, dude.

1554
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,980
Just goths?

1555
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,380
He's going to like sex clubs.

1556
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,080
Yeah, he would.

1557
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:16,280
His wife didn't want to be a swinger, but he was like, no, we have to or I'll divorce you.

1558
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:23,680
And she took her, he took her to a goth sex clubs and he would like fuck a bunch of goth chicks.

1559
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,180
And she would just sit there, drink up probably a bitters and soda and look at the wall.

1560
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,240
I remember when, uh, that sounds awesome.

1561
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,600
When Compton first came out, I was talking to,

1562
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,000
I used to go to Goodwills all the time to like make extra money and just like

1563
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,360
flip shit. And, uh,

1564
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,640
I remember talking to this like alcoholic that worked at the Tempe improv,

1565
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,600
um, that was like a cashier there during the day.

1566
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,960
And we were like talking about like comedy and he was like, Oh yeah, like, um,

1567
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,800
TJ Miller, like was just here. And like, I was his like handler.

1568
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,480
and he like smashed an egg on my face

1569
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,240
and like hit me over the head with a beer bottle.

1570
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,080
- What?

1571
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
- Yeah, yeah.

1572
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,760
Just like completely, just like destroyed this dude.

1573
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,320
(laughing)

1574
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,760
I was like, oh man, that sucks.

1575
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,720
And he's like, no, it was awesome.

1576
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,720
He was really funny.

1577
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,160
- Wait, what did that have to do

1578
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,360
with the beginning of your story?

1579
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,120
- That's just how I started like talking to him.

1580
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,520
He's like listening to Comptown.

1581
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,360
- Oh, okay.

1582
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,200
- So that's how I started talking to him.

1583
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,000
- That just made no sense at all.

1584
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,120
Yeah, we were just like talking about it and then I found out he worked at the

1585
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,260
improv and then he was like, I was like, Oh, that's cool. Like, what do you do?

1586
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,400
And he's like, I'm like a, like I handle like some of the,

1587
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,400
like the bigger talent that comes through.

1588
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,280
I didn't notice until like literally like a couple of days ago,

1589
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,300
but Rex has so many famous people, celebs connections.

1590
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,320
It's crazy.

1591
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,520
Do you, who do you, who are you connected to? Say it publicly right now.

1592
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,320
I'm not going to say it publicly.

1593
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:55,020
Someone informed me of a bunch of different celebrity connections.

1594
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,020
I went to high school.

1595
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,660
All right, we have to end this episode so I can hear this.

1596
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,660
Yeah.

1597
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,660
All right.

1598
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,540
Number one being Ludwig from Tempe.
