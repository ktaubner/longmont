1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Last time on Gun City Abroad City, Playtime continue fun.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You boys began your dogged search of the space station for playtime.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Investigating the corpses that lay at your feet from their most recent murder,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you discovered that the toys Playtime lodged into their neck wound were strangely strange.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Missing letters, and the book, and having melty faces on the toy.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The toy looked weird.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,160
unfinished imperfect creations. You brought these things to the crime lab

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,400
where the crime lab expert Blue Gopher suggested that these toys could

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,560
potentially have

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,400
been come from the under city. The part of the space station that exists beneath

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,800
the lower half and the part of the downer district.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,680
Where the fuck was I?

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,240
Since there was no way to trace them on their product history

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,240
So that's why you knew that it was probably from the Undercity.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,240
There's no way that... It seemed like they came from nowhere, the toys.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,240
After getting that info, you made your way to the Undercity the way that God intended, through space,

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,240
which Patrick Yoda thought was gay.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Um...

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
That was funny. That was the biggest laugh he ever took at me.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
I forgot about that.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,240
It was just him calling me gay.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Fucking gay!

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
I asked him how it was.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Woo, that was funny.

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Yeah.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:31,240
After you arrived in the undercity, or rather right outside the undercity in the Downer District, you reviewed the case files and began to investigate your immediate surroundings.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,240
This was where the first murder that Playtime had done took place. You learned there was only-

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Oh, and we found out it was the Grinch.

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,240
There was only one confirmed witness. No, there's nothing like that.

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,240
But it was Grinch. It was heavily implied.

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
Grinchian.

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
It was a Grinchian crime.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,200
If it's not the Grinch, by the way, if it's not the Grinch,

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
- Then we know that you had to change it

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,960
because our camera noticed.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,120
- It's the Catch-22 then.

38
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,280
- It's Santa, the Grinch, or it's the Auntie Claus.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,240
- I will show, I will date my notes.

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,160
- Okay.

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,120
- And I will show you that it was never the Grinch.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,880
- You're gonna go back and date your notes now.

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
- No. - Yeah, he's gonna

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
date your notes. - Nope.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,960
Nope, this is a draw.

46
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,520
- I will date your notes. - You will get an audit.

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
First of all. - 'Cause you're such a nerd,

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
you would date your notes.

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,160
- You got me.

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Hold on. It is too easy.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
This fucking guy.

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Okay, yeah, so anyway, there was only one confirmed witness there.

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
The shopkeep, O'Neal.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
By being amazing detectives and even better racists,

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,400
you quickly assessed that he was lying about his being human and having just human skin,

56
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
and discovered he was half leprechaun.

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,400
To keep you guys quiet, he told you some info on what he heard that night,

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
but begged that you wouldn't reveal his dark secret.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,600
He told you that the metal against metal scraping sound that were heard by

60
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,240
witnesses at the murder that you were there and saw was also heard here in

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,960
this first murder up on the roof in one of Baby Gadd's properties. Baby Gadd, you

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,280
also learned, had moved from whatever he was doing in Bullet Town to go up here

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,680
to the Pleasure Palace. You guys got into the building and climbed the roof, dropped

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,980
a magnet down a small winding pipe that jutted from the top of the building and out came a

65
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:27,320
crazy snake. Patrick swung and connected his sandwich with the snake, or hoagie, but before

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,080
he could even roll for damage, the lights flickered, the space station once again powered down

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,560
for a frightful moment, and this time O'Neal was the one who was attacked. You heard a

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:52,360
a

69
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,040
It's the Grinch as a monkey.

70
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,480
It's the Christmas monkey.

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
It's Dunstan.

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,040
What kind of fucking reference is this evil man?

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm gonna crack it.

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,520
I'm gonna do a hundred guesses a minute until I crack it.

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,760
Well but the thing is he's just gonna give you nothing once you get it.

76
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Right?

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,440
Well just knowing that I knew it ahead of time is enough for me.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
That would be enough for you.

79
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,200
Let me guess.

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
It's this fucker Ron DeSantis.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,520
I hate that red bastard.

82
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
I have to go home.

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Run to Santa.

84
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Fuck me.

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Fuck me, that's good, lad.

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Go ahead.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay, cool.

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:41,080
All I was going to say is, much to investigate after you deal with this deadly snake.

89
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,000
So Patrick Yoda, you did in fact connect your hit against the snake.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I have.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the middle of the battle, by the way. I have my notes from that battle up here.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,320
Oh, fuck. Here they are for me. So yeah, the initiative order was Patrick first, then it's

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,640
gonna be the snake, then Blowtoss, and then you, Ray William Johnson. Patrick, we just

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,560
need to roll for damage. You basically connected with the snake and then the light started

95
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:22,760
kind of flashing. I'm busy. I'm drawing you. Damn, that does look like me. That looks exactly

96
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,800
like me. That looks just like him. Roll for damage. Yeah, roll for damage. What, which

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,480
one do I roll with? You gotta take a look at your sheet. I'm busy with the sheet though.

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
I know.

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Shit.

100
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Here, hold on.

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Try to get less busy.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Nice.

103
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
You flipped it over, though, for those listening.

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Wow.

105
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
I'm impressed.

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
That was good.

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
You flipped over the piece of paper he was drawing on.

108
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Oh, it's a D. So you used your hoagie in your attacks.

109
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
It was a hoagie.

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
No, it was just a hoagie, not hoagie surprise, right?

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
The hoagie surprise is the hoagie.

112
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Okay, I thought that was a different thing.

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
No, I apologize.

114
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
I thought there was one where I throw it.

115
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
You have your hoverboard, but you can throw.

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
He's stalling and I have to read the number of dice.

117
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
He has...

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
To take the dice.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
I'm just going to throw it.

120
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
I apologize

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,720
You have your hoverboard

122
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,880
To d8 which is like the two

123
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,760
D4 oh my apologies

124
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,720
So just roll

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
No

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,720
The 2d force of the the pyramids the pyramids are the d4s so you'd roll those two those pyramids twice

127
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,800
And then and then you would add four to that

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
- 2D4+4 that picked up the beast.

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,420
- Look man, it's a lot of numbers.

130
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,260
- It is a lot of numbers.

131
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,420
- Well it's two fours.

132
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,260
- Oh wow.

133
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,860
- It maxed hit.

134
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,740
- That's very good.

135
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,580
- Max win.

136
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,840
- That's 12 damage.

137
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,680
So yeah you--

138
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,840
- Did I get to roll again?

139
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,160
- No, it's not like Monopoly.

140
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
It is close to Monopoly but not quite.

141
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
No, you got it, that's fair.

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,960
Yeah no, you connected--

143
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,320
- It should be like Monopoly.

144
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,160
There should be--

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,980
- I agree.

146
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Snake Eyes! Well Snake Eyes is basically a crit one but it should be first.

147
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Anything to make it not like Wizards of the Coast. Nope.

148
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,980
Don't even, that's the worst thing I could have said. I shouldn't have said anything.

149
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Yeah. But this is, I mean, so speaking of Snake Eyes though, hey this is a snake if you're facing it.

150
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,980
And as you connect with it, one of the things that you notice is that it has this like big hood on.

151
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,980
That's the snake by the way. This marker.

152
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,980
I'll move you back a bit.

153
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Why are you bent over?

154
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,980
I don't know why he's bent over.

155
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
That's how my guy is.

156
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
What the fuck are you doing?

157
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,980
So he's more like, that's not...

158
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:40,980
So, uh, but yeah, so it's, it's, again, I think I said it last time, 15 feet long, it's kind of plasticky and metallic,

159
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,980
and it's also, it has like a hood, like a cobra, right?

160
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
You can see some of these like plastic ridges.

161
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
They're multi-colored.

162
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
It's hissing and yelling.

163
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,980
It's yelling?

164
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Wait, what's it yelling?

165
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,980
(Snake screeching)

166
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,980
(Snake screeching)

167
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Hey! Hey you!

168
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Hey, do a different sound. That does not match

169
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
the way you look.

170
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Hey! Hey you!

171
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,980
Hey! Hey you!

172
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,980
Leave me alone.

173
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
Well, that's what he's saying now because he's got a sandwich

174
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,980
his face 12 damage. Oh that sounds awful. He does not sound good. I would hate to have

175
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,300
that. Yep. So um. That looks like a sandwich doug. I think everyone, I think that looks

176
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,580
like it. You can't even see it on the camera. You should hold it up and let the folks at

177
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:39,580
home vote. Yeah. Does that look like it? Cut to the Patrick scam. Can we get him side by

178
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,580
by side. How's your face? Can I see the face? I gave you a lot more hair. I was joking.

179
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,060
I look like a bitch. This page is a giant blank square and you're like I need to draw

180
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:59,060
on the back of this. That's my notes. I'm sure you're going to fill that one up. I will.

181
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:06,060
this

182
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,900
so

183
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,740
this was going to be it

184
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,220
watch

185
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,020
we just keep this snake is now going to go

186
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,140
so uh... he's going to try to grapple

187
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,620
you pat since you just hit him in the face

188
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:44,180
with

189
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,180
bit off your balance, and so he's able to whip around really quickly and wrap around you

190
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,060
and you feel the sort of like combination of flesh and plastic and metal like starting

191
00:09:53,060 --> 00:10:02,060
to constrict you for an initial 17 damage.

192
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,140
Wow you're headed to damaged city, population 17.

193
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,940
I can't roll again right?

194
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,940
No.

195
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,940
Oh what again?

196
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Well, can I use a special ability?

197
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Um, look at your rea- so here's the way you could do it.

198
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
I have Peace for Yoda, Peace for all.

199
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Well what are your reactions?

200
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,940
So go over there, I have reactions for you for exactly this kind of thing.

201
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,940
I'm gonna say attack melee, if melee enemy moves.

202
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,940
So you have an opportunity attack if they move within range of you.

203
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,940
How many years have we been playing this game with specifically this- these characters?

204
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
Three years.

205
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,940
These sheets.

206
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Not even like how-

207
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
Almost three years.

208
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Yeah, right?

209
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,940
Specifically always the same.

210
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Also it's obvious that you took a bite out of that champ's neck.

211
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:56,940
It's got T marks on it.

212
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,940
You did it.

213
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
Stop playing with it.

214
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Please play the game.

215
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
Please play the game.

216
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Don't listen to Cameron, he's being mean.

217
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,940
Play the game.

218
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,940
You're so good at DnD, you're the best.

219
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,940
This is the one that just melted in my pants.

220
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
That's the one that I bit.

221
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
Oh, this was my snacking one.

222
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
Yeah, it melted in my pants.

223
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
It melted in my mouth.

224
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
It's so delicious.

225
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,940
Okay, he wants to react.

226
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,940
So what are your reactions?

227
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Deflect a non-magic missile roll ranged attack.

228
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,940
So you can deflect ranged attacks with your hoagie

229
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
because it's kind of like a lightsaber for you.

230
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,940
But this is a melee attack.

231
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,940
So you have no reactions to this.

232
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
to this so this just kind of happens.

233
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Okay.

234
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,940
But, um, I mean, so you take 17 damage

235
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
and the snake does constrict around you, so

236
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,940
there might be some lingering effects from there.

237
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
But Blotoss, first, it's your turn.

238
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Okay, has the snake acted already?

239
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Yeah, the snake has acted, and he's wrapped around

240
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,940
the Grogu. Can we just get the Grogu and the snake

241
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
just near each other?

242
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
Yeah, we should have got a piece of string.

243
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
I know, I couldn't find it.

244
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,940
here

245
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,380
so yeah like that

246
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,700
turned around right away

247
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,600
are able to have wrapped around

248
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,940
okay i'm gonna go up

249
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,220
and i'm gonna start getting i want this nato like open so i'm gonna start

250
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,780
getting it with my

251
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:48,900
and

252
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
I can feel it like a big wave.

253
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Meanwhile, we're playing D&D more like an elf-fulfilling prophecy.

254
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
And prophecy with a higher emphasis on prophecy due to the fantasy themes of the game.

255
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Yes, that's so good.

256
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Damn. Let's see how much damage you do now.

257
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
That's 7 damage.

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,900
For my first attack.

259
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Yes, because you have 2 attacks.

260
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,900
Okay, that's not so good a roll.

261
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,400
That's a 13.

262
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,900
Okay, yeah, that does not hit.

263
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,400
Okay. I accidentally hit Patrick, but in a prank way. It doesn't do anything.

264
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,040
I will say I've tried to adjust the enemies a little bit more so that they hit harder but

265
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
they go down quicker.

266
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
The battle's moving.

267
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
So, yeah.

268
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
I don't game.

269
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Me neither.

270
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
I just play pretend.

271
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
I read a lot of gamer forums to catch up on the lingo so if anyone speaks gamerese to

272
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
me I know what they're saying but I don't know the first thing.

273
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah, the first thing you think when you see this whole, all these playstations is that

274
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
we gotta be gamers.

275
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Real gamers loud.

276
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Hey, well why don't you play this game instead of the other ones?

277
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm not a gamer.

278
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I'm not a gamer.

279
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
I'm not a gamer.

280
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
I'm not a gamer.

281
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm not a gamer.

282
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I'm not a gamer.

283
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
I'm not a gamer.

284
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm not a gamer.

285
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,520
All these places to get gamers.

286
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
(laughter)

287
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
Real gamers lounge.

288
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Hey, well why don't you play this game?

289
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,220
Okay.

290
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
It's your turn.

291
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,720
Well, first things first, my character turns around to look at what's happening.

292
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Second things second, I'm going to use my...

293
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Fuck it, it's my grenade, it doesn't actually matter.

294
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
I will use...

295
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Is there... do I have a clear shot?

296
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Or do I need to get close range and try to fucking cut that snake like the devil himself?

297
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,280
So the way that you could, yeah, I mean I would say just cause he's wrapped around him completely.

298
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,620
The range of the grenade, if I'm correct, it's 10 foot radius I think, right?

299
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,120
But I have my matrix beam.

300
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,920
Oh I see what you're saying, if you can try to like...

301
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,080
If I roll low am I gonna fucking hit one of these?

302
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,600
Yeah I think that's how we can play this, is like, cause normally you can't cause they're

303
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
connected.

304
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,360
But I would say if you roll high enough, not only will you hit but you'll also be able to

305
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,760
kind of like slice around Patrick Ewen.

306
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
- All right.

307
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
- So the idea would be to kind of like get like this angle.

308
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
How's the sound?

309
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,080
- Yeah. Can I give a producer's note?

310
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,760
Can you tilt the mic a little towards your mouth

311
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,600
a little more and maybe just be a little closer to it?

312
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,440
- Okay. Yeah.

313
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,260
Sounds good to me.

314
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,240
- I think that you guys are about to see

315
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,880
the first natural 20.

316
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,360
- I'm ready to see it.

317
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,960
Do you want magic fingers to help?

318
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
- Give them to me.

319
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,440
Thank you so much, Patrick Ewen.

320
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,640
- Okay. And you.

321
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,000
- He doesn't hear the snake.

322
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,840
- That's true.

323
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,680
- You are the serpent.

324
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:25,240
of

325
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:40,240
in

326
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,240
the comments.

327
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,240
things happen at once. First, Patrick Yoda, roll a perception check. Add your perception.

328
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:23,040
So you guys remember that you heard O'Neal kind of bleeding out, you heard people kind

329
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,540
of hollering over there, you were kind of up on this building, he's not too far away.

330
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,720
Patrick Yoda, you kind of can tell based on just you have this ability with the foreskin

331
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,720
to heal people, that O'Neal might die if you don't do something to him.

332
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
We gotta escape the snake.

333
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Oh wait, it's my turn again?

334
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
And go rescue O'Neil.

335
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Maybe he's seen this.

336
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Peace for Yoda, peace for all.

337
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Grinch him!

338
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Read for me, peace for Yoda, peace for all.

339
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Once per recording session, Patrick can create a realm of calm

340
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
or create a realm of mental stability

341
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
instantly calming any conflict he's in for one minute.

342
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
All enemies are unable to make any aggressive actions

343
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
towards Yoda and his friends

344
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
for the duration

345
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
unless

346
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,320
Unless they beat Yoda's spell DC.

347
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,540
He's had this ability for a while, but I changed it to be once per recording session.

348
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,340
You meant it so much about him himself, but not even a character.

349
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
Yeah, pretty much.

350
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,060
I was just like, "Pat can do this.

351
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
This will be fun."

352
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,700
So yeah, you do this, okay?

353
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,340
What does it look like when you...

354
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
Basically you're using kind of a battle meditation.

355
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,580
Don't they have to beat his spell save?

356
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,340
They still have to beat his spell save, so they will...

357
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,100
Well, no, this, it just happens, I think, and then like...

358
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
What did I write?

359
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,300
I say it just happens, I mean he has the roll to beat it after the minute?

360
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Or is it just...

361
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,020
It just says unless they beat it.

362
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,780
Oh, okay, so he does have to try to beat the spell save.

363
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,780
What is your spell save?

364
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,260
It should be in the middle of your sheet, next to your spell attack.

365
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,540
It's probably kind of small font.

366
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,500
It's next to the death saving throws.

367
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
There's two numbers.

368
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
The DC?

369
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Yeah.

370
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
16.

371
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Okay.

372
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
So let's see how the snake does.

373
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
The snake is decently wise, but not that wise.

374
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Okay.

375
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Decently wise.

376
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Alright, that's my fault.

377
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
that's my fault first

378
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
cool

379
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
damn he did he does have a +2

380
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
oh that's bullshit

381
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
so he's had once per recording session

382
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
that's it that's all he can do it for

383
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
guys I think I'm tired I might want to wrap this up and start again

384
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
here's the thing

385
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
here's the thing you can still try to escape this fight

386
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
you also have a hoverboard

387
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
that you don't use for hoverboard purposes

388
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,940
I'm gonna use the hoverboard then.

389
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,740
First you're gonna have to get out, you were constricted by the snake right now.

390
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,100
Then that's, do I roll athletics?

391
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,700
This would be a strength check first.

392
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,340
Okay.

393
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,940
Against the snake's strength.

394
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,060
That one.

395
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,420
That's a natural one.

396
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,420
Unless the snake gets a natural one.

397
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,180
You really bricked that thing.

398
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,780
You got an 11, that's almost a one.

399
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,620
It didn't roll at all, he threw it straight up.

400
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,580
Yeah, that didn't roll.

401
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,460
You're saying we are on a one.

402
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,500
Where's the dice tower?

403
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,820
Oh yeah, where is the dice tower?

404
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,460
It doesn't matter because it was never on camera in the beginning.

405
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,580
Yeah, it was last episode.

406
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,380
You can't see the result though, right?

407
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,880
Yeah.

408
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,380
It's nothing.

409
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,880
Yeah.

410
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Well, I'm sorry.

411
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
So you're struggling in here.

412
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,380
You can hear O'Neal is in trouble.

413
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,380
You guys, though, obviously have a chance to free--

414
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,380
I'm just going to tell this snake I'm going to kill myself.

415
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
How about that?

416
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
It's a wise snake.

417
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,880
You probably have emotional--

418
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,380
Wisdom.

419
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,880
Wisdom.

420
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,380
You said he was wise.

421
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Wisdom is like awareness and ability to make decisions.

422
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,880
Wisdom is not--

423
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,380
I have--

424
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
You didn't say wisdom stat.

425
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,820
You said he's wise.

426
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,100
I know his mind.

427
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:43,420
Wisdom is next to insight on here, so the snake would have enough insight to realize that

428
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,420
he's about to kill himself.

429
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,100
Animal insight, is this a different critter control?

430
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,940
I put the gun to my head.

431
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,580
I found a gun, look at my character, he has a gun in his hand.

432
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,780
I found a gun, and I put it to my head and I say, "I don't care if you kill me, I don't

433
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,380
have anything to live for anymore.

434
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,380
Snake! Snake let him go he's serious!

435
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,380
He's never done this before!

436
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,380
I mean he's eaten 30 ibuprofen before and sat in a bathtub

437
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
but he's never put a gun to his head.

438
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,380
Let him go!

439
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,380
And I found this gun, there's no serial number on it, I could pin this on you.

440
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Yeah!

441
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,380
But it's actually, no, cause it's gotta be, I actually don't care what happens.

442
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
Is that what you want to be, a murderer?

443
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Well, uh, is it persuasion or intimidation?

444
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Intimidation I guess.

445
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,380
I guess. Yeah, right? Intimidation with disadvantages.

446
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,380
19 is the first one. Okay, whatever your plus is.

447
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,380
And it went in that way. Oh my god.

448
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,380
So I think that we could, you know what, don't even tell us.

449
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,380
We know what happens. Yeah, why don't you tell me what happens.

450
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,380
I kill myself. Immediately. The ultimate intimidation.

451
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,380
No, you tell me.

452
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,380
The snake cocks its head curiously at you.

453
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Does it look cute when it does that?

454
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,380
It does a little bit. I can't believe I let this happen.

455
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,380
Just kidding. I always let this kind of shit happen.

456
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,380
And he looks at you, Patrick Yoda, and it starts to uncoil a little.

457
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,380
So you would be free to slip out at the top of your turn.

458
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
Okay.

459
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,380
But it's still like a hostile creature probably to all you guys.

460
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,620
This is kind of a brief moment where for some reason, something inside of this creature

461
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,580
recognized your desperation.

462
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Maybe it's heart group resize.

463
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,580
And I just earned a new ability called suicide threat.

464
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,580
Yeah, add that to your list of abilities because I did just kind of make that a thing.

465
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,080
Okay, so the snake's not going to trick you.

466
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
It's going to skip its turn.

467
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
I'm going to let that.

468
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Insanely good roll

469
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:02,120
Yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah, you got a 20 you will you'll get her back if you do it

470
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,480
So we're now it's up. It's it's your turn blowtoss piss

471
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,080
I mean, I guess I'm gonna run now now that I I'm thinking about O'Neill's poor leprechaun body

472
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,960
half leprechaun half leprechaun which half

473
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,120
Well, the bottom we know the back had our pubes so maybe split vertically

474
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,720
But pubes a little of each bubes

475
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,680
Hmm. All right. So you run you're gonna run. Yeah, I think I'll run. Okay, cool. Yeah, you can run. Can I like grab?

476
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,080
Patrick Yoda and run

477
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,920
Yeah, I would you you can try I mean, like I said the snake is not like

478
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,920
It's like relaxing, but I'm not gonna say it's like fully like if you yank the guy from its clutches would it like

479
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,500
Snap back in mentally like things like that you'd have to consider

480
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,000
If that makes sense, okay, what do you think I should do?

481
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,040
I think you should kill the snake because now it's relaxed, and I think that you could probably just chop it. Yeah

482
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:15,760
Okay, you all made it this attack. We're not gonna go save O'Neill and find out there's a great. Well. I can't you just do it

483
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,080
you do I don't have healing you're the one who has healing that was what I

484
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,000
said it from across the map your foreskin how far is me over the corner

485
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,040
he's not he's a little bit more than I would say 60 feet away what you could do

486
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:37,760
probably is hmm let me think about this how would you get there well there are

487
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,880
there you I have the hoverboard have the hoverboard shoot the hoverboard up in

488
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,080
the air and then just fucking grab onto it. You could probably do a kind of a rooftop style Tony

489
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,760
Hawk activity. Subway surfers. Subway surfers. Subway surfers. And roll an athletics check to

490
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,520
bound across the buildings up top. Okay. I will let you guys skip your turn so we could just get

491
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,280
this to happen. Okay. I think that's what we should do. Oh you'll let me skip my turn? That's

492
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,360
really nice of you. As a tent. So you take this opportunity and you slip from the snakes clutches.

493
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
He's kind of outside the turn order I guess anyway

494
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,220
With that ten you're able to get on your hoverboard bound down one building

495
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,840
You kind of stumble a little bit and you're going to take

496
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,360
17

497
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,960
Damage already done to you

498
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,320
You're not gonna take much more you're gonna take five more damage as you kind of like stumble down the building and you kind of land

499
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,140
And skid yourself a little bit like you like the hoverboard kind of like doesn't quite get it's like bearings on the billy

500
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,140
It's like you have to kind of Center it

501
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,700
That's right really good Pat so you get down there and

502
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,500
You see O'Neill and he's bleeding out

503
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,640
It looks pretty bad. We're gonna go back to you. There's something on his neck

504
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,740
He has no it's just a like a

505
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,400
Half of like a line kind of clean across. Oh, it's just a line. That's not that dangerous the lineman

506
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,720
Well, it's a cut I mean like no lineman did it it's the snake from the game snake

507
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:21,840
Which is that's what that's Harold's magic crayon. It's Harold. It's Harold doesn't play time boys books

508
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
It's oh my god. It's Elmo

509
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,040
This always whenever I do a mystery anything it becomes a guessing cuz 20 questions or 20 guesses

510
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,920
You don't even ask me quite. What's the best one?

511
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,400
I got you so good. You got me so good with the Konami code one. I obviously never fucking forgot that.

512
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,080
Yeah, I felt very dumb after that. I probably got you like 20 times, right? You did with the teleporting ability

513
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,920
I gave you and I forgot to give it a cool down. I guess I did. I don't forget when I fuck up.

514
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,480
We're trying to draw the next one out of you.

515
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,600
Fucking failure of storytelling. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, right.

516
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,120
so badly. Well, you know, if I knock these out now, I won't deal with it later. So we'll go back to you

517
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,440
and healing O'Neal in a second. Let's go now to your turn up here with the snake. So yeah,

518
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,480
I mean, you have an opportunity to run if you want. The snake might chase you guys, you know,

519
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,680
like, but let Patrick go. It had the sympathy for him. Okay, and Patrick's on his way to go. He's

520
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,400
at O'Neal. He's basically going to be like, if you look at in terms of like how the turn order works

521
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:44,400
in

522
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,120
to bring him back to life. I want to defeat the snake. Okay, well I'm gonna stay and defeat

523
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,960
the snake too. So Patrick can just go handle that. I trust Patrick to go handle that. In

524
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,520
a highly sensitive situation. Yeah, absolutely. Alright, so I'm just gonna keep whaling on

525
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:07,000
this thing. Okay, that is an 18. Yeah, that hits. Okay. That is 15 damage. Damn, okay.

526
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,320
Yeah, you, so the snake like kinda like loosened up for a second and almost like, you almost

527
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:38,320
I

528
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,880
always forget to roll twice or do I double it double it roll twice I mean

529
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,680
you can roll you can oh yeah that's snake eyes yeah that should count for something

530
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,280
this snake in his eyes go ahead Wow that's pretty bad the other way we can

531
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,480
do it maybe we can do this next time would be more fun you can take the max

532
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,720
of like your boy double the plus damage and then add no you just count that one

533
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,560
Okay, I mean still describe your kill. Oh, I do this

534
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,960
He grabs the cable

535
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,400
Holding it and I'm great on it, and I'm rip it in half and then yeah, I'm gonna sit in half

536
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,040
What do you do after that? I just ripped it in half under the table

537
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,760
I didn't want to show cuz I don't like damaging property. Yeah, I'm ranked as a wow. Yeah, you're really is really unreal

538
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
It's pretty scary stuff. Yeah, you just

539
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,760
obliterated that snake. I did nothing. I turned around. That's the only thing I did.

540
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,240
Yeah, you turned around and missed. No, the snake was, snake hits hard but doesn't, didn't have a lot of HP.

541
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,160
Let's keep a, at least a representation of its corpse here. Okay. Because that is still.

542
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,520
That's just, can I give you a kudos right now? You're the perfect distance from the mic and you

543
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,760
should keep this distance. Right here? You're great. This is the one? I love you. I love you too.

544
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,260
Okay, Patrick Yoda.

545
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,680
Yeah, you're in front of O'Neal right now.

546
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,560
You can whip out your foreskin.

547
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,360
- Yeah, I do that.

548
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,360
- Yeah, okay, everyone at first is really worried

549
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,840
about the sort of thing you're bringing to this,

550
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,040
but then as you're--

551
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,960
- If you guys think this is weird, I'll kill myself.

552
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,520
- And it works again as you drape your foreskin

553
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,940
over this half leprechaun.

554
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,000
And he heals for, well, roll,

555
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,560
I believe it's 1d10+4 for your 4-skin.

556
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,040
You can read the ability actually.

557
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Bless you.

558
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
1d10+4.

559
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Do I roll?

560
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Read the ability.

561
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,240
It should be on the other page, your spells page.

562
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,760
I keep forgetting that +4 is not another dice.

563
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,320
It's just adding a number.

564
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,080
I wish they let you roll dice in math class.

565
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,680
You got 1d10+4.

566
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Nice.

567
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Alright, do it up.

568
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
10.

569
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Nice.

570
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
And you add 4.

571
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:02,840
14 yeah he is like like it's like magic as your how does your foreskin work I

572
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:09,000
don't know I think it's pretty soon I thought so too like it's sort of like

573
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,920
it's a white cape okay what of Yoda has a white penis yeah

574
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
His doesn't matter

575
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,760
Just a white really white tip. It's got that line, okay

576
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,140
So like when you take the sliders on like a like color correcting something in Photoshop

577
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,060
Then it like makes like one like when you're color correcting penis. Oh, yeah

578
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,980
It's like that's a place that has the least blood in his body. It's like what you're painting Yoda's penis white

579
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,760
It's like what it looks like after that. Oh, yeah

580
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,920
All right, so it's a lot. Okay now because before I was like, but it's like painting his penis white. Yeah

581
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,040
All right, yeah, it's amazing this white penis comes out and it heals this half, and it's not my

582
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Anatomical penis excuse me. It's not my it's not my it's not the one on my body

583
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,720
Which way it's just a penis that I have

584
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,600
This is not the cannon the cannon is at your

585
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Cock I don't remember that

586
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,960
There's always that you have like this sort of magical technicolor

587
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:24,120
Dream skin that you kind of like can throw out and cover the party. Yeah weights on the end, right?

588
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,440
There's literally like a strength check people have to take to like get out of it after he heals

589
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,160
Yeah, it's like like when you do the parachute game in class with a substitute. Oh, you're substituted

590
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,520
It's like you'd you paint Yoda's penis white and you drape it over your substitute teacher. Yeah

591
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:56,220
Yeah, so he's good I mean you guys can run down how much does he have I mean he's an NPC just a regular dude not

592
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,300
10 HP

593
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Yeah, I have so much of something that's not energy. I can't explain what it is. Yeah, right

594
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,700
I mean you guys want to look at the snake or do you guys want to run down there?

595
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,400
I want to look at the snake. I feel like I'll bring this

596
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,980
Leave his corpse there. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie. All right. I'd like to investigate the snake. All right

597
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,480
So you can roll investigation. You are the computer

598
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,320
But you had a nine I think yeah, yeah, so 14. All right, cool

599
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,040
so

600
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:44,220
Looking at the snake that 14. It's pretty good. I will say there's you can't get like a

601
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,040
Ton of info you might want to bring it back to the crime lab

602
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,740
Just because you're on first glance you're not gonna get a ton of info

603
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:57,480
We need to bring this back to the crime lab, but what you can get from this is that it is definitely similar in

604
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:05,440
General composition and look to that monster that you saw that you fought earlier at the royal district

605
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,840
We need to run an analysis on this snake

606
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm one step ahead of you. Yep

607
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,560
We need to bring him back to the lab. I'm going like I'm eating it like corn on the cob

608
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Okay, yep. Yep. Yep. We need to are you actually eating wait?

609
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,280
He's part computer. Can't we just like make the crime the crime lab

610
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,700
We can put part of the lab can't you like he can connect to any of the lab computers and then get all of its

611
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,500
like info there is a cloud upgrade that he can get if he goes to the right shop

612
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,260
in the game oh and we skip the shot let's just go to all the shops right now

613
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,180
can we just go to every shop you guys want to stop stop it that's just like

614
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:54,340
drop everything and go shopping I would love I'll surf I'll surface some shops

615
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,260
okay I'll set a 10-minute timer and we'll go what shopping as we can in that

616
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,100
time okay I have a thousand credits you do have a thousand we get a thousand

617
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,660
every day tokens yeah oh so wait so how many games have we played of this no it's

618
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:14,180
every day in game so it's been the same day the whole year - man I was gonna say

619
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,780
at least I have like at least have two thousand now you just have one thousand

620
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:24,620
that's why the other way to get money is to do gigs or jobs maybe a little bit of

621
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,540
window shopping because I don't think a thousand grams is going to go very far.

622
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,780
I'm gonna come shopping with you and I'm just gonna be carrying I'm dragging the

623
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,540
snake over my shoulder. So Patrick, did you leave O'Neal or are you staying with him? I guess I'm

624
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,580
waiting for him. I'm watching him I'm watching him run the he's like it's like

625
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,940
a now everybody that was around him has formed like a circle and they're all

626
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,860
watching him breakdance because he has all the energy. Uh-huh. And they're going

627
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Okay, oh, yeah, it's your birthday

628
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,980
yeah, and

629
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,820
Yeah, O'Neill is sort of like kind of a bit

630
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,060
He's spinning around his head, but he's also like trying to get his bearings here a bit

631
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:07,280
Outside of that. Yeah right now. He's just in a complete. He's just in the he's in b-boy heaven. Mm-hmm

632
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,900
and he

633
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
he talks about

634
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,260
He's I mean like yeah, I guess well actually you know what he's just spinning on his head

635
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,040
- Yeah, you guys can talk to him if you want to.

636
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
You guys wanna go shopping?

637
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,220
You wanna leave O'Neal here to spend his night?

638
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,100
- I'll let him work out his energy.

639
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,940
- His energy.

640
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,920
- And I'll go shopping.

641
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,760
- You guys wanna go shopping?

642
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,580
Alright, go shopping.

643
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,280
So, there is a shop in the Downer District

644
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,780
you can go to right now.

645
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,620
Okay, cool.

646
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,460
- I'm down.

647
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,800
- Is that the one with the cloud upgrade?

648
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
- Yes, it is.

649
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,120
You're in the Downer District,

650
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,040
so that would make sense to go there.

651
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,700
So let me pull up my shops list.

652
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,340
Item shops.

653
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,420
Item that's the only one item shop. You have a beautiful hand

654
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,180
Which hand the one that one? Oh, thank you. Look at his hand

655
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,100

Not a hard he says about George's a day a manual labor in my life

657
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,780
It's I think it's I think

658
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,600
It's the way that you how you pick you held it up and you went like this

659
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,100
- Yeah. - Yeah.

660
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,940
- I'm sorry.

661
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,760
- You're supposed to go like this.

662
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
- Yeah. - Yeah.

663
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,420
(grunting)

664
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,260
- I'm gonna, oh!

665
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,100
(sighing)

666
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,920
Yeah, I'm supposed to hiss.

667
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,260
- That's what boys do.

668
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,100
(laughing)

669
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,100
- Boys bring out the claws and hiss.

670
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,600
- Boys do this with their hands.

671
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,440
- Yeah. - Right?

672
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,280
- Do do do do.

673
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,100
- And girls are like.

674
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,940
- I mean, I don't care.

675
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
- Okay. - And boys are like this.

676
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,780
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,600
- Boys dance.

678
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,180
- So, at this shop,

679
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,600
this shop there are three Technoslime refills you can buy.

680
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,640
Or there's three, yeah, three Technoslime refills

681
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,760
that you can get like as a pack.

682
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,440
Each of those are 1,000 tokens.

683
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,800
There's cloud mode.

684
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
- Shit, that's all my damn money, bro.

685
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,420
- Right, and that's the thing,

686
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,020
is right now that's all you have.

687
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,340
Cloud mode, that is 8,000 tokens.

688
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,080
That's where you can, you would move--

689
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,920
- 8,000?

690
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,280
It would allow you to move your computer to the cloud,

691
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,640
which will have a number of benefits,

692
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,840
including connecting to things like the crime lab.

693
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,720
And it will also allow you to--

694
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,760
- Can we rob this bitch?

695
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,760
- Control, allow you the opportunity to control the--

696
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
- What's your slate of hands?

697
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,500
- World.

698
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,720
- No. - Okay.

699
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,120
- No, it'll allow you to control the demon

700
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,680
with more ease whilst you can be separate from the demon.

701
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
I cast my sleight of hand.

702
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
I can turn invisible.

703
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
You can turn invisible.

704
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,680
He's gonna go invisible.

705
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
We're planning a heist for this thing now.

706
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
This also has an upgrade for Blotoss's Grinch Gun.

707
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Which gives it tracker mode.

708
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,680
So you can shoot an invisible painless dart at an enemy or a target.

709
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,680
It sticks into them and you'll be able to track their whereabouts for 24 hours.

710
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
How much?

711
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
It's 4000 tokens.

712
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,680
And then there's a Patrick Yoda upgrade as well.

713
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,600
as well here it's only 2,000 tokens it's a foreskin adjustment you'll now be able

714
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,800
to give up to two pieces of your foreskin to your friends to keep as

715
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,720
healing potions. Can we just sit in this store for eight days? No can I roll

716
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,760
you will starve. I'm gonna roll my sleight of hand to try to nab this. Why don't you let me

717
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,520
turn invisible because let me try this first. I mean so these are sort of like I

718
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,520
mean they're not just like on a shelf this isn't like a medieval item shop so

719
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,240
So they're like in these like, it's like a Zordon case.

720
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,080
- So it's like in a jar.

721
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,280
- They're like in a Zordon case.

722
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,520
- So I still like to try.

723
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,340
- Yeah.

724
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,180
- You still wanna try.

725
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,020
- Yeah.

726
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,040
- So I'm just trying to, what are you, you gotta--

727
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,880
- I know.

728
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,760
- Just get up, slide a hand, like slowly approach it

729
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,000
and then punch through the glass.

730
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,840
- Silently.

731
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,440
Is there a shopkeeper or is this like fully AI?

732
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
- This is fully AI.

733
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,280
- Shit.

734
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,100
- Yeah.

735
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,940
This is like--

736
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,920
- So you're a fucking computer, get in there.

737
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,200
- You could try to hack it.

738
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,020
- Yeah.

739
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,500
I added a tech skill.

740
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,900
- No, I wanna use sleight of hand.

741
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,980
- You wanna use sleight of hand really badly?

742
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,820
- Yeah, I really do.

743
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,020
- Okay, cool.

744
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,340
Roll sleight of hand.

745
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,180
Let's see what happens.

746
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,820
- I just need my D20.

747
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,620
Where is this thing?

748
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,820
Wait, patches, what's behind your ear?

749
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,660
- Stop it.

750
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,700
- Oh my God.

751
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,540
- Whoa.

752
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,380
- Tell me--

753
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,200
- Sleight of hand.

754
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,040
- This one's gotta be a bonus, right?

755
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,880
- Yeah, he did a sleight of hand on you.

756
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,700
- 'Cause you didn't notice, I did a real life sleight of hand.

757
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,780
- It was actually very good.

758
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,060
- It was very, very cool.

759
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,260
And I was holding it the entire--

760
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,100
- He gets to roll with advantage?

761
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:42,460

I work here too!

767
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,500
And I have to inspect this because I'm also a robot.

768

Please state your model number.

769
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,660
One hundred and forty-

770
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,660
You're a demon.

771
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
Six six six.

772
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,660
Five.

773
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Calculated.

00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
Ghost.

778
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
One.

779
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,660
One.

780
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,660
Eight thousand eighty five.

781
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Two.

782
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Two.

783
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:38,860
I am a robot too and I am here to open the case.

784
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,860
I am a robot repairman.

785
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,260
Wait, this guy isn't a robot.

786
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
Get out of here.

787
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,260
He's not even here.

788
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,260
God, I'm not insane.

789
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Listen, I work here, the boss is me.

790
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,260
Listen.

791
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,560
Okay, listen.

792
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,740
We all know that guy's lying, but I'm a real robot and that's how you know I'm reliable

793
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,640
I'm willing to call out your right here. I'm not even a robot. I'm a robot, right?

794
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:20,260
You could have gone down a terrible life of crime otherwise you both saved my life give this man a promotion

795
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,620
Would you like to be my manager yes

796
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Okay, bye-bye.

797
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:36,100
I'm going to make a request to see if I can make you my manager. Okay, you just get back to me on that. Okay

798
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,820
It's gonna get back to you in eight days. Okay, I'll sit and wait. Yeah

799
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,580
No, I mean, yeah, it didn't work

800
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:52,940
I'm just open. I'm just trying to open the key. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you're gonna start drawing attention to guards

801
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,020
Okay, I'd like to have their guards first it was all AI now there goes I mean there's

802
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:06,700
I'd like to throw my ninja star dongle USB cable into

803
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,340
Something

804
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,460
Okay, here I go

805
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,460
What?

806
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,060
How do you roll like that, what do you mean?

807
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,220
You've getting the worst roles. I'm honestly cursed like I think

808
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,380
This happened last campaign. It's respecting the die. My life is shit.

809
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,380
You're disrespecting it. You have to treat it well.

810
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,380
Maybe a little. Yeah.

811
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
See I got a five.

812
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,380
Overhand is a good way to roll. Okay let's see it.

813
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,380
What'd I get?

814
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,380
No no you knocked over your own piece though.

815
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,380
Oh is it this one? Yeah. Two.

816
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Getting better.

817
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Getting better.

818
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,380
This is some sort of incremental improvement.

819
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,380
This almost isn't D&D.

820
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,380
I don't have any money for this thing.

821
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,380
I don't have any money for this thing and I'm being too...

822
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,380
So the way you can get money again is by...

823
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
Ruining everything.

824
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
Well, not by ruining everything, but...

825
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,380
Can I sell him?

826
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,380
By doing jobs for Giancarlo.

827
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,380
That's a good idea.

828
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
By potentially...

829
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
There will be other opportunities to earn tokens.

830
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
I think that that is not worth...

831
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,380
It's not worth doing eight of those fucking jobs just to avoid going to the lab.

832
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,380
They wouldn't each be a bad...

833
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,380
Let's just go to the lab.

834
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
The lab.

835
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Let's go to the lab.

836
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,380
Let's just go to the lab.

837
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,640
(laughing)

838
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,460
- Let's just go to the,

839
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,940
can we please just go to the lob?

840
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,780
- Yeah.

841
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,600
(laughing)

842
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,700
- And do an analysis, please.

843
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,940
- Cool, you can go to the lob and do an analysis.

844
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,420
- Patrick, are you still with,

845
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,260
you're still with the,

846
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,300
- I guess we just forgot Patrick.

847
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,140
(laughing)

848
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,900
- The, what's his name?

849
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,300
- Patrick, we're going to the lob.

850
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,700
(laughing)

851
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,580
Bye.

852
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,660
- You could call him.

853
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,460
- Pat goes to a place called the lob.

854
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,940
(laughing)

855
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,940
He wasn't around to hear the inside joke.

856
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,780
- I'm with,

857
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,940
Duncan? What was his name?

858
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,860
What? O'Neal.

859
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,580
O'Neal. Duncan O'Neal.

860
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,660
You see O'Neal comes up to you, Pat.

861
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,900
I'm with him at the lob.

862
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,220
Yeah, the lob, the club.

863
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,700
No, you're with him at his sort of kiosk area there.

864
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,980
And you see him, and he's kind of like holding his neck,

865
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,460
and he's like, "It didn't even feel like a knife.

866
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,420
It felt like a...

867
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,620
It just felt like just a worm opening up.

868
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,100
I don't know how to explain it."

869
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,180
and you see it was gone

870
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,700
and i think that's the as he's saying that mister teen

871
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,100
handling saying that that is that all you see a familiar face you patrick you

872
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,140

873
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,060

874
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,160
you know you didn't have a figure last time

875
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,620
you don't get that man a figure

876
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,420

877
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,780

00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,660
uh... man

880
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,540
I spent 30 minutes making that.

881
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,980
You spent 30 minutes putting this on his head?

882
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,100
No, but sculpting it with super glue.

883
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,380
Well, it's still there.

884
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,700
And you hear this guy-- this guy kind of shows up,

885
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,620
and you would recognize him as Baby Gat.

886
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,060
Oh, his shirt says BG.

887
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,100
Oh, nice.

888
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,380
Or it says BC, maybe.

889
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,460
That's one big baby.

890
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,940
Yeah.

891
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,300
And he sort of like tells everyone, hey--

892
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,620
he's like, all right, move aside, move aside, move aside.

893
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:23,620
He walks up to O'Neal, falls over onto him.

894
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,620
He knocks him down and sucks him.

895
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,620
This baby gad fella really is a baby.

896
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,620
Look at his balance.

897
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,620
He basically says, "Alright O'Neal, that's enough.

898
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,620
Let's try to not talk too much about this."

899
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,020
and he turns to you, Patrick, and he goes,

900
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,360
"I haven't seen you in a while.

901
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,660
"What have you been up to?

902
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,060
"Thank you."

903
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,200
- I don't even care what I, I don't know.

904
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,140
(laughing)

905
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,340
Just fucking, my nephew's dead or something.

906
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,480
I'm stuck on this vibrator ship.

907
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,460
- So you're investigating, right?

908
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,820
I've heard some rumors.

909
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,140
- I think that's what I'm doing.

910
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,420
- Look, if you could,

911
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:10,920
Um...

912
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,420
*clears throat*

913
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,020
Can I keep this?

914
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,020
Uh...

915
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,420
I just post- I posted it on Weibo.

916
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,220
*laughs*

917
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,620
I literally just made a post about this-

918
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,220
Please remove it from Weibo, if you can.

919
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,020
Every single one of my...

920
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,220
100 followers saw it.

921
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,720
Okay, fine. Well, whatever.

922
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,620
I have 100 followers on Weibo and they're all Chinese.

923
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,520
If you can- *laughs*

924
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,620
Did you post it in English?

925
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
Yeah.

926
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,620
Okay, well...

991
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:43,820
over. Okay, you know what, you're clearly too weak so here's what you have to do now.

992
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:49,580
Because you've demonstrated that you are useless to us, you have to go to the gym and get strong.

993
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,180
That is your new prime directive.

994
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,460
Okay you got it.

995
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,900
I'm going to be really strong next time you guys see me.

00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Oh yeah, you definitely will.

Okay bye.

That bought us a little more time.

00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
Let's hit the lob.

1000
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,900
Okay cool.

You guys this is the crime lob.

1003
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,900
I don't remember the exact layout.

1004
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,860
But let's add some blocks back in here.

1005
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,380
Yeah it was something like this.

1006
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,420
I remember saying it was something along the lines of this.

1007
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,300
We got the blue gopher's back.

1008
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,300
I love that blip.

1009
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:26,300
Yeah, he's working, he's like, "I've been doing some rearranging, what do you think?"

1010
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,300
Snake.

1011
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,300
Holy sh...

1012
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,300
I can't curse.

1013
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,300
Lob.

1014
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Wow.

1015
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,300
That is crap.

1016
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,300
Oh, Lob Master, analyze my snake.

1017
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,300
That is a...

1018
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,300
Well, it looks just like the monster.

1019
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
Hold on.

1020
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,300
The monster?

1021
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,300
The monster?

1022
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,300
I'm glad we took it to the lob.

1023
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,300
Me too.

1024
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,300
Yeah, analysis over.

1025
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,880
- This forensic genius can handle chemistry.

1026
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,380
- He picks up the snake very easily somehow

1027
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,940
and dumps it into his snake analyzing machine.

1028
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,280
It's over there.

1029
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,840
- Nope.

1030
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,680
I make the noise.

1031
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,500
- Sorry about that.

1032
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,380
Sorry, sorry Cameron.

1033
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,540
- It's a silent machine and you're just sitting there like.

1034
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,300
- Scanning, scanning.

1035
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,820
- Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1036
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:22,580
the MRI. It's done! So yeah, as you're analyzing the snake you see a couple of

1037
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,260
different things about it. One, it has stomach acid it would have used to

1038
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,860
digest you guys if it swallowed you. Close call. And the acid itself is

1039
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:35,420
synthetic. Yeah. So it's not whatever organic parts of it. I'm dropping that shit on my tongue.

1040
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:40,460
Thank God. I almost let that snake eat me until I found out they had stomach acid in them.

1041
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah, okay. You also notice that the plastic is made of polyethylene and

1042
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,440
polypropylene. These plastics are often what make up toys as well. You'll also be

1043
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,040
unable to trace, notice you'll be unable to trace this within the supply chain as

1044
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,040
well. So any sort of the remnants of that plastic, the Blue Gopher is able to see

1045
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,940
that these are not a part of the sort of normal supply chain of plastic.

1046
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:14,380
The Toymaker. Yeah. Keep it 3thowl with me. He said yeah, it's the Toymaker. Keep it 3thowl with me right now.

1047
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,880
It's Robin Williams. Okay.

1048
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,340
The final thing. Is this a toy?

1049
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,440
It is part toy, it seems like. Crap.

1050
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,040
The final thing. It's a monster. The final thing.

1051
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,540
It's like a monster. Is that the snake has erogenous zones.

1052
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,540
Where? Where? Where? Where? It's a sex toy, y'all.

1053
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,680
Damn! And that the erogenous zones

1054
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,600
reveal highly sophisticated synthetic flesh as well as organic flesh melded

1055
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,640
together that would require a state-of-the-art facility to produce at all.

1056
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:54,040
I think that Cameron has a guess to wager. Lay it on me Cameron. Playtime was

1057
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,840
the architect of the spaceship because the spaceship looks like a sex toy too.

1058
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,640
Oh my god. Just you don't have to do anything. He's nodding. I want to put it

1059
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,200
He's nodding! I like that guess. It's a cool guess.

1060
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,320
I'm just drawing connections. I think it's Ron Jeremy.

1061
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,800
Now, that's a guess I like.

1062
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,280
That's what I think. I think it's Ron Jeremy.

1063
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,480
Cool. So yeah, the blue gopher says,

1064
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,680
"I hope this helps you with your investigations."

1065
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,480
It's a very similar composition to the monster, but that one didn't quite have the same

1066
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,880
erogenous zones as this snake, though. It's interesting.

1067
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,400
where where are the origin of zones on the body of the snake?

1068
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,800
It looks like inside of its mouth and on its

1069
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,120
underside there was a... Inside of its mouth?

1070
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,160
It feels good inside of its mouth? What kind of a creature would have that?

1071
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,800
And then also on its underside... Are you sure you didn't accidentally detect a food zone?

1072
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,840
Well it might also be... This snake was a hoe!

1073
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,640
It's also a... Love sucking dick! There was also a

1074
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,440
some kind of a labia

1075
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:10,200
situation on its underside not its underside it's on the side oh I call I

1076
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:24,560
just called bloat us okay okay under where what under where I grab was uh

1077
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:30,520
wait what's up dog oh no I didn't do that okay I gotta go back to this thing

1078
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:37,640
All right, we got what we need. Cut to him again. Okay, perfect idea. So, you are back.

1079
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:45,240
We are back. We are family. All right, I guess we're at the bar. That's right.

1080
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:53,680
So you're at the... This is the bar. Mm-hmm. Yeah, actually... Should we bring O'Neal with you guys to the

1081
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:59,920
bar? No. Let's start adding some... I guess O'Neal is with me now. Yeah, well, if you want to bring O'Neal, yeah, I guess you can come to the bar.

1082
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,920
Why not?

1083
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,320
He's feeling that much better.

1084
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,880
Let's add some people around the bar, guys.

1085
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,880
He's a leprechaun.

1086
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,880
He needs a drink.

1087
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Where's the bartender?

1088
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,880
The bartender needs to be behind this counter.

1089
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
Here is the bartender.

1090
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,880
What did you just do?

1091
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:18,960
The bartender cannot be a sheep.

1092
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,960
Something happened.

1093
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,960
It doesn't matter.

1094
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,960
This thing.

1095
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Something happened.

1096
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,960
I'll add these two guys in a second.

1097
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,960
Just stop.

1098
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,960
I fixed it.

1099
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,280
Let's add these Roblox guys as well.

1100
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,360
The big guys need to go in the front.

1101
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,000
Oh yes, I will make sure of that.

1102
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yeah, this is fine.

1103
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,320
Can you guys help me please?

1104
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,320
This is fine.

1105
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,880
I don't think that we need this many people.

1106
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,480
I think it needs to feel like a bar.

1107
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,880
If there's that many people, they're not standing up.

1108
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,880
Oh, there's a kid at the bar?

1109
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,880
What the hell?

1110
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
There's a kid at the bar!

1111
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,200
The people are sleeping at the bar.

1112
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
Don't worry about it.

1113
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,960
Just start the scene.

1114
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,960
And then these guys are there.

1115
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,960
Make sure those guys are out.

1116
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
They're going to come in later.

1117
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,960
All right, let me get up my notes for the freaking bar.

1118
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,400
- These guys are cool.

1119
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,720
- From now on, the new protocol is me and Cameron

1120
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,000
set up the scene and you can just start.

1121
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,600
- Yeah, and I'll just start doing stuff?

1122
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,480
You got it, oh yeah, 'cause people are gonna be listening.

1123
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,880
- What kind of bar is this?

1124
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,320
- It's Gaddy Up.

1125
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,520
- What are they doing?

1126
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,080
- It's gonna be blocked by these two big guys.

1127
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,800
- Yes, it's a seedy bar.

1128
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,520
It shares some of that look of Gadsville

1129
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,040
that you guys would have recalled if you two were there,

1130
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,500
but you would recall Patrick Yoda,

1131
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,220
where it has those, you know,

1132
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,580
baby guys clearly cashing in on his name here, right?

1133
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,160
You have some of that blue and red boxy look

1134
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,620
that Gadsville has with those kind of cables

1135
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,120
running through it.

1136
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,740
He has local Gadsville drinks on offer,

1137
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,860
show tunes blasting out of the speakers,

1138
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,220
but it's working, people are here.

1139
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,700
It's clearly sort of a like theme bar

1140
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,700
for folks on Pleasure Palace, right?

1141
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:59,780
They're here to see a little slice of Gadsville while they're away.

1142
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,540
Baby Gat has his face everywhere.

1143
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:05,500
You know, he's got his face and his label, the Prince of Parties, right?

1144
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
Because he's a prince.

1145
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,460
And he's called the Rogue Prince as one of the drinks.

1146
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:14,740
And it's really just a mezcal cocktail with chocolate syrup instead of agave.

1147
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,540
And it tastes horrible.

1148
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,540
And you see here, Baby Gat sort of starts talking to you about, you know, he's like, "You know,

1149
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,140
They don't treat us right in the undercity.

1150
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,860
You know, we don't even get the scraps, we get the scrap scraps.

1151
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,860
You know what I'm saying?

1152
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,160
Skip.

1153
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,160
*laughter*

1154
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,120
You know, you became a lot ruder somehow.

1155
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,300
You guys were crazy rude when I first met you.

1156
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Interrogate.

1157
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,300
*laughter*

1158
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,680
What do you mean? I didn't do it!

1159
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,020
What are you talking about?

1160
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,140
Interrogate again.

1161
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,480
You're out of your mind.

1162
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,100
Press harder.

1163
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,100
Okay fine, I'll spill.

1164
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,500
What do you want to know?

1165
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,340
All of it.

1166
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:59,180
See a quest marker comes up and it talks about,

1167
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,900
it's something about the Holocaust,

1168
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,200
it's something about history of the world.

1169
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,580
He says, "Leo's whole thing with the freaks

1170
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,100
"is a complete political move."

1171
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,140
Okay, so destabilizing Gunn City,

1172
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,660
he's having his empire provide refuge for their shit.

1173
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,660
It's all just a bunch of, I fucking hate this place.

1174
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,500
You know, I wish I never left Bullet Town.

1175
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
He's like sort of rambling about a bunch of crap.

1176
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:27,500
And as he leads you through the bar, you see regular folks, vacationers who stumbled into the wrong place,

1177
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:35,500
off-duty guards, which is basically most of the guard presence in the undercity, are just off-duty guys.

1178
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Whovians, robots, apes, and of course freaks.

1179
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,500
There's an air, water, fire, and earth hockey table.

1180
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
There's a... I like that.

1181
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,500
There's V-Folk strippers.

1182
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,220
There's two people doing it apparently.

1183
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,100
There's two people doing it.

1184
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,300
I still can't see it.

1185
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,900
These people could also be doing it though.

1186
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,100
So don't worry about it.

1187
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,600
Okay.

1188
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
And uh...

1189
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,900
Uh, for a...

1190
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,900
Collect the reveal.

1191
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,300
There's a...

1192
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,900
Pretty good reveal.

1193
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,900
There's a rudimentary VR headset that lets you shoot up a bank.

1194
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,300
Uh, what else do I have right in here?

1195
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,500
A poker table.

1196
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,900
There's lots of stuff you can do in Gaddys, in Gaddy Up.

1197
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,500
Um, as you approach Gadd's office, and he was gonna let you in,

1198
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
These two guys do show up.

1199
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
Is that their names?

1200
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
No.

1201
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Do show and up?

1202
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Their names are Keep Calm and Chive On.

1203
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,500
Really?

1204
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,500
Yeah.

1205
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
And Gat sort of sees them

1206
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
and you see his face kind of

1207
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
grow a little white.

1208
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,500
And he says,

1209
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
What color was it before?

1210
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
It was tan.

1211
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
He says,

1212
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,740
a second and I promise we'll talk and I'll get you I use Yoda's mind on them

1213
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:56,100
okay cool um so they're gonna try to roll to resist that time this toy keeps

1214
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:00,140
making me laugh I don't know I can't it's a very funny toy I found it at a

1215
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:05,480
like just a random store you made that

1216
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,480
I'm so glad.

1217
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:18,600
I thought that was going to be a character from like Real Steel or something.

1218
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,600
I'm so glad.

1219
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,320
Yeah, I have no idea who that was.

1220
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,000
I found him and I found two wrestlers who have the worst faces.

1221
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,720
I'm going to bring them out another time.

1222
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,480
But I found them together and they looked like a gang.

1223
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,640
I was very excited.

1224
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,280
But anyway, he's going to roll.

1225
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,280
These guys are going to try to roll a resist.

1226
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,280
Let me get their stats up.

1227
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
Hold on.

1228
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,280
but they have a bad wisdom.

1229
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,480
Definitely, they're big jocks.

1230
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,840
Yeah, they probably got head around on the head.

1231
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
Yeah, they got CTE.

1232
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,720
Football.

1233
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,760
Head around on the head?

1234
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,920
Head around.

1235
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,080
Head around on the head.

1236
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,000
Still doesn't really flow or make any sense.

1237
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,840
Head around, head around, head around.

1238
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,480
At least a level above head around.

1239
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,480
Yeah, definitely better than head around.

1240
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:58,840
You cleared your throat like you had something to say.

1241
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,680
Yeah, no, sorry, yeah.

1242
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,240
What are you doing?

1243
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,520
You were able to read.

1244
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,960
Oh my god.

1245
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Patrick just taped his eyes.

1246
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,320
Oh, he has invisible eyes.

1247
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,440
Well, you have to go in front of the blue screen.

1248
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,080
Oh, he's trying to do a thing.

1249
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,360
Or do it in front of something where there's something,

1250
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,000
I guess.

1251
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,920
You're just going in front of blackness.

1252
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,800
Oh, is this kind of--

1253
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,400
A little further, a little further.

1254
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,080
All right, yep.

1255
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,580
Perfect.

1256
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,960
All right, Patrick right now has blue tape on his eyes.

1257
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,000
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1258
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,680
This does look pretty cool.

1259
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,560
Yeah, rip that off his face.

1260
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,560
It would be so funny if he had no eyelashes.

1261
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,560
He definitely lost a few.

1262
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,820
(laughter)

1263
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:39,660
- All right, you are able to read their minds.

1264
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,260
Read to me what Yoda's mind does.

1265
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:45,020
- It's a mind reading spell?

1266
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,620
Oh, I can read minds, blah, blah, blah.

1267
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,760
I can either shift my attention to the target's thoughts,

1268
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,120
and type a rope deeper.

1269
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,880
- Yeah, you get those surface level thoughts.

1270
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,040
- Yeah.

1271
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,260
Oh, I feel like these two guys

1272
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,000
only have surface level thoughts.

1273
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,520
- They might have more deeper, but--

1274
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,800
- Well, what are their thoughts?

1275
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,960
Their thoughts that you're hearing right now, just like surface level impressions that you're

1276
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,480
getting is that they're pretty pissed at Gadd.

1277
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,480
Hot dog.

1278
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,520
Hot dog and hamburger.

1279
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,160
They're pretty pissed at Gadd.

1280
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,160
Oh!

1281
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,160
Fall.

1282
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,160
I fall down.

1283
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,000
And they're definitely wary but curious about you.

1284
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yeah.

1285
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,760
But they're pretty- I'm probing deeper then.

1286
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,960
They're really angry at Gadd.

1287
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,960
Okay, you're probed deeper?

1288
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:28,960
Yep.

1289
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,960
Here we go.

1290
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:30,960
Look at the size comparison.

1291
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:38,560
Wow, okay. Is that a wow for me? Yeah, wow for you. You did well there. So what happens when you probe deeper? Read that to me.

1292
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:44,680
Okay, if you probe deeper the target must make another wisdom saving throw.

1293
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:51,080
If it fails you gain insight into its reasoning, if any, its emotional state in something that looms large in its mind

1294
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,600
such as something it worries over, loves or hate.

1295
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,320
If it succeeds on this probing, well it didn't, so.

1296
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,680
Well you did.

1297
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,680
I've been out of the mind for 24 hours.

1298
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1299
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
So you haven't.

1300
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,840
So now, so what was the first thing there?

1301
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,200
Insight into its emotional state.

1302
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,400
Like I said, you kind of get to say it's angry, but not just angry.

1303
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:18,700
You understand that they are here to get something from being a dad, and also to get something

1304
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,640
maybe from you.

1305
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,440
As far as their, what was the last bit there?

1306
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,440
Um, does that one make sure?

1307
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,440
They're, uh, something it worries over, loves or hates.

1308
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,440
Um, they are worried...

1309
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,440
Do they love each other?

1310
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
They love each other because they're brothers.

1311
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,440
They are, they are worried...

1312
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,440
I didn't know they were brothers!

1313
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,440
Yeah.

1314
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:47,440
They are worried about people learning more about the operation that's going on with Hugeass and the scientists that works for him.

1315
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,440
The blue... squirrel?

1316
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,440
No, the blue gopher.

1317
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,440
Okay.

1318
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:08,520
for

1319
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:23,520
of

1320
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,120
No, no, no, well, no, that's a different guy.

1321
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,120
But I mean, he has at least a similar look.

1322
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,720
I don't know what that guy's called.

1323
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,520
Isn't he called Moonraker?

1324
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,920
No, Moonraker is the name of this--

1325
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,320
stop, you're fucking with me.

1326
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,280
You're fucking with me.

1327
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,480
I'm so simple.

1328
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,760
I'm such a simple little idiot.

1329
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,360
No, I genuinely don't know.

1330
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,040
I've never seen--

1331
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,640
OK, his name is Huge--

1332
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,760
Huge-ass Facts.

1333
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,120
By the way, now that I know, it's kind of stretch.

1334
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm going to be real.

1335
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,200
Huge-ass Facts, Hugo Drax?

1336
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,120
It's a stretch.

1337
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,040
It's not a big stretch.

1338
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,640
It's OK.

1339
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,600
Hugo gas where you're supposed to kind of like

1340
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:02,960
I think we'd feel differently if any of us knew who Hugo dress. Yeah, that's a good point

1341
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,240
Yeah, it was something from this all good Rick in decade you old bitch

1342
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,840
I am an old bitch when it comes to this one moonraker does take place partially on a space station. Oh

1343
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,920
My god, cuz he rakes the moon

1344
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:20,400
Anyway, so

1345
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,760
About finding out about what the Sun the scientists is doing you don't have too much more info these guys don't seem like they're capable of

1346
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,480
No

1347
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,120
Much about that. They look like visual learners

1348
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:37,120
Yeah, go on can I can I have a you know like I

1349
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:41,260
Have inside it so I can only hear their thoughts. I can't like

1350
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:47,480
Probe any further and like like Jimmy Neutron like when you go through his brain

1351
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,040
brain blast. It has a picture of the monkey and stuff. No, no, no. I can't brain blast.

1352
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:57,960
It's not quite like that. Is that an upgrade I can get? No, but maybe, it's not listed

1353
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:02,640
right now, but I can make that into an upgrade. That's a good, a visual learner or something.

1354
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,840
Visual learner is a funny upgrade. I like that idea of an upgrade, being able to see what

1355
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,480
they've seen in their minds. That's kind of fun. Alright, I was going to say, write this

1356
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:17,100
down this is recorded so I will add that I like that um what I will say is I mean

1357
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,540
this is this is enough info about their emotional state and what they're

1358
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:23,340
concerned about that you could potentially obviously use this to your

1359
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:27,380
advantage if they're concerned about the scientists and they're angry at baby Gadd

1360
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:32,380
about in this case about what went down with O'Neal you know you can start to

1361
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:35,740
draw your own conclusions or to figure out oh yeah well I know that's what

1362
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:39,700
they're I mean I got like two good yeah yeah I'm like deep in their damn mind

1363
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:45,620
So what are their, why are they here for GAD?

1364
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:50,900
So I would say that what you're able to tell is that they're upset with how this O'Neill

1365
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,080
thing is drawing attention to them.

1366
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,860
They're upset with, they kind of want to make sure that something about GAD needs to keep

1367
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:00,440
kicking up money.

1368
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:07,620
And then something else about to gauge the interest of those three detectives.

1369
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:11,620
So does this mean Gadd works for Hugeassfacts?

1370
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,620
It's not that he works for him, you get the sense?

1371
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,620
Okay, so it's like he gets shook down by him.

1372
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:18,620
A little bit, yeah.

1373
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,620
Okay.

1374
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,620
He might have his own operation, but he's kind of their bitch at the end of the day.

1375
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:24,620
Yeah, okay.

1376
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,620
Alright, what else should I ask? Is there anything else I need to know?

1377
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,620
I would say that's probably all you're going to get from them anyway.

1378
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:36,620
Okay, alright then. I'm going to walk right up to them and try and stab them.

1379
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,620
*laughter*

1380
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,120
What?

1381
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:39,620
Yep.

1382
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:44,620
I'm gonna walk up to them and I'm gonna try and stab them with a knife that's on the table next to us.

1383
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,620
All three of us are violent, crazy people.

1384
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:47,620
You really...

1385
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,620
Doesn't surprise you?

1386
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,620
Really are.

1387
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,620
You're the one who keeps putting us in fuckin' places of authority, making us cops and shit.

1388
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:54,620
Yeah.

1389
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,620
We do keep making you cops.

1390
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,620
We're bad.

1391
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,620
We're the bad guys.

1392
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,620
We're hella bad.

1393
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:59,620
You're gonna try to attack them then?

1394
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:00,620
Yeah.

1395
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,620
*laughter*

1396
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,620
Okay, uh...

1397
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,620
*laughter*

1398
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,140
Do I get to roll with advantage because they don't know I'm coming their backs are turned to me

1399
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:12,420
I would say that since you're 1/16 their size you're at a maybe

1400
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:18,740
That is not to scale your friends are not here to help. Yeah, this is 1v2. Oh, yeah

1401
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:22,780
Maybe you burst the whole I know what I still haven't healed up. So I don't think I'm gonna go

1402
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,820
Yeah, I wanted to me. I mean I go up and I grab the knife and I go

1403
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:31,720
Kind of make like I love it face. Yeah, I love how ballsy that was though

1404
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,120
I like the world where you did that too.

1405
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,920
Can we play that out for like...

1406
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,920
Yeah, you want to do that?

1407
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:37,920
You know where it's like...

1408
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,920
Yeah?

1409
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,920
Yeah.

1410
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,680
Like where they've cut back and then it's the guy's like, "Hey, hey, what are you doing?"

1411
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,680
You were zooming out.

1412
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,680
Yeah, super bad.

1413
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,680
We do one of those.

1414
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,680
You know what?

1415
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,680
Can we actually...

1416
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,400
Can we end the episode on playing this out?

1417
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,400
I want to do that.

1418
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Okay.

1419
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,400
Okay.

1420
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Roll a d20.

1421
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,400
Let's see the attack.

1422
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,400
Okay.

1423
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,400
Let's see how you do.

1424
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Okay, not good.

1425
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
Okay.

1426
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,120
So you add your, I mean add eight to that, that's not enough for your AC.

1427
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,620
You kind of like walk up to them, after reading their mind so thoroughly,

1428
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,900
they're even maybe a little intimidated by you.

1429
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,900
Like if you were standing across the bar like with your hands, do you just...

1430
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,900
*laughter*

1431
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,900
Like, they're just so...

1432
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,900
You just walk like a psycho.

1433
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,900
And then you just whiff.

1434
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:25,300
Like you just like, basically swing your sandwich upwards.

1435
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,300
And then they just like...

1436
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,300
Do they even recognize a sandwich as a weapon?

1437
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:36,100
Mean like maybe his sandwich. I mean he they've heard about you you can tell obviously they know you guys are

1438
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:43,980
Kind of crazy and then one of them with a tail so initiative we'd roll initiative so we roll initiative

1439
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:48,380
What'd you get

1440
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,380
okay, so they got a

1441
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,100
23 so they're gonna go first

1442
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,700
Here's more of what would have happened

1443
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,020
One of them would have taken out

1444
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:03,220
Well, they're already wearing their brass knuckles.

1445
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:06,220
Okay, what's your AC, Pat?

1446
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:10,420
My AC is 14.

1447
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:13,620
Okay, that hits. Let's see what also would have happened.

1448
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,620
These guys are badass.

1449
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:22,020
Okay, so that deals...

1450
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,820
And this one's got DoodleBob's powers.

1451
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,820
Yeah, that deals 13 damage to you.

1452
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,320
And then the other one would have attacked.

1453
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,520
Where you at in HP wise?

1454
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,520
I don't remember.

1455
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,520
Let's say I was at full health, because it's an imagination.

1456
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,520
You would have died.

1457
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,520
You would have died.

1458
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,020
You would have died instantly.

1459
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,320
You would have just been dead.

1460
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,520
There would have been nobody there to help you.

1461
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
Right now, cut back.

1462
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,520
Yeah, cut back and you're just standing across the bar.

1463
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,520
Wait, wait, wait.

1464
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,520
Can I implant this thought in their heads?

1465
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
No.

1466
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,520
Like, like, like, like, like, uh...

1467
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,520
Why do you want him to be like, "Get kicked out of you?"

1468
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,520
Yeah, yeah, so they think that they beat the fuck out of me, right?

1469
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,520
Then they don't view me as a threat anymore.

1470
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,520
No!

1471
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,520
I can't do like a, like a Professor X-style thing?

1472
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
Who's they? You?

1473
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,520
Yeah.

1474
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,520
No!

1475
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:17,520
You're at a bar, you're at a bar and you see a guy, you guy, you see a guy like, standing across the bar and doing, like, doing like the, the telekinesis thing at you,

1476
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,520
and then you suddenly get a vision implanted in your head of you killing that person.

1477
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:27,440
Why can't that go through?

1478
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,440
Why can't it go through?

1479
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:34,920
Why can't that go through by the ether into their brain?

1480
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:42,440
If you could see the ship from where you are, you would see a beautiful, pleasurable shape

1481
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:48,400
made of metal and black metal and yellow lights.

1482
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,900
And if you moved in a bit closer, you might even see one of the dozens or hundreds of

1483
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,120
windows really that line it.

1484
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:00,480
And you'd see some of them flicker on and off, people doing things, different activities.

1485
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:05,280
But you might see if you look closely enough, flickering on and off in a pattern, something

1486
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,760
moving through these windows.

1487
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,040
And if you listened closely enough, you could swear you could hear the faintest lullaby.

1488
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:18,280
And the only thing you would know for certain is that it's something you've

1489
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,480
never in your life heard before.

1490
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:32,600
It's a some song. It's a song. Jigglypuff. I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna make it

1491
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,680
and I'm gonna add it to the give it to Jubio. And it'll be playing over us

1492
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,680
talking right now. Yeah. Oh, and it's Jigglypuff's lullaby.

1493
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,640
Even over this part. Okay, well, I haven't heard the song yet.

1494
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,440
God, Patges, this is the song you wrote? This song sucks!

1495
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,640
No, uh... This song's a piece of shit! Hold on, it's actually...

1496
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:55,640
Hold on, wait, this part's actually pretty good. Okay, okay, go Cameron, go Cameron.

1497
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,360
Right, okay, good. Is there any feedback, any notes?

1498
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,760
On the song? Yeah. Make it quieter.

1499
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,200
Okay. Now make it louder.

1500
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,440
Now, go back quiet. Okay, Jubio.

1501
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,200
Now play it in reverse. Jubio, can you...

1502
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,200
Add a little steel drum right here.

1503
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,200
Okay.

1504
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,200
Alright, I'm gonna go pee.

1505
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:18,200
That's that mattress, man.

1506
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,200
Jeez.
