1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We are going

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I love that drinking sound.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I know.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I love beer.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And drinking.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up all my chuggers?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm trying to get that boob out.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,520
the

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,880
my god it's beer

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,040
yen guys welcome one hundred yet again

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,480
to uh...

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,680
one hundred to close to one hundred episode of beers we drank only the

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
closest we've ever been to a bit closest by far the we've ever been

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,280
Let's go ahead and crack open these beverages.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
It's a strong top.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,800
- Can I lead as the host

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,960
and as the probably having the most boring beard?

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,800
Which I thought would be fun.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,240
- As probably, as easily the fan's least favorite member,

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,920
you are allowed to lead.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
You get to go first.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,480
To try to earn some goodwill back from these people

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,560
who really, really despise you.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,120
- I went to my local 7-Eleven,

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,080
the one closest to my house.

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,960
And I was going through the preselection,

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,960
They had really generic stuff, really nothing too crazy.

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,680
But then I saw that they had this one, and I thought to myself, "This is going to be so

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
funny."

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,120
But then Rex prefaces beer with being so crazy that I think it's kind of the lamest beer

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
in the world now.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:47,080
It's an Indian Pale Ale, Evil Dog.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,440
Aero Del Mar.

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,080
How is that not crazy?

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
That's awesome.

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
That's awesome, man.

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,580
Wait, it's Ocean Dog, it's Sea Dog, I thought it was Evil Dog.

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
I thought it was Mal, not Mar.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
Right, not Mar, like the Corona.

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,580
I think I am fully dyslexic.

42
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,580
Dude's poppin' Zen.

43
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,580
That's okay, I am poppin' a Zen.

44
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,580
Um, I will go...

45
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,080
Well, first I need to hear... Sorry, I just assumed you were gonna skip the rating.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,580
No, it's okay. I will rate it badly, as I always do.

47
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,580
Mmmhmmm, I'm surprised you sprung for the IPA.

48
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,080
That is so not the flavors that I think you like in anything.

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,160
Yeah, well I saw the dog and I saw I saw dog and I thought it was what can be funny

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,240
You like a dog

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,040
Type beers you're not me and me and

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,840
Rex over here. We're getting

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
Caviar type beers we are getting the kind of an aged cheese

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,720
Clams

55
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,420
That kind of thing a chicken nugget pizza pizza beer. Yeah, that's like the kind of you like chicken nugget pizza food

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,540
and the chicken nuggets and pizza of beer I'm gonna go next guys this was a fail

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,060
turned reverse fail otherwise known as a win I forgot or I did not have time to

58
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,540
get a beer today I was busy all day long non-stop go go go yep and then I was

59
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,700
like oh we have to record I looked in the fridge for mayonnaise didn't find any

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,620
man is but I did find a beer that my wife hid from me so that I wouldn't drink it

61
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,500
I found a beer that she hid for me secret and the secret beer and those who have

62
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,620
seen the show before know that sometimes I get my wife go and get me a beer or

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,020
she on she gets a beer for me on the way home she always picks the most

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:42,340
disgusting pumpkin worse dog shit coffee really just as a way to prank me it's a

65
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,380
full prank that she does to me.

66
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,020
And this time, I wanna show you guys the difference

67
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,220
between a beer that she gets me

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,060
and a beer that she gets herself.

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Every beer I get is a bacon washed, disgusting,

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,980
- Wasn't the last one, the normal beer,

71
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,780
what was it called, the beer can?

72
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,100
- The regular beer.

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,940
- Regular beer.

74
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,500
- Yeah, so this, she just gets a normal, just IPA,

75
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,940
just a craft IPA.

76
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,660
this is a lamplighter brewing company double IPA.

77
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,380
It is disappearing into the forest.

78
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,340
It's an invisible beer.

79
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,660
It is, it has a rabbit on it.

80
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,260
It's so clear that a woman picked out this beer.

81
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,100
Yes.

82
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,940
Because he was smoking my ass beer.

83
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,740
I did not pay attention to the fact that it's almost 9%.

84
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,660
But guys, because I didn't pick out my own beer,

85
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,100
because I didn't pick out my own beer,

86
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,860
I'm taking this to another level.

87
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,020
Because what do I have before me?

88
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,020
But a bottle of Buffalo Trace, guys.

89
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,940
We're doing a beer and a shot tonight.

90
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,140
- Damn.

91
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,020
Wait, I can join you.

92
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,220
- I can also join you.

93
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,320
I still have my skull.

94
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,840
- Let's go, man.

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,340
- All right, I'm gonna go get it.

96
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,440
- Hold on, I'm gonna go do the same thing.

97
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,680
(coughing)

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:07,840
(singing)

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:23,640
*sad music*

100
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
*laughing*

101
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,080
what's up?

102
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
what? WHAT?

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,720
I just tried to open this with my mouth as you guys left, and the cork flew off, and

104
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:49,400
probably two ounces of bourbon went directly into my nose and my eye.

105
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,800
Oh my god, I'm fucking covered.

106
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,280
Ugh.

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,600
Okay, man.

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,120
That is an amazing sign for things to come.

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,120
You know some no passion is coming.

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,400
Oh god that was insanely, that feels bad.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
What's up?

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,640
Oh my, I opened my, you were gone but I opened my bourbon with my mouth and it exploded into

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,360
my nose and it was truly one of the most painful things.

114
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,960
Somebody will clip this and you'll be able to see I had a true reaction.

115
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,200
And that's how you know none of this is scripted.

116
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,880
Things like this happen all the time.

117
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,880
up

118
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
to beers

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
we're bodies

120
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,960
musco beers

121
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,600
also okay

122
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,200
or

123
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,640
uh... now the beer guys

124
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,720
this is how i'd be a shot where he chases with the beer

125
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
jesus christ

126
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Now beautiful Rex.

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,120
So I lied about having a crazy beer.

128
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
I have a Heineken.

129
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Oh my god.

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Pranks we pulled!

131
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Don't do this to me!

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:18,120
I just, I offhandedly was pranking Caleb and then you fed that information to Juvio and he's like "Oh my beer is so gay it's got a dog on it."

133
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
You told me it was crazy.

134
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,520
I mean I was, you know, just running with the bit, the gang.

135
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,080
Since when have we done pranks and lies on this show?

136
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Since never.

137
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,360
Well, starting today.

138
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,400
Okay, give me a Heineken review.

139
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
It's perfect.

140
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Heineken is great.

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Heineken, okay.

142
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,360
Heineken and Rolling Rock, I call them the green bottle twins.

143
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,640
They are severely underrated beers in a glass bottle.

144
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,880
I don't think I've ever had rolling rock in a glass bottle, but I have had 30 green cans.

145
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,720
The green cans are not as good as the glass.

146
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Something about glass feels harder to me than a can.

147
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,760
Yeah, I would agree with that, yes.

148
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
Okay, so yeah, so I'm on the right track.

149
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,320
It also tastes better out of the glass hard bottle.

150
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,720
I think that's true.

151
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,040
There's a, okay, here's, I'd like to posit you guys something, okay?

152
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Right.

153
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Sure.

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,160
This is my theory, I've been working on this for many years.

155
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,120
Beer tastes better the harder the glass is, right?

156
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,320
Well, what about a Sapporo?

157
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
A Sapporo is a very hard glass and that's one of my favorite beers, the hard can.

158
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I see.

159
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
So you're saying glass as...

160
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
That's an extremely heavy duty.

161
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,800
So, yeah, container.

162
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
The harder the cup is, the drinking thing.

163
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,280
So like a really thick cup?

164
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,440
A thick glass cup is great.

165
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,260
But okay, so the vessel is harder, the beer is better.

166
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,460
But then with water, guys, the inverse is true.

167
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:07,540
The best water comes from a shitty plastic cup that I stole from the movie theater.

168
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,200
A big, disgusting, BPA-filled plastic cup with ice-cold water.

169
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,040
And then also, those bottles, those eco-bottles, those eco-water bottles that you can crush

170
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,680
and turn into a twisty weapon.

171
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,160
- I drink out of this and this is hard.

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
- See that doesn't sound good.

173
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,600
That sounds awful to me.

174
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,160
- Have I ever shown you guys my water drinking thing?

175
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
- Whoa, it's a Bucky's cup.

176
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
- It's a Bucky's cup.

177
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
- See that's a perfect looking cup to me.

178
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,740
- It's a really insane cup.

179
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,440
It says, sorry, I can hear you over the sound

180
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,520
of freedom ringing, which I'm not American

181
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,880
nor care about freedom.

182
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,360
- Well, we let freedom ring.

183
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,160
You just said the same thing twice.

184
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
- Right. - Yeah.

185
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
- But I drink water-- - You're not American.

186
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,920
You don't care about freedom.

187
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,760
What do you care?

188
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
What, if you ran for president,

189
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,400
or Presidente of Mexico--

190
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,120
- Dude, this is so fucking easy.

191
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,440
I've been thinking about this for so long.

192
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
- Oh, okay, well, let me interrupt you.

193
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,800
Go ahead, you have the floor, my friend.

194
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,440
- What I would say is so,

195
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,320
I wouldn't make any grand promises.

196
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,000
I wouldn't go out there in the streets

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,600
kissing dirty babies.

198
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:33,920
all

199
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Here comes Chris Christie, big, making out with a kid's head.

200
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Ew.

201
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:50,440
Alright, so no baby kissing, no grand posturing myself as the new star of any which side political

202
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,840
spectrum side.

203
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,920
My one and only thing is I'm going to go out there on the podium on the Republican debate.

204
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,920
So you are, you said no side, but then you said you are a Republican.

205
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,360
I just ended up there. I just ended up there anyways.

206
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,040
Okay. So we'll just go. Uh, I'm sorry, Donald Trump. Uh,

207
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,800
what I promised the people is I want to make groceries $1.

208
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,640
Wow.

209
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,720
Can I ask you about this policy and plus we're building a wall by the way.

210
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,880
Yeah. Go ahead. Lady in the, in the white and the glasses. Go ahead.

211
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,600
Beautiful lady that I'm going to kiss later.

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
*laughter*

213
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,520
Hey, I have a beard and you are clean-shaven.

214
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,960
I don't wanna hear none of that.

215
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,400
But he has short hair like a boy, and you have long hair like a girl.

216
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,240
He looks like a lesbian.

217
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
Point to kill, but he's wearing a ribbon.

218
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,400
Nope.

219
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
Thank you.

220
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,080
Like a lesbian.

221
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,440
You're losing the debate right now.

222
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,400
Okay, go ahead.

223
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,880
What's your point?

224
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,280
Anyway.

225
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:59,920
Is all of the groceries you buy at once $1, or is each individual grocery $1?

226
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,960
I think that would be absurd.

227
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,760
I think it has to be individual groceries. So like every individual item is now this is just becoming the debate

228
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:16,040
So I just like to jump in here the

229
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:24,240
Groceries are not $1 as a whole according to mr. Julio's plan. I'll be ridiculous. That would be ridiculous, but I am an agreement on this

230
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
Grocery should be individually

231
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,440
$1 in this country. Yep, you come back home

232
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,020
You spend I don't know tops 30 bucks. You're gonna full pantry for it for two weeks

233
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,540
Okay, I like that but

234
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,060
Theoretically all groceries could be $1. They would just get smaller and that's fine

235
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:50,120
What if you had a smaller pantry? What if that's what we have really offering so but when you say all so you're saying

236
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,440
Like if you bought I don't know again something I eat a lot of you have one

237
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,640
Socialist Marxist into this debate by the way. Yeah, I agree. Well, it's clearly this woman in the white

238
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,880
And I think I recognize you from a Playboy cover issue. Yeah, and I'm okay with you staying

239
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,800
But I do think that yeah, if so, what's an expensive grocery? What's something you buy?

240
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,680
That's like kimchi is something that I buy and every time I get to the register. I'm $9

241
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,820
I can't believe I just paid $10 for this a big thing of a

242
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,680
of ham. A big thing is the groceries that you buy.

243
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,040
You buy spiral ham so often?

244
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,640
Are you insane?

245
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,680
Why would like what would a pound of ham should cost $10?

246
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah. $1. A pound of ham is, is, is not $10.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,960
I don't think it's like the cheapest possible meat.

248
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, I just went to the bodega and everything was $10 for a pound.

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,600
True. Well, you live in Hollywood.

250
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,980
That's true Hollywood East point, you know, that's what they we did

251
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,840
We had two TV shows that filmed in my hometown of Wilmington when I was a kid really and once people started

252
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,980
Dawson's Creek, yeah and

253
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:15,880
Another show like that that I don't remember the name of it, but because of these two shows we got the nickname

254
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Hollywood East guys a bunch of stuff in my hometown that says Hollywood East

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,360
Well, Asheville is a woke nexus.

256
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Well, I didn't live anywhere near Asheville.

257
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,080
Well, I'm just saying.

258
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,840
Well, you do come from a woke family.

259
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,280
Yeah, my family is anti- until recently, the least woke people of all time.

260
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,360
I was thinking the other day, my grandpa still says, uh, the blacks.

261
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,680
He says that all the time.

262
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,880
But he's not saying the n-word, which for a guy in his 70s might as well be saying people

263
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,360
of color in the most respectful way possible.

264
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,000
That is litera- I think that that- that he has- that's like his limit.

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,800
That's like where he can get to like 1930s level of respectfulness towards other races.

266
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,040
If you as like a person in their 20s are like the blacks, you are racist.

267
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,860
If someone who was born in 1940 says the blacks, they are saying black and indigenous people

268
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
of color.

269
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
Mmm.

270
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
But it- I guess you're right.

271
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,320
Just not enunciating the other four words of that.

272
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,840
I guess that's true as fuck.

273
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,840
My family, my mom has become a Wokie recently in the last, because of Trump.

274
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Trump turned my mom completely into a Wokie.

275
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Yes!

276
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Trump turns moms into libs because he grabs women by the pussy and they hate that.

277
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Is that true?

278
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Yeah.

279
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
How did this transformation happen in your eyes?

280
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Well, my mom, I think, okay, my mom was not a reality TV person, so she never had the

281
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,840
existing goodwill for Donald Trump, okay?

282
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
She didn't already think he was funny.

283
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
She didn't watch any movies with him in it?

284
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Like, Home Alone?

285
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,340
Two?

286
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,840
The Home Al-

287
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Can we get over this Home Alone thing?

288
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,340
We get it, he was in the-

289
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
He was a celebrity.

290
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,840
Plenty of celebrities are in movies all the fucking time.

291
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,340
Yeah, but not-

292
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:04,840
Okay?

293
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
The Minions are in-

294
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Are in Despicable Me, did you know that?

295
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
I didn't know that, yeah.

296
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,340
And they're also yellow.

297
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
And they're completely yellow, just like Donald Trump.

298
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Or he's some color.

299
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,840
Will you vote for a Minion?

300
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
What?

301
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,340
Will you vote for a Minion?

302
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,340
Real quick.

303
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,340
the

304
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,340
the

305
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
the

306
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,340
the

307
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
the

308
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
the

309
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
the

310
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
the

311
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,340
the

312
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
the

313
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,340
the

314
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
the

315
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,340
the

316
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
the

317
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:59,780
the

318
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,920
I was just the biggest dork. I forget that we had the same childhood. Yeah. Yeah in a way

319
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,320
We split at some point where you kept getting smarter and I stayed at the same kind of level of intelligence

320
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,720
but I

321
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,420
I had

322
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Basically kind of saw a seeded this entire this libertarian thing with my mom for some time and she was showing I would put Ron

323
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,780
Paul videos on the on the TV on the YouTube app and

324
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,060
I would be like check this out man. He's basically owning

325
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:39,120
People because they I got her with the weed thing first. I was showing her Ron Paul videos

326
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
She was like, yeah, we'd should be legal and

327
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,420
Then she voted for Gary Johnson

328
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,300
Obama won and she held it against me for probably four and a half years treated me very differently

329
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:55,620
And then it's your fault, yeah, it was my fault and then and then the the fucking the

330
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,780
Debate started happening. She gets plugged back in Donald Trump comes up. She loved

331
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,860
What's the name Nikki Haley from South Carolina? She loved Nikki Haley. She's

332
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,660
this time probably I

333
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,700
Think Donald Trump will probably be the night

334
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,260
I do too I was thinking that which is like it'll be nice to not have to change our intro

335
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:23,600
Because the only two politicians anyone will care about or Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Yeah, probably but the thing is so

336
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:31,500
Nikki Haley gets knocked out my mom thinks of Donald Trump as an evil bastard and she thinks what is the next thing to a woman?

337
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,940
running for president a

338
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
gay guy

339
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:46,260
Yeah, and I

340
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,800
Got I got her she voted for Bernie in the primary. I believe

341
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,580
Which was pretty crap, but she said I'll vote for him in the primary because you want me to but I'm not gonna vote for

342
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
him for president

343
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:06,240
Which was awesome, but now she's still a huge Pete Buttigieg fan thinks that he should primary Joe Biden

344
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:14,640
She thinks Joe Biden is a pedophile. She's still that's a thing. She's like one of the only people who's like like straight-line Democrat and

345
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,880
Also believes that like Hillary Clinton has actually eaten a child

346
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,700
Like she believes all that shit. That's so awesome

347
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,660
Pretty awesome. Should we segue this into talking about what happened in Crown Heights?

348
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,320
What happened in crap? Oh, oh with the tunnel the tunnels

349
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,340
Yeah, I'm gonna let you take this one man. This is probably the funniest

350
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,340
the video of the

351
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,300
Hasidic guy

352
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,860
Crawling out of the tunnel and scurrying away

353
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,280
Uh-huh.

354
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Might be the funniest video that we'll ever make.

355
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,480
Just wanna jump in, just wanna jump in here.

356
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,180
If I told this story, I would not have said scurrying.

357
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,380
But, again, Rex is telling the story, so he can go ahead and say scurrying.

358
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,880
Dude.

359
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,980
Anything like that, go ahead.

360
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,580
He was scurrying, 'cause he got that, he got like, and he started shuffling like this.

361
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,080
Yeah.

362
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,580
Too fucking slow.

363
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,080
Or not yet.

364
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
We're, we got...

365
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,880
Well, it's not our fault that fucking Haseeds are crawling out of tunnels in Crown Heights,

366
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,320
being videotaped by, you know, fellows on the street

367
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,320
doing probably the most embarrassing caricature of being a Jewish rodent of all time.

368
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Okay, here...

369
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Alright, again, Rice is fully Jewish, 100% Jewish.

370
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,320
He can say whatever he wants.

371
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Every single person in my family is Jewish.

372
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Okay.

373
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Here's what I want to say about the tunnels.

374
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Yeah, go ahead man.

375
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
I...

376
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,320
I... if I knew how to make a tunnel,

377
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
then I would make one. That sounds fun.

378
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
What's in it?

379
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,320
I don't think they were raping. I don't think they were doing anything crazy down there.

380
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
I think they built those tunnels

381
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
because they thought it was cool.

382
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,320
And then as soon as someone saw them in the tunnel, they were like, "Come on now."

383
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,320
I agree. I think that there's no malice with these tunnels.

384
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,760
I think they were almost certainly storage facilities

385
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,500
And the thing is if you the thing hot seeds are a whole different

386
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,920
Kind of person that you never see anywhere else. They all drive minivans

387
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,680
They all have barred windows that they go sit on once a year to do some holiday

388
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,320
it's a very bizarre culture and

389
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,720
what and I

390
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,880
Think that

391
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,680
They could definitely I could see them just being like it's cool. Like it's cool to have a tunnel

392
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,820
Yeah, like this is just cool, you know

393
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:55,880
I'm not gonna go with they own everything. That's not something that I would say personally

394
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:04,560
Maybe like a chosen people right and that nothing particularly applies to them

395
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,480
I think we should harness this power because they also wasn't it a big thing like when Israel was like claiming that

396
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,280
They were Hamas are like underground bases. It just came on that day that Israelis made the tunnels

397
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:27,520
Regardless I think we can harness this this power from from this chosen people and

398
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,920
Make more tunnels for for trains is what I say. That's my new platform

399
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,520
Seeds should build the railroad sir. I'm hearing from you. I think that would be a very

400
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,520
My time

401
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,440
Okay

402
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,320
There's no I thought types of Jews and there's there's normal people who just happen to have be

403
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Unlucky enough to born people weren't Jewish. There's Hossein's who love it and then there's Israelis who are the mentally ill

404
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
Those are the white lights

405
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:05,720
Why is it that on this show everything we say we say with no malice and it always is the most anti-semitic thing

406
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:12,840
Are you on my screen? You're pointing to all my other discourse? That's right. Are you pointing at Rex on the feet?

407
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,520
I'm putting up the right person

408
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,200
Okay. Yeah, I think it really is psychotic that almost every single time it ends up being a

409
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,680
Disgusting display of anti-semitism in a way that we never mean it to be. Yeah, of course

410
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,760
I think except for maybe this guy

411
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,200
Yeah, are you pointing to me cuz that is Julio on my screen? I'm pointing at you Rex. I really am pointing at you

412
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
You pointed the other side, please. I'm a little

413
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,460
There you go, there we go, yeah, so enough of the tunnels man

414
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:56,280
Talk about it all you'd like man. I know you're talking about it behind closed doors. No, you never I have a family

415
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,160
And I have a life that I'd like to continue living

416
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,800
You're looking it up right now. You're watching the video

417
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,240
Not man, it was so funny

418
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,880
I went into that account that really puts like that take talk on Twitter and it was just like fully like a

419
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,280
like a pro sireness just like oh, this is what happening with like sign is in today and

420
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,120
I think that what they got made fun of so hard that they deleted it within like three hours

421
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,520
Which is really funny to me

422
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,280
Again man, it was cool. I know that now they've they've done something which I think this is a hate crime

423
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,920
they

424
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,920
They covered up the hole where the guy popped out of they did

425
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,940
It's a hate crime in the sense that we're not gonna get another video of a Jewish guy

426
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,960
It's a crime to every to man

427
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Right man as a whole has been hate crimed by this disgusting display by the NYPD

428
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Did you see that the Italian guy that interacts with that sect of Chabad so often that he's called the rabbi?

429
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,260
No, but that's awesome. That Italian cop who was like yelling at them. Wait, that's the guy- wait that guy that all the pictures are of?

430
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,780
Yeah, is he- they call him the rabbi? They call him the rabbi. I love that guy. He's awesome. Yeah, it's so funny

431
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,500
There's some post it's like it's all scam. It's all scheme because he's called the rabbi

432
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,860
No, that is the nicest way possible for saying he's the only one with the soft touch enough to interact with those

433
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,200
Wow, wow, do you should I maybe convert I

434
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:39,640
Would that be has there ever been a Gentile who is converted to not just Judaism, but a acidic Judaism

435
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,180
Yeah, I knew them. Yeah, I mean really I know a Mormon that hot seeds are Orthodox. Well, it was hubbub

436
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
So oh really

437
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:56,180
Has seemed but the thing the thing that's cool about the the whole like Hasidic thing is that they're there in these are the

438
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,280
closest thing that like is in Judaism to like like

439
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,580
Buddhist monks, yeah, like they believe they believe in like that like the

440
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,120
The what's it called the kabbalah kabbalah?

441
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,300
The Kabbalah is so cool, man

442
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,420
Most of them don't believe in the Kabbalah cuz that's like what Madonna is into

443
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:25,660
What's the kabbalah? Really? The Kabbalah is like this Jewish mysticism thing. And then also there's these there's all these posters. I don't know if this is

444
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:31,540
Chabad or Hasid, but there's all these posters in New York City that say like the

445
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,740
the

446
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,740
What's this? What do they call them?

447
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:43,660
The Savior is here or whatever and it's just some random like 95 year old guy on the poster and they're like this has been this

448
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,180
Is the real Jesus?

449
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Yeah, and I think that is cool

450
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,780
Yeah, the Hossein's believe that like their one rabbi is the Messiah

451
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,420
basically

452
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
And then they passed that down

453
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,620
Generationally, okay. Yeah, so it's like Dalai Lama. Yeah, it is basically Dalai Lama

454
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,620
Yeah, I mean it's it's awesome if they weren't a completely evil sect of people that

455
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:15,020
Get away with lots of crimes like rape and things like that, which is I'm not saying that in an anti-semitic way

456
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:22,580
It's horrific what happens to the I know there's a there's a movie about this. Yeah, it's it's really bad

457
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,220
they don't like interact with the police at all, so they just

458
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,300
Things go on

459
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
and solved and...

460
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,300
Right.

461
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,800
They can't read, they don't have phones.

462
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,300
They have to have that really shitty haircut.

463
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,800
With the paisleys, the curls.

464
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,300
Paisleys, yes.

465
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:51,800
My mom was a kebab goer for about two years.

466
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,300
Yes.

467
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,860
No, but it was segregated so I didn't care.

468
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,980
Oh, you didn't care if she shaved her head or not?

469
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,860
Yeah, I was awesome. It was like, because growing up I would get in trouble every time we had

470
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,140
to go to the temple, right? You know, it's like, you're so annoying that your mom is

471
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,700
like, "I'm going to break your PS2 if you don't stop."

472
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,260
But then she goes to a different church so you don't see her.

473
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,140
Well, she's on the other side and she's not allowed to see you.

474
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,460
Oh, God.

475
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,260
So then you can just be on your phone the whole time and that is awesome.

476
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,940
God damn, that's cool, man.

477
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
That actually sounds so- my mom used to-

478
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
Isn't that so fucking awesome?

479
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:34,940
My mom would do full WWE moves on me in the middle of church because I drew a smiley face on the pamphlet.

480
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Almost every single time.

481
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,940
Yeah. Yeah, my mom would fucking destroy me.

482
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,940
My life would be in shambles.

483
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,940
But then my grandma's on the other side of me, giving me gum.

484
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,940
Oh yeah!

485
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
Thanks for the gum, Nana!

486
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,940
I think that's an experience that people have been losing over the years.

487
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,580
That kids going, being forced to go to church and just being, rotting there for like two

488
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,300
hours so bored.

489
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,300
It's not TikTok.

490
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,060
They put, send them to church.

491
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,620
I had a much, I had, I would say I had one of the worst church experiences of all time.

492
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,140
Right up, Noah had the number one worst cause his dad was the pastor.

493
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,940
But my mom was the worship leader at our church.

494
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,700
Like every church we went to she would find a way onto the worship team.

495
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,620
And so I would have to get there at 6 in the morning and stay for the rehearsal and then

496
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,680
for both services every single day.

497
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,140
It was hell bro.

498
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,380
And so I would walk around and I would cuss to myself.

499
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,520
Because I thought that this was a cool kind of way to...

500
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,860
I thought God could hear me so I'd walk around and be like "fuck."

501
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
Yeah.

502
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Ass.

503
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
For four hours?

504
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,580
Yeah, well, she'd only made me go to one service.

505
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Right.

506
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,940
She'd only made me go to one service.

507
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,780
And my, I know I've talked about this before, but my past, sometimes I would really tune

508
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,180
in to what my pastor was saying.

509
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
His name was Devin.

510
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,540
Most of the time I'd completely zone out, but then every once in a while I'd lock in

511
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,260
because he would start talking about Obama and every single time he would be hinting

512
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,500
that somebody should be assassinating him.

513
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,100
And it was so fucking awesome.

514
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
That is awesome.

515
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
Yeah.

516
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:23,100
The nice thing about Temple Riot is that there's always a game of pickup basketball going on right outside

517
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:29,100
and kids in Yankees, Yamakas are just draining free throws because their fundamentals are amazing.

518
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Free throws? They're doing fouls? They're calling fouls?

519
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Of course! Everything is a foul.

520
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:40,100
But they're litigators at heart, so they're always getting into trouble and being like "Hey, that's a foul!"

521
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
It's a six hour game of 21.

522
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,940
But they're just sinking buckets from the freezer a lot.

523
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,980
That is so awesome, man.

524
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,620
Yeah, we didn't have anything like that.

525
00:30:51,620 --> 00:31:00,860
My church was all fat guys, like fat people who like all owned all the franchises of all

526
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,100
the like fast food restaurants in our hometown.

527
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,460
And then there was one family, the entire family is like six boys shows up to church every single

528
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:22,820
a

529
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,520
nice bow tie look like? Crazy patterns that you fucking wouldn't believe. Different

530
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,560
themes depending on what time of year it was. You could tell that it was

531
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,880
autumn. Not even by looking outside you look at his fucking bow tie. He had a bow tie

532
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,080
I'm not I'm not kidding when I said I went to this church for four years never

533
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,840
saw him wear the same bow tie twice. Not once. This guy would wear him he'd turn

534
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,200
him and burn him dude. Give him to his kid every fucking time. He looked amazing.

535
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:59,520
that is crazy it was pretty it was pretty sick but we don't have in Christianity

536
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,640
we don't have a I'm trying to think if there's anything that's like has like

537
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,580
hot seeds in Christianity I guess Mormonism is kind of like that we're

538
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,000
like a little bit more insular and there's like kind of weird rules yeah I

539
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,680
I mean Mormons are similar. Really the Hasid's are like the Amish.

540
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,120
True, I guess Amish are... what are they? Yeah.

541
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,200
Are Amish... Amish aren't normal style Christian.

542
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
No, they're like Christian plus.

543
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,800
But don't they think the Pope is the devil?

544
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,320
Well, most people think the Pope is the devil.

545
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,440
That's true. My entire family thought that all of Catholics were going to hell.

546
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,400
Yeah, it's like a sect, right? You know?

547
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,060
Uh, maybe like Greek Orthodox?

548
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,880
Like, like the true, like, Orthodox, but...

549
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,600
I went to a couple of Greek Orthodox churches 'cause my friend went there.

550
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,440
And that was... I've still never been to a Catholic Mass, that's probably the closest thing I've ever gone to it.

551
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,520
And it was so...

552
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,800
-fucking boring, dude. -Yeah.

553
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I was like, "I'm never complaining about church again."

554
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
It was so goddamn boring.

555
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,000
'Cause here's the thing, man.

556
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,160
the orthodox churches where the people wear robes

557
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,020
either greek orthodox or catholic

558
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,660
what do you get on communion

559
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,120
a wafer

560
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,620
yeah okay what do you get at a an evangelical

561
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,280
a hearty piece of sourdough bread

562
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,140
that's what we got and grape juice

563
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,380
that's actually fire

564
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,640
that was our communion

565
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
a big ass piece like

566
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,440
straight out of cracker barrel

567
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,300
just cornbread anything

568
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,820
yes any card they had their of a fuckin sweet potato and then you take that with

569
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,780
grape juice

570
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,020
it was amazing jesus has been picking up

571
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,580
over the years

572
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,460
yeah and i was reflected uh... in his in his uh... church

573
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,780
we had some big ones

574
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,620
jesus a little diabetic

575
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,020
was a little sweet

576
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,060
and as well as a little people probably every year we probably lost

577
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,700
in a two hundred fifty person congregation

578
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,780
probably lost three people to heart attacks every year

579
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,360
yeah but i think that's just living and it's not like you live in the south but

580
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,660
that just living near itself

581
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,100
i live in it

582
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,840
kind of fucking bullshit did you just say to me it's not like i lived in the

583
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,900
south that's pretty

584
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,660
that's crazy shit

585
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,740
that's what i think that's what i think that's the thing that's out

586
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,980
not carolina's not the south it has north in the name

587
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,260
Are you- I'm sorry, have you lost your mind?

588
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,380
Wait, hang on, I think-

589
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,820
Have you lost your- is North Korea the North Pole?

590
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,880
No!

591
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,460
It's Asia!

592
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,020
It's the North Pole of Korea!

593
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,980
Okay, then it's the North Pole of the Carolinas, but it is the South!

594
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
It's below the Mason Dixie line!

595
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,300
It's a- it is the South!

596
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,700
The Mason Dixie line is...

597
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,540
You're showing your hand here.

598
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,080
What?

599
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,500
It's Mason Dixon!

600
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,300
I said it and then I was like please nobody notice that I said Mason Dixie

601
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:15,620
line listen here's how Southern North Carolina is my hometown had the only

602
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:21,660
coup d'etat successful coup d'etat in American history because it was a that

603
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,300
town had a black guy running the newspaper and it got raided by the Klan

604
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,940
and they destroyed the entire town burned everything down and then it sucked

605
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,060
for a hundred years because of how racist people were.

606
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,060
Okay.

607
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,040
Being from a place that's racist doesn't mean you're from the South.

608
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,140
LA is in the southern part of the United States, it's below the Mason-Dixon line.

609
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,100
Sorry, Los Angeles didn't exist when the Mason-Dixon line was drawn, okay?

610
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,380
So I see a flaw instantly.

611
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,820
It's not part of the South, I'm sorry man.

612
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,100
North Carolina is part of the South.

613
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
What do you think the South is?

614
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,580
Do you think fucking Arizona is the South?

615
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
It's not the South.

616
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,580
No.

617
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
That's the Southwest, obviously.

618
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,060
It's very different.

619
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,500
North Carolina is easily the South.

620
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,860
You've spent no time there.

621
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,020
I'm not going to listen to you.

622
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
You're stupid.

623
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
It's...

624
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,020
No, I'm sorry.

625
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,860
You do not get to claim the South in this way.

626
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
Can we take a trip?

627
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,260
Are you crazy?

628
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,700
Are you out of your fucking mind?

629
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Can we please take a trip to North Carolina?

630
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,300
Do you know nothing about North Carolina?

631
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,540
North Carolina is the South.

632
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,980
I'm not saying a small town isn't racist.

633
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,540
No, no, the entire...

634
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,340
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I even said that. The entire state is the south.

635
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,320
The entire state front to back is the south.

636
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,920
Asheville is literally like a woke college area. It's-

637
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,520
Why do you keep bringing up Asheville? Asheville has like, it's like 80,000 people in Asheville.

638
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,920
It's like the seventh biggest city in the- in the fucking state.

639
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,660
What are the big cities in North Carolina?

640
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,620
Charlotte.

641
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,720
Raleigh.

642
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Woke.

643
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Charlotte and Raleigh are not woke.

644
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,060
And what is a wolf this have any

645
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,260
Atlanta's woke

646
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:09,620
Yeah, Atlanta is lit. Atlanta is the South but well, Georgia is the South but Atlanta is

647
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,340
Not the South

648
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,860
You

649
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:19,940
Okay, you you are done. You are done. We're not talking about this anymore. We're moving on to sports, right?

650
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:27,100
This is not a something that you can even this is the I have never been more disgusted with you in my entire fucking life

651
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,740
This is like so disgusting to me that you would bar. Sorry wait, I'm back in barbecue

652
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,720
We have we have one of the big four regional barbecues and you're saying it's not southern. Wait, what is it?

653
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,300
What is one of the four regions? What are the four regions?

654
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,140
Kansas City

655
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,460
So it's Kansas City the self. Nope

656
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,460
Nope.

657
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:54,460
I think Rick's wins.

658
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,460
I'm starting with that.

659
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,460
I think Rick's wins.

660
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,540
Okay, well you don't win, it's the South.

661
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
Google it.

662
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,540
I'll Google it right now.

663
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Google what the South?

664
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,100
I hate to do this.

665
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,620
I hate to do this.

666
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:21,620
Is North Carolina the South?

667
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:29,180
He's going to read a whole ass Wikipedia article now about this.

668
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,820
Wait, no, no, it's...

669
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,620
They were part of the Confederacy, but...

670
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
That's the South.

671
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,540
The Confederacy is the South.

672
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
That's the South.

673
00:38:41,540 --> 00:39:00,900
a

674
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,500
They're saying this is the South, but it's not the real South.

675
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,620
You don't know anything!

676
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
They're talking out of your ass!

677
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,620
I'm just saying what I read in one form or post.

678
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
I didn't say it's the Deep South.

679
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,260
The Deep South is people start talking in a crazy way.

680
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,220
Yeah.

681
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,780
That's not... I have nothing to do with that.

682
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,860
And I'm glad. I've been to all those states and they're all really, really terrible places.

683
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,460
Someone said it's South-ish, not Southern.

684
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,300
You guys are so fucking stupid.

685
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,340
It's on the line man, I don't know what you want me to say.

686
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,340
It's very up in the back.

687
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,940
It's, it's, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, see, see, see, this is where you get it wrong.

688
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,500
It's not on the line.

689
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,860
It's below the line!

690
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,100
It might as well be the line.

691
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,300
That's fine, I'll take the line.

692
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,860
And you know, but, so, it is the line, because Virginia, not Southern.

693
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,300
I mean some people like- But Virginia is, I would consider Virginia

694
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,100
and North Carolina to be basically the same thing.

695
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:11,980
the

696
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:18,060
Rex and we're going North Carolina and South Carolina are effectively the one

697
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,700
big state so this is where you have a real problem and you can't say anything

698
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,820
because you've never been to either of them you have nothing to say about these

699
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,900
two places they are the same state the water they're different because we have

700
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,860
two different kinds of barbecue and by the way there's much worse and nobody's

701
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,820
nobody even knows about it nobody has any North Carolina barbecue is iconic

702
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,700
South Carolina barbecue, nobody gives a fuck about that.

703
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,740
- Is that your North Korea, South Korea argument?

704
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,900
To keep yourself separated, just the barbecue?

705
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,240
- Pretty much, there's a huge barbecue divide

706
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,720
because in the South Carolina, they do the same barbecue

707
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,060
but they add mustard to it.

708
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,240
- That is true, I do know that.

709
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,500
- So it's disgusting.

710
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,580
It really is like revolting, I can't even look at it.

711
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,300
The smell when you walk into a South Carolina barbecue place

712
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,540
of which there are very few because they are so disgusting.

713
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,800
There's more North Carolina barbecue in South Carolina

714
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,320
than there is South Carolina barbecue.

715
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,280
If you walk into one, immediately you're hit

716
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,640
with this disgusting wave of just,

717
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,120
oh God, keep that away from me, it's yellow.

718
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,600
- Right, okay.

719
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,440
I think I've heard enough.

720
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,400
I think I might have taken away.

721
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,860
- Okay, we can go differently.

722
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,080
We can go differently to a different topic.

723
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,200
Okay, wait, we did Jewish stuff, we did Southern stuff.

724
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,160
Julio, it's your turn, what do you have?

725
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,840
- Fuck, I don't know, I was,

726
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,240
Mexico has been crazy recently.

727
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,040
- What's going on with Mexico, man?

728
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,520
- I actually don't have a single idea

729
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,840
of what's going on in Mexico. - I think that you

730
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,440
are more informed about what's going on in America

731
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,680
than Mexico by a long mile.

732
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,560
- I think that's what people in America think

733
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,360
of anyone in the world.

734
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,980
- Well, it's true.

735
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,320
- It's not true because I don't know anything

736
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,880
that's happening in either country

737
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,480
because I have fully turned into a suburban white mom

738
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,560
who just hates talking to people

739
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,920
and I never leave the house

740
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,720
unless I'm going to the supermarket.

741
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
- That's, I'm sorry man.

742
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,240
- It's actually kind of cute.

743
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,080
- Yeah.

744
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,280
- It's actually really chill.

745
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,320
I'm eating food today.

746
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,080
And I'm thinking I'm about to become a chef.

747
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,440
- Yum. - How so?

748
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,960
- I think I'm about to just cook every single one of my meals

749
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,240
for the first time in my life.

750
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,080
- What have you been doing?

751
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,440
You've been ordering food?

752
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:37,940
No.

753
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,440
Thank God, this is one of the worst things you can do for your wallet.

754
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Oh, I lost my wallet today and then had it returned.

755
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
I already talked about that on the premium episode.

756
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:45,940
Yeah, let's talk about that.

757
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,440
Oh, someone stole my debit card that I never take out of my room.

758
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,440
And they used it, I noticed, to charge for Turkcell,

759
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,940
which, take a guess, Turkish cell phone.

760
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,940
How did somebody steal your debit card?

761
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,940
I don't know, but I saw like an $8 charge for Turkcell

762
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,940
and then a three cent like withdraw from an ATM.

763
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,620
- Okay, so wait, wait, wait, wait.

764
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,220
- This is a confused thing that you have.

765
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,260
This is probably, if you go to any smoke shop or deli,

766
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,740
they always have a very different name

767
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,220
on your bank statement.

768
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,100
So you'll go to-- - No, Turkcell is real.

769
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,260
- Turkcell is real?

770
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,700
- Turkcell is real.

771
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,500
- And so did you get RFID scanned or something, you think?

772
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,100
- I love that 'cause I never use that card.

773
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
I haven't taken that card to a deli.

774
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,100
Mmmmm.

775
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,100
The 3 cent ATM is making me think that this is not possible.

776
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:47,100
So they did a 3 cent ATM withdrawal and then a 3 cent deposit.

777
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,100
It's insane.

778
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,100
That just can't be true.

779
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Do you want me to share?

780
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:59,100
No, no, no. I mean it has to be some issue that is going on with your bank or something.

781
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,620
There's no ATM in the world can you take three cents out of.

782
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,620
I mean a Turkish lira is three cents.

783
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:10,540
Do you think if you call them and you go like, "Hey, there's like something crazy going on

784
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,540
with my account.

785
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,860
Yeah, nine bucks are like being crazy right now."

786
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,980
No, they flagged my account for fraud.

787
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,700
And a Turkish lira is literally three cents.

788
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,580
Oh, so you think that it might be in Turkey somebody is taking out one dollar.

789
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,620
Yeah, they were testing it to see if it was number one.

790
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:43,620
a

791
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,820
You use one of those? You use one of those wrist rests?

792
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,140
Oh god, holy oh no.

793
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,700
That is a disgusting thing to use. It's a Christmas

794
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,620
gift. Throw it away. Give it to somebody else.

795
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:01,060
That's like an old person, that's like a mouse with a ball.

796
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,260
Yeah. Wait, no, the ball mouses are fire.

797
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,340
I know you like the ball mouse. I do. Unfortunately, the ball cracked

798
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,580
during travel. You're kidding me.

799
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,260
I used a cue ball for a bit, but it just wasn't the right fit.

800
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,420
Wait, you can swap the ball out?

801
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,420
Of course.

802
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
Oh my.

803
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,420
It comes right out.

804
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,420
Whoa!

805
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,420
Can you play with it?

806
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,420
Yeah.

807
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,420
No, you probably can't.

808
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,420
You can?!

809
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,420
Of course.

810
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,420
Oh my god.

811
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:33,980
Have you fully given up on this ball mouse thing?

812
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,420
It was $100 and I broke the ball.

813
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,740
So yes, I gave up on it.

814
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,740
I did not feel like getting a new ball.

815
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,340
Just get a replacement ball.

816
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,880
How much is just the ball?

817
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,820
Like 30 bucks.

818
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,940
Can you just get like a golf ball?

819
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,100
By the way, I've seen you lose $600 in four minutes.

820
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,620
That is for fun, and it's different.

821
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,660
Okay, yeah.

822
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,260
Money that I have to take from my bank account

823
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,660
and give to a company is real.

824
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,100
Money that becomes a one or a zero on the screen

825
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,420
doesn't count.

826
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,260
Right. Okay.

827
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,540
It hurts to lose 50, if you lost,

828
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,940
I will say it does hurt way more to lose $50 in

829
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,920
like cash you if yeah that you like

830
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,080
Either you misplace the cash or you like send it to the wrong person on Zelle or something that stings way worse

831
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,540
Than losing three hundred dollars gambling. Yeah, and it's not even close really

832
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:36,180
It's completely different. I don't even know the amount that you have to lose gambling

833
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,300
I'm telling you I'm talking about this shit. They were showing us last night. Oh

834
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,140
Oh, the slot league?

835
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,140
Okay, yeah, we should talk about the slot league.

836
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:57,020
Guys, for those of you who like having fun, there is a guy on kick, an Australian guy,

837
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:03,060
who does a fantasy slots tournament that you can join the league and bet on which slots

838
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,180
are gonna win what amount of games or whatever.

839
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:14,100
next season I am having a team we're called we're called the monsters and we

840
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:19,380

843
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:38,540
every once in a while. His name is Systems, Heather. You go for the slots that pay a little

844
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:45,540
bit almost half the time. So you go for a sweet bonanza. You go for a juicy fruit, or

845
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:51,340
not juicy fruit, you go for a fruit party. Yes, sweet bonanza did one. But that's not

846
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,180
so interesting to people who don't like gambling.

847
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,140
Yeah, you go for a Teo. You go for a-

848
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:01,420
You go for Teo. Teo would be an amazing choice. Teo would be an amazing choice. You go for

849
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:08,420
for

850
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,420
made any progress on building your slot machine, Rex?

851
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,420
No.

852
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:17,420
It's a side project that is getting... it will continue to be on the side.

853
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,420
I want to do it so bad, dude.

854
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,420
I think that... I think you have to do it.

855
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,420
Do you know anybody who's into, like, game dev stuff?

856
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,420
No.

857
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,420
That's really the problem.

858
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:35,420
I want to, like, contact No Limit City and, like, build out a system to turn their slots

859
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,420
into something else.

860
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,420
What does that mean?

861
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,420
Just like, without getting into technical,

862
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,420
like a way to turn their slots into a Ponzi scheme.

863
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,420
I think they would love that.

864
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,420
I like scamming stuff.

865
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,420
Yeah, I think that would be cool.

866
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,420
Money type of things.

867
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,420
Right.

868
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,420
Yeah.

869
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,420
Tech is so funny.

870
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,420
You know like CES is happening right now?

871
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,420
Yeah.

872
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,160
I was uh, I was watching like this big thing. I watch a WAN show man. Come don't ya know me

873
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,600
Did you see the rabbit the like a on a like saw that?

874
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:20,920
The pitch that the guy was doing is so funny and I'm gonna try really hard not to do an accent when I imitate

875
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:28,380
It was like, you know how everyone hates their phone because they're always tapping too much and there's too many apps on it

876
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,200
That was like the pitch for it

877
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,720
That problem cuz my phone screen is broken dude

878
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,760
But my phone screen broke and then I got a new screen on it and it works even worse than the broken one does

879
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,760
So now I hate tapping it's infuriating to me to tap. Well, that is a problem with your phone

880
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,240
That's not a problem with the design of the phone. I love looking at my phone. I don't know the difference

881
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:01,880
Okay, I just buy this shit. All right, I buy this shit. I put it on moist critical videos and then I just let it autoplay

882
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,800
Like

883
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:16,920
How can that possibly be your pitch, okay people hate their phone would you replace

884
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,280
With a fully AI little little gadget that you only hold one button and you talk to it and it does something

885
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,800
You know what I looked into for a while?

886
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:32,600
This phone that has a complete it has like the same screen as the Kindle the like paper screen

887
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,840
Yeah, because guys I'm I if you know one thing about me, I love candy

888
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,120
Okay, and I love flashing colors

889
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:47,280
and I was interested in getting a phone that did not have the candy and the flashing colors, but then I

890
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,320
Looked at it and it was $600. So I said no to this phone

891
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,440
Also, you would you would lose your favorite activity to want to do on the phone

892
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,800
Which is which is I I got to I got to notice this on first person

893
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,000
I saw this happening Caleb if he ever gets on a train that's longer than a couple minutes

894
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,200
He'll just sit on his phone. He put on the phone in his ear buds and I'll just watch slot videos for the entire time

895
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,080
That's true. I have a I have a I have a serious YouTube addiction

896
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:24,140
My youtube addiction has gotten out of control to the point where I think that I need to like maybe go to rehab for YouTube

897
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,200
That's no way

898
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,320
I do

899
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:35,240
Yeah, I already watched it man don't even worry about it it came out two hours ago and it's an hour long

900
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,540
How is that possible? I watched the premiere man

901
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:44,200
How I watch the premiere while I was at the dog park how many do you think you watch a day

902
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,760
in terms of hours or videos

903
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,680
Let's go videos and then let's actually let's do ours. Fuck it.

904
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:57,280
Ours? Yeah. Is there a way that I could see on my... there is right? I could pull up

905
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,320
the... You could probably just like look up like... Wait hold on. Yeah hold on one second.

906
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:09,160
I don't know where I look at my screen time bro. That's gonna be embarrassing.

907
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:15,040
I'll put... I'll do it. What do you what do you think it's gonna be on YouTube?

908
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,040
for a week or a day?

909
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,040
We'll go a day.

910
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Yeah, sure.

911
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,040
Probably three hours a day.

912
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,040
On the phone? No. I don't watch YouTube on the phone much.

913
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,040
Rex, you are very close.

914
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,040
What is it?

915
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,040
Today, two hours and 36 minutes.

916
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,040
Yeah.

917
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,040
Of YouTube.

918
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,040
But, I'm also listening to YouTube things.

919
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Right.

920
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,040
I would say that's 90, not 90, that's 70% of it.

921
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,920
percent of it is I'm listening to YouTube, because I'll put on something that is mostly

922
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,880
an audio type thing and just listen to it while I walk around.

923
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,260
But I'm trying to do that, I'm trying to get away from listening to other people talk and

924
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,720
get back into music, because music heals your soul in a crazy way.

925
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,160
I fuck everything with music, that's what I use YouTube most for, is music.

926
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,160
This is my top ten.

927
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,160
You have YouTube Premium?

928
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,160
Yeah, I do.

929
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,160
YouTube Premium is low. If you do anything that's not YouTube Premium plus the music, you're wasting your money.

930
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,160
You have YouTube Premium, you don't use the music?

931
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,160
Or you do use the music? You do, okay.

932
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:30,160
Because I know some people who have YouTube Premium, they don't use YouTube Music, they still use Spotify.

933
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,160
Because they think that it is embarrassing to use YouTube Music.

934
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,160
And guys, let me tell you, this is by far the best music streaming service there is.

935
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,160
It is the best.

936
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,160
the best.

937
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:46,760
Okay, well one thing is that you're kind of late behind on the times.

938
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,920
They split them up recently, like two months ago, maybe four months ago.

939
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,280
I got grandfathered into the package deal.

940
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,620
Yeah, but it's more expensive.

941
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,740
It's package board, it's more expensive.

942
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,720
I don't give a f- I don't even know.

943
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,720
I don't know.

944
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,360
I could not tell you how much YouTube cost.

945
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,360
They didn't grandfather you into anything.

946
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,320
It's just the same deal, but it's more expensive.

947
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,080
- You're talking like this is an ISP or some like--

948
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,620
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

949
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,360
- Oh, let's get a valid customer.

950
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,620
- You don't understand.

951
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,120
- You did not get grandfathered in.

952
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,960
The server's changed.

953
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,800
- You don't understand.

954
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,680
- You're getting charged more and you're like,

955
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,120
yeah, I'm special.

956
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,640
Yeah, I'm one of the special ones.

957
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,620
- They're letting me keep the same price.

958
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,240
Whatever that price was, again, I don't remember.

959
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,360
But they're letting me keep it.

960
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,360
I'm pretty sure it was upwards of $50.

961
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,800
- That is simply not true.

962
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,640
- It's true.

963
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,800
It's true.

964
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,560
Also, how many, like, now I think about people who don't have YouTube Premium, it's so sad

965
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,200
to me that they're watching these advertisements.

966
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,360
Because I'm at the point, I'm at the point where I have gotten, I never thought about

967
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,400
ads ever before I got YouTube Premium.

968
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,720
Now I'm at the point with ads where they infuriate me.

969
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,160
If I'm watching a Twitch stream and an ad comes up, I'm done with it.

970
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,680
I'm turning off Twitch.

971
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,680
I'm not watching.

972
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,680
you can get turbo.

973
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,680
You know what has the worst ads?

974
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,680
It's like Hulu.

975
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,680
Yes.

976
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,800
I remember it's actually infuriating.

977
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:23,480
One of the first stand up jokes I did when I was a kid was about opening up Hulu, because

978
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,960
I was real into tech.

979
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,720
Opening up Hulu and watching a thing and when it says, "Is this ad relevant to you?"

980
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,400
Clicking no on every ad in the hopes that one day they would get the idea that I just

981
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:44,240
don't like ads that much. That's why it was a kind of a stand-up comedy joke and

982
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:56,120
I was 16 years old. Right. That's how it should work yeah cuz some people are

983
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:02,040
sitting there like oh shit TurboTax oh what a lovely break between the thing I

984
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,880
I was enjoying.

985
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,280
- That's actually quite interesting.

986
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,400
Oh, H&R Block, oh, Pepsi, I like Pepsi.

987
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,880
These are called NPCs, guys, I learned this recently.

988
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,880
And NPCs like ads.

989
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,040
But me, I'm kind of a main character type,

990
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,760
so I don't care for these advertisements.

991
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,840
They're a waste of my time.

992
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,480
- Yeah, I think what got to me was not the ads

993
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,020
on like when I'm on YouTube on my computer.

994
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,720
On the phone and on the TV,

995
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,320
it is, they can get so annoying.

996
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,040
And also something I noticed recently with Twitch ads

997
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,480
is that they are also, there's no consistency

998
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,840
on like the volume of the ads.

999
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,680
So I'll be watching like a Twitch stream

1000
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,000
that's like, he doesn't really get that loud, the streamer.

1001
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,800
And then I'll just like run an ad

1002
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,680
and it's just like blasting loud music

1003
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,480
and just showing me gum.

1004
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,440
I'm like, yo, this is, this should be banned.

1005
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,640
My third platform, I'm banning loud ads.

1006
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,680
Only quiet ads from now on.

1007
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,120
- Something has changed with these advertisements, man.

1008
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,080
Because I have recently gone and watched

1009
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,760
one of these YouTube compilations.

1010
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,640
Big surprise, I'm watching a YouTube video.

1011
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,960
But the YouTube compilations that are,

1012
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,140
it's like all the ads from your childhood.

1013
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,400
And something about these, I was like,

1014
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,800
I remember every single one of these.

1015
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:25,960
I remember not hating them when they were on.

1016
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,480
And they are so different now.

1017
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,200
I hate these ads.

1018
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,240
I would never remember these.

1019
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,800
No kid in 20 years is gonna be like,

1020
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,160
oh shit, that progressive commercial really,

1021
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,360
I'd like to see that again.

1022
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,780
That is nostalgic to me.

1023
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,960
- You know what I think-- - What changed?

1024
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,840
- I'm gonna think back on,

1025
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,760
what's his name for the insurance company?

1026
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,560
The one, the guy on the red shirt?

1027
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,360
- Nobody-- - That's gonna--

1028
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,920
- Jake from State Farm, you're not gonna notice that.

1029
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,560
- Damn, remember Jake?

1030
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,200
The head no way died in that accident

1031
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:06,480
He will not you will never die. No, he's gonna explode. They will replace it. They replaced him once they're gonna replace him again

1032
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,320
I don't think so. Yeah, there's a white replacement. Jake is a

1033
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,920
forever type of

1034
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,180
Immortal type of thing. Yeah, but then I get nolly llama favorite Jake's

1035
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:25,280
Well, that's true. That's like like a Steve from Blue's Clues thing. People will grow up with different Jake's something about that

1036
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,560
That is beautiful to me.

1037
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,560
What?

1038
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,560
Blue's Clues?

1039
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,600
Well, Blue's Clues is of course beautiful to me, but also growing up with a different Jake

1040
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,880
from State Farm.

1041
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:41,360
I grew up with the original one, and then I saw these kids growing up with the new Jake,

1042
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,080
and I said, "You know what, man?

1043
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,320
Knock yourself out, kids.

1044
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,160
That's an amazing, amazing privilege to live in the same time as a Jake."

1045
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Yeah.

1046
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,160
That is true.

1047
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,800
We live in a beautiful time.

1048
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,280
There's no doubt about it. We live in one of the most beautiful eras ever.

1049
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,000
It's 90 degrees in January. This is a perfect time to be alive.

1050
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah.

1051
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I really don't like June.

1052
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,520
And the future will probably only be better.

1053
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:13,800
What do you think is the year... what year is it that like, you have the perfect balance

1054
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:22,640
of like, global warming is not so much destroying the earth so badly, but then also you get maybe

1055
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:28,040
a cool video game. Because obviously the best one, like the coolest video games are going

1056
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:33,920
to come out in 20 years, but things are going to be underwater. So there's some kind of,

1057
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,200
there's some equilibrium to be found there. Some GameCube game maybe? I'm not a global

1058
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:46,200
warming expert guy, but like 50 years from now, things will not be underwater in 20 years.

1059
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:53,200
in

1060
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Yeah, that is true.

1061
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,200
I think that's more it's sinking.

1062
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:05,200
You know what I want to see from the future is getting to like the years 50, 60, 70 and having Madden 73.

1063
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,200
Madden 73, nobody knows what, people think Madden means football.

1064
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
Right.

1065
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Yeah.

1066
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,200
That's what I want to see.

1067
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,200
We're going to go to the Madden game.

1068
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,200
That will be an amazing thing.

1069
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,200
They're doing a live Madden game down at the theater.

1070
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:32,080
the

1071
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:47,100
of

1072
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,980
on like ESPN2, like ESPN3.

1073
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,580
- See, that's, but people never,

1074
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,380
I guess nobody thought of the fact that there,

1075
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,780
it's like the NFL,

1076
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,820
if there was 50 different kinds of football

1077
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,220
that everybody liked.

1078
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,060
- Right.

1079
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,180
And you couldn't, it was completely inscrutable

1080
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,260
if you liked one kind of football.

1081
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,260
- Yeah, and it's only for people who are under 30.

1082
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,100
- Yeah.

1083
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,620
- Like, of course you're not gonna make any money on it.

1084
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,460
- Yeah.

1085
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,260
- Except for us. - Esports is so funny.

1086
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,620
- We will make some money with Esports very soon.

1087
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,020
- Yeah.

1088
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,760
okay i have to go i have to leave right now

1089
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,500

1094
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,280
and now that i had the whole thing i would not recommend drinking this

1095
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,740
this really slowed me down and now i have to go do something

1096
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,620

This has been beers we drank and I'm leaving the call to put an end on this.

1109
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,420
Julio you better not talk when I leave.

1110
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,420
Bye.

1111
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,420
He sucks dude.

1112
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,420
He's so bald.

1113
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,420
He is so bald.

1114
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,220
I was just thinking about how bald he is lately.

1115
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:33,900
I think this combo, I don't know why we followed his lead.

1116
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,780
I think it killed me.

1117
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,980
I spent stretches.

1118
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:43,300
I spent stretches of the show just thinking too much about what I was doing.

1119
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,340
And it really took me out of the experience.

1120
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:50,020
I drank this today as well. I'm just gonna show this.

1121
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:50,980
A Gyat?

1122
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,100
-Gyatweed? -It's called Gymweed.

1123
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:54,980
Okay.

1124
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,860
And it's an energy drink that has ashwagandha in it.

1125
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,220
And it was fire.

1126
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,980
Didn't they start banning that shit because it gave people cancer in the balls?

1127
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,260
Wait.

1128
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,900
Are you sure?

1129
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,900
I don't know, I have no idea.

1130
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,900
I don't think that's true.

1131
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,900
I think they did something to it.

1132
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,900
I'm pretty sure that's false.

1133
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,900
I'm pretty sure that's real.

1134
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,900
As the host of the show, we're saying goodbye.

1135
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,900
Thank you for watching Bish We Drink.

1136
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,900
Caleb is not the host, and I'm the host.

1137
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,900
Goodbye.

1138
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,900
I'll say bye now.
