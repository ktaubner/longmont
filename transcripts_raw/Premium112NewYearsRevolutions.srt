00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,000

18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,040
- You have a costume on.

00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,720

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,480

29

00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,120

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,940
Oh man.

43
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,440
He left the room.

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,940
He's so mad.

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,940
Wow.

46
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,940
When he comes back I have to ask him something.

47
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm not fu-- I'm not fucking doing this!

48
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,940

Why do you even own this?

It's Halloween, it's Christmas!

54
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
I have to ask you one thing.

55
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,440

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Yes! That's why I can't do it!

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Why is it so intricate?

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
That's a velvet blazer.

59
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,440
It looks so good!

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,560
Derangements hat that ended up in my backpack at the live show back in July.

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Ended up.

132
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Look at what it says on the back.

133
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040

134
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040

It says F.A.G. on it.

138
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Yag?

139
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Oh, okay.

Can someone, could you take a screenshot of this?

141
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,800
Don't worry, I got it already.

142
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,680

Those MAGA powers?

146
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
That doesn't even make sense.

147
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
You put on my MAGA hat.

148
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,960

They're so big.

- Is that really big?

161
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
- Is that good or bad that they're big?

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,960
- 60 millimeters don't seem very big to me.

163
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,660
- I don't know if it's good or bad that they're big.

164
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,420
I've just always wanted to try them.

182
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,860
listen my brother throw up last night that's swag that was a yes I was I

183
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:44,580
watched Borat and today I flew home hey here's a question what this so these

184
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,760
days you what you go to the airport you see that they have a cell phone parking

185
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,940
lot here we go right so I don't understand no I already don't understand

186
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,600
- It's just, I got this.

187
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
So they have some, they have a--

188
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,260
- I don't know what a cell phone parking lot is.

189
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
- Well that's what I'm saying.

190
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,600
They got these signs that say cell phone parking lot, right?

191
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,380
And it's like, okay, what the hell is that, right?

192
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,240
You go, but then you go over there,

193
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,280
like today I went over there.

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,080
Nobody's on their cell phone.

195
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,880
You know what people are doing is they're in cars, right?

196
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,720
- Whoa.

197
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,740
- So here's my, well, here's my question.

198
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,740
They should call it a car parking lot.

199
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,000
- Uh-huh.

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
- But I see why that is confusing, right?

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,900
- I don't, I'm already really confused.

202
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,320
I have literally no idea what you're talking about.

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
- Let me finish!

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,660
I see why that's confusing.

205
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,240
So they probably just called it a cell phone parking lot

206
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
because it's a little less--

207
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,440
- What is a cell phone parking lot?

208
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,400
What are you talking about? - I don't know.

209
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
That's what I'm talking, that's what I'm trying to ask you.

210
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I've never seen a sign that says, "It's a cell phone parking lot and you see people in cars."

211
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
What is happening right now?

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
You said there's a sign that says "cell phone parking lot and you see people in cars."

213
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Cell phone lot!

214
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
And the people aren't, there's no one on their cell phone, everybody's in their car.

215
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Why is, what?

216
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
In the parking lot.

217
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
What are you talking about?

218
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
There's lots at airports with little photos of cell phones.

219
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah, they have restaurants and planes and stuff, there's a lot of stuff at the airport.

220
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

221
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
No, I'm not saying there's lots of stuff.

222
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm not saying there's lots of stuff.

223
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,560
I'm not saying there's lots of stuff. I'm saying that there are

224
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:33,360
Lots that are at the the yeah, there's lots of cell phones a lot of people there's the set there's lots of cell phone

225
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:41,560
At the airport. What are you saying? No what you're talking about the airport every airport now is okay

226
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
I have a lot of cell phones. Yeah

227
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Cell phones has lots no has cell phone parking lots. And what does that even mean?

228
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
What is a cell phone parking lot?

229
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,960
That's my question because you go to it and everybody's in a car.

230
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Okay, so I just found I've googled it. A cell phone lot is a parking lot.

231
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,960
That's what it says.

232
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Oh, you know what it is? You got to be kidding me.

233
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,960
It says a cell phone lot is a parking lot typically located at airports where people can wait before picking up passengers.

234
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Why would they call it a cell phone lot?

235
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,960
I don't know. You did a really bad job of explaining that. I did not...

236
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I didn't know what it was! I just see the signs!

237
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
You said it was in an airport, first of all.

238
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
It's in...

239
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
It's clearly outside an airport.

240
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
An airport? Okay, so...

241
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,960
You think a parking lot is inside the airport?

242
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Listen to me.

243
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Yeah?

244
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Do you think that the fucking runways are in the airport? Yes.

245
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Do you think the parking lot of McDonald's is in the McDonald's?

246
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,520
that is in mcdonalds at mcdonalds no not at not at it's at I said at you said I

247
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,200
say that they have a lot in the airport they should have yes actually yes they

248
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,400
do you know why well because it's a parking garage it's a parking garage it's

249
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,800
an airport or different buildings airports are multiple buildings with

250
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,360
Ever heard of a concourse, idiot?

251
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
No.

252
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
What's that?

253
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Fuck, I don't know.

254
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,920
I don't know what that is.

255
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,200
Now you're getting in a preacher zone.

256
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,800
He's taking off one article of clothing every five minutes.

257
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
I can't wait to see where this goes.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,880
Now you're not so on, not so on Powers.

259
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm Sebastian Maniscalco now.

260
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,640
Austin Powers, I need-

261
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
How can you-

262
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,700
I need in the friends who can ease did you got you know nowadays kids are there on

263
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,600
their cell phones in these parking lots but and they seem to be harking not to

264
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:55,560
the music of the angels from on high yeah I the we used to love watching awesome

265
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,440
Austin Powers but now these these kids are more worried about their awesome

266
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,940
passwords. He's taking off more clothes. You're not even committing. There's nothing Austin

267
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,280
about you. You literally didn't even do the Boston Powers thing. You're so lazy. This

268
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,440
is why Caleb is the one who wears costumes. Yeah, you know what? This is a big responsibility.

269
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,800
Because when I wear the costumes, I embody... He makes us argue about the costume for an

270
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,440
hour straight when he wears a costume. That's a very unique skill, I'd like to say. We got

271
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,640
- Barely one minute.

272
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,840
(laughing)

273
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,240
- We got one minute of audio off of,

274
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,440
like a very expensive, obviously.

275
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,280
- Best costume that's been on the show so far.

276
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,640
- The best costume, by far.

277
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
Beats the chef, beats the Jacques.

278
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,560
- Thank you, Eric.

279
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,640
- That was Eric?

280
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,840
- Eric got me that, yeah.

281
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,920
- Yeah, I bought a bigger. - Hey, check this out.

282
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,760
Check this out.

283
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Did I ever show you this?

284
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I bought, remember those t-shirts I bought?

285
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,600
- Yeah.

286
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,440
- Oh yeah, we talked about it on the episode.

287
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,320
- You have a t-shirt with numbers on it.

288
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,400
- Yeah, I bought a bootleg Hanes Tee.

289
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,440
How are you talking about this more than the fucking Austin Powers outfit you were just

290
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
in?

291
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm still wearing the velvet pants.

292
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
The numbers are not it.

293
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm so comfortable.

294
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
And he's like, "Yeah, check it out.

295
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Look at these numbers.

296
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Look, eight, three."

297
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,600
What do the numbers mean?

298
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,680
This could be a phone number or something.

299
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,960
Yeah, you should head over to the airport cell phone lot and try to use your cell phone

300
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,440
to call the phone number there.

301
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,780
Well, that's the only thing.

302
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,720
Is there really good service in the cell phone lot?

303
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
I think that's it.

304
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,120
I think maybe you get better service there because...

305
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,000
I think that is what it is.

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I guess that makes sense.

307
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, because there's so many planes.

308
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,680
I thought that they just wanted a different lot and they didn't know what to call it.

309
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,960
Yeah, well it's like when they name a concert venue like the Xfinity Center.

310
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Yeah, this one is cell phones took care of the bill for this.

311
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm pretty owned for my flight, man.

312
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,160
I'm yeah, luckily I flew not knowing if I had or did not have COVID and then found out I don't as soon as I land

313
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Nice, so you're not a criminal. I was gonna be really bad or really but it turns out I'm really really good

314
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,340
Yeah, yeah, it was up in the air there for a minute. I was almost a well get it later like I did

315
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,280
What doesn't it know?

316
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
- Get it later, what does that mean?

317
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,760
- That means it could be in your body.

318
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,420
It could be in your body right now and then it could like--

319
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,240
- You didn't like fly, like what do you mean?

320
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,800
You can get it later.

321
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,280
- You can get COVID later.

322
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,600
- You can get COVID later.

323
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,360
I mean, I guess you can, yeah, you can.

324
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,200
You can get it later. - Do you wanna go

325
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,400
get it later?

326
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,200
- No, I don't wanna go get COVID.

327
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,040
- Yeah.

328
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,800
- Do you wanna go grab some later?

329
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Mm-hmm

330
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,100
Yeah, I seriously do. Yeah, I miss you guys. I think I think everybody should have like

331
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,360
Should get like 10 free flights without having to get tested first. Yeah, I agree

332
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,480
Also, I don't really care if I if anybody dies ever

333
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,340
Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, that's it like the the thing like everyone's like

334
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,580
Oh like don't go home for Christmas or like don't do this. You'll kill grandma

335
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Do you I don't care like I'm waiting on like probably no

336
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Inheritance from I don't know my grandma

337
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,280
Yeah, you know like I don't like my grandma's been dead forever

338
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,560
My grandma is basically a like a food machine to me. Yeah, like I have no I mean

339
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,360
I love my grandma as much as I love a like a vending machine

340
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,880
Honestly, like I walk up to her and I say

341
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,540
E7 which is her lasagna. Yeah, and then I and then I get it it's free. There's the best vending machine ever

342
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,500
And she has a big TV. Mm-hmm

343
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,040
It's honestly more likely that if you go home for Christmas your grandmother's probably gonna kill you because I mean she's what yeah

344
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,640
She's pretty old. She's probably got some insane diseases

345
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,780
festering somewhere in her body my my grandmother is a

346
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,860
Spanish colonizer actually so she has a lot of really weird diseases.

347
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,300
Yeah, that's like she's like an incubator to create the next strain.

348
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,620
You know what I just remembered is that she actually is Spanish.

349
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:27,720
Really? Yeah, isn't that weird? Are you white Spanish? I'm white Spanish. Yeah, her mom was

350
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,500
Spanish.

351
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,720
Whoa. Dude, I'm Espanol. Yeah, you're like Judy Cortez.

352
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,880
I'm straight up Cortez family line. That's why I'm so good at rolling my arms. Are there any spies in your family?

353
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm also there's a heavy spy current. Yeah. Yeah, I fan. Yeah, there's a it skips a generation though. My dad was a spy. I

354
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,240
Mean that the spy kids were Mexican though. Yeah

355
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,440
That's a I mean, you're the one who brought them up. So yeah, I didn't know that like why are you?

356
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,200
You're doing you're doing race watching you well you were

357
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,000

Just talking about Mexican people now like you are tried to I said Spanish and you were like, how can I get to Mexican?

359
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,080
Mexican my Spanish accent

360
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,240
Yeah, I I

361
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,120
I think we should talk about Spy Kids.

362
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,520
Spy Kids is awesome.

363
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,320
I re-watched Spy Kids 3 recently.

364
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,560
I watched Spy Kids with my nephews.

365
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,360
I talked about this last episode.

366
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Yeah you did.

367
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Fuck.

368
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Dude, you're in a loop.

369
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
You're in a fucking loop.

370
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
You're in my brain.

371
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,560
How about we talk about our beautiful New Year's Eves?

372
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Yeah.

373
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
You did Borat.

374
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Yeah, I did Borat.

375
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
That's the only one I did.

376
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
I set up a couch.

377
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
It's something actual.

378
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
He went out and partied.

379
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Uh huh.

380
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
And that's why it looks like this.

381
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,400
up and he's a degenerate piece of shit oh yeah me I was having a nice I was having

382
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:13,480

385
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:49,920
Ham on Swiss. Ham on cheese and toast. Ham on the Kruger. Ham on the Aldi. Ham on Iberico.

386
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,360
Oh, that's what I'm thinking of.

387
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Jamona Barrico.

388
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,360
I ate that for New Year's Eve with my whole Spanish family.

389
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,160
Girlfriend wanted to watch the New Year's Rockin' Eve thing, the music thing, and she

390
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
made the fatal mistake, which I tried to warn her about.

391
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,640
She turned it on at like 6 p.m.

392
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Oh.

393
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Can you believe that?

394
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,000
So it just sat there all day?

395
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

396
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Just doing nothing?

397
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,280
That's when they're not even doing anything yet.

398
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,000
just like we turned it on when she was like oh let's watch the New Year's Eve

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,420
coverage she turned on it was like it was just like Kyle Rittenhouse Kyle

400
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:38,960
Rittenhouse was it that is sick dude it was our boy it was Pete D there we did

401
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,360
we literally we turned it off before then because it was so man that's a

402
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
I started way too early.

403
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Wait, who's Pete D?

404
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,360
When Pete D was on, dude, I was watching B Sagdieff.

405
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,600
Shit, they need to get Borat into the next New Year's Eve.

406
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,920
He'd probably say something foul shit.

407
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,040
He'd probably compare the ball to some other kind of ball in a disgusting manner.

408
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,280
Do you guys hear about Betty White?

409
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
No.

410
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,000
I just found this out.

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

412
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,480
you were dressed as her? Apparently yeah, apparently they found her in her apartment. She looked like a

413
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,520
crumpled up napkin. Yeah. Yeah. She fell down the stairs. Yeah, she apparently fell down the stairs

414
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,520
and then fell through the floor at the bottom of the stairs into the basement and fell into a bucket

415
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,400
of bleach. Apparently she fell down the stairs from the emperor's new groove and she's still

416
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,080
falling. They know she's dead but she's still on her way down the stairs. Apparently she was

417
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,980
playing basketball and some kid like crossed over and totally twisted her ankle and her

418
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,780
foot fell off and she died from blood loss.

419
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,600
I mean we gotta get this fentanyl out of these drugs.

420
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I know.

421
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Absolutely.

422
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
It's killed so many.

423
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
So many.

424
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Especially Betty White.

425
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,840
Apparently like Betty White, like right before she died she was skydiving and all her limbs

426
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,560
flew off like a Lego man.

427
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:14,200
Yeah, yeah, she fell in that she got sucked into an HVAC system. Yeah, yeah,

428
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,040
for her hundredth birthday, she wanted to get really, really close to a jet

429
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,600
turbine. Yeah, it's like she was like, oh, it's only I plan my hundredth big

430
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,840
a hundredth birthday bash. I've only I only have a few days till I turn a

431
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,360
hundred. I gotta make sure I don't die. So I'm gonna lock myself in this room

432
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,800
and then she got sucked into the central air. She said I'm gonna lock myself in

433
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,620
this sealed room with no windows and no no air conditioning and just take some

434
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,420
deep breaths to relax. Betty White was uh she was sitting on her couch listening

435
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,000
to a happy birthday but the the speakers were too big and too loud that it shot

436
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,960
all of her skin off when happy birthday started to play. It was like at the beginning of Back to the Future.

437
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,040
bones flew. Like the Mortal Kombat Fatality. Like multiple rib cages and skulls.

438
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,080
She basically fell into all the clogs and big bin and she got turned into nothing.

439
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah it was really fucked up and sad. Yeah. She actually fell into an assembly

440
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,040
line and got turned into a toy. Somebody found her in their chili at

441
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:31,760
Wendy's and he complained. Apparently she actually died like months ago. She died

442
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,840
in a spirit Halloween in October and they didn't find her body. They just

443
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,900
thought her body was part of the decorations for like months. She would.

444
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,040
The thing is, I'll say this about Betty White, she kept it tight for a hundo. Oh

445
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,440
definitely. Have you ever met a hundred-year-old? I've met one

446
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,160
hundred year old before I don't like I was like 96 or something great aunt Ruth

447
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,400
and I don't like I don't like old people at all got really confused and started

448
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,200
taking her top off right in front of me I saw her boobs okay

449
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:08,280
score and then I she like got really confused she started getting naked and I

450
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,240
looked at her I was like seven or eight I said you look like a dinosaur yeah like

451
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,440
a real bad back. Oh my god. Oh yeah, the curved back. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. I met somebody recently

452
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:29,100
who is like maybe 37 or something. A woman who has a hunchback. But like not, but I've

453
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,760
known her for a while and she didn't always have a hunchback and she developed one. I

454
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,320
was like that's tough. That year where you're finally like. Yeah. I, oh, I, my, my. You become

455
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm an old person.

456
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,080
My posture is irreversible now.

457
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,120
Millennials be on the computer so long they get a hunchback.

458
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,240
Me I sit at the table I eat my lunch comma snack.

459
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Yep.

460
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Or lunch pack.

461
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
I mean that works too.

462
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
Yeah well I said lunch comma snack.

463
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
You could say snack pack too.

464
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
The comma's silent so it's lunch snack.

465
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Well no, lunch.

466
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
It has to rhyme.

467
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
What?

468
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Fuck.

469
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
What?

470
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Woo wee!

471
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Woo wee?

472
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Woo wee!

473
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Is that your...

474
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Woo-wee!

475
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Is that you bringing that in?

476
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,520
That's how I get my brain back. I'm really shutting down.

477
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,180
Alright, let's wake you up.

478
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,840
Okay. New Year's resolutions.

479
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,460
What are we doing different in 2021?

480
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,460
How are we coming in 2021?

481
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,320
As a squad.

482
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
I'm coming in a sock.

483
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna...

484
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,900
I'm coming in a different sock than last year.

485
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:44,100
The big two. I'm changing it out. Okay. One, first million. Two, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

486
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,780
Wow. That's my big two for this year. That's a good one. Pretty good, right? Yeah.

487
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:59,860
I'm going to quit making excuses for women and I'm going to try to hold my poop in the whole year.

488
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Those are my two. If we just get two.

489
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm gonna try to hold in my poop until I become a big poop balloon.

490
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,620
And i'm not gonna make any excuses for these women no more.

491
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,220
That's facts.

492
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,740
Oh, you already got you three strikes bitch. Can I add a number three to mine?

493
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,060
Uh, if I can add a third, yeah. Yeah, my number three second million.

494
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,660
Whoa.

495
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,180
Okay, my number three is at the end of the year after I held my poop in the whole time

496
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,780
I lay a giant poop egg. What does it hatch into? And then more just shit all the way through.

497
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:45,860
My new year's resolutions is I'm gonna, I guess this year 2022, this is the year I find a wife

498
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,460
and immediately have a kid. Nice. I could see it happening. Yeah, that could work for you.

499
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,700
I don't think you have it in. Number four, become more cybernetic throughout the year.

500
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,200
Yeah.

501
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,700
Oh, fuck. I want to lose a woman.

502
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,200
Number three, I send the kid to Iraq.

503
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
[Laughs]

504
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,700
Right when he's not even a year old?

505
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,200
And he has to find his way back to me.

506
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
You also, wait, you only have four women.

507
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,700
If any women want to help me out with this, I'm going to have one giant kid.

508
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,200
You have to be the biggest woman in the world.

509
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,680

time to get this woman, this huge woman pregnant and find her.

Dude, I gotta get truey so bad.

558
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,800
He wore a glow gang football jersey.

559
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Dude.

560
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,160
He's 24 years old.

561
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,040
What are you talking, why are you saying that like that's a bad thing?

562
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,400
No, it just looked, it was awesome.

563
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I loved it.

564
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,040
And he just sat there eating sushi.

565
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,640
Dude, that's-- Noah's pimp as fuck.

566
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,960
Dude, it was next level, bro.

567
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,200
I've never seen anything like it.

568
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,360
He's come out of his cocoon in a major way.

569
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,360
That's so cool.

570
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
Yeah.

571
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,280
No, I forget what resolution number I'm on.

572
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,420
I think seven.

573
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,420
No more rolled foods.

574
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
No more rolled foods?

575
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
No sushi, no burritos, no wraps.

576
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,420
Whoa.

577
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,960
What about a fruit roll-up?

578
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
If you unroll it?

579
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
No rolled foods.

580
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,640
If you unroll it and I don't see it before it's unrolled, I could pretend it's a fruit

581
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
line and not a fruit roll up.

582
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,760
Well, what if I like, you know, like you deconstruct the sushi?

583
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,040
As long as I don't see it while it's rolled, I'll eat it.

584
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
What about...

585
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,280
What do you know it's sushi?

586
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,040
What about like a nigiri, like a hand...

587
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Just a hand thing.

588
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
If it's rolled?

589
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
It's not rolled.

590
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
I wouldn't call that rolled.

591
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,800
Okay, here's the thing about rolled food, it's a circle.

592
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
And that...

593
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,440
Are you off of all circles?

594
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
No.

595
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Or all...

596
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Just rolled foods.

597
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,080
just rolled foods yeah okay so about a crescent rolled food symbolizes that's

598
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,240
more of all that means you're never going to digest it what about it just

599
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,840
stays in your body forever it's got all those layers in a circle that's a

600
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,240
crescent old food so I could eat half of it yeah okay that makes sense yeah top

601
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,440
or the bottom I could I could just eat I just can't eat at all hmm okay I think

602
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
I think this might be the worst resolution.

603
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:57,880
I was at the word is going to get on that tip soon. You'll see you say no

604
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
rolled foods.

605
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,940
No,

606
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,440
I think so.

607
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,940
No,

608
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,340
no,

609
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
no foods.

610
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,240
You can't have any rolled food.

611
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,240
We're only eating triangles from now on.

612
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,740
You can't have any world food,

613
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,740
snap any food that's been rolled. If you see if you if you see it after it's

614
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,340
unrolled,

615
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,140
it's okay.

616
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,860
You just can't see it while it's rolled, or your body will know that it's rolled.

617
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,600
He has like no, like, he's not tying it to any sort of his like weird philosophical like

618
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,360
man-woman thing, he's just like...

619
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,420
And also, you just, you cannot eat anything rolled.

620
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,060
It's just, it's just, you just can't.

621
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,740
I won't even say it's not right, actually, I'll just say you can't do it.

622
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
You shouldn't be eating it.

623
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,540
You just shouldn't be, it's not for you.

624
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,100
It's not for me.

625
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,340
It's not allowed, it's not for anybody.

626
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,340
You can't do that. You can't have any rolled food.

627
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
I'm gonna read.

628
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Rolling is for a cigarette.

629
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Or a sleeping bag.

630
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Or my sleeping bag.

631
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Also you sleep in a sleeping bag.

632
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,340
You have to sleep in a sleeping bag.

633
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:09,340
The biggest problem here is that lobster rolls are...

634
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,340
What's he trying to say about lobsters?

635
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Connect it, Pat!

636
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
What's he saying about lobsters?

637
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
You had a good one!

638
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,340
Fuck dude

639
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:23,180
What does he suck so close? I know I know dude. I had to sabotage the I sabotage myself

640
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:29,020
He says they're red right yeah, what's he say about lobsters his whole thing. Maybe we should start reading

641
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,140
I don't understand to fight each other or something have to fight Rob

642
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,140
Monster there's some kind of hierarchy where they all have

643
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,300
Yeah, think about a dinner roll is it's not a rolled food. You can eat it

644
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,260
That is true a dinner rolls not a rolled food. It just has the word roll. Yeah. Yeah

645
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:54,480
Sweet rolls, what did the butter sweet? What did the butter get at school? What Jordan?

646
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,940
On a roll, I just got it

647
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,860
No, I have to joke from a joke book. I had in like second grade

648
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,860
Yeah

649
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:26,100
Hey Pat, hey Pat. What did the second place a butter who didn't get on our roll say? He

650
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:34,500
said, I've never been so unsalted in my life. That's a pretty good one, right? That's also

651
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:42,140
a joke book one you guys have a parking lot at the airport called a cell phone

652
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:52,460
lot and there's no cell phones. I admit it. I think that I don't I think that might have

653
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,360
been a one of the minor Muppets that has no name you know when they do like a

654
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,740
finger puppet basically yeah who yeah usually it's a bird it's a bird sitting

655
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:11,300
has no name. The minor muppet who has no name. The other day I remember. That's a two sentence

656
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:19,460
horror story. I saw a minor muppet he had no name. Yeah. Hey what's ET short for? What?

657
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,380
Because he's got little legs. I said. That one's pretty good actually. I said what not why so your

658
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,540
answer didn't make any sense. No it's pretty funny. No. It's like. Sorry it didn't flow grammatically.

659
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,380
You know what I did get for Christmas and I'm pretty excited about this damn keyboard.

660
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,460
I'm gonna be- What's brown and sticky?

661
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,740
Your ass and your butthole and probably your penis and your balls and your taint too

662
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,460
because all the shit that you've been squirting on it because you wear a diaper

663
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,540
and you pretty much live in a diaper and you never changed it.

664
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,020
A stick.

665
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,140
You wear a diaper with a chastity belt on top so that nobody can unlock your-

666
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,500
Cameron, wait, Cameron got it.

667
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,820
Brown and sticky, a stick?

668
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,700
Okay.

669
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,740
What did the ranch say to the refrigerator?

670
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,540
What did the ranch say to the ridgerator?

671
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,300
What did the ranch say to the ridgerator?

672
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,980
I don't know what a ridgerator is.

673
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
Close the door, can't you see I'm dressing?

674
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,780
Do you guys want to know something that shattered my reality yesterday?

675
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
What?

676
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
What I just remembered?

677
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,940
I did one of those Instagram "what animal are you" filters and it said I was an ant.

678
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
Holy shit.

679
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
It's like the most- What?

680
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,140
The worst experience I've ever had in my life.

681
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Are you fucking serious, man?

682
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
You like shattered me spiritually.

683
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
You ant.

684
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,980
It was the worst- You ant ass bitch.

685
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,780
It was God getting one last jab in at me in 2021.

686
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
You're an ant?

687
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
Why is it even an option?

688
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
I don't think...

689
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
I don't think...

690
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
You're nothing.

691
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
It's literally Imbia.

692
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,780
The data doesn't add up.

693
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,780
The other ones are like

694
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
you're a monkey, you're a cat,

695
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
you're a lizard.

696
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,780
I don't think that

697
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
test has enough like...

698
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,780
I don't trust it.

699
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
I don't think it's backed by science.

700
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,780
It's not peer reviewed.

701
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
Yeah.

702
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
It's not peer-reviewed.

703
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,440
No, it's powered by magic.

704
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
I'm not letting them say that about my friend.

705
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,260
That means it's the most true of all.

706
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,900
Tell me who the app developer is.

707
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,740
Tell me who that created that app.

708
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,740
God really made...

709
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,880
I don't think God is involved.

710
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,740
My sixth New Year's resolution, or my fifth, I don't remember which one it is now, more

711
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
threats.

712
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Yeah.

713
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,460
More threats of physical violence and harm.

714
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,460
That's a good one.

715
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
What was that?

716
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,420
I'm gonna take control of my life

717
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,420
and I'm gonna force this app to no longer call me an aunt.

718
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,380
I'm gonna take control of my wife.

719
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,220
I'm gonna control her.

720
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,980
I'm so hungover I thought that Caleb

721
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,660
just played a sound at me,

722
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,000
but I just realized I had EA Origin open.

723
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,740
Why did you have EA Origin open?

724
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,980
No, it's not open, like you know,

725
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,300
like the little dashboard at the bottom thing?

726
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,140
Backpedaling.

727
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,780
Why would you think that I played a sound at you?

728
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,860
What does that even?

729
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,040
I thought you played a "dung-a-dung" at me.

730
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,420
You think that's the sound I would pick?

731
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,420
No, I'd pick a fart, man.

732
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,420
It's a comedy show.

733
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
True.

734
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
Yeah.

735
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,420
Obviously.

736
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Duh!

737
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,420
I would pick the funny fart.

738
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,100
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about my keyboard.

739
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm going to become a synth-pop musician.

740
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,300
You play us a song right now.

741
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
It's all the way in the other room.

742
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Go get it.

743
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,300
You wouldn't even hear it.

744
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Go get it and play it.

745
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
I'd have to plug it in.

746
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
It'd probably take an hour, honestly.

747
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
Really?

748
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,900
bad I am at plugging shit in these days.

749
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,300
You don't have batteries in it?

750
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,740
No, it's like a plug into the wall type keyboard.

751
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,580
I still have Christmas presents for you guys.

752
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,420
Oh, I have my Christmas presents for you guys too.

753
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
We should do that sometime.

754
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
Do you want me to show you yours?

755
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
No.

756
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,420
Right now?

757
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
No, no, no, no.

758
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,420
Wait, Cameron, I got...

759
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,420
I kinda wanna see mine.

760
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,060
I got Cameron something crazy.

761
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,420
You guys, did you get me something crazy?

762
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,620
I don't wanna see you on a video and not be able to reach into the screen and play with

763
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
it.

764
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
Yeah, you're right.

765
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,340

We're coming up on 20 at 40 minutes.

773
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,780
We try really hard for the next 20.

774
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,580
- Okay, we have like 45 seconds.

775
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,340
- We close it out really strong, prepare.

776
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,800
Okay, I'm gonna do some mental techniques right now.

777
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,860
- What kind of mental stuff are you gonna do?

778
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,080
- I'm just, I'm doing warmups.

779
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,080
(mimics beatboxing)

780
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm a little weirdo.

781
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,640
I'm a little weirdo from France.

782
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,900
(mimicking gun noises)

783
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,060
- 15 second warning boys, 15 seconds 'til showtime.

784
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,020
(mimicking gun noises)

785
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,020
- Ow, ow, that really hurts.

786
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,480
Ow, that one's gonna hurt me.

787
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,180
(mimicking gun noises)

788
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,580
You just hurt me.

789
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,540
- Okay, four, three, two, one.

790
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,940
All right, and go.

791
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,020
Happy New Year.

792
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,620
Happy New Year everybody. - All right, horrible start.

793
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,460
- No, that's a bad start.

794
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,460
Let's talk about cars.

795
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
Oh, let's talk about cars.

796
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Happy New Year!

797
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,460
No. Wait, no. Fuck. Hold on.

798
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,460
What's the craziest car ever?

799
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Mitsubishi Eclipse.

800
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,460
Probably a monster truck, right?

801
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
Do you guys want to see a car I got?

802
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,460
Can we go to a monster truck rally, man?

803
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,460
Oh, dude, we have to.

804
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,460
Are they expensive?

805
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,460
Yes.

806
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,460
My mom got me this for Christmas.

807
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,180
That is fucking sick dude.

808
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Woah.

809
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
It's a Hot Wheels rat car.

810
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,100
Can you imagine how fast that shit would go?

811
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
It's a green rat dude.

812
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Do you want to see?

813
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
Looks like a gator.

814
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Yeah.

815
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,100
Watch this.

816
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Woah.

817
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:03,100
That reached fucking 0-60 real fast.

818
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
Yeah that was insane.

819
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,420
That was pretty crazy right?

820
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,180
That was really cool.

821
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,860
Okay what are the things that we're going to buy in this new year?

822
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
Because I want some stuff.

823
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,820
Oh dude I will definitely be buying things.

824
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,060
I'm gonna buy a humidifier.

825
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,660
That's a baller pimp-ass joke.

826
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,540
I was talking last night about how I get mine stuff.

827
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,860
Get a lot wetter all the time.

828
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,420
They should have been putting humidifiers in Pimp My Ride vehicles.

829
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,620
That would have been good.

830
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,820
I'm also gonna do a lot of experiments with my humidifier where I put strange liquids

831
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,820
into it.

832
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,860
They need to bring Pimp My Ride back, honestly.

833
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,780
Dude, holy shit.

834
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,420
A pimp my ride reboot right now would be so fucking choice.

835
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
That would be tight.

836
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
That would be so good.

837
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,420
You know what would be cool?

838
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,420
Who would host it?

839
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
Who would host it?

840
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
Yeah.

841
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,060
I feel like they'd probably get a new host.

842
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,900
It probably, I hate to say it, it probably would be Pete Davidson.

843
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Yeah.

844
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,700
It would probably be Pete Davidson or McRiblet.

845
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,460
No it would be Machine Gun Kelly.

846
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,860
Oh you gotta give it to fucking Kells dude.

847
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Killa Kells.

848
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,740
They would not make it a white guy.

849
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,540
Hey, whites can be pimps too though.

850
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,540
No.

851
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,620
Straight up.

852
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,620
You know who it's gonna be?

853
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,620
Who?

854
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,620
What?

855
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,620
Maya Angelou.

856
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,180
I don't think so.

857
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Is she alive?

858
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,340
So you're gonna bring her back to life.

859
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,660
I feel like that'd be way worse than Machine Gun Kelly.

860
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,700
Machine Gun Kelly might be pretty decent at it.

861
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Yeah, he could.

862
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,140
I think he could do it.

863
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,980
Maya Angelou would be terrible at it.

864
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,900
What are you talking about?

865
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,100
What would Maya Angelou put in a fucking, in a Subaru?

866
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,660
Maybe for once they could have a host that's a car scientist and actually knows what the

867
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,780
hell he's talking about when uh...

868
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Bill Nye.

869
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
Oh my god.

870
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
Oh my god.

871
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,780
That is a good, Bill Nye.

872
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,700
I put a magnet in your fucking car, pimp.

873
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,980
Pimp.

874
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,060
Pimp ass playalistic magnet in your damn car.

875
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,500
You know who'd be the best host?

876
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Who?

877
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Who'd get my ride?

878
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Us three?

879
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,940
exhibit exhibit would be really good they should get exhibit yeah I forget

880
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
he's still alive.

881
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,060
Can you get off your second monitor please?

882
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,060
He's trying to spell exhibit.

883
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,060
I've seen you the entire time.

884
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,060
He's playing a typing game.

885
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,860
The whole episode.

886
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,260
He literally is playing fucking Mavis Beacon the whole time.

887
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,260
What is wrong with you bro?

888
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,620
Listen to that fucking giggle dude.

889
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,900
And then he's just like yee.

890
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,900
I waited 40 minutes to bring it up.

891
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,100
I'm sucking my job.

892
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,780
Are you online shopping right now?

893
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,780
Yes.

894
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
Are you googling?

895
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,900
Can you be allergic to an Austin Powers costume?

896
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,580
I'm looking up stuff. We were talking about buying stuff and I'm looking up stuff right

897
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,220
now. He's literally sitting here, he's googling on Amazon, he's searching on Amazon, "Most

898
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:49,500
expensive annoying shirt ever." So that he can buy it for himself and wear it around.

899
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,940
Say, "Hey look at my expensive annoying shirt." Most high-pitched instrument. Yeah. This is

900
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:00,100
why we gotta record these in person. Also because I miss you guys. I can't get COVID

901
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,820
this week dude. I'm sick of not hanging out with my boys. I'm locked down this week. I'm

902
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,820
I'm sorry. Yeah, Cam can't leave his apartment.

903
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,820
And I'm going with you to the crazy festival.

904
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:16,820
Yeah, so I'll gladly get COVID on the way there or the day before,

905
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,820
but I cannot find out that I have COVID before it's time for me to go.

906
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,820
Just go anyway. Who gives a shit?

907
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,820
I mean, I would, but I wouldn't say it on a podcast if I were going to do that.

908
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,820
[Laughter]

909
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:39,600
I think everybody does that right. I've thought I've had covid and traveled with it probably

910
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,380
six times. You can't just not travel. It's fucking expensive. I'm not just gonna not

911
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:50,020
yeah bro. I don't have my computer at my mom's house. What am I supposed to do sit there for

912
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:57,820
four days? I was so right before I yeah right before I was I was I was going home back coming

913
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,900
back to New York, my mom took like a rapid COVID test and I was so pissed off. It was

914
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,500
like if she got a positive, I had to stay at home for like another week.

915
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Just wait till I got home.

916
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,700
I thought you were going to say, before I left, my mom took my computer and I was so

917
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,700
pissed.

918
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,740
That sucked when she did that too.

919
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,020
My mom took my computer and she typed on it.

920
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,700
I played so much Fortnite over the holidays. That's literally all I did at home. I stole

921
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,980
a table from my sibling's room. I brought it to the basement and I played Fortnite in

922
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:32,580
the basement all night every night. That's sick. Dude I just got fat at my house at my

923
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:38,420
mom's house. I ate so much bullshit. I ate so much candy while I was playing Fortnite.

924
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,340
Dude I was a candy animal dude. Yeah. I had a good Christmas with Joe and Alex.

925
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,260
Oh yeah how was your roommate Christmas? What'd you do? It was

926
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:54,300
good. It was honestly yeah I still I'm waiting because I only have $50 in my

927
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,820
bank account right now. You shouldn't be saying that out loud. Yeah. Yeah that's an inside thing.

928
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:06,300
Why? Why not? Because now people know that you're a target and you have 50 bucks.

929
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,100
That's true somebody could try and take my 50 bucks. That's an easy 50 dollars.

930
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:17,580
Oh man I hope no one takes my 50 dollars. Honestly if you ever see Patrick walking around Brooklyn

931
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:23,820
you should rob him. He'd be so easy to rob. I wouldn't be easy to rob. Are you kidding me? I

932
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,180
I have a skateboard with me most of the time, I would smack the shit out of somebody.

933
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,180
Actually, try it!

934
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,180
Actually, come up to me!

935
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,180
Come up to me and try it!

936
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,380
Literally, your hair would shoot out like spaghetti, like this.

937
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,820
Your eyes would pop out.

938
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,820
You'd go, "Ahh!"

939
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,540
All your money would fall out of your body like you were a defeated video game boss.

940
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,380
I would not turn into spaghetti.

941
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,500
And then you would get really, really small and you'd run into a mouse hole.

942
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Not true.

943
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Yeah.

944
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,580
That would not happen.

945
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,580
It's not true.

946
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,980
You'd look at these people like the guy from Warheads and you'd run away and you'd give

947
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,980
them all your money.

948
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,980
I wouldn't.

949
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,700
You'd be giving them, you'd run out of money and you'd keep giving them shit.

950
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,460
You'd give them lint out of your pockets because you were like, "Please, take everything."

951
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,020
I'd probably apologize to the person robbing me.

952
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,860
"Please, I'm so sorry I don't have even more money.

953
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,100
Here, take my ID.

954
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Take my teeth.

955
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,100
Here you go."

956
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,100
"I'm so sorry.

957
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:25,860
money right now. That's one of my New Year's resolutions also is I will not get mugged

958
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:32,020
this year. I didn't last year, I want this year. I kind of want to get mugged. Really?

959
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,300
Yeah, because I like getting hurt and I like when bad things happen to me.

960
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:42,100
It is really nice to every once in a while a bad thing happening so you get to go "ohhh".

961
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:47,140
I think I'd probably be just as easy to rob as Patrick, but I never have cash on me.

962
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,980
Oh, I never have cash on me though. That's the thing.

963
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,100
Then you're gonna get killed.

964
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,620
You'll be killed.

965
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,060
I've always just thought a good idea is just pretend you're deaf.

966
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:57,300
Yeah.

967
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,100
Yeah.

968
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,020
There's, yeah, that is, that is one of the things.

969
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,180
What if the person robbing you is deaf though?

970
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,340
You gotta stand around every once in a while and just brainstorm different ideas to do if you get

971
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,940
mugged. Different moves, different runs, different...

972
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,420
I mean, not moves as in like fighting moves.

973
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,740
No, no, no.

974
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,220
Moves as in like, what do I say that's so...

975
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:21,420
like if I can I think fast enough that I can just instantly run yeah can I think

976
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,740
can I process the situation at enough speed and do the math of the length of

977
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,660
the guys looks the question is like maybe in that moment like when when moms

978
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,180
like lift up a car to save a baby yeah right like maybe in that moment you

979
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,620
discover you have a time ability yeah yeah right you pause time so cool yeah

980
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,520
Yeah, you pause time and you walk behind the person and then now you're mugging

981
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,600
them when you replay time to go again, right? Because whoever's behind the other

982
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,540
one, that's the mugger. Yeah. I think that's pretty, I mean, I would be counting

983
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,340
on that. Right? A secret, because superheroes always discover they have

984
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,900
powers when they're getting attacked, you know? So that's what I would probably have

985
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,540
that happen to me. Or when their parents are killed. So you could also maybe try and... I guess I could kill my

986
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,140
parents. Yeah, you could tell the mother like my parents or you could kill my parents.

987
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:17,100
Yeah. Hey, on your way home to somewhere else in New York, could you walk all the

988
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,020
way down to North Carolina, kill my parents and then come back? Yeah.

989
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:25,740
Hmm. So that I can have a revenge on you? I can do that for sure. I'll do that right now.

990
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:31,100
My dad would be hard to kill I think. Yeah. Yeah, I honestly think my dad has like...

991
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,980
I just went and killed Caleb's parents. No, my dad has no blood in his body.

992
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:40,100
body. That sounds like I did it. Maybe he's already dead if he has no blood in

993
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,820
his body or he's a Dracula.

994
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:48,860
My dad is some kind of undead construct. He's red. My dad is a red guy. You'll

995
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,700
ever meet and he has a lot of blood. Yeah, well, it's all in his skin, though

996
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:59,900
he's none in his body part. I'm really dead has blood in his skin, but no one

997
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:06,540
in his body part? My dad is literally like he looks like one of the fucking one of

998
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,780
those jazz raisins but red. Yeah the California raisins. Yeah he looks like

999
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,140
they are kind of red are you just saying your dad looks like a California raisin?

1000
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,980
He looks honestly exactly like a California raisin. I don't know if I've ever seen a

1001
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,780
picture of him. My dad? Yeah. I thought you're gonna say the California raisins. I

1002
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,220
haven't seen a picture of your dad either. I haven't seen a picture of the California raisins. We

1003
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,140
We really, we were all pretty buddy buddy with each other's moms, but our dads are-

1004
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,700
I think you met my dad one time and you refused to remember it for some reason.

1005
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,700
I've never met your dad.

1006
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,700
I have never met your dad.

1007
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,020
I don't even know what Cam's dad looks like.

1008
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,980
Your dad met a fucking, like a different bald guy in Boston.

1009
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,020
That's- there's millions of us.

1010
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,880
No, you definitely, you definitely met my dad and you erased it from your memory because

1011
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
you didn't want to be experienced for some reason.

1012
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,880

I showed them to you last episode and you guys say all this crap about my mom.

1032
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,020
I had barbecue brain last episode.

00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,860
It's not crap, it's sweet.

1034
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,820
It's not nice what we say.

1035
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,380
It's not nice what you say.

1036
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,260
I'm calling your mom a beautiful young woman.

1037
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,260
She likes it.

1038
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,300
saying no you're saying that you put things in her who's saying that I put

1039
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,260
thing in her that's what you said I didn't say anything about putting things

1040
00:52:53,260 --> 00:53:00,300
in her yes you did I thought it I didn't say it I considered it I'm sick and I

1041
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:06,580
did it in 2022 anytime you guys say something about my mom you guys have to

1042
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,880
give me a dollar worth it.

1043
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,980
Yeah, he's giving me she's giving me way more than that.

1044
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,380
I'm still way up on this deal, bro.

1045
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:26,680
Oh, yeah, 2022 even more gambling way way more.

1046
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,380
Oh, yeah.

1047
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:33,180
I want to say I won $30 on a scratch ticket for on for Christmas

1048
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,580
scratch.

1049
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:41,380
that's not a good omen. It's funny that you and me are the two that like gambling a lot

1050
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:46,500
and both of us have dads that give us Christmas scratchers and have since we were kids. Like

1051
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,420
I've done that since I was like five years old. Yeah, that's a Christmas tradition. Dude,

1052
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,900
it's a classic Christmas tradition. It's the best. What's the most you've ever won? The

1053
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,300
$30 I think. I feel like somebody won like a hundred bucks one time but it wasn't me.

1054
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,960
I did. Do you have that fucked up rule where it's like anything over a hundred everyone

1055
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:11,520
splits it? No, we never, I feel like if that did happen. The thing is also is like for most

1056
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,880
of my life, it's like my parents just counted on like us kids being too ADHD to remember

1057
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,680
that we won on scratch tickets so they could just take them. Yeah, I think that's why my

1058
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,040
dad has that rule. Yeah. Because he's basically just getting us to open his scratchers for

1059
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:34,180
Yeah, yeah, it's an excuse to buy them. Yeah, it's great though. Yeah, but now now my now all the kids

1060
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:40,620
My family are 18. Everyone could cast their own parents. It's nothing. They don't get anything. We're high a depression

1061
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,280
Good. I parents can get fucked. That's right. Mm-hmm

1062
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:52,200
You want to learn about winnings on a scratcher when and I bought an external hard drive with it in in the eighth grade

1063
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,880
That's not where you're supposed to it's basically a coupon for more scratchers. Yeah

1064
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,160
You're wrong. You ever grown your money exponentially

1065
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:07,260
Dude, I just remembered I won I won I won like 20 bucks on a scratcher at the beginning of 2021 - oh

1066
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,000
God, it's and that and this was that was a great year. So this is gonna be an even better one

1067
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,560
That was yeah, I got our real job gave us one gave us a scratcher when we moved in

1068
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,200
And honestly yet

1069
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,680
Hmm, how much did you win on it? We only won like two dollars on that one

1070
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:31,580
But I had already won like 20 bucks on another one. Whoa, I think I I think I'm gonna plan on finding buried treasure

1071
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:37,120
Yeah, that's a good risk. That's a really really. That's a really good one. I had a metal detector as a kid

1072
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,800
I could go look at my dad's attic to see if we could find it. We could go to Topsail Beach in North Carolina

1073
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:49,840
That's where Blackbeard's treasure is buried. Whoa, really? Yeah, it's like it's like 30 minutes away from Wilmington. Damn. Yeah, it's pretty fucking cool, man

1074
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:57,960
That's crazy just pull out the pull out the dude if we find blackbeard's treasure just be sitting in some retirees garage

1075
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,080
Mm-hmm. Just like no, you don't understand. It's it's beeping right where you're

1076
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:09,440

1088
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,440
You're smarter than that.

1089
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,200
You have more than 20 IQ points.

1090
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,960
My 20's pretty good.

1091
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,040
The average is zero, you know.

1092
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Really?

1093
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,040

1094
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,040
Oh, I believe it.

Yeah.

1097
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Oh my God.

1098
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
Yeah.

1099
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:54,480
people walking around nowadays with 16, 64 gigabyte iPhones. It's like, yeah, it's more

1100
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,880

00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,260
IQ.

1102
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:03,280
That's right. We used to, we want to have our IQ and now everybody wants to have this

1103
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,280
Shanghai flu.

1104
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,280
Whoa.

1105
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,280
Definitely.

1106
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,280
What does that mean?

1107
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,160
I don't know. Oh, by the way, my grandparents who you met, they are loading up on ivermectin

1108
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,240
because of my whole family getting COVID.

1109
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Nice.

1110
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,560
They are pounding it right now.

1111
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,560
Damn.

1112
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,840
They are just beasting on packages of ivermectin right now at the crib.

1113
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,840
That sucks.

1114
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Nah dude, it's cool.

1115
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,840
It's sick, bro.

1116
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,680
Doesn't it kill you?

1117
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,280
No, it kills worms.

1118
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,840
No, it kills COVID-19.

1119
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Nah.

1120
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,200
Yeah, dude, it kills it in one shot.

1121
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
One shot, one kill.

1122
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Really?

1123
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,200
Yeah, instantly.

1124
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,840
I think I might try it out then.

1125
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,120
They offered to give us some.

1126
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,240
I was like really have come. Yeah, I should have just taken it dude. I know it's no way

1127
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,560
you don't know I'm talking to Patrick. It'd be really funny the next few months Patrick

1128
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,560
gets covered like every two weeks.

1129
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,120
Yeah, Patrick says the worst year ever.

1130
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:08,160
He's like, I must have the antibodies by now. Yeah, it's immediately gets it again. Just

1131
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,760
constantly getting COVID. Yeah, that would be pretty. That's not an impossibility. Yeah,

1132
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,840
I think there's going to be, I think we're going to move to the new strain every two weeks.

1133
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,480
That's my 11th resolution is I'm going to make that happen for you.

1134
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,080
You're going to inject me with COVID.

1135
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
Oh, okay.

1136
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,080
No.

1137
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,080
12th resolution, profit even harder off COVID-19.

1138
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,480
We need to make a lot of money off this disease.

1139
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
You know what we got to do?

1140
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
What?

1141
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,760
Get into the, well, I think it's pretty late in the game now, but we start making masks.

1142
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,840
Oh, yeah.

1143
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
That's a really good idea.

1144
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
What should we make?

1145
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,520
We could come up with like funny-ass masks too with like jokes and shit.

1146
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,840
It says the mask says "I have COVID."

1147
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,720
Yeah, that'd be a mask with a smiley face.

1148
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,800
Oh, what about a mask that is my teeth like this?

1149
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,760
What about a mask that says...

1150
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,480
That's a bit egotistical, don't you think, Patrick?

1151
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,840
Yeah, like why are you always trying to make it about you?

1152
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,360
Well, we could have your teeth too.

1153
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,000
What about...

1154
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,880
I don't want my teeth. My teeth are shitty. I don't want them on a fucking mask.

1155
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,800
What about a meme on the mask?

1156
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,760
Oh my god, no wait.

1157
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,320
So it's the Grateful Dead logo, but it says, it says, "I am one grateful dad."

1158
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:20,160
Do you think that would do numbers?

1159
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,720
Yeah.

1160
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,760
What about like this?

1161
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,640
What about a mask that says ADHD in the AC/DC font?

1162
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,560
That's, that could be good.

1163
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,040
That's good.

1164
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,880
What about a mask and it has like a mouth like on it, but the mouth is like beatboxing,

1165
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,400
it has like beatboxing sound effects written around it?

1166
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,400
Oh my god, wait, a mask that has a microphone in it for when you want to beatbox.

1167
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,400
Yo!

1168
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,920
Just a mask that has a microphone in general and you can amplify your voice whenever you

1169
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,920
want.

1170
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,920
Yeah.

1171
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,520
You have a little remote control in your pocket and you can put effects, it has an effects

1172
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
pedal.

1173
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,080
Or like, like tooth tunes, it just, like, let's simplify it.

1174
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,320
It just plays one kiss song, like a 30 second snippet, every time you open your mouth.

1175
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,320
Oh, I had that one.

1176
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,320
I had that tooth tunes.

1177
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Yeah.

1178
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,680
Rock and roll all night.

1179
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,840
What about like a thong mask?

1180
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:10,000
Where it's just like a thin strip over your mouth and you see everything else.

1181
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,800
Yeah, nothing to be desired.

1182
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,800
Nothing left to the imagination.

1183
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Yeah.

1184
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Yeah.

01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,800
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1186
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,200
That'd be good if you had a mouth that looked like an ass cracker or a vagina.

1187
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,080
Yeah, so Pat, that'd be really good.

01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,680
Yeah, that'd be perfect for you.

01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,680
Ass mouth.
