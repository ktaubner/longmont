Yeah, yeah, take another bite of the sandwich that made you run out of the room.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Yeah, do that.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Pierce got a gas station sandwich and right before we started,

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,680
He turned into Darth Vader voice and had to leave the room because the sandwich was attacking

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
him.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,440
The sandwich was punching out at him like a xenomorph.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,360
Every single time I eat, I take really big bites, I don't chew and then I start to chew.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
Nice.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,520
You need to relearn how to eat.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,540
It's so funny to identify that as a thing that happens every time you eat and do nothing

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,540
about it.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,540
I'm always so hungry.

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,540
Have you ever tried?

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,280
I'm always so hungry to eat.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,640
How long do you wait between meals?

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,760
Have you tried chewing before?

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
It's only breakfast.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,800
It's only when I - it's like when I sleep in until -

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Wait, it's only breakfast?

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Oh, I'm kind of the same way.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
That's like why I don't like breakfast.

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
It's only breakfast.

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,560
Breakfast for some reason your brain can't think of taking smaller bites.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm so hungry in the morning.

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
Because you've been working up an appetite all night.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Exactly.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
I sleep in until noon.

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Do you like - are you like hiking?

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,240
I sleep in until noon and then I have like a fried chicken lunch for my first meal.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,840
to me and I eat such big pieces of fried chicken mmm I'm drinking oh yeah what

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:38,440
time is it over there it's like 11 let's do that again

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,600
Pierce just dreams all night of running on a treadmill I dream of being chased

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,680
by my high school drama teacher dreams of a doctor taking all the food out of

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,760
of his stomach surgically and then he wakes up and he's like, "Fuck, I'm so empty."

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Better not chew.

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm chewing now.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,560
Do you sleep in late normally?

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,640
Like when do you wake up today?

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,640
I kept waking up, I probably like got up at around 9 or 10.

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,000
And is that early or late for you?

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's fine for me.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's fine.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's normal.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, that's okay for you.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,520
I've been waking up at like 630 every day. No control over it. Yeah. Yeah, that was happening for me to me for a while

50
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,200
I was waking up at 7 and then just showering and

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,680
Playing video games through three hours before I started my day. Yeah, I felt like I was smarter than everyone else

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah, when you wake up early you are like, oh I fucking rock like even if you do nothing, you're just like, oh, I

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,320
Want to know this is free. Yeah, you just get some extra hours

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,620
Being a lot I used to I woke up at like 4 a.m. Every day. I think the parts do

55
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,340
Wow, that's how we have man. Yeah

56
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,540
Before before the Sun comes up exactly before homeroom. That's awesome, dude

57
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,960
A15 you walk and you walk onto the school bus and people could just tell yeah

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,340
There's an air because you're wearing a goofy costume

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,140
Sword

60
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
Receipt of your ps3 trophy

61
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:24,300
Yeah, and he was mad yeah, and to get back at you he dropped you off at school

62
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,660
To get back at you he drank

63
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:36,360
If you if you're applying to be a school bus driver that you have to hate kids because you have to hate them enough to

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Take them to school, which is like the worst

65
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,880
There's a citizenship they give you a they give you a test it's like there's 30 kids on your bus. Where do you take?

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:55,340
They give you like a doll and then whatever you do to the doll that's how they hire

67
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,020
Yeah, if you take him to school, you're the bus driver. Yeah, what do you mean? That's how they hire you

68
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Like if you fuck the doll they fuck you back

69
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,520
That's the job well, yeah, so if you hire the doll you hire the doll

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:17,520
They give you a doll and you drive it to school.

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
It's in your blood.

72
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Like a bus driver.

73
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Yeah.

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,520
They have someone waiting at the school with a sign that says you're hired.

75
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,520
But if you take the doll to the trampoline park, they hire you as cool uncle.

76
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Yeah, they give you some nephew.

77
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,120
you yeah you cigarettes if you suck the dolls dick do they suck your dick or do

78
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,960
they make you suck their that's sort of the old - that's why they had to stop the

79
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,600
program because people figured out that one way to play it safe is to is to 69

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,160
the doll you get you get your dick a little wet exactly just a little bit

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,600
that's you also get hired as a bus driver if you 69 because you're a problem

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,160
solver yeah but a city bus driver not a school bus driver I never rode on a bus

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,360
that was never I only know like weird charter schools growing up so I never

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,880

87
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,280
school was over and that was a short bus oh yeah short bus I was a that was a the

88
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,560
kiss of death in elementary school if a kid got picked up for like the girls and

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,560
boys club doesn't matter as long as it's a short bus I'm gonna get you yeah yeah

91
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,960
short bus is the downs bus it's just that it's shorter than my bus exactly

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,520
look at my long bus yeah look at my big long bus I do remember think I remember

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,920
thinking like the girls and boys club that sounds like paradise and then I

94
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
I don't know what that is.

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,400
Girls and Boys Club is like this, it's like a thing for, it's like an after school care

96
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,880
thing for like kids whose parents work like 24 hours a day.

97
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,020
And so they would pick up like six kids from my school and take them and I was always so

98
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,300
jealous and I told my teacher, I was like, "Yeah, I wish I could go to the Boys and Girls

99
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Club."

100
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,160
And she was like, "No, you don't because that would mean you were very poor."

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,420
(laughing)

102
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,180
- Okay, I guess I didn't make the cut.

103
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,120
- Yeah, you didn't think it through?

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,960
- No.

105
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,580
- Yeah, you just thought it was gonna be nasty poet.

106
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,220
- Yeah, yeah, I was like, "Girls and, wait,

107
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,160
"girls and boys?"

108
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,000
- Yeah, that's what's up.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,760
- "In the same bus?"

110
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,000
- One time my friend's mom was giving me a ride somewhere

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
and it was just me and her,

112
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,800
and I had just gotten back from summer camp,

113
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,640
and she was like, "She's dead now."

114
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
- Nice. - That doesn't matter.

115
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,680
She was like, "Was it a co-ed camp?" and I didn't know what that meant so I just went,

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,400
"I think so."

117
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,600
And she was like, "It means boys and girls."

118
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,160
And then I was like, "Yeah, well, you know, you never know with these girls."

119
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
I don't know what I was - I don't know what I was -

120
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,600
I have so many memories of any time I was in the car, like as a 10 or 11 year old with

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,920
like an adult woman at some point I would think during the ride like we will have

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:31,680
sex. I remember going on a field trip and it was there was like not enough room in

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
the bus for me I so I had to ride with the teacher my teacher Miss Sullivan.

124
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,720
That's just what they told you dude. They just didn't want you on the bus. All the other kids on the bus

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,280
had a petition do not let Caleb ride on this bus. They all had a petition that said

126
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,680
Let's get Caleb Wade by the hottest teacher in school.

127
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,860
- But we were right, it was like to the aquarium.

167
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,140
quality. And then my teacher, like once we got back, she was like,

168
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,100
yeah, I'm sorry guys. I don't know why we had to do that. Oh my God. Oh,

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,300
there was, so there was two video production class.

170
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,020
There was the juniors and the seniors. This happened when I was a junior,

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,260
my brother, Paul, who's a, he's a patron. He's going to hear this.

172
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,140
We can ask him his story. Yeah, we'll ask him. Yeah, we'll definitely, yeah.

173
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,000
But yeah, we can call him right now.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,060
- Okay. - Yeah, I need to know.

175
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,260
- Get him, get him, I had to call him.

176
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm gonna make sure he's not in there.

177
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,940
- No, I just remembered, I just remembered this

178
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,780
'cause like, I guess--

179
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,300
- No, call him, call him. - This is such an outlandish

180
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,140
story. - No, call him.

181
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,980

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,740
- Call Joe! - Yeah, 'cause--

186
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,860
- Joe walked into the cafeteria.

187
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,820
- Where's Joe?

188
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,940
- As soon as Joe walked into the cafeteria,

189
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,700

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,140

there's this student announcement like we

216
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
would do the morning announcement on the

217
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,200
TV I thought you might just announce

218
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
things to the school and you all the

219
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,120
announcements were like they were they

220
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,520
wanted to make it like its own cool

221
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,840
program so I got to do my own little

222
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,920
stand-up segments at the end where I

223
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,840
would like played an old it was I was

224
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
like an eighth grade and there was this

225
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
guy mr. Toto was like he walked up to me

226
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,960
one time at the water fountain like

227
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,840
during like free period and he was like

228
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,560
"Pierce, I just want to know what ticks you off."

229
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,080
You should do a show called "What Bothers Pierce"

230
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,200
or "What Pierce's Pierce."

231
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
(laughs)

232
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
I was like, "Okay, yeah."

233
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,640
- I'm just watching the Daily Show on his phone.

234
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,160
- You should make this at my house.

235
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,000
- Literally.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,280
- You should make this show at my house with me.

237
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,320
Don't tell anyone.

238
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,560
- Yeah, and we're gonna find out what bothers you.

239
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm just gonna do stuff to you

240
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,720
until you say this bothers me.

241
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,400
- We're gonna find out what ticks you off.

242
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,200
We're gonna work our way up until I take you off.

243
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Yeah.

244
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,840
And then we'll turn the video off.

245
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Say uncle!

246
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Um, yeah.

247
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,080
Then we'll turn the video off, yeah.

248
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,520
But I did one like bit about how the Santa story is stupid and then like everyone on

249
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,360
the - all the teachers that ran the program were like, "Do you think there's any middle

250
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
schoolers who still believe in Santa?"

251
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,520
And I was like, "No."

252
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,600
And like five parents called in and were like, "Yeah, my seventh grader didn't know."

253
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
And Pierce ruined Santa.

254
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,600
When you say they call into your show, they call things like Morning Zoo Radio.

255
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,680
"Hey, first time, long time listener, first time caller, you broke into my son, Bradley,

256
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
that Santa's a real."

257
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,600
You said, "Fuck you."

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,600
And then I said, "Why don't you straddle your speakers and turn the bass all the way up?"

259
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,860
(laughter)

260
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,120
- Yeah.

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,160
- I wish an Opie and Anthony style talk show

262
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,040
in middle school would have been perfect for me.

263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
It would have given me an outlet.

264
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,440
We didn't have any sort of AV program

265
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,040
at any schools that I went to.

266
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,200
They were all too poor.

267
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,440
We didn't have a playground,

268
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,400
we just had like a,

269
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,840
there was always a parking lot behind the school

270
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,040
that they would put a,

271
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,520
they would draw a four square.

272
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,360
Square.

273
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
- Awesome.

274
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,720
- You could play jump over the glass.

275
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
Yeah, so I, yeah.

276
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,240
You know, it's just how I grew up, it's not.

277
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
You play wall ball at all?

278
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,600
We played wall ball, we played ball wall,

279
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,980
we played Paul Wall, the rapper.

280
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,200
Yeah. Paul Walker.

281
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,760
We played Paul Walker until the game died.

282
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,000
(laughing)

283
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
Yeah.

284
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,520
Until the game crashed, exactly.

285
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,960
It's my birthday.

286
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,880
Woo!

287
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,200

- Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

301
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
(laughing)

302
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,400
Whoops.

303
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,560
But no, I'm hanging out.

304
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,120
- Haven't you seen Super Size Me Too?

305
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,920
- Yeah, I actually did watch Super Size Me Too.

306
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,760
- You did?

307
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,580
- Yeah, it's so sad.

308
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,880
- And you still got Chick-fil-A?

309
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,000
- It's so sad 'cause it's just like he's just--

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
- Are you serious, dude?

311
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,400
- The first one was interesting because--

312
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,480
(laughing)

313
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
The first one was interesting because it was just like,

314
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,920
it was like, okay, yeah, people I guess don't know how--

315
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,760
Like, shit, that's--

316
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,760
How many 5,000 calories a day will actually make you kind of fat?

317
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Eating McDonald's is bad?

318
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Yeah, I mean that was definitely surprising at the time.

319
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
That was before people knew.

320
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
He's like, "Oh, whatever."

321
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Everyone thought it was healthy.

322
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
There definitely wasn't the same sort of health conscious movement.

323
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Nobody saw a fat guy say, "Meat on me hurts!"

324
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Yeah, people thought that fat guys were just nerds back then.

325
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Before that, they had never had a real fat guy in a movie.

326
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
It was all people acting fat.

327
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah, they had Eddie Murphy play all the fat people.

328
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,880
Exactly.

329
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,120
Yeah.

330
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
It's similar to Borat.

331
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,720
They never saw a documentary where someone said, "Oh my god, my stomach."

332
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
That was the first time somebody threw up on camera.

333
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,880
"I drank too much root beer and now my stomach hurts."

334
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,960
They should do Super Size Me, but just with the drinks.

335
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,920
You just peed a lot.

336
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Super Coca-Cola Me.

337
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,200
Yeah, yours was worse.

338
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,880
Drink me.

339
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,240
Super Power Me.

340
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,800
Before Borat, no one found out that if you talk in a silly voice you turn into a gay guy.

341
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Yeah.

342
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Yeah.

343
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Yeah.

344
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
But not until the second movie.

345
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Yeah.

346
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
That's when you get it.

347
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Yeah, exactly.

348
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Yeah.

349
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You turn into a gay guy.

350
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,320
Bruno is like the chicken super size.

351
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Yeah, exactly.

352
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,680
He's really depressed and really gay.

353
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,880
These people already knew about a guy who talks funny, but they didn't know about a

354
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
gay guy.

355
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
And so they made Bruno.

356
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,480
I haven't seen Bruno in so long.

357
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:18,480
the

358
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,800
together to simulate a stick hole opening.

359
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Yeah, he goes, "Bruno."

360
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Bruno.

361
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,080
I've never seen Bruno.

362
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
You gotta see it, dude.

363
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
It's really good.

364
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
It's on my computer.

365
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Yeah, it's on Caleb's computer.

366
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
You come watch it on my computer.

367
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
Alright, I'll hack in.

368
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Do you have my computer?

369
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm gonna hack into it.

370
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Go for it.

371
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
I dare you, I have so many firewalls.

372
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I know how to get past firewalls, really easy.

373
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
How?

374
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Water.

375
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
You didn't think of that, did you?

376
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Fine.

377
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:54,960
how water they're useless now yeah I use water programming it's where I pour

378
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,880
water onto my computer and I'm able to access any file I want if you if you if

379
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,640
you hold on to a frayed wire poking out of your computer and then pour water all

380
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,360
over it you can see whatever file you want in your head yeah you become part

381
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,740
computer yeah yeah you cry you climb into your bathtub holding your giant CRT

382
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,280
computer plugged in and you experience the files

383
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,000
experience your files in three-dimensional it's a real computer

384
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,920
into the bathtub and open a file and then just let that boy fly if you want

385
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,360
to know if you want to see Wolfenstein 3d in real life yeah put your yeah if you

386
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,460
want to see it in 3d yeah yeah yeah they say it's 3d but they say you activate

387
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,120
3d once you put it in the tub. Have you any of you guys been contacted by the

388
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,820
Secret Service about your tweets? No no I don't think mine doesn't have a keywords

389
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,480
in it so I think I'm fine. Mine I think I'm I think I'm waiting I think they're

390
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,800
probably building up a bigger case against me honestly yeah yeah cuz I had

391
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,600
I had like three people DM me and they were like,

392
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,920
"Hey, I just like posted the lyrics from this

393
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,480
"and a guy knocked on my dad's door."

394
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
- Holy shit.

395
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,000
- Yeah, so I mean I think it's probably not a big deal.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,920
And if you guys are listening, I'm just joking.

397
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,740
- Yeah.

398
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,580
(laughing)

399
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,880
- I really, yeah, it doesn't matter.

400
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,800
It's just like right now,

401
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,360
I don't want anybody coming to my house.

402
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,440
- Yeah, exactly.

403
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,100
- Well, the thing is,

404
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,440
the reason I'm bringing it up is 'cause I got a call

405
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,000
the secret service about the Mechagodzilla tweet.

406
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What was it?

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
They called me and they were like, it was the one where it's about Mechagodzilla using his

408
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,840
finger missiles and it also has to do with his brain.

409
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm not going to say the whole syntax because they told me I shouldn't say it again.

410
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Gotcha.

411
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,120
But yeah, they called me and they were like, is your account CRM?

412
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,400
Is your refrigerator back?

413
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,840
There were two of them, one was like training the other one, but they were calling from Boston

414
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,540
'cause that was the last address that they had of me, I guess.

415
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,040
And I guess they're making calls because of COVID, they're not knocking on doors so much lately.

416
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, that's good to know. Alright, I'm gonna kick it up a notch then.

417
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
[laughter]

418
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
What are you gonna do, call me?

419
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I just won't pick up, bitch.

420
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,840
I said that I was gonna pick up [censored] and swing him like a bat.

421
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,960
Yeah, you also said you were gonna go Travis mode on him.

422
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,160
yeah i don't know if you can i said it's really a i think i i i i i said i was

423
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,720
going to go to our national disaster

424
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,240
yeah he's gonna repeat your face off

425
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,560
yeah

426
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,880
yes i think it's a good thing to trick is just to say jill

427
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,360
as people get it

428
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,560
that's a young interviewed me for like forty five minutes well um... what all

429
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,160
did they have to do for you later you are you ready to argue that uh... yeah i

430
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,720
think so they asked me like if i've ever been suicidal if i've ever shot a

431
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,840
firearm if I've ever been to a rally for a political protectee before. They asked me

432
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,520
if I was a member of any groups and I was like, "Like what?" And then he listed like

433
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,680
three very avant-garde white supremacist groups that I've never heard of. I was like, "How

434
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,440
do you know all these groups?" He was like, "You wouldn't believe me if I told you." I

435
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,880
don't know what that means. I think how he knows is that he's a secret servant. Yeah,

436
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Of course, of course.

437
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Yeah, he should have just said that.

438
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Yeah, that's because it's my whole job.

439
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Uh-huh.

440
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,320
Um, it ended pretty strangely because I was, like, the whole time I was trying to make

441
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,880
them laugh to prove to them that I was funny and not insane.

442
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,200
I also, like, before the interview even started, I was just like, "How did you know, did you

443
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,880
guys already know the Godzilla monsters or did you have to look it up?"

444
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:57,000
And one of them was like, "I'm 51, I know all the Godzilla monsters."

445
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,800
But it ended with, "Yeah, yeah man, you wouldn't believe the kind of shit we hear.

446
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,600
We just had to make sure that Mechagodzilla wasn't code for you or something.

447
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,240
I heard one guy say that the devil talked to him on the TV and told him that he needed

448
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,040
to kill Barack Obama."

449
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,200
I was like, "Yeah, that sounds pretty normal."

450
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,400
And then he was like, "Well, anyway, we just had to make sure that you weren't gonna, you

451
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,000
know, travel across the country to do anything to hurt poor d**k."

452
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And I laughed so hard.

453
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,080
I was like, "Did you say poor d**k?"

454
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,840
And then he was like, yeah, poor [beep]

455
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
[Laughter]

456
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
It was insane.

457
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
He really had a joke.

458
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,480
I was like, what is his home address by the way?

459
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm kidding.

460
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm more than - I'd welcome a call.

461
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
I would love to talk -

462
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,880
It was pretty nice to talk to them.

463
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,040
I would love to talk to them just because it would keep me from like - like every time

464
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,240
I get like a phone call or something, I'm just like, oh my God, here it is.

465
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,160
But it's always capital one.

466
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,440
It's always a worse phone call.

467
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,080
Manchester, New Hampshire. I don't know if that's the Secret Service though. I've been

468
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,120
hanging up on them. Yeah, the thing is most phone calls I hang up on, I don't answer a

469
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,000
lot of stuff. The only phone calls I get ever are just some, are like a pre-recorded message

470
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
of a woman speaking Chinese. Oh, that might be, that might be from when I signed you up.

471
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That might be the Secret Service. That might be from when I signed you up for Scientology

472
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,400
in Chinese. Yeah, I think that is what it is, but I get them like, that's literally the only

473
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
phone calls I get. Nobody else calls me.

474
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Yeah, Scientology wants your Chinese ass.

475
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Yeah.

476
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
They're gonna get your Chinese ass, Cam.

477
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You watch out.

478
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I don't know if I can help it.

479
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Have you been, Piers, have you been to the

480
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
psychiatry industry of Death Museum?

481
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Mm-hmm. I went there on like my first week

482
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
in LA.

483
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Man, it's good. I think I did too.

484
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
I think it was my first or second week.

485
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
I was gonna go with Alex, but he was a coward.

486
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
He didn't want to go.

487
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
It's so scary. It's like a haunted house.

488
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I walked in with a group of friends and we all gave

489
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
fake names and then, you guys know Mike Palladino?

490
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Yeah

491
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,240
Yeah, he literally just walked out and you waited outside for us

492
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,040
We were in there for like an hour the whole time

493
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,920
He was just stressed out on the street corner of the psychiatry

494
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,040
When I went it was completely empty. I went with David Potashnik

495
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,800
the

496
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,880
Boston comic and we just yeah, we just moved through there's nobody in there except there was like two

497
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,020
Beautiful like the most beautiful like French couple I've ever seen

498
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:24,260
And I've seen a lot of French couples and they were just looking at everything and they seemed

499
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,380
so convinced that I couldn't help but think that they were - they just like - they lived

500
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,540
there and like that's their whole job.

501
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:37,580
And then when we were leaving, a guy who looked exactly like Shaggy like walked in and it

502
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,980
was like the most crazy scripted shit I've ever seen.

503
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,160
The guy walked in and he was like, "Hey, I just wanted to come check this place out because

504
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,860
this is the Scientology Museum, right?"

505
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,700
the guy behind the counter was like no we are not affiliated in any way with any

506
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,260
religious organization we are an activist group and a museum and he was

507
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,660
like awesome thank you so much and then he left but it was scary you got it they

508
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,020
have cameras. Scientology stuff in LA is so makes you so paranoid when I

509
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,300
walked when we walked about when I walked by the the I walked by the the

510
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,500
Psychiatry Museum like a few times and just there were all there always just

511
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,700
like people standing like right like there were construction workers just like

512
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,720
standing there like not like yeah just like you know just standing next to it

513
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,540
and it's like oh you got your cat calling

514
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:32,260
cuz yeah they have all those like front businesses around the media center right

515
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,220
that guy David he he lived right he lived in like let's feel as right near

516
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,380
they're like media production center and there's this there's a string of shops

517
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,500
that surround the media production center that they don't they aren't real

518
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,580
They're just like owned by Scientology. It's like a dry cleaner and a mechanic and you walk in and you're like, "Hey, I need my car worked on."

519
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,240
And they're like, "Oh, we can't. We don't actually do that."

520
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,640
And they're just there to serve as like a buffer between the media center and like people who want to like record,

521
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,040
you know, going clear to or whatever.

522
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,500
Yeah. Jesus Christ.

523
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,000
People like watching you over the counter.

524
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It fucking rocks, man. It's awesome.

525
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's so cool.

526
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,500
It's so funny. They just let it happen.

527
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:22,120
scariest thing I saw other than the giant vampire that I walked by the giant

528
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:31,420
vampire I shit myself yeah yeah vampire of LA Pierce no his name is Dracula he

529
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,180
lives in the Hollywood sign hmm he lives in the name is Dracula yeah he lives in

530
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,980
the D it's Dracula. We were guessing it's Dracula. Okay he hasn't said it. No just L. Ron Hubbard's

531
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:49,680
Winter Wonderland. Oh my god I forgot about that. That was so fucking weird. Yeah in like

532
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,980
in Hollywood. I was like a little bit away from the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum

533
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,020
though. Yeah. So like. So I don't know if I believe it or not. Yeah I don't know I thought

534
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,380
it was just one of those things. They had a Scientology themed like like Santa Christmas

535
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Park yeah and it just had like a quote from L Ron Hubbard that was like like

536
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,220
they hadn't opened it yet it was a very Christmas presents it was like and all

537
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:26,980
the little children of the world their Christmas goodies it's a part of a

538
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,900
larger work on Christmas yeah it fucking it was it was awesome definitely one of

539
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,100
highlights of walking through that godforsaken place. Oh my god, Hollywood, whatever that

540
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:44,300
thing was, that strip we walked on. Yeah, it's a nightmare dude. It's the worst place in America.

541
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,400
It sucks. I can't believe you're there, Pierce. It makes no sense. Yeah, I mean I can't be

542
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,500
here for much longer. Yeah, we gotta get, we're gonna, I'm gonna get you out of there.

543
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna pick you up. Put me out of my misery, man. Yeah, I'm coming.

544
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,300
So you're gonna move across the country?

545
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Yep.

546
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Yeah.

547
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,420
Well, I'm gonna move across the country, get him, and then he's gonna move across the country

548
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
again.

549
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
Yeah.

550
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,140
Well, now he can't come across the country because the Secret Service is blocking him.

551
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,500
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

552
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Yeah.

553
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I think, oh, god damn.

554
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
You're right.

555
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Yeah, I think I'm gonna move to Delaware.

556
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:26,500
And I'm gonna, yeah, hey guys, do you guys mind if I wear this Mechagodzilla costume

557
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
on the plane?

558
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
*laughter*

559
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
*laughter*

560
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Yeah, fuck.

561
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Yeah, that's all Pierce can say.

562
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Fuck.

563
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Yeah, I'm not allowed to comment on that.

564
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
You do not have the liberty to say anything else. You can just say fuck.

565
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
No, no.

566
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
That's the Secret Service.

567
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
You're allowed to say fuck.

568
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Yeah.

569
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
The Secret Service called me because I was using curse words.

570
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
*laughter*

571
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Have you been saying the F word and even the C word?

572
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
disturbing the people in the government, okay?

573
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
It's been really upsetting them.

574
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
You've been using disturbing language recently.

575
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Like the F word or the S word or even damn and hell.

576
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
We heard you say

577
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
F Trump

578
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
and honestly I, we have to take up

579
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
every threat. You wouldn't, you wouldn't believe

580
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
the kind of stuff I hear. Sometimes I hear

581
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
I hear F Trump, F Nancy Pelosi

582
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
F this, F that.

583
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
It's disgusting. Sometimes I've heard I want to

584
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
F Trump and that to me

585
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
is just a bridge too far.

586
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:46,420
or

587
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,900
this month's rent it's exactly this month's rent nice dude

588
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,660
congrats i can't get uh... unemployment or

589
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,620
uh... stimulus

590
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,140
i quit my job in december

591
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,620
and yeah that's right

592
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,540
yeah fuck you pat fuck you you're a bitch dude

593
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,060
broke bitch where's your money at

594
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,580
we get your money out that's why we need everyone to up their pay grade

595
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,300
we need someone to up their pledge to the filipino mr bean tier

596
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,020
yeah

597
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,780
filipino mr. beantier is i think three thousand dollars

598
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:24,260
we had somebody up their pledge like forty dollars a month

599
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,800
yeah that was insane

600
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,780
yeah such a mistake

601
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,940
what do you get for filipino mr. beantier?

602
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,700
I think we set it to be you don't even get the premium episodes

603
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,380
you don't get anything

604
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,460
yeah so if you want the episode it's three thousand five dollars because you have to subscribe

605
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,460
You just unlock every episode, you guys say "Thank you Filipino Mr. Bean" and you don't even say a name.

606
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,420
No, they know who they are.

607
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,020
I think if somebody's dropping $3,000 on the Filipino Mr. Bean tier,

608
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,700
they probably want to be anonymous anyway.

609
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,380
You don't want that coming up when you search your name.

610
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,680
Yeah.

611
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,820
Yeah, an employer is like, "It says here you're a Filipino Mr. Bean."

612
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:14,380
It says here you're subscribed, you pay $3,000 a month to a podcast so that they call you

613
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:21,380
you Filipino Mr. Bean, is this correct? Yes. Congratulations, you're a school bus driver.

614
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:30,300
Oh fuck. I'm so fucking tired. You're tired? Yeah. You should get on that NOS shit like

615
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:38,780
young Pierce. I was gonna get a Monster Zero for this but I didn't. But I don't know, I

616
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,700
went to bed at like 11 last night, I woke up at 5, fed the cats, and then went back to bed

617
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,540
and feel like, well...

618
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,200
- Wow. - That's awesome, man.

619
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,700
Let's call Paul and confirm.

620
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
(laughing)

621
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,420
- Let's call Paul, let's see what Paul has to say.

622
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,800
- I never, for some reason, I still have little kid brain,

623
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,420
and on my birthday and Christmas,

624
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,060
the night before, I can never sleep.

625
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,980
- Yeah.

626
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,500
- Yeah, I can't fall asleep until like 3 a.m.

627
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,460
on my birthday and Christmas.

628
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,420
I haven't done anything today.

629
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,900
Yeah, I'm just sitting, I'm giggling like a little girl

630
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,380
in my bed, going, "He he he he, it's my birthday!"

631
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,420
And then it turns 12 o'clock and I, and then I get more excited.

632
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,780
Yeah.

633
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,180
You start jumping up and down.

634
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:22,020
I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna read the poem that I wrote for Caleb's birthday now.

635
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
This is one of the sweetest things ever.

636
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,460
This poem is called the King Caleb.

637
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:26,860
Yes.

638
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,660
And it's for Caleb's 23rd birthday.

639
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,620
I'm going to sit back.

640
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:35,060
King Caleb is so funny and he has a lot of money.

641
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,700
Don't interrupt.

642
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,100
Okay.

643
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,660
I'm going to start over.

644
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,740
It's called King Caleb.

645
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,100
King Caleb is so funny.

646
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
And he has a lot of money.

647
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,100
He is handsome too, except his head looks like it's been stretched on the x-axis by three inches.

648
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Going viral with his challenges, Caleb has advantages.

649
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Like being...

650
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Like...

651
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Like being good at basketball.

652
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:08,100
And having the strength, speed, cunning, group skills, and head of a hammerhead shark.

653
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,460
King Caleb has a wife and fame, but what is up with Caleb's name?

654
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:20,320
You may not- you may think it's nothing special, but the etymology of Caleb can actually be

655
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,220
traced to "caliber", meaning the diameter of any circular body, as in, "Caleb's

656
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,720
skull is of a grossly wide caliber", as well as "caliper", as in, "I am going

657
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,560
to use a caliper to measure the width of Caleb's ear to his other ear", and the Arabic word

658
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:43,240
"Kalib" meaning mold, as in Caleb's mom's pussyhole is shaped like a rectangle, resulting in a

659
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,560
wide berth, no pun intended, in the mold, or "kalib", of Caleb's head.

660
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:59,840
Patrick is a prince, and Cameron is a royal clown, but today Caleb is the king of town.

661
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,120
So put on your kingly crown, the whole of which is shaped like a rectangle.

662
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,760
Wow. Happy birthday, Caleb. Thank you, Pierce. That was beautiful. I do have a big head.

663
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,920
Yeah, you look like a bald-headed baby. I do. One time, a friend of mine

664
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,520
had his barber went to the same gym as me and I guess his barber one day was

665
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,280
talking about, he was like, "This is fucking little white boy with the

666
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
biggest damn head I've ever seen in my gym.

667
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
*laughter*

668
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
And my friend was like,

669
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
"Is his name Caleb?"

670
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
And he was like, "I'll ask next time."

671
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
And he came up to me at the gym, he was like, "Is your name Caleb?"

672
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
*laughter*

673
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
And I was like, "Yeah." And he was like, "Okay."

674
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
And that was it. And I didn't know him for like

675
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
six months.

676
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Fuck, in my gym.

677
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
In my gym, yeah, in my own gym.

678
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Caleb's gym. Fuck. I was attacked in my own

679
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
gym for my head's shape and size.

680
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,800
Is that the gym you worked at in?

681
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,920
No, this was back, this was years ago.

682
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,040
This was when I had an even smaller body so my head looked even bigger.

683
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,840
Did I tell you when I applied to work at the gym that you quit, your boss said that you

684
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
did improv?

685
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Yes, that's awesome dude.

686
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:24,120
Your boss was like, "Well, I know you probably know Caleb through improv or something."

687
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:33,240
Yeah, that guy, he managed a gym and he had been, he used to be a UFC fighter, like, not

688
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,200
a UFC, just like a low level MMA fighter.

689
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,640
He used to be a UCB fighter, that's what he kept talking about.

690
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,840
He got punched in the face so many times that sometimes, he briefed me on this when I interviewed

691
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,520
there, he was like, "Sometimes I'll just be talking to you and I'll just start drooling

692
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,800
and not be able to hear what you're saying for a little bit.

693
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,320
So just bear with me.

694
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,580
And it would happen every day.

695
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,220
He'd be like, "Did you fold the towels?"

696
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,800
And then he'd just look at me like.

697
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,720
(laughing)

698
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,640
- Oh my God.

699
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,320
(laughing)

700
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,200
- For like 10 seconds.

701
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,240
And I'd have to be like, "Hey man, you there?"

702
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,520
He'd be like, "Yeah, sorry, I zoned out."

703
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
He called it zoning out.

704
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,760
(laughing)

705
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,720
- Those are called non-epileptic,

706
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,000
or no, yeah, they're called non-epileptic seizures, I think.

707
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
- Is that what that, oh yeah.

708
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,240
So I have talked about this on the podcast,

709
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,600
but I think it was very similar to the kid

710
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,000
who I went to school with that would,

711
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,680
when he laughed, he would have a non-epileptic seizure,

712
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,400
and I would just spend all day

713
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,480
trying to make him have a seizure

714
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,220
until they had to separate me from him.

715
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,200
It was similar, but his was just like,

716
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,520
if he had to remember where the laundry detergent was,

717
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,800
he would just start drooling.

718
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,240
- Thinking longer than a three-word sentence.

719
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,840
- Yeah, he would just absolutely lose his brain.

720
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
It was awesome dude.

721
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,720
He would have to trick his brain into thinking about numbers.

722
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Yeah, he was a math genius somehow.

723
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,080
You should have worked there Pat.

724
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,680
You would have continued the long line of fat people working at the front desk.

725
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,280
No, I tanked the interview so bad.

726
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
What'd you say?

727
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,040
He said something and then I said like, "I'm not going to tell you I'm going to be the

728
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,600
best employee in the world."

729
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
God, you suck dude.

730
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Dude, I can't do job interviews.

731
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
What is wrong with you?

732
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I don't know.

733
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
I'm going to ask you something you said.

734
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,680
Well, you know, when I was 13, I screen printed this thing and all the teachers, you just

735
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
started telling a story.

736
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,960
Yeah, I'll just say right now, I love to jack off at work.

737
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Yeah.

738
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
It's just like one of my perks.

739
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Straight up.

740
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,400
If I see a fat person in this gym, I'm going to call him a fatty.

741
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,960
It's one of my call of duty perks is I can jack off at work.

742
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,440
It's in my load out.

743
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,240
And I will not switch my load out for you.

744
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,480
And I will not switch my load out.

745
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
It is very tactical.

746
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
I'm gonna take my loadout on your towels.

747
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,480
[Laughter]

748
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Yeah, my two perks is I jack off at work and I steal money whenever I see it, no matter what.

749
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Because I'm trying to buy a new loadout.

750
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Yeah, that means that I can't take any cigarette breaks.

751
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
That's one of the perks that I'm choosing not to use.

752
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,480
So you're welcome.

753
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,480
And I also won't hit on any customers.

754
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,200
I roll up the dollar like a cigarette and I smoke it in the gym.

755
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,160
There was a, at that gym there was a panic button under the desk.

756
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,600
You had a man hour button?

757
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it would lock all the doors.

758
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,720
No it would just call the police basically.

759
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,640
It was in central square, it was right down the street, like the police station.

760
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,000
And there was this one girl who every time a homeless person came in asking to use the

761
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,600
bathroom she would press the panic button.

762
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,040
And the cops would just come in every day and just be like, "Please, just let him use the

763
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,280
bathroom or tell him to leave."

764
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,040
To be like, "I was scared.

765
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
I was scared for my life.

766
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,760
He's asking me to use the bathroom."

767
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Yeah.

768
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,640
Well, I mean, what else would you do?

769
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,560
Just shoot him in the head.

770
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
"I can't.

771
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,880
Can I use the bathroom?"

772
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
That's the other button.

773
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
It activates the turret.

774
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
That's the real panic button.

775
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
The century gun.

776
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
The hobo turret.

777
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,400
It shoots the sandwich out the door.

778
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
That's our bum laser.

779
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,400
*laughter*

780
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Yeah, there's like ten buttons for just different weapons.

781
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Yeah, it just slices him in different layers like Resident Evil.

782
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Is that a bum or a hobo? I don't know if he's the bum laser or the hobo grenade launcher.

783
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Sir, please identify yourself so I know which weapon to dispatch you with.

784
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Are you a bum or a hobo?

785
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Did you get here via boxcar?

786
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
We need to know.

787
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Or you just ugly

788
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,480
We have a big we have a big makeup

789
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:59,120
But there's no cure for what you have

790
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,240
You doing inside ciggies is that what this is like I live alone I get to do this

791
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,040
Your landlord says okay

792
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,040
He don't know. He don't know. What he don't know, he don't know.

793
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Yeah, weird. Now he does. Patrick's your landlord.

794
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Yeah. That's right. That's right.

795
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Oh my god.

796
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Cut that. Don't.

797
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,040
I'll cut that. Yeah.

798
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,040
I knew a guy who had his landlord as his Snapchat username.

799
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,040
That's funny. Yeah. Pretty good.

800
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
That is good.

801
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
I'm not going to say it.

802
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
Why not say it?

803
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Come on.

804
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Let's all add him on Snapchat.

805
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
No.

806
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Why not?

807
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,840
I used to have a crazy, when I was a kid, we had a crazy Greek landlord, this old lady,

808
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:57,440
she would walk in while we were there, she would just walk in unannounced and start telling

809
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,960
us our house was dirty and sometimes she would just use the bathroom.

810
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,520
She sucked, man.

811
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
She sounds awful.

812
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,600
She was one of the worst landlords I've had.

813
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
She would use the bathroom.

814
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Yeah, one time my landlord came in to use my bathroom and it was when a friend was staying

815
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,120
with me and the place was just absolutely fucked.

816
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,480
Just trash and ash everywhere.

817
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,840
And he was like, "I had some coffee and it went right through me.

818
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Can I use your bathroom?"

819
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:34,060
He used my bathroom and then a day later he called me and he was like, "I raised the rent

820
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,700
on everyone by $25 but you are still paying me the old rent and I was like

821
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,700
you didn't tell me he was like I put mail in everyone's mailbox I don't know

822
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,380
how you didn't get it and also Pierce there is no maids we don't have maids

823
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,340

824
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,700
the direction of him saying like well you don't have to pay the new price

825
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,540
because you let me demolish your toilet no no he roasted me for having a messy

826
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,580
apartment. God damn it. He had the guts to shit in your toilet and tell you off? Yeah.

827
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:16,220
To do a coffee shit? Yeah he did a coffee run. Oh my god he did a coffee run in my toilet.

828
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:25,180
God damn dude. That sucks. That sucks right guys? That's seriously shit. That's ass. I'm

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,860
But what have you just been stuck inside? Are you're not doing any any work anymore?

831
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,380
No, I I know I'm not doing any work anymore

832
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,100

00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,980
Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Yeah, how do you know are you playing it on the emulator emulators for like PlayStation is so confusing and annoying. Yeah

836
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660
That's a simulator

Yeah, I got a special edition Metal Gear Solid 4 ps3 from the mall

838

00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,840
What is there isn't there a new one that you're not you're not snake or something you're just like four guys

842
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,380
That's like you're looking at her be in the amazing final fantasy. Yeah

843
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,680
They're all the same game to me any PlayStation. I've been playing death stranding

844
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,540
It's pretty good. Yeah, it doesn't seem fun

845
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,760
It's it's got a fun story and like it's just a nice like zone out game. I mean like yeah for me

846
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,640
I can't imagine picking it back up again after beating it, but it was it was good to play. Yeah, it's not it's good

847
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
I gotta get it.

848
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,280
It's a good game for a guy who's like bad at games and likes movies, which is me.

849
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,280
Yeah.

850
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,280
I'm the opposite.

851
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
I hate movies.

852
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
And you're great at games.

853
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,560
I'm great at games.

854
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,640
Yeah, you wouldn't like Death Stranding if you don't like movies.

855
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,080
It's just like all cutscenes and then walking.

856
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
I love those games.

857
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
I love like Heavy Rain.

858
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
Yeah, you would not play it.

859
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,000
And what's the horror one?

860
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Until Dawn.

861
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
That's a good game.

862
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It's great.

863
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm human.

864
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I really like Heavy Rain.

865
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000

00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,260
Yeah, that's a game that you play every day.

00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,180
I'm not modeled after--

914
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,660
Bald Baby's Adventure.

915
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,660
No, it's not a game.

916
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,300
The Tall Baby's Quest.

917
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,740

924
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,100
no already

925
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,740
on their plate you play baby they can't make the game until you die because they

926
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,740
one of the ending of the game. It has to be based on a true story.

927
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,220
Uh huh. No, it started out as a baby. They should make games that are based on a true

928
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,460
story and you can't deviate at all from what happened. So...

929
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,260
That's kind of like the JFK. The what?

930
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,100
Have you ever played that? No.

931
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,940
The JFK reloaded? Are you JFK or are you the shooter?

932
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,580
You're Lee Harvey Oswald and you have to recreate the JFK assassination as...

933
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,140
Then that's not based on a true story because that's not how it happens.

934
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,740
Yeah, you have to do it as accurate as possible.

935
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:21,140
Do you think Lee Harvey Oswald got New Game+ from doing that?

936
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:27,140
Yeah, he hit him in the head and it said "Achievement Unlocked" on the bottom of the screen.

937
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:34,140
Yeah, and he started with infinite ammo as some other guy.

938
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,140
Pretty good.

939
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,140
That was his New Game+.

940
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,740
He upgraded in every sense.

941
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,740
Chris Dorn was the new Z-Ball version.

942
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,780
New skin unlocked.

943
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,540
And then he didn't get a new one though.

944
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,620
And he won't.

945
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,420
He doesn't get another chance.

946
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,540
Jack Ruby got Kingslayer.

947
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,540
Yeah.

948
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,260
Didn't they kill Jack Ruby too?

949
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,500
Yeah, they killed Jack Ruby in Prisoner of Jail or something.

950
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,140
Dude, they absolutely killed everyone!

951
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,700
They killed everybody in that shit, dude.

952
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,220
It was fucked, dude.

953
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,220
They killed, uh...

954
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,460
They killed MLK, they killed JFK, they killed Ruby Tuesday, they killed...

955
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,980
They got 'em all.

956
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,380
They killed, uh, BFG.

957
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,540
Yeah, they killed the big fucking giant.

958
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,420
Yeah.

959
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,060
No, he's friendly.

960
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,940
With a BFG.

961
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,980
Yeah, they killed...

962
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,380
Wow, I'm killing the BFG with the BFG, and I'm at... I'm at BFG.

963
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,060

00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:46,900
Yeah

968
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,900
That's a good item

969
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,200
They should put BF Wangs

970
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,400
BF Wangs

971
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,740
*laughter*

972
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,740
Big fuckin' thing

973
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,540
At PF Changs

974
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,640
They should serve BF Wangs

975
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,980
Uh huh

976
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,580
What is it?

977
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,380
Buffalo Wangs

978
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,380
Buffalo Wangs

979
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,580
*laughter*

980
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,620
You're right, they should serve that with a Z at the end.

981
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,120
Uh-huh.

982
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,580
[Laughter]

983
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,060
I only had P.F. Chang's once and I vomited.

984
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,980
Was it the one in Boston?

985
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,580
You used to work there? No, it was in Charlotte.

986
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,940
Yeah, I worked at the Boston one.

987
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,380
Oh, did you? The one in Seaport?

988
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,060
Yeah, that's a P.F. Chang's, right?

989
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,380
Yeah, it's the one with the big horse statue outside where they modeled half the penis.

990
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,380
Wait, yeah, that P.F. Chang's is a P.F. Chang's, right?

991
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,180
Yeah, that one is, yeah.

992
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,980
They all have horses. That's the way.

993
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,580
No, they're lions. They model half...

994
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,580
Oh, no, there's a horse.

995
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,580
Yeah, there's a horse.

996
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,580
There's always a horse.

997
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,580
There's always a horse.

998
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,580
And they have half of the penis modeled.

999
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,580
It goes half the shaft up.

1000
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's pretty funny.

1001
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,580

1002
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,580
It's not quite the Denver Airport thing.

1003
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,580
It's penis 50% Chang's.

1004

00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,260
- One weird multicultural mural.

1016
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,500
- Yeah, there is one weird one.

1017
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,020
- Yeah.

1018
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,860
- I think the same artist, whoever did that mural,

1019
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,900
I saw a painting from him once,

1020
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,500
like a print of a painting from him

1021
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,660
in a skate shop for some reason.

1022
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,380
And I remember it was the Denver Airport muralist

1023
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,180
'cause I looked up the signature

1024
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,060
'cause it was so insane to me.

1025
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,220
But it was a person, it was a body

1026
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,660
in like a lotus stance.

1027
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,340
And then it was all of the person's chakras were identified.

1028
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,580
And for each chakra,

1029
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,820
there was like a little vignette next to it.

1030
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,100
And I don't remember all of them,

1031
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,500
but one of them obviously was Bob Marley.

1032
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,100
One of them was 9/11.

1033
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,500
And then one of them was just a family watching TV.

1034
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,340
- So sick.

1035
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,660
- It was like $600.

1036
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,180
- Did I ever talk about that crazy statue I saw in the mall

1037
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:33,120
