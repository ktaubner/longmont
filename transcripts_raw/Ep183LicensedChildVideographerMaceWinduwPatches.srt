Caleb's very, very sick.

19
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,200
He has a new type of COVID where his butt can't breathe

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,800
because his underwear is too tight.

21
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,800
- He was in Boston and he ate like the shell of a coin.

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,160
- Yeah, like a two week old lobster roll.

23
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,680
- Oh yeah, dude, I love this.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,880

28
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,400

It's me, Caleb Pitts.

34
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Now, I just love having diarrhea and not recording.

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh, it's my favorite.

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I love eating doo-doo.

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I got diarrhea, you know how?

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Eating my own poop.

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
I'll be pooping from the front and throwing up from the back.

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Everything's all backwards where I'm from.

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:35,800
I live in a swimming pool. I live in a swimming pool and I'm not allowed to go in because I have active diarrhea.

42
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,400
My landlord makes me sit outside.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Yeah, my Caleb voice is, it's just if you live below like the 40th latitude to me.

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Yeah.

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
You just immediately...

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Of course.

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,400
[Caleb makes weird noises]

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Does that sound good or bad?

49
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Deep throat voice.

50
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,940
Yeah, you immediately sound like you suck pee pee.

51
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,200
You got a dick in your whatever.

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,080
You got a pee pee in your mouth.

53
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Yep.

54
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Pee pee in your mouth.

55
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,800
I was also in Boston over the weekend.

56
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,240
I didn't get to go.

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,600
While I was waiting, while me and my girlfriend were waiting for the Amtrak in South Station,

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,640
we were sitting down at like a table by the like Obonpan.

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
And the what?

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
The Obonpan.

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Obonpan.

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Are you familiar?

63
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Obonpain?

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,140

65
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,040
I forgot it's Boston yeah I'll bomb

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,960

67
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,480
French sitting next to a like a middle

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,440
age couple who's on like a date yeah

69
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,960
like a station that's probably so

70
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,760
there's nothing there yeah dude it's so

71
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,240
so look at they were having a yeah they

72
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,200
were having a conversation this was like

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
one of the my the best Boston guys ever

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,040
yeah so on a date in South Station you

75
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,480
have to imagine it was his idea because the woman seemed pretty normal, but he

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,600
was like terminally Boston and it was at one point. They know me at the tavern in

77
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,040
the square. Yeah, exactly. At one point she was like she said something about

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,000
like having epilepsy and he was like epilepsy what's that? What's epilepsy?

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,400
And she was like well I haven't had a seizure in a long time but epilepsy is

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
like when you have seizures and he's like oh a seizure so what do you see a

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:35,160
vision of something I see you over there I love you like ask who like talk like

82
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,200
that where where they're like when they ask questions it's always at you yeah

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,480
it's like it's like see just what are you doing yeah I don't what did I do I

84
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,160
I don't think you can. Why are you mad at me? I can't control that about myself.

85
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,880
He was so fucking good. Then they were talking about like religion and stuff and of course

86
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,600
you're saying like, "Yeah, I was raised super Catholic. I'm super Catholic."

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,840
And then she started like saying something about the Bible. I don't remember how they

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,400
got on the topic. She's something about like healing lepers being in the Bible or something,

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,240
right? And he's like, "Oh, I don't know about any of that stuff. I just have an adventure book."

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,960
That's so fucking sick. Oh my God.

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,560
So cool, dude. He also told me that he got into Harvard on a full scholarship for sports.

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,560
What?

93
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,840
Yeah. Oh my God.

94
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,320
No.

95
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,280
That's what he said.

96
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,120
Big Papi signed my adventure Bible. You want to take a look at that?

97
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,560
He was so fucking sick, dude.

98
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,320
I also like the idea of you at this, with your girlfriend, just listening to this conversation.

99
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,160
You're back completely away from her and just like, it's like, no, this is sort of

100
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,960
of what I'm doing here right now.

101
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,800
- It was literally so--

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,340
- You're like you have a newspaper,

103
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,500
like you're spying on the date.

104
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,400
- It was even more awkward than that

105
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,160
'cause we were sitting, like me and my girlfriend

106
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,440
were sitting across from each other at the table

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,000
and then on the chair next to us,

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,240
they were sitting across from each other.

109
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,080
- Oh yeah.

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,000
- So we were not talking at all

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,680
'cause we were both just listening intently

112
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
to this conversation going on.

113
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,340
- Of course, of course.

114
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,180
- So we were just looking at each other

115
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,560
and every once in a while just looking at the people

116
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,060
and looking back at each other.

117
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah, and kind of like, yeah,

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,720
like peeking out from behind the luggage

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,560
be like oh my god. At one point she also started talking, they had a crazy

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,480
conversation, it was a crazy date conversation. I wonder if they met at South Station,

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,360
I wonder if this is like an internet thing. I couldn't tell if they were like

122
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,200
went there on a date or if they like met and like he started like he crawled out

123
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,360
from underneath South Station. At some point, at one point she also started

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,400
talking about Anne Frank's diary and how like it was like edited out that she was

125
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:42,920
gay or whatever. Oh yeah. And the guy got really quiet. He was just like, "Oh, a lot of things

126
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,060
I want to say about that but I'm not going to say them." He was jumping to interrupt

127
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:57,280
her to say his thing and now he's just like, "Hmm." Oh, yeah, that's gross. Dude, I wish

128
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,960
that that couple would win. She was like, "Portuguese?" Anything to change the topic.

129
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,560
yeah who's that bless him who's that yeah who's that and she has seizures yeah who

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,640
is that who is that who's that maybe that's why I just didn't know who she

131
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,080
was or he like it is like oh and Frick Oh and friend line one of my

132
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,360
delightful I blind one oh the one who picked up the ice the underground

133
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:36,960
railroad. He's just like sitting here. Did I go to school with her? Do we both know her?

134
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,640
Oh yeah, Anne Frank. Oh, Sister Anne Frank. Sister Anne Frank, yeah. She hit me with a

135
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,040
Arula great ass.

136
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,340
Not no offense.

137
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,640
She's a whack my fucking hands with Arula.

138
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,940
That's so I would we've definitely talked about it

139
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,240
before.

140
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,140
It's so funny that like every fucking townie in Boston has

141
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,940
some story about just like, oh, yeah, the harshest abuse ever

142
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,340
fucking.

143
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,740
Yeah, like ever fucking like done to a child by just some

144
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
it's always like it's all they always want to us.

145
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,240
They're always went to a school that's called like, yeah,

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,960
like like Our Lady of the Afflicted by the Faith. Yeah. They were like

148
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,440
they're like, "Yeah, but it was fine because we pranked her back." Yeah, we put a thumbtack under her chair.

149
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Yeah, we covered the chalk in paint so it didn't show colors on the blackboard.

crazy they made that kid eat so much food yeah damn that honestly they should

170
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,620
have done that to Bruce yeah that was fucked up what they did to him that cake

171
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,280
looks so fucking good though I really did oh my god I think I think about that

172
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,100
cake every time that I like that's probably the best of cake has ever

173
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,460
looked yeah movie that's but that's I hate cake that's the best of cake has

174
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,000
ever looked. Every time I see a cake I want to eat that cake. I have to imagine

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,580
I'm eating that cake to eat the cake. You walk into a bakery and just have like an

176
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,860
episode. That's a beautiful metaphor for porn addiction.

177
00:09:51,860 --> 00:10:02,900
Yeah every time I have sex I just hope it's that cake. I was hoping it was Miss Trunchful.

178
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:10,140
know that cake is a lie? Wait is it actually? Did you know that that cake is a lie? I never

179
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,060
played Portal which is a huge blind spot for me. I heard they actually killed all the kids

180
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,300
on Matilda's set. They did. The real daddy kid that died on Matilda's set. I heard they

181
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,100
actually threw that kid out the window by her pigtails. No shit. Yeah. I heard it was

182
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,460
actually a really fucked up set. You know that's because the kids don't have unions.

183
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,300
They don't have kid unions. It's a problem. Man hold on going back that cake in Portal

184
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,100
also looked at the table to look at it

185
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,300
as the best the case is that we're going to rank we're talking about case

186
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,100
right now what other case are there are many wedding cakes are really good the

187
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,200

188
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,700

189
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,660
the

190
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,540
your and i don't like the post-it notes

191
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,980

193
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,320
is walking you walking into McDonald's and looking up the menu and starting to

194
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,140
cry because you think you have to eat everything

195
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:16,340
looking at the McDonald's menu and being like a twelve course meal.

196
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,540
This is all this is all prefix right, yeah,

197
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,500
gonna be like okay yeah all right here's my money okay okay yeah just go to it

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,880
how much does it cost to buy the whole McDonald's menu hmm I'm sure that I could

199
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,040
find that on Google right yeah that's so well I mean I'm sure it's like more we

200
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,980
can find we could we can stop the episode and then do the man do that do

201
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,960
that and then come back and try to record after doing that yeah we eat the

202
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,720
whole McDonald's menu we bring the whole McDonald's challenge yeah yeah I feel

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,960
like I feel like if I was ever I feel like I would fast for a week to do that

204
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,840
to eat the whole McDonald well no because if you fast for a week your stomach is

205
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:13,200
gonna get smaller okay so in in May 2017 the answer was a hundred and ninety four

206
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,160
dollars and ninety cents that's fucking Biden's inflation yeah go on how much is

207
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,160
is it now? I don't know. That's just the most that's way less

208
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,560
than I thought it would be $194.

209
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,160
Buying the whole McDonald's menu would cost like $2,000.

210
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,960
I don't know.

211
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,660
We're forgetting.

212
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah, that's a small medium and large.

213
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
You get every size of everything.

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
We're also forgetting the Golden McNuggets.

215
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,760
Those are really expensive.

216
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,760
go to the McDonald's and say, I want the golden McNuggets. And

217
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,160
then the guy has to like go to the back and talk to the

218
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,160
manager. Then the manager has to like go to the vault and

219
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,760
unlock. Yeah, yeah. Well, I heard you can only get those in

220
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,160
Dubai. Yeah, it's true. That's one of those international.

221
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,660
Yeah, that's what I mean. There's a lot of articles where

222
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,060
Steve Harvey is just like when I go to Dubai, I'm always eating

223
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,360
the golden McNugget.

224
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,060
Just be like that's maybe you see that might be Steve Harvitt's

225
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,460
favorite Dubai meal may shock you. That's one of the funniest foods to be like to

232
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:55,380
You're so you're so like sweaty and gross from working in the kitchen you can see the sauce is a different color when it leaves your

233
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:04,580
It just smells by that area I keep doing that keep squeezing the shit I like

234
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,080
The idea of like of like like gently putting salt on and you're like you're wearing a long-sleeve shirt

235
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,180
You do it and it runs down the sleeve and then like filters

236
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,100
Assistance assistance

237
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,960
We drain it out of there put it on the prize. Oh my god. We would kill opening a salt-based style restaurant

238
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,020
Like doing like opening like a

239
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,460
Chick-fil-a or something I feel like I feel like really easy to make a shit ton of money opening chick-fil-a

240
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,860
Chick-fil-a will know chick-fil-a is cheap to open, but then they take a bunch of your

241
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:48,020
Write like 10 essays yeah, but I think it's only like how much you'd love a thousand bucks. Yeah, okay?

242
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,300
Yeah, yeah, it'll write like all this stuff like oh

243
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,100
I just writing like your whole chick-fil-a essay like yeah, I would bend down and I would suck

244
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,220
Yeah, I would let Christ fuck fuck me. I would let Christ pipe me down

245
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,560
I would let Christ bust it. Why I would let I would let Christ squirt his hot nut into my

246
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,100
One chick-fil-a, I would let him breathe right into my prostate

247
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,820
Shit I would let Christ use his magic ET finger

248
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:23,900
Making me nut 1000 nuts. Oh my god leaders of not Christ turn my come in the wine

249
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh my god, I would be I would be fucking his renaissance. Halo - yeah, I'm a woman by the way. This is not gay

250
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm a woman in this scenario. Not I'm not not trans. I'm not I'm just an actual is a woman

251
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,740
I'm not trans. I'm a woman in this scenario

252
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:50,180
Yeah, I I think I'm not gay either. Yeah, this is the most this is the most

253
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,020
heterosexual Christ sexual

254
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,320
I'm writing like a letter to Chick-fil-a and just title it titling it if I were a woman

255
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:06,860
Yeah

256
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,300
Fine let me and let me tell you chick-fil-a. I would be letting the Lord give me a different type of my pleasure. Mm-hmm

257
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,740
No, I know that this is a scenario where I was a sighted female at birth

258
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,020
which that means and they just

259
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,540
explain everything and realizing you're writing to Chick-fil-a and being like,

260
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,820
but I don't agree with any of that. Yeah, but that stuff not for me.

261
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,220
I made that up. The footnotes are going to cover this. Yeah,

262
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,940
yeah. You'll see. All the footnotes are like, but straight up, I think this is bad.

263
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,860
I mean, footnotes that are like, I will let Christ fill me with his nut and then like a

264
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,140
little one and you like flip to the end of it and it says like, the nut will be hot.

265
00:16:50,020 --> 00:17:00,980
I would let Jesus Christ go fucking buck wild on my ass and it's like, "My ass will be good.

266
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,980
My ass will be hot.

267
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
It will be sexy."

268
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,500
My ass is a woman's ass and my name is Jeanette.

269
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Yeah, my name is Jeanette.

270
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:17,740
Yeah, like a footnote after that being like, "Jeanette is 5'4", 36, 24, 36, blonde, beautiful."

271
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Yeah.

272
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,380
This is all written from the perspective of Jeanette. Yeah, yeah, oh man. Yeah, I'd

273
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:32,020
love to write a Joycean essay. Tight hold the exact size of Jesus's cock. Here's a

274
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:46,380
picture. It fits like a sweater on a snake. That would be so funny if like, oh man,

275
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,700
and just like having a,

276
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,780
well have you seen those Chick-fil-A commercials now

277
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,500
where they have like the,

278
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,060
like it's like how great their service is?

279
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,580
- I've never seen a commercial.

280
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,700
- I think I've seen one.

281
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,220
I think I saw one Chick-fil-A commercial recently

282
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,740
but it was in Spanish.

283
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,580
It came on Hulu.

284
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,340
- Yeah, I haven't like seen commercials in a while.

285
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,940
- Yeah, I saw, I think I saw them on Hulu.

286
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,780
- You gotta tap into Hulu.

287
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,620
- Should I check this shit out?

288
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,900
- Hulu, that shit will blow your mind.

289
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,820
- Yeah.

290
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,980
- Well, Hulu, I didn't used to have Hulu with ads

291
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,380
but then they made it more expensive

292
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,540
So now you always have ads.

293
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,020
Yeah.

294
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,980
But what's the Chick-fil-A commercial?

295
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,540
There's like these Chick-fil-A commercials

296
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,180
where they're like, all they talk about

297
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,860
is just how great their service is.

298
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,300
So it's just like this one.

299
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,140
Oh, you know what it was?

300
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,860
It was like a commercial where it's like

301
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,380
a woman who had recorded this like employee

302
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,580
and it was like the singing Chick-fil-A employee

303
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,060
or some shit.

304
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,720
And it's like, I think, honestly,

305
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,800
I think it was just a show that Chick-fil-A hires gay people.

306
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
- Right, yeah.

307
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,600
- It was like, it's just like a crazy PR move for them.

308
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,440
- That's funny they have like a

309
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
don't ask, don't tell thing with that too.

310
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,120
They're never gonna say it, but it's like, look.

311
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,040
- We know, we know Travis is our fabulous employee.

312
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,800
- Yeah, right, yeah.

313
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, we know he's wonderful, we know he's on fleek.

314
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760

315
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,280
Like can you guys cut us a fucking--

316
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,600
- A message from the CEO.

317
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Look at this thing we brought in.

318
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Can you give us a break?

319
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
And because we love him so much,

320
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600

321
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
fabulous badge all the time

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
whenever he works at our store.

323
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
The most fabulous

324
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
employee at Chick-fil-A.

325
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
We are giving him the privilege

326
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
of being constantly

327
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
identified. Just like

328
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
the idea of Chick-fil-A.

329
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Just the idea of Chick-fil-A.

330
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Just like being like, okay, we'll let

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:59,240
this person good we're just gonna okay yeah this is a pink triangle bed people

332
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:07,280
who are serving we have another thing for that yeah we are so excited to debut

333
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,200
our fleek badge program. When you work at Cracker Barrel you get a you get you like

334
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,400
stars. Do they do that? Yeah I was only a one star I didn't work there too long but

335
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,240
there's like you know you get like you get stars like you're a general. Yeah

336
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,440
yeah that thing that's like such an ingenious way to break people's morale

337
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,320
down. Oh no no the Cracker Barrel kitchen is the saddest place in the world. Yeah no it's

338
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,980
but you see that when you see that like at grocery stores too where you'll see

339
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,700
like an old person walking around with like a 12 year like it says their name

340
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,460
and then 12 years basket yeah it's so it's so nasty it's oh yeah it's so

341
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,820
ingenious well yeah cuz yeah it does this like it does this because because

342
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:56,060
there's the way that people people for not great reasons think of you as scum

343
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,220
if you work there yeah and then then it's like you should be proud of how

344
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,340
long you've worked at this place. It's such a smart move.

345
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,180
It's genius. I'm going to do that. We should do that. Yeah. I'm going to do that for my

346
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,940
neighbors. You flip next door to me. You could do that to me and Jubio for how long we've

347
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,420
been working with you guys. It's true.

348
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,700
You have one more star than Jubio. I know. I order over him every day.

349
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,620
You just say, "Oh yeah, they're paying for my vacation."

350
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,880
(laughing)

351
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
- And then once both of you guys level up,

352
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,040
we'll need to hire a third person.

353
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,880
- Absolutely.

354
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,280
- I can't remember what the fucking,

355
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,300
the stars meant at Cracker Barrel though.

356
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,140
- Yeah.

357
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,960
- 'Cause it was like--

358
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,240
- You had one star, did that just--

359
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,280
- That's 'cause I just started working there.

360
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,600
Actually, I never got my star,

361
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,680
'cause you're supposed to get an apron that has the star.

362
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,520
- You were zero stars.

363
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,920
- I think I quit before that happened.

364
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
- You were zero stars, wow.

365
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,760
- Dude, I was a dishwasher too,

366
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,040
they were putting me on,

367
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
I had to do lunch rushes and shit,

368
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,820
Like there was one time I came in and there was like six bus tubs

369
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,860
lining on like lined up on the floor and someone's like, Oh,

370
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,980
thank God you're here. Yeah. Oh, cool. I'm going to quit.

371
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,520
If you ask me, nobody working at Cracker Barrel should have any stars.

372
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,460
It should be everyone's zero.

373
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Every time you put the fight that broke out in the kitchen. I don't know.

374
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,060
Yeah. There's like a fat bald guy fought a guy.

375
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,580
Well what that's come on.

376
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,100
- You copped out so hard there.

377
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,940
- I copped out hard 'cause then I realized

378
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,740
that the story wasn't that interesting.

379
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
- That sounds cool.

380
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,180
- What was the fight about?

381
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,820
- The fight happened during the breakfast rush.

382
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,260
- Okay, so we had a fist fight.

383
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,500
- Yeah, it was a fist fight during the breakfast rush.

384
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,340
- What was it over?

385
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,420
Was it over a girl?

386
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,780
- I don't remember, I just saw one guy,

387
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,500
the shortest guy in the kitchen,

388
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,040
fighting the biggest guy in the kitchen,

389
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,060
who was bald and had little black holes for teeth.

390
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,220
- So they were trying to reenact the biblical myth.

391
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,060
- Yeah.

392
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:59,940
and he screamed like you do again you fatball fuck I'll fucking kill you and I

393
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,020
think I was imagining I'm imagining the little guy just running back and forth

394
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:11,780
like the giant boss fight in Resident Evil 4 running through his legs and

395
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,220
trying to stun him he can climb up his body yeah yeah yeah the problem was that

396
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,140
that the big guy found his weak spot.

397
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,580
So he was trying to find his,

398
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,460
he was like, I'm gonna find your weak spot now.

399
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,260
- Yeah, his prostate, they were doing crazy things.

400
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,380
- Yo, that's a perfect spot to hit during a fight.

401
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,220
If you can get your fist up your opponent's butt

402
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,100
and hit him right in the prostate.

403
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,620
- Will not shrink. - Glowing red.

404
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,380
Glowing red boss weak spot.

405
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,660
- Once you're above a certain height and a certain weight,

406
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,700
you get a glowing red thing on your back

407
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,740
that's your weak spot.

408
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,620
Like that's how we evolve.

409
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,940
It's like, okay, you're too big,

410
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,420
need to have a weak spot. So that's what happens. So that big guy probably had one.

411
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:58,380
My only other co-worker there, that day at least, was a 65-year-old man named Buster.

412
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Whoa.

413
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,700
There was four people working at Cracker Barrel that day?

414
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Yeah.

415
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,500
Like, oh, it was just me and him at a working dish.

416
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,940
Okay. You were just like, yeah, there was four of us. Nobody was serving.

417
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,940
No, you know what I mean.

418
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,940
The only other person in the dish pit.

419
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Alright, cool.

420
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
I think I've talked about Buster on here before.

421
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,940
First day I was working there

422
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
it was my birthday.

423
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,940
My 19th birthday.

424
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

425
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
It doesn't matter. It was my birthday.

426
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,940
He was teaching me how to take the

427
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,940
trash out.

428
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
Oh, did you have trouble with that beforehand?

429
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Before Buster showed you how to do it?

430
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Yeah.

431
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
ever done it before.

432
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Yeah, right.

433
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
It was his first time.

434
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,780
Well, no, he was telling me how to like, because there's like some system where you like, he's

435
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,540
like, "You gotta tie the bags like this."

436
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,740
And he's putting the bag, like he empties one out and then he's like putting another

437
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,620
one in and he's like, "See, you put it on like this.

438
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,300
Kind of like putting on a rubber.

439
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:04,140
Hey, this trash can's almost as big as me.

440
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,940
I wish I was that big."

441
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,940
You're just not responding, yeah.

442
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,140
I actually don't wish I was that big. He like fucking went through the thought

443
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,700
process of like, "Oh what if I had a penis that was the size of like a trash barrel

444
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:27,340
that is meant to hold like probably a ton of grits?"

445
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,420
Like an actual ton of grits. How is putting a trash bag on anything...

446
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,700
You put it in.

447
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,700
I was he may well, what if like he's the only like guy in the

448
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,260
world that use dental dams?

449
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,660
The guy's name was Buster. Yeah, like he had some money, rolled

450
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,820
his own cigarettes and kept them in an old Winston box. And I

451
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,460
don't know how long he had that Winston box, though. Oh, yeah,

452
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,820
that's true. I guess that is pretty crazy. Yeah. But it's

453
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,700
still cool, though. Yeah, it's cool to be that dirty. I hope.

454
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,220
yeah yeah I when I'm old dirty old guys kick ass oh they so I hope I just get you

455
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,380
close to you I smell weird yeah yeah sound memes are amazing if you're a

456
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:22,460
dirty old guy I want to sound like a lawnmower when I'm I've had 65 I've had

457
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,740
that like the type of when I worked at the liquor store I see you would see a

458
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,020
bunch of the type of old guy who would hand me like money that was literally

459
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,380
covered like in dirt.

460
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,620
(laughing)

461
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,460
As if he was like storing it like underground

462
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,020
before he walked into the store.

463
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,860
- Yeah, it's so cool.

464
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,060
- It's so sick.

465
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,860
- Yeah, there's just like a, there's like some step,

466
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,020
there's like, I guess what it is is that we haven't

467
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,100
figured out that guys when they're older than 35

468
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,580
or something, you just start to produce dirt

469
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,420
and grime and like--

470
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,260
- You do.

471
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,100
- Like it's a like pig--

472
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,100
- You don't have that step in your like hygiene,

473
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,380
it's just gonna grow.

474
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,220
Yeah, I have no choice. There's something it's either that or you do something like you have some crazy private secret

475
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,740
If you're like a well manicured man in his 40s, oh, yeah

Killed a guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like it's like why isn't your dirt sack working? What did you do your dirt go? Yeah

477
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,140

Yeah, no just someone unlike like someone walking out of like sacks fit that yeah

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,520
I'll be here all night.

488
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,360
- You know what it is?

489
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,960
It's also, I think, the amount of dirt you have

490
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,760
is the amount, like the amount of dirt you produce as a man

491
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,920
is also, it's like correlated with the,

492
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,960
what's the word I'm looking for?

493
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Like your willingness to wear

494
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,120

- I'm outing myself as a fucking scrub.

511
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,520
What's a Bruins logo?

512
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,720
- The Bruins logo, it's either a bear

513
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,000
or a bee that has black and gold.

514
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,040
- Oh, that's cool. - Black, white, and gold.

515
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,000
- It's either a bear or a bee.

516
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,840
- Yeah.

517
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,720
- It's usually a bee, the ones that I'm thinking of.

518
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,280
- That's interesting, so they're just kind of like

519
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,360
any bee animal will do.

520
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,160
- No, a bee, like the letter.

521
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
- Oh, I'm...

522
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,320
(laughing)

523
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,240
- You thought it was a fucking bee?

524
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,360
- I don't know.

525
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,440
- I have to find the specific pants.

526
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,120
- Those are the ones, right there.

527
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,560
- With the fucking...

528
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,800
the ones that those dreadful all of those are actually never mind

529
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,560
but these are these are the idea of these ones that are there were a little go and

530
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,980
i think it's really important to have a room for the bumblebee

531
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,360
there's a lot of my mind there's no bumblebee on the brew is that is not a

532
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,080
man

533
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,360
this isn't that the perfect logo for any of the other hand yes he has a brutal

534
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,560
though the bruins logos all so sick it's just a

535
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,320
fucking uh... it's so sick because i have to go more

536
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,780
Oh yeah, I never even thought about that.

537
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Oh dude, look at this family.

538
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,540
This is going up with the episode.

539
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
Yes.

540
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Oh my god.

541
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Oh man.

542
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
That's going to be my family.

543
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
We gotta get-

544
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
When I grow up?

545
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,680
We gotta get Bruins pajama pants.

546
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,340
It's like of course they have four kids.

547
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Like they can't fucking help themselves.

548
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
I know.

549
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Literally my family.

550
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Yeah.

551
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
100%.

552
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
That looks like my family.

553
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,380
Yeah, it's like there's a latent gene in the Irish.

554
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,900
It's like there's still a famine.

555
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Like we have to.

556
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,500
We have to produce as many fucking kids as we can.

557
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
It's not even like a Catholic thing anymore.

558
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
It's just like something stuck.

559
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
We think this works.

560
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Just in case a comedy writer eats two of your kids.

561
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:57,500
[Laughter]

562
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Yeah, this is a new problem.

563
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Irish Catholics keep producing kids because all the Harvard people are going out at night and stealing their kids.

564
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,500
It's those two groups both have ancestral genetic memory of a modest proposal.

565
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Yeah, right.

566
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Yeah.

567
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
And they just...

568
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
The incestual...

569
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,140
The Harvard kids can't stop doing satire of eating babies and placenta and doing...

570
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
And doing those things, actually.

571
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,140
Doing blood rituals.

572
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,260
Doing those, yeah, whatever that stuff is.

573
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,700
And the Irish people just love popping them out and fucking.

574
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Oh, yeah.

575
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Absolutely.

576
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
I don't even like anything.

577
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
And not being able to eat.

578
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Yeah.

579
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
And dying.

580
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,420
And smelling like shit.

581
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,580
And living in Shrek's house.

582
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
And fucking Shrek.

583
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,560
Yeah, in the mud bath. Yeah, and there's bubbles whenever they thrust. Yeah

584
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:50,120
There's a footnote and it says yeah, and the bubbles they're stinky

585
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,820
Those are stinky bubbles

586
00:31:53,820 --> 00:32:00,800
man, okay, I would love to yeah, you're like I I thought that I guess a kid I

587
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,140
Thought that farting in the bathtub. I think it was just we do that every time. Yeah. Yeah, it's done it before

588
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
I've seen that happen.

589
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,380
- Has it really, like, but like legit,

590
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,220
like, you know what I mean?

591
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,040
Like real--

592
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,880
- I saw a bubble come up to the surface and pop.

593
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,100
- That's awesome, man.

594
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,940
Did it smell?

595
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,780
Did you like smell it?

596
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,260
- It was the worst smelling fart I've ever had.

597
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,460
So I thought that if you fart in the bathtub,

598
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,880
it makes it smell more.

599
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,620
- I know why you thought that.

600
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,740
I can't get mad at you.

601
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,580
- Yeah, no, I--

602
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,800
- 'Cause you're like, oh dude,

603
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,580
it's gonna travel through the water and then blow up.

604
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,620
Like, you just had, yeah, it's like, no,

605
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,860
all that just gets absorbed.

606
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,700
Yeah.

607
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:42,180
the stink the stink air comes like combines with the filth of your day.

608
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,700
Yeah and then it goes up.

609
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
It's carrying your dirt.

610
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,180
You know what I thought about being like a scientist?

611
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,180
Yes.

612
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,180
You know what's so funny?

613
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:54,180
The stink air, my hypothesis is that the stink air combines with the filth of the day.

614
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
You know what's so funny?

615
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:04,700
When I was like ten years old, I thought I could be a doctor when I was older.

616
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,620
I was like, I'm going to like, you know, I'm going to dick around as like a kid.

617
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,580
And then one day, I'll just sort of sort this shit out.

618
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:13,780
Yeah.

619
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,020
Yeah.

620
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,980
My, my sixth grade teacher, we had to do a, uh, he was like my sixth grade social

621
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,660
studies teacher made us do the vision boards.

622
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,380
Oh, miss do vision boards.

623
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,900
And on my vision board, it said, I'm going to be a doctor.

624
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,780
That's so admirable.

625
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,580
I feel like every kid that wants to be like an astronaut or like a doctor or an inventor

626
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,940
or something is like, "Well, I better get going now.

627
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,060
I better make an invention.

628
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,660
I better start practicing going to space because I'm going to do that."

629
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
But yeah, you just want to be a doctor.

630
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
You're like, "Yeah, I'll do that later."

631
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
That's fine.

632
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
That seems like a thing that happens with time.

633
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,020
That's how you become a dentist is just like, "Yeah, I don't know.

634
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
I could be a doctor."

635
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
Which is what you are now.

636
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Yeah.

637
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Yeah.

638
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
Yeah.

639
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Yeah.

640
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
A dentist is a doctor with no will.

641
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
Yeah.

642
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,820
It is a doctor who just like was too fucking who's boring want to party

643
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,440
more yeah,

644
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:11,260
you don't want to party with a dentist. You're a dentist in that they bring

645
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,100
you into dental school to punish the

646
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:19,620
like this guy's getting too cocky. You're like the choky of the dental

647
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,540
world. They have to operate on my shitty ass fucking yeah, British teeth,

648
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,500
British teeth quarter British I'm not I'm not claiming that mm-hmm okay we got a

649
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,340
list today this is sent in by our boy Charlie by Charlie thank you Charlie

650
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,940
most controversial go listen to that I've been on it I've been on it twice

651
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:48,540
Cameron this is I went on it one time Cameron went on at one time I went on it

652
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,700
twice I don't know maybe it's cuz like I'm a better guest yeah or maybe because

653
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm just like a 10 times the guest that Cameron is.

654
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,100
Maybe because you're so stupid it takes you two episodes to say what I could say in one.

655
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,500
You had to stop in the middle.

656
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,620
25 things parents should never say to their kids.

657
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,460
This is from bestlifeonline.com.

658
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,900
Think twice before saying things to your kids that you'll wind up regretting.

659
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,860
I don't subscribe to that.

660
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,060
I think that you should say whatever to your kid whenever.

661
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,380
- Oh my god, I was having a real conversation

662
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,060
about this the other day.

663
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,900
- Yeah?

664
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,660
- Yeah, that like that--

665
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,500
- Number one is, hold on, you keep going.

666
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,340
(laughing)

667
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,700
Sorry, sorry, no, I'm just--

668
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,960
- No, you couldn't, what it was,

669
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,100
this camera was in front of me,

670
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,220
so you're like, Patches isn't here.

671
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,300
- Yeah, no, I have no object for him.

672
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,540
- Yeah, absolutely.

673
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,220
- Yeah, that's my bad.

674
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,220
- Oh no, it's very--

675
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,060
- I genuinely like--

676
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,420
I thought the Bruins had two animals as their logo.

677
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,100
(laughing)

678
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,500
I can't come back from that.

679
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,080
- I genuinely did not mean to interrupt you there,

680
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,300
sorry man. - Oh, that's fine.

681
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,460
No, I was talking about how just like,

682
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,060
I was like, how do you, 'cause you see,

683
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
it's like you don't wanna be a shitty parent,

684
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,300
but you're like, man, kids are sometimes just fucking,

685
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,180
genuinely unreasonable.

686
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,060
Like what am I supposed to do except be like, fuck you.

687
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,460
(laughing)

688
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,780
Like either like--

689
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,020
Sometimes they kill yourself. They just want some

690
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:28,560
You know like a parrot I don't like that color shirt yeah fucking kill yourself

691
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:38,260
Our parents are not supposed to say that

692
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:45,400
Number one like I got told this all the time as a kid. Yeah, well it was

693
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
It's fair for you.

694
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
I want to read the opening paragraph.

695
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
That is true.

696
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
No, the opening paragraph is boring.

697
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Is it boring?

698
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
You don't know what you're talking about.

699
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

700
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Let's do this.

701
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Number one.

702
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
This is number one.

703
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
You're so dramatic.

704
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah, I got told that a lot, but I would freak out over tiny things.

705
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Oh, yeah.

706
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
I mean, I still do.

707
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,040
Yeah, you definitely do.

708
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,880
I do too, and I was definitely told many times, "You're being dramatic."

709
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Yeah.

710
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,760
If we go to like a bar or something and I think that the vibe is corny, I'm like, I'm not

711
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,600
going there ever again.

712
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,320
I will never step foot in there ever again.

713
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,160
That's the last you'll see of me.

714
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,440
The last you'll see of me, McFerrin's.

715
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,760
I didn't like that like Modellos were $2 more than like a different place.

716
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,440
I'm like, well, see you never.

717
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,480
a nice life! I must be gone now, ta-ta! And I won't tip! And then you just spit in their

718
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,740
face. Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel like, I feel like with when, when you tell a kid you're

719
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,320
being dramatic, you're just making sure they understand that like, you know, there's times

720
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,700
to be dramatic, there's times to be comedic. Yeah, no, you should absolutely tell your

721
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,720
kid when they're being dramatic, like when they're telling you way too enthusiastically

722
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,000
about their favorite Pokemon.

723
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,840
- Yeah.

724
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,680
- Like shut up, you're so dramatic.

725
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,500
- You're so dramatic.

726
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,340
- Just say you like it.

727
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,180
- Yeah, why are you like--

728
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,000
- I don't care.

729
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,840
- Yeah, I don't care, like I don't--

730
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,680
- It's a kid's show, I don't care, I'm a grown up.

731
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,040
- Why would I be interested in that?

732
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,140
- Yeah, I don't even know what that is.

733
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,980
- Yeah.

734
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,820
- Is that a Pokeman?

735
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,020
Did you guys get that growing up?

736
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,860
- Pokemans, yeah.

737
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,680
- Oh man.

738
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,520
- Yeah.

739
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,560
- I never, I don't think I ever got like,

740
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,720
'cause I was thinking about like the shit

741
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,360
like when you're a kid where you're just like,

742
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,020
that's not how you say that!

743
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,220
I don't think I ever did that with Pokemans, but I definitely did that with

744
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:39,660
like, like I feel like, I feel like my parents would like if I was playing like

745
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,300
this is so bad, playing like a like a Final Fantasy game. Yeah, like they'd be

746
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,900
like, what is that? What does that say? Like Sephiroth? And I'm like, that's

747
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,540
Sephiroth! I definitely did that to adults a time with like Godzilla type

748
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,540
stuff. Oh yeah, yeah. I'd be like, no, it's Badara and it's the evil Mothra. Yeah,

749
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,380
- Yeah, yeah.

750
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,220
- It's, yeah.

751
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,040
(imitates gun)

752
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,880
(laughter)

753
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,780
- I did, like, the complete opposite, I think.

754
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,120
I was watching Revenge of the--

755
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,960
- You're the parent.

756
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,800
- Yeah, I'm my dad's dad.

757
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,620
- You're the kid.

758
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,700
- No, I was like, I guess it's not the complete opposite.

759
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,800
But like, I did something, like,

760
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,100
I was watching Revenge of the Sith with my dad,

761
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,460
and I had the visual dictionary,

762
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,960
and I was telling him what the names of--

763
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,900
- What's the visual dictionary?

764
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,500
I'm sorry, you don't know the visual dictionary?

765
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,340
Damn, all the--

766
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,560
- Oh, you missed out then.

767
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,400
- All the-- - This is like a

768
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,880
New England thing. - The kids whose houses

769
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,600
you hated going to had those.

770
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,440
- Yeah, really? - Star Wars visual dictionary.

771
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,280
- That was not the only thing you could do

772
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,520
at their house. - Yeah.

773
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,840
- What is the visual dictionary?

774
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,680
- It's so cool. - It just has like

775
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,500
the names of blasters and shit.

776
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,840
- It's a bunch of pictures of all the Star Wars stuff

777
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,160
and it has like just, it's like an encyclopedia.

778
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,000
- Yeah. - Oh.

779
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,820
- But it's like all the pictures and stuff.

780
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,660
- Made by the DK, whatever the fucking--

781
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,920
- It's so cool, dude.

782
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,840
- Oh, that sounds sick.

783
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,000
- Oh yeah, they're so sick.

784
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,840
All of those--

785
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,800
all the kids you hated had that. Yeah, all the all the rich kids who are super

786
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,160
annoying. Yeah, you go to their house and they be like, I just want to read your

787
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,840
book. Yeah, I had a friend growing up. I didn't hate him, but like he had like

788
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,960
the full it was the full encyclopedia of like everything from like the like

789
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,360
beginning of like from like EU to like before I got retcon I used to fucking

790
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,880
read that shit all the time. But the one time I was watching Revenge of the Sith

791
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,680
with my dad and like show like and that's Plokoon and Plokoon is a

792
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,480
Keldor and like saying like that and realize like my uncle Paul came

793
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,280
downstairs and like it's like dude your dad's asleep.

794
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,980
I think though I remember I think probably the worst of that type of

795
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,780
thing that I did.

796
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,680
I was thinking about Godzilla stuff specifically as I was a kid who

797
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,480
like if someone says something about Godzilla breathing fire, I'd be

798
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,280
like, no, he has atomic breath.

799
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,120
Oh man, it's different. Yeah, I doesn't breathe fire. I would he doesn't I was

800
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,440
right. I know it's so what it's so unimportant that you're right about that

801
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,080
man. I got upset. I will never be your dad. I'm gonna get so mad at you.

802
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:10,640
Number two is you're selfish again. I got your kid. They're selfish. Yeah, it's

803
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,160
a works. It does work. They've got these works. Oh yeah, they do exactly what you

804
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,320
want them to do when you say that. Yeah, exactly. You're only

805
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,120
thinking about yourself. How come you don't think of me constantly?

806
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:30,040
Exactly. How to make me feel good. Yeah, I want to watch TV. I don't want to

807
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,240
pick you up from school every fucking day. You can't get home on your own.

808
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,920
That's so gay. Yeah, what's wrong with you? You're six. You can walk home. It's really not

809
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,680
hard. Hey, hey, hey, give me a refresher. Hey kid, kiddo, kiddo, kiddo. How long ago

810
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,080
did you did you learn to walk? It's been what about like five years now right?

811
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,760
Okay. Oh that's I was just trying to do the math because it seems like I guess

812
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,320
if I was if I was able to do something for five years I would just do it. Oh you

813
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,760
want me to pick you up from first grade? Okay let me ask you a question did you

814
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:12,960
do my laundry? Did you give me a back rub? Yeah oh you think gas is free huh?

815
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,840
Okay, well you want me to tell about you up. Yeah, how about this? Yeah? Yeah, smell that

816
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:25,060
Take a big whiff of that dad ever fart in your face since they smell that my dad never farted in my face

817
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,780
Not in my face, but definitely pull my finger was - yeah, really my dad finger dad

818
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,360
I mean my dad just let some rip dude. That's sick

819
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,560
I hang out with my dad

820
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,080
And he just fucking like he like I think we were we were walking we were hanging out around here

821
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,560
We're walking to a bar one time. It was like mm-hmm outside

822
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,560
and he's just walking, just blasting heaters.

823
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,060
And it's like, "Man, I should not be able to smell these outside."

824
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,060
Yeah.

825
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,060
Only, yeah.

826
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,060
That's dangerous.

827
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,060
Yeah.

828
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,060
It's dangerous.

829
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,060
Number three.

830
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
You don't feel that way.

831
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:03,060
The picture of this is so funny, too, because it's a kid who's clearly hurt.

832
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Yeah.

833
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,060
You're so sick.

834
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,060
Yeah.

835
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,060
You're not hurt.

836
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,060
Yeah.

837
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,060
You don't feel it.

838
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:15,540
That is actually, this is the first one that I actually think you should say to your kids.

839
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
This is the first one.

840
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,340
Literally, the first example is like, even the belief to be less than completely true,

841
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,540
your kid saying, "I hate you" to you.

842
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,540
Yeah.

843
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,540
What the fuck?

844
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,940
No, if your kid says, "I hate you," you say, "Well, I hate you too."

845
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
Yeah.

846
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,940
Yeah, you just say it right back.

847
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,940
"I hate you, bitch."

848
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
Yeah.

849
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,940
"I hated you first."

850
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,940
"I hated you, bitch."

851
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,940
"I hated you, mommy and daddy."

852
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,940
"I hated you, but more than you were even bored."

853
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,940
Yeah.

854
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,940
"I knew this would come."

855
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,220
Yeah, you don't feel that that is actually that's one of the funniest

856
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,740
evil thing.

857
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,440
Yeah, that is such a funny thing to say, especially to a child who's

858
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,740
like just sort of figuring out how like these things like cause and

859
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,840
effect and all these things and to be like no, no, no, no, no, no,

860
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,140
no trust your gut here.

861
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,940
Yeah, I know not even that just like no, you're wrong.

862
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,040
Yeah, no, no, no, sorry.

863
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,140
It's like I'm hurt.

864
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,740
It's like interesting.

865
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,340
Let's look at that from a different angle.

866
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,520
- Yeah, I do like that one, I think that's a good one.

867
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,680
- Number four is I wish you'd never been born.

868
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,420
(laughing)

869
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,220
- Why isn't that one number one?

870
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,960
That's like-- - Oh my God.

871
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,460
- No, that's-- - It's so crazy.

872
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,960
- No, that one's okay. - You know what it is?

873
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,700
- In the right context, that one's okay.

874
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,060
- Yeah. - Yeah.

875
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,660
- Like, okay, if you're in a scenario

876
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,100
where it's you and your kid, and your kid is like,

877
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,420
if your kid wasn't born, you know,

878
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,060
you wouldn't have to get drafted to go to Ukraine, right?

879
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,040
then that would be an okay time to say it, I feel like.

880
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,960
- Well yeah, so we're not supposed to say,

881
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
"I wish you'd never been born."

882
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,640
What if my kid just killed everyone else in my family?

883
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,480
- Yeah, right.

884
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,640
- And went on a killing spree and killed 5,000 people?

885
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,680
I'm not supposed to say,

886
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,360
"I wish you'd never been born" to them?

887
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,320
- I'm gonna say it.

888
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,160
- I'm gonna say that,

889
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,240
and I'm also gonna say, "You don't feel that way, too."

890
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,440
And you're dramatic.

891
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,280
- Yeah.

892
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,240
- Oh yeah, that's the most dramatic shit you can do.

893
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,160
- My kid goes on a 5,000 person killing spree,

894
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,040
I know 25 things I'm going to say to him right off the bat.

895
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
Yeah, exactly. My kid goes paddock mode.

896
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
[laughter]

897
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,760
I like the last sentence here. It's like, "When you're feeling frustrated enough to say something

898
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,860
this hurtful, simply remove yourself from the situation until you've cooled down enough

899
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,500
to respond in a more level-headed manner."

900
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:27,140
Just like, imagine a parent who's so angry at their kid. How angry? I guess it's like

901
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,340
you have to be I guess completely fucked but it's like being like like I'm really

902
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,860
frustrated like that word is so like I'm so frustrated I'm gonna tell you I wish

903
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,660
you were never born like that that that makes a lot of sense yeah like after

904
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,300
he's not cleaned his room yeah yeah yeah it's like okay before I go in there and

905
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,100
say I wish you were never you never existed and you're a little fucking shit

906
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,540
yeah you or like being like really pissed off and being about to say that

907
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,900
and then be like okay wait I'm gonna leave the room I'm gonna cool down

908
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,420
- Yeah, coming back in and saying,

909
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,380
I wish you'd never been born, wait, shit.

910
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,980
(laughing)

911
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,820
- It's like, yeah, when I--

912
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,980
- I was supposed to think of a new thing to say

913
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,820
when I was in the other room.

914
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,340
- Instead I said that really calm.

915
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,900
- I still had that loaded up.

916
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,140
- Saying it calmer than you've ever said it before.

917
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,820
- More sincerely with more honest emotion.

918
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,700
- Number five, why can't you be more like your sibling?

919
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,780
- Oh, that happens all the time, that's fine.

920
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,460
- That's fine too.

921
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,580
Usually when that's, one sibling's evil,

922
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,660
the other one's good.

923
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,300
there's no one and then i said i don't got that one sibling

924
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,780
howie i mean

925
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,060
and i don't want to know that that war

926
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,820
and sibling and i want to go settling

927
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,100
the other side warren i don't know what i have a lot of a number six years to be

928
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,300
here

929
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,200
my mom said that i had a good time the problem is a by the way that my brain is

930
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,620
wired i will say this to my child five thousand times yeah with like without

931
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,060
meaning because that's just like I just say you're an idiot yeah I say oh you're

932
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,660
stupid yeah you're stupid you're stupid you're stupid I have to hear that like

933
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:06,220
train that up in the next ten years yeah because I will be saying that a hundred

934
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,820
times a day oh yeah absolutely and I'll be doing the post that this guy's doing

935
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:18,720
this pose with that caption so funny yeah dad taking a knee like like brow

936
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,920
now furrowed pointing his finger really sturdily in your face. You're stupid.

937
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:30,920
You are stupid. He said the number seven you're the man of the house. This is

938
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,900
this is this is the one well you can't you shouldn't this is one you

939
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,900
shouldn't say because it's not true. Yeah, all the other ones that stuff

940
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,600
it's like could be damaging. This is just it's false. You can say this on

941
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,900
opposite day, maybe but you shouldn't be saying this because you don't want to

942
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,800
be a liar. How do you how when did you guys first know you were the man of the

943
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,100
house. When did you guys first know about this?

944
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,700
I'm not the man of the house, even in my apartment.

945
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,460
No? You don't think so? I think you are.

946
00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:04,460
I think I knew when I was in high school and I had a girlfriend and I did well on a test.

947
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,580
And then I kind of went home and I told my dad, "Get out." I said, "You gotta go. I had

948
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:16,700
the two and a half good things today. I need you to get out of here. Yeah, he left right

949
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,580
after that.

950
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,520
This one says, "This puts too much pressure on the child to fulfill a role he cannot and

951
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,540
should not yet have. It's the equivalent of a chef going on break and telling the dishwasher,

952
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,540
'You're cooking now.'"

953
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:34,580
Which, as we went over, dishwashers only have one star, so how are they going to start cooking?

954
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,620
Well, you get more stars.

955
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,620
Oh, okay.

956
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,980
Okay, I've been there a child getting like your work is permanent psychological

957
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,100
damage because his dad told him like I'm going to take a nap. You're the dad

958
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,860
while I'm asleep.

959
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,260
Oh my

960
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,260
how to do taxis.

961
00:48:54,260 --> 00:49:01,300
And then get it like he's asleep. The dad's asleep like sit like four hours

962
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,380
just like I'm taking a nap before a big flight or something. And then like he

963
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,420
already has the whole house like the family audited

964
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,980
like this is obviously a chef should tell the dishwasher to cook but that's not

965
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,260
like a terrible thing to do a little like i got a break

966
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,220
like close to come break it right now

967
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,740
yeah right yeah i think it's a good idea to be like a little being like you you

968
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,460
can't go on break like you know i think you will never take a break well well

969
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,500
being a father's a twenty four-hour job and so is being a chef a chef should

970
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,700
never have to leave work never sleep they shouldn't

971
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,700
They don't.

972
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,380
Look what happened to Anthony Bourdain because he slept.

973
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,140
He did a bunch of, he did cocaine and drank beer all the time.

974
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,140
And he slept a lot.

975
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,260
Yeah, no, that's what happened to him.

976
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,260
Absolutely.

977
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,060
Number eight, no dessert until you finish dinner.

978
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,060
Shut the fuck up.

979
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,060
Fuck you.

980
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:55,060
This article was written by a kid.

981
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,300
This article was written by a 13 year old.

982
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,300
No dessert until you finish dinner.

983
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,560
(laughter)

984
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,440
- Listen to this.

985
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,260
- Yeah, I'm gonna listen to this.

986
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,060
- Enforcing the clean plate club rule at your house

987
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,820
can have serious ramifications in terms of your kids'

988
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,780
autonomy and eating habits.

989
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,620
- Oh my God.

990
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,260
- Oh my God, that's so funny.

991
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,500
- Sounds like someone's pissed off

992
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,940
they never made the clean plate club.

993
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,780
- Yeah.

994
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,660
- Oh, my little hummingbird stomach,

995
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,260
I can't eat one whole rib.

996
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,780
- Oh my God, I remember joining the clean plate club

997
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,100
and just like, oh my God,

998
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,940
and watching everyone else in my family not join in

999
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,180
and feeling so fucking good about it.

1000
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,020
You get benefits when you join.

1001
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,020
Immediately.

1002
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,020
Immediately you get benefits.

1003
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,020
Sky miles.

1004
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,020
Sky miles.

1005
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,020
Oh yeah.

1006
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,020
The dining club.

1007
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,020
Amtrak points.

1008
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,020
It's all just clean plates.

1009
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,020
Yeah.

1010
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,020
This is the thing on.

1011
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:51,820
Okay, but to be fair on this one, the parent scientists need to recognize that children

1012
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,260
have been telling you all for years about the dessert and dinner stomachs.

1013
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,260
They're separate stomachs.

1014
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,260
True.

1015
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,260
That's true.

1016
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,640
They've been new.

1017
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,800
I want to read this quote because of who this person is,

1018
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,540
what their title is.

1019
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,720
"You're already having difficulty getting your child

1020
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,940
to eat their food, and this actually increases

1021
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,440
your child's perceived threat and creates

1022
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,520
an increased power differential,"

1023
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,660
explains registered play therapist, Rees.

1024
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,120
(laughing)

1025
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,160
So it's like, oh, are you just a gamer?

1026
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,880
Like, what are you describing here?

1027
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,320
- Yeah, this lady-- - Wait, okay, wait,

1028
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,720
listen to this last sentence.

1029
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,640
Instead, Reese recommends telling children that they can choose to have dessert if they choose to finish their food first.

1030
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,140
That's psychotic.

1031
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,360
That's the same thing!

1032
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,360
Yeah, there's no difference there.

1033
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,360
You're fucking stupid.

1034
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,080
I think when you do that, you're just fucking with your kid.

1035
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,580
Yeah.

1036
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,980
You're just like, "Oh yeah, it's all a matter of choice."

1037
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,320
Yeah, exactly.

1038
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,200
That's a, "I don't know, can you?"

1039
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,280
Oh yeah, yeah.

1040
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,680
That's treating your kid like a computer.

1041
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,720
Where it's like, if you don't have the exact right words, it's gonna malfunction.

1042
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,840
It's like, "Shut the fuck up."

1043
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,720
- If I tell my kid to eat the vegetables

1044
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,680
that I know are good for them before they have the candy.

1045
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,840
- Nah, but candy's better.

1046
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,680
- I mean, candy--

1047
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,520
(laughing)

1048
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,880
- Nah, but candy better though.

1049
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,640
- I mean, it's just, it's true.

1050
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,320
It's a thing.

1051
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,960
- Number nine, hurry up.

1052
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,800
- This is insane.

1053
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,640
- This is the list, I hate this list.

1054
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,400
- Yeah, Jesus Christ.

1055
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,880
- The phrase creates more stress and anxiety in children

1056
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,880
who are most, I'm doing Caleb again,

1057
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,360
who are most likely already doing their best

1058
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,600
to find their shoes to get out the door.

1059
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,440
- Yeah, this was written by--

1060
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,560
I'm telling my kid hurry up constantly.

1061
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,560
Oh yeah.

1062
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,840
Just everything, doesn't matter, even if they're on time.

1063
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
Hurry up, let's go, come on.

1064
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,840
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1065
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,840
Snapping in their face.

1066
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,840
Makes it more punctual.

1067
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,840
Yeah.

1068
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Oh yeah.

1069
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
It's good, I mean it's training.

1070
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,280
He doesn't have to, you know, never has to say hurry up to as a German kid.

1071
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,080
They're famously very punctual.

1072
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,080
I also like it's like, but telling them to hurry up isn't actually going to motivate

1073
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
them.

1074
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,840
It's not about that, I'm trying to hurt them.

1075
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,680
(laughing)

1076
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,680
- Fucking stupid.

1077
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,800
- Yeah.

1078
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,640
- It's not about motivating.

1079
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,720
- I didn't even, I didn't want to bring them

1080
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,840
to this dinner anyway.

1081
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,680
- Oh my God.

1082
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,520
- Right?

1083
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,340
- Yeah.

1084
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,200
- That actually does, like I think about like, I do.

1085
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,920
- I would like to get Apple Dippers though.

1086
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,760
- Yeah.

1087
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,600
(laughing)

1088
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,040
- Like it would be, I think it'd be fun to be a parent,

1089
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,360
but I don't know how I feel about like,

1090
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,600
bringing a child with you to places.

1091
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,440
Just sounds.

1092
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,260
- Yeah.

1093
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,560
- I think it can be really fun probably,

1094
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,280
'cause it's probably fun to watch a child

1095
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,640
just make a mockery of any situation

1096
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,080
and be kind of blameless in that, right?

1097
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,280
Like if I show up to dinner and I, you know--

1098
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,520
- I don't wanna wear my shirt anymore.

1099
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,360
- Yeah, right.

1100
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,840
- The collar hurts on my shirt,

1101
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,680
I don't wanna wear it anymore.

1102
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,040
- The waiter's Chinese.

1103
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,280
(laughing)

1104
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,400
- Yeah, it's like--

1105
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,480
- Gosh, geez.

1106
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,400
- Oh, yeah.

1107
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,560
I gotta remove him from the situation.

1108
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,720
- Sorry my husband gets like that.

1109
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,960
(laughing)

1110
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,360
Yeah, no, he's in his terrible 32s.

1111
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,360
Yeah, he was told hurry up too much as a child.

1112
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,360
Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,360
He was told to hurry up too much, you know.

1114
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,360
Yeah, the terrible 32s.

1115
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,360
Number 10, what did you do to yourself?

1116
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,360
What do you mean? What did you fucking, like, what did you do?

1117
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,360
Let's find out what they mean, Halle.

1118
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,360
While you might not be a fan of your kid's new hair color or nose ring,

1119
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,360
when you start a conversation with an accusatory question like this,

1120
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,360
you're shutting down communication right off the bat.

1121
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,360
Your child will constantly feel judged and not good enough.

1122
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,280
They shouldn't do stuff to themselves then.

1123
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,280
Right?

1124
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:27,860
You walk in, you walk in, your kid has cut, I've done this before, I've cut like, I cut

1125
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:33,020
like up and around on my hair, like when I was in the third grade, and like there's a

1126
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,560
family photo where, I mean it was taken on like an old cell phone so you can't really

1127
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:43,580
see it, but like I have just like one giant chunk missing from my hair.

1128
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,680
You just like created a like a, sort of like a puzzle piece.

1129
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,680
Yeah.

1130
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,020
I think I tried to I think I saw like a dude with like

1131
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,520
Sounds like you're trying to make yourself

1132
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,680
It sounds like you were trying to do Trunks hair

1133
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,680
Yeah I think so

1134
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,600
The thing is if parents don't want kids to give themselves

1135
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,720
fucked up haircuts and stuff they need to stop putting it in movies

1136
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,200
because it looks so fun in movies

1137
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,200
Yeah it's true

1138
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,920
They do it's in every movie ever

1139
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,560
Think the utility of what did you do to yourself is like to let them know

1140
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,360
you did this to yourself

1141
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,360
Yeah

1142
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,360
You need to understand that

1143
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:22,040
did this to yourself is worse than what did you do to yourself. This is a kid coming home

1144
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,760
with a triangular ring, a triangular nose ring or something, you know. And you just don't

1145
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,460
even say it, you just say, "You did this to yourself."

1146
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,460
Number 11, stop crying.

1147
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,460
How are they going to know to stop?

1148
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
How are they going to stop?

1149
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,460
This is very obvious.

1150
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
Yep.

1151
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,460
Just tell them to stop.

1152
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
Just tell them to stop.

1153
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,980
Okay, here. Yeah, let me predict what this is going to say.

1154
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,980
Cut the waterworks.

1155
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,300
licensed crayon therapist

1156
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:50,300
Buddha, who even knows what liberal name is freak has says

1157
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,060
that instead of telling your line instead of this, instead of

1158
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,840
telling instead of saying stop crying to your children, which

1159
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,620
creates a threatening power attack.

1160
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,060
You should

1161
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:06,580
try triangle triangle square combo.

1162
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,540
Actually, you should actually use the empowering phrase start

1163
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,060
laughing.

1164
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,320
(laughter)

1165
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,940
- Start laughing.

1166
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:24,120
- Yeah, Diesel Antwerp, a child psychologist,

1167
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:30,140
says instead of telling your child to put away your toys,

1168
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,020
which is a--

1169
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,420
- Which could actually mutate them.

1170
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,340
- You should say,

1171
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,580
you should say,

1172
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:45,180
like use your mind and your body to move yourself slowly over to the

1173
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:49,260
block. Just take like as long as possible to articulate this. I don't

1174
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,980
understand why you can't say stop crying.

1175
00:56:52,980 --> 00:57:01,860
Child linguist Nick Cannon says that you should never say clean up

1176
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,960
your room. Instead, you should always use the empowering phrase.

1177
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,460
Shit.

1178

It's okay to say stop crying to your child as long as you also

1182
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,360
sometimes say it when they're not crying.

1183
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,620
(laughter)

1184
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:35,860

Number 12, don't be a baby.

1186
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,620

(laughter)

1197
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:07,140
Saying the phrase "good job" makes a child act stupid later in life.

1198
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:11,020
And instead you should say "fuck you" to your kid.

1199

Infant gymnast Boba Fett claims that tickling your child can actually rupture their soul

says that parents should actually not

1232
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,540
teach their children about stranger days.

1233
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,540
It forces them

1234
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:20,440
Forces them into a state of just distrusting everyone who comes to their door and offers them treats and fun time

1235
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,440
Child psychologist Jimmy Savile

1236
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,440
Says that he'll fix it. Yeah

1238
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,840
Mm-hmm. I don't believe you. That one's okay to say there's nothing to be afraid of

1239
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:44,180
This is just shut up. There's a lot to be missing their feelings. You're trying to comfort them

1240
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,540
Number 20, you're lazy.

1241
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,040
Mm-hmm.

1242
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,380
What if a kid's fucking lazy?

1243
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,260
Remember I told you guys--

1244
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:48,740
I was.

1245
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:54,340
When I was a kid, I went to see the Star Wars movies when they were released in theaters.

1246
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:54,580
Yeah.

1247
01:00:54,580 --> 01:01:00,420
And I was really afraid of Darth Vader, so my dad told me that he just had a cold,

1248
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,700
and that's why he was breathing like that.

1249
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,660
And so I just thought for too long that he had a cold.

1250
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,460
Then someone was like, "That's not why Darth Vader--"

1251
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,860
He's in that suit, because--

1252
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,300
I was like, "Yeah, he's got the flu."

1253
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:19,680
Yeah, it's gonna weaken. Yeah, right. He's Darth. Yeah, that's why number 21. You have to give them a hug or kiss

You should have done better.

You should have done better.

01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,900

What if you caught your...

you don't have to do anything.

1296
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,520
If you just count them the way I count them,

1297
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,060
