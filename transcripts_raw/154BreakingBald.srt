Let me see your butt.

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,460
- You're a monster.

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,040
(explosion)

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,880
- Here I am.

10
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,000
- Come home.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,840
- Come home.

12
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,080
- I've been fucking betrayed.

13
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,920
I've been cloned.

14
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,740
- I gotta get that keyboard.

15
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,800
- Shut up.

16
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,840
Stop changing the subject.

17
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,440
- I made a mistake while I was giving myself a haircut.

18
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,140
- I've had my swagger jacked.

19
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,160
First of all, mustache.

20
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
(laughing)

21
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,360
- Second of all-- - Are you kidding me?

22
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,400
You have to grow your hair out and then shave that,

23
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
or keep that, and then grow your hair out.

24
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,760
- You're not even speaking English.

25
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,600
I can't think of it.

26
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,920
Take that hat off right now.

27
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,840
(laughing)

28
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,040
You have a piece of tape stuck to your head.

29
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,880
- Oh, I still do?

30
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,760
(laughing)

31
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,940
- Giant black piece of tape.

32
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,560
Don't put it back up there.

33
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
- How does that look?

34
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,840
- It looks pretty, I mean, it's a piece of tape on your head.

35
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,680
What do you want me to say?

36
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,380
I'm not completely bald, all right?

37
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,240
I just gave myself like a whiffle cut.

38
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,080
- A whiffle cut?

39
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
- That's what my dad used to call it.

40
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,800
- Nobody knows what the hell that means.

41
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,480
- I've never heard that before.

42
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,160
- Well, one person's gonna know who's listening.

43
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,000
- Your dad?

44
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,280
- Yeah, I think.

45
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,040
Is it called, I don't know, whatever.

46
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,560
- I wanna do a head shape analysis.

47
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,400
- Yeah.

48
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
- Look to your left, you have a dent.

49
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,720
- Yeah.

50
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,280
- Yeah, you have a dent, he has a dent.

51
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,680
- Pretty big dent in the middle.

52
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,520
(laughing)

53
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Yeah, so I use the clippers that I have, have like one of those guides that's like you put

54
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,240
it around the corner of your ear.

55
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Yeah.

56
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,360
And I didn't do it right, I put it up too high.

57
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,680
Why didn't you go straight low top fit or straight fucking like short on the side, one

58
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,760
on the sides and have a giant ass fucking thing on the top?

59
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
I should have done something like that.

60
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,320
Classic sports clips cut.

61
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Yeah.

62
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Yeah.

63
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
I should have done that.

64
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Right off the menu.

65
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
But you know, whatever.

66
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
This will grow back.

67
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
No it won't.

68
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
It doesn't grow.

69
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,160
- I thought that too.

70
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
I thought, oh it'll grow back.

71
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,580
- I mean, look at my hairline right now.

72
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,480
Do you think that's growing back?

73
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,520
- Your hairline's fine.

74
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,000
It's better than I thought it was, honestly.

75
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,120
- Yeah? - Yeah.

76
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,760
- It's better than I thought it was.

77
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
- Nice.

78
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,040
- I thought that it was way, way farther back.

79
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,800
- I thought you didn't have any hair.

80
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,640
- Yeah. - Yeah.

81
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,000
- You thought I just like combed it over.

82
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
- Yeah, I did.

83
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,080
- Yeah, for a while now.

84
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
- Makes sense.

85
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,840
- I think you also, you are very secretive about it.

86
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,660
- Yeah.

87
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
- So then when you actually see it,

88
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,320
you're like, oh, it's not that.

89
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,140
The degree of secrecy that you undertake

90
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,700
with your hairline, I would expect you to have less hair.

91
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,480
- I just, it doesn't grow in the spots that it should.

92
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,260
- What? - Is what the,

93
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,440
like these two corners right here.

94
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,300
- Those are cool corners for it to not grow in.

95
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,720
- That's just how, that's a mature hairline I've learned.

96
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,020
That's what happens when you mature.

97
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,220
- Do you have, are you supposed to have a mature hairline

98
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,060
from the age of like 16? - Yeah, your hairline's

99
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,400
supposed to go, yeah, and it's supposed to go

100
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,740
all the way back here, and this is like a mature

101
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,900
kind of hairline is when it hits kind of the back ear,

102
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,660
right where your head starts to curve into your neck.

103
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,500
- Interesting. - All the way in the back.

104
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,580
That's a mature hairline.

105
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,900
- I'm also missing like a patch of hair right here.

106
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,700
- I saw you have a little like a scar.

107
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,540
- Let me see. - A bald spot.

108
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,860
- And then yeah, there's a scar

109
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,700
on the back of my head on this side.

110
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,980
- You had to have been abused.

111
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,340
Just looking at your head.

112
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,740
Just looking at your head, you got abused for sure.

113
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,740
- Yeah, but the back of my head--

114
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,340
- He changed the subject fast.

115
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,660
Oh, you had the back of my head.

116
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,860
- Back of my head right here, well, here's a story.

117
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,020
- Okay.

Star Wars issue with your head? I had staples put in my head with like a patch of like

126

something over it. They took the hair from up here in the front and they

127
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,720
stapled it over the piece of paper. You have a perfectly fine hairline if

128
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,780
they didn't do that. They did a follicular transplant. That must have

129

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,460
- Cats like eating hair, that's why they have hair balls.

169
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,940
- I didn't know that they liked that.

170
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,180
Speaking of Moe, he has a beaver fever.

Even girls have beaver fever these days.

173
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,180
- Nowadays, and they also, they used to have beaver fever,

174
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,340
And now they have beaver fever.

175
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,180
- Yeah, that's right.

176
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,020
- 'Cause they're all damn bisexual.

177
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,840
- And I thought beaver fever--

178
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,260
- Pretty much the same thing, yeah.

179
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,280
- I thought beaver fever was gay.

180
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,300
- I thought beaver fever had a beaver fever.

181
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,140
- Yeah.

182
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,980
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,780
I looked up beaver fever when Pat was saying

184
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,040
that his cat had it, and the way that you,

185
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,320
it's a sickness and you get it by eating poop.

186
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,420
- Why does every sickness, why does eating shit

187
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,260
give you every sickness?

188
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,540
- Well, so here's the important part is that it's,

189
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,420
you could get it by either eating animal poop

190
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,580
or human poop.

191
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,260
So there's a distinct possibility that his cat ate human poop.

192
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,340
My stray cat probably ate a homeless crap.

193
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Yeah.

194
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Ugh.

195
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Yeah.

196
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
So.

197
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Well, yeah.

198
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
It turns out that...

199
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
Found a new home in your cat's mouth.

200
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,260
It turns out taking in a stray cat...

201
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Not that awesome.

202
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,060
Yeah, and nursing it back to health.

203
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,980
It's actually very expensive.

204
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,460
I found out I have canine stomach ulcers.

205
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Yeah?

206
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,460
Yeah.

207
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,460
I fit all the symptoms.

208
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
Really?

209
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Yeah, I don't...

210
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,460
What are the symptoms?

211
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,460
dog food or play with other dogs or go into my crate.

212
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,540
- Really?

213
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,360
- These days, yeah.

214
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
- Not even your crate?

215
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,420
- I won't even touch a bowl of dog food.

216
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,260
- Wow.

217
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,500
- Yeah, I got all the symptoms of canine stomach ulcers.

218
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,360
- Dog food, at least like the wet food that like,

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,180
they're like, oh yeah, we eat like a real,

220
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,020
oh my God, this diet.

221
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,140
- The other day I was so hungry that I was making Phil's food

222
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,160
and I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna go to bed,

223
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm not gonna eat anything.

224
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,160
I'm just gonna go to bed.

225
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,240
And then I started making Phil's food.

226
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,160
I was like, fuck, I'm getting, I could eat this right now.

227
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,720
And so I had to boil an egg.

228
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,380
- It has to look, it,

229
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,680
- I had to boil an egg to keep myself from eating dog food.

230
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,840
- Dry food or?

231
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,040
- Well, I mix it with canned pumpkin.

232
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
- Oh, okay.

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
- Yeah. - Yeah.

234
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,540
- All right.

235
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,380
- I thought you were talking about,

236
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,520
no, like the wet food containers.

237
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,320
Like when it's like, oh, like a chef made this.

238
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,200
There's sometimes, you'll see a video where it's like,

239
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,400
a guy is making food for his dog

240
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,720
and he's chopping up like chicken breast.

241
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,880
- I thought I was gonna do that.

242
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,080
- He's making it in like slow comparison shit.

243
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,120
- I thought I was gonna be a quail egg

244
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,560
for my dog kinda guy.

245
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
- Yeah.

246
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,520
- And it turns out I just forget to feed him.

247
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,360
- Yeah.

248
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,720
- Yeah, so it's a lot worse probably.

249
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
- I can't forget to feed Moe

250
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,760
because Moe literally has like a parasite in his stomach

251
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
that he's eating for, and he's eating for two because of it.

252
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,040
And I have to put stuff in his food

253
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,160
to kill the parasites now.

254
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,200
- He's a tapeworm.

255
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
- No. - Ringworm.

256
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
- He also has--

257
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,780
- Stomachworm.

258
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,620
- What did he have?

259
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,460
- Worm, tummyworm.

260
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,280
- He does have a tummyworm.

261
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,520
does actually have a tummy worm. Did they like find it on an x-ray? Yeah, they had to

262
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,280
collect a stool sample and ride on the bus with poop in my my tote bag. No.

263
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,420
Your tote bag? I filled my tote bag to the brim with shit. In that tote bag? In that tote bag I filled it to the

264
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,800
brim with shit. The one that Caleb's backpack is leaning on? Yeah. Oh come on.

265
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,360
That's why I have some kind of fucked up stomach issue. That's why I never put poop in my bag.

266
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,360
egg. You know what I didn't I'm a first time stray cat owner. Okay. I didn't know

267
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,260
you say it. You're a noob. I'm a noob to owning a stray. You're a total. I've

268
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,060
never had to bring a stool sample anywhere. Okay. Really? I'm a new I'm a

269
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,160
green horn when it comes to stool samples. I'll say it. You say you're very

270
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,160
horny when you come in. It comes to stool samples. No, I said I'm a green

271
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,260
horn. I don't know what that means. It means it's what it means to be green

272
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:18,260
with

273
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,540
to jack off with it.

274
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,780
- Juvio, come say hi real quick.

275
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
- Yeah, Juvio's in the house.

276
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,460
- We have a live studio.

277
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,060
- Grab the mic and say hi.

278
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,900
- Hi.

279
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
- There we go, that's enough from you.

280
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,720
You can sit down now.

281
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,560
- Get the fuck out of here.

282
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,220
- Wait, look at this.

283
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,060
Look at this.

284
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,900
- Don't blind him with a flashback.

285
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,720
- That's the Phantom.

286
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,740
Why do we have, oh right, 'cause the, nevermind.

287
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,060
- Listen, two times in one month,

288
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,820
a bee, I've been eating something outside,

289
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,420
and a bee has, okay, you're--

290
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,740
- Now you're ruining the episode,

291
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,900
'cause this is the second time I've tried

292
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,500
to tell this fucking story about my beef food a set there's a second time where a

293
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,420
bee has tried to eat my food really what I thought I'd been eating pollen and

294
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,420
yeah I haven't I've been having a similar experience where I about two

295
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,380
times in the past week I saw a bee really posing outside and where was it

296
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,900
headed one time it was remaining in that same location in there how do they do

297
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,820
that another time it was circling around a trash I saw both the times I was

298
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,700

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:46,020
Dnuthi. I love ventriloquism. Oh my god. Ventriloquism. Ventriloquism. I love ventriloquism. But yeah,

302
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,780
the bees, the bees are going on with them. Something is going on with them. The bees?

303
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,700
Recently that's making me see them. There was all these movies a couple years ago, what

304
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,100
the fuck is going on with the fucking bees? Yeah, they're dying quote unquote. I hate bees.

305
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:07,020
Bees suck. Who likes bees man? A lot of flowers. Not me. What picture did you take? You had

306
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,420
You have to show me what you took.

307
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Close your eyes.

308
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
What the hell are you?

309
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,620
Is this a photo of me drinking in portrait mode?

310
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,220
I don't get why that's that funny.

311
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,100
Get ready dude, now that you have no hair people are just going to start taking photos

312
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
of you all the time.

313
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Yeah.

314
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,620
Patrick just went teacher mode.

315
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,620
Yeah you did.

316
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,940
I'm not sure I see what's so funny about this.

317
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,060
Can you explain to me what's so funny about what you just did?

318
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
He's acting like a damn kid.

319
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,060
Explain to the class.

320
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,220
And guess who gets who's getting a spanking.

321
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
You look like a damn kid.

322
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
A baby.

323
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,660
This is so much fun to make fun of people with no hair.

324
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,700
I see why you guys do this.

325
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,540
Yeah, I'm trying to get out all the things

326
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,180
that I've always wanted to say.

327
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,940
- You've been practicing in your mirror.

328
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,760
- I hate my dad.

329
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,600
No, not dad.

330
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,340
(laughing)

331
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,480
No, I love my dad.

332
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,300
Your head looks really fucking no hair though, pretty much.

333
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,140
- No hair though?

334
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,960
- Yeah.

335
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,220
- Boy ain't got no hair though.

336
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,540
- I guess that's facts now.

337
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,380
- Yeah.

338
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,200
- Used to not be.

339
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
- That used to not be facts,

340
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,720
very quickly became fast was fiction now facts yeah I am afraid I've thought I

341
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,320
have come close I would say if maybe two times in my life to shaving my head but

342
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,240
I think that I every time I pussy out because I think I think I probably have

343
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,520
the most dented head of all time I think I think I think I do think if I shave my

344
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,680
head like it would look not think it's good it's corrugated I think it would be

345
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,000
really bad that it might be fun though because you could I'll do it I'm

346
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,720
probably do it eventually but I do I am really dreading seeing what it's what is

347
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,640
- You shave it with the same guard,

348
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,320
the whole way through so that there's like,

349
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,240
when it dips down in the dents,

350
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
that's like a different length

351
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
because you hit everything with the sabi fun.

352
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,080
- Yeah, that's what happened today.

353
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
- Yeah, let me see.

354
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,880
- So, what if I like, what if I shave my head though

355
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,380
and I have just red open sores on my scalp?

356
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
- Well then--

357
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,040
- That's what I thought I would see.

358
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,880
- And I have like white worms sticking out of them.

359
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,400
- There was like an itchy thing over here.

360
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,240
- I actually did have that when I shaved my head.

361
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,060
- Really?

362
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,900
- Because I had such terrible dandruff

363
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,200
that my scalp was just like bright red

364
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,040
and covered in just like rotting.

365
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,400
- Is that dandruff or is that psoriasis?

366
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,080
I wouldn't be surprised if I had like purple rotting skin and gangrene yeah on

367
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,960
my brain there there you two are literally acting like you two are acting

368
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,360
like children you're you were your audience you were acting like the you

369
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,960

371
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,600
penis with the grabber. Do you think this is fun for people to listen to? Yeah.

372
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,560
People are gonna be upset. The two people they could care about the least in the

373
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:46,520
world fighting with a penis grabber. And it's not a penis grabber until you make

374
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,480
it one. And you've been making it one this whole time. It's not supposed to be

375
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,840
for grabbing penises. It's for grabbing toilet papers down from the

376
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,900
bodega counter he shaved his head you know he shaved his head shave ice you know I

377
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,380
shaved my head you shaved my head these are the times these are the times when I

378
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,020
honestly wish the fucking Grim Reaper was real yeah yeah he'd come out of nowhere

379
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,700
and he fucking take you away I wish the Sandman was real so you could dance to

380
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,940
him off the stage dance to you that's right yeah that's exactly still the words

381
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,200
right out of my mouth I feel the exact same way that's the ball or the dragon

382
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,380
from the grand fairy tales to burn them alive

383
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,220
squirted cinders. Yeah, touching your head, yeah, scratching it. You know it's

384
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,740
not fun, dude, when someone else does it. Yeah, don't touch my hair.

385
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,240
It's that simple or my lack of hair. I don't like when people touch my bald

386
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,980
head. I'd like to publicly say that. I shouldn't have to sit there and take

387
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,340
that when someone touches my bald head. Because all of a sudden, if someone

388
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,660
touches my bald head and I go like, "Stop doing that," like, "Knock it off,"

389
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,580
they're like, "Oh, what? I was just touching your fucking bare skin."

390
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,880
You can touch my ass cheek, you can rub my ass cheek,

391
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,020
and you can pat that.

392
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,300
My head, man, that's where my thoughts live.

393
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,060
- You're gonna shake my head around?

394
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,940
You're gonna do that to me?

395
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,340
- I don't like that, dude.

396
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,960
Especially 'cause I've been taking a lot of fucking

397
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,380
Tanga Ali and Ashwagandha, and my natural testosterone,

398
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,860
my free testosterone, it's getting way too high.

399
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,020
So if somebody does that--

400
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,260
- Mine's already too high.

401
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,740
That's why I'm losing my damn hair.

402
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,140
- I'm probably liable to freak out

403
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,540
if next time somebody does that to me.

404
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,640
- What everyone says about me is my testosterone.

405
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,740
It looks like I have high T.

406
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,580
- Yeah, through the roof.

407
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,300
- That's why my hips are very wide.

408
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,500
- Yeah, it's through the roof.

409
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,100
- My legs are longer than the, long as the night.

410
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,000
- Yeah, long as the night is long.

411
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,260
- Long as the night is long.

412
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,100
- Long and dark legs.

413
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,220
- And my stiletto heels make my ass look amazing.

414
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,700
- Yeah, 'cause you're high T.

415
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,540
- High T, yeah.

416
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,340
- 'Cause of my high testosterone.

417
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,820
- Yeah, I'm high T, I got this big ass nose.

418
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,340
- Yep.

419
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,180
- I think T does make your nose big.

420
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,860
- What do you mean about?

421
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,700
What?

422
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,460
I've got a big nose, 'cause I'm high T.

423
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,060
When you take testosterone, like TRT therapy,

424
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,980
when you get older, it makes your nose big.

425
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,220
Like bulbously big?

426
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,500
Yeah, it gets like big and red.

427
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,300
There's like, when people take--

428
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,060
What the fuck are you doing, Jubio?

429
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,900
He hurt himself.

430
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,780
You know that Patrick is easily distracted,

431
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,740
and then you fucking do this shit.

432
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,320
Go sit on your iPad.

433
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,580
Turn on your iPad right now.

434
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,420
Turn on your iPad and draw.

435
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,540
Turn on your iPad and draw.

436
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,280
Stop playing with toys.

437
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,100
And don't mess up anything on that desk.

438
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,140
unbelievable comes takes an unauthorized vacation request vacation

439
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,540
request vacation goes through the for request vacation vacations. I'm late. I

440
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,340
might need at least a full six way in advance. Ask me to approve it while I'm

441
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,460
by the way outside of business hours. It was like six thirty text me ask me to

442
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,460
approve. It says look at your email. I see it. I say yeah, but that's not going

443
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,180
to work. It's going to be a no for us. It's going to be a hard no and then I

444
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,140
message you again outside of office hours didn't have to do that. I'm not

445
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,580
getting paid for that work and then you throw a hissy fit and you send me

446
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,180
pictures of you in a diaper. You're loading it up with fucking what looks

447
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,340
like orange piss, you know, and I just think that's unbecoming of an employee.

448
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,420
Exactly. I know. I remember the first picture looked like orange piss and then

449
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,220
the second picture you could see the texture and it was more like yogurt.

450
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,660
Yeah, and it's like why are you putting yogurt in a dice and then the third

451
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,460
picture very clear. It's not yogurt at all, but it's it because it's like

452
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,800
- It was clearly coming out of his body.

453
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,640
- Also, it's in some way.

454
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,460
- Burya consummate.

455
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,300
- It was clear, I could see that you were--

456
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,140
- How do you say it?

457
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,960
- Bedia.

458
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,800
- Bedia?

459
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,960
- It was clear in the photos that you were using

460
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,040
like studio lighting, you had like a ring light, you know?

461
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,860
- Yeah.

462
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,700
- And it's like, why are you going through all this?

463
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,960
- And you could actually tell based on the glare

464
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
that he had one ring light at face level

465
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,120
and one from behind at his butt.

466
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,960
- It's disgusting, yeah.

467
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,840
- That apparently he uses for other uses during the day.

468
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,680
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
- God. - What is that?

470
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
- You need to leave us alone.

471
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,080
You need to leave us alone.

472
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,920
We're busy.

473
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,880
you have to go to the other side of the office and close the curtain. I'm getting pretty

474
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,200
excited. I really think that tonight when I go to this bath house it might be a game changer

475
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,120
for me. Yeah. I think I might finally get into relaxing. That does, and honestly it sounds so

476
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,920
nice. I have to say it's been growing since you first said it. When you first said it my first

477
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:09,360
thought was naked? Yeah. Yeah. And since then? Naked. But is there, what if, imagine just like

478
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,080
you go to a place in an Armenian guy forces you to relax

479
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,300
because that's what it is as far as I know you are forced to relax I guess

480
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,400
you're allowed to play play video games in there that's what I'm kind of hoping

481
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,320
I'm sorry I pad in with you yeah damn if I can bring my iPad in that I because I

482
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,800
think I I think I still have a warranty on that thing do my god I got into the

483
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,680
bath with me bring that it doesn't matter what happens oh my I was under the

484
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,840
I was under the impression that the bad to be in the bathhouse holy shit.

485
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,080
I was under the impression of the bathhouse was just a basically like a

486
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
water park like you pay and then you just walk around and get in the

487
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,940
different pools, but then I signed up and it said you need to arrive early

488
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,360
before your session. So I think they're going to fucking do something.

489
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,980
They're going to do something. I'm fucking terrified man. I think they're

490
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,440
probably going to do something to you. It's like a spa right yeah, but I don't

491
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
What do you do at a spa?

492
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,460
Well, I would assume...

493
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
Do they massage you?

494
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,460
I guess maybe you'd probably have to...

495
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,460
Do you have to get clean before you're on the baths probably, right?

496
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,460
I'm definitely gonna wash my butt before I go.

497
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
Yeah.

498
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
So maybe they do that.

499
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Maybe it's something about that.

500
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,460
I don't want to have my butt all stinky for him.

501
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
I don't want to make the whole sauna stink.

502
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Well, I'm gonna let him know when I walk in.

503
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
I'm gonna be like, "I washed for you."

504
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
I washed my butt for you.

505
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Excuse me!

506
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,460
I washed my butt!

507
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
Are you here for the 930?

508
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
Yes, I am.

509
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
And I washed my butt.

510
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,860
but I washed it very, very good. Maybe they're going to shave your body so you

511
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,620
don't get any stray hairs into the bath.

512
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,700
They are going to might.

513
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,340
What?

514
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,820
Just go in there, go in that bath house with a ladle to get all that broth.

515
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,780
Oh my God.

516
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,340
You get all that broth.

517
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,660
Taking that home in a thermos.

518
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,900
Take that home in a thermos.

519
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Dude, that's the ultimate.

520
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,100
That's the ultimate in testosterone boosting stuff.

521
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,780
Oh my God.

522
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,820
You talking about high T?

523
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,300
That's some serious free testosterone.

524
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Talk about free testosterone, that's free.

525
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
Yep.

526
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,020
Also, take that home, okay?

527
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,460
Take that thermos home, put it in the freezer.

528
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,660
Put it in a little baggie.

529
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,260
That's an ice pack.

530
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,940
After you work out, you're sore, put the ice pack on.

531
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:22,020
Not only does it help you feel better, reduce inflammation, but it's also adding testosterone

532
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,980
and it's going to make your arm big like Popeye.

533
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,620
You could put it, once it melts a little bit, just a little bit, depending on who you are,

534
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,020
you could insert it rectally and let it melt in there.

535
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,860
and a slushy to yeah and a slushy to you and it could probably absorb even faster

536
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,520
through your rectal lining yeah probably if you had like a slushy and then a

537
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,220
straw that goes into your rectum and then maybe if you had trained

538
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,860
yourself to take it have air intake yeah through your rear end. I guess I'm just

539
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,980
worried about sharks at this thing. Yeah, I guess I'm probably worried about

540
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,380
about masked killers. I think that that might be a bad problem at a bathhouse.

541
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,660
house yeah in a bath house. Let's see what is my yeah. What am I the most

542
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,900
scared of it's probably getting a boner if I was gonna get a boner from an old

543
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,500
guy. Yeah, yeah, unlock. I think if there's any place in real life, you're

544
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,660
gonna get killed by Jason Voorhees. It's probably a bad house right. I would try

545
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,660
fucking a camp man. Yeah, so that's the movie. So I just said was real life. So

546
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,660
I was kind of doing a departure from the movies, which is in a my early departed.

547
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,180
If you keep talking down to me about flicks, I'd seriously I'm not even talking

548
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,260
about flicks. I'm talking about real life, which is the point I'm trying to

549
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,020
across here okay so maybe I don't even really matter that I like a

550
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,780
combination of real life and flicks no it's purely real life right now all right

551
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,620
when you watch a movie that's a combination of real life and flicks oh

552
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,340
you're right yeah flicks is the purest form of movie yeah movie is somewhere in

553
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,620
between flicks and reality yeah watching movie watching movie oh my god and it's

554
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,940
called flicks because of the shutter flicker it's called no it's called flicks

555
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:59,300
because of Netflix. Oh, okay. I sit there and I flick boogers onto my TV. Yeah, I flick my

556
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:05,380
bean. That's right. I'm watching Showgirls, unrated. That's got to be weird to touch your

557
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:12,100
bean. Yeah? Yeah, that's got to be really odd. Yeah, it probably feels weird. It must

558
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:21,700
tingle. I bet it like spreads through your whole body. It must tingle. It must! It must!

559
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,820
You do kind of look a little bit more like a villager or a slave with your head like

560
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
this.

561
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Yeah.

562
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,740
Oh my god, I would love to put you in some burlap.

563
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,740
Doesn't he look like he's got chains attached?

564
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,860
I could see you rowing a ship, like a Viking warship.

565
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
Definitely.

566
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
See, dude, he's sucking his teeth.

567
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
He's so mad at this.

568
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
Oh my god.

569
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
He's like, "No, I'm noble."

570
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
I just have like a...

571
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,860
Dude, dude, dude.

572
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
I think my wisdom tooth is infected.

573
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,260
He's going to star in the fucking Northeast Man.

574
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Holy shit.

575
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,340
The fucking Northeast Man instead of the North Man.

576
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,180
- A Northeast man, like New Hampshire.

577
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,780
- What's going on with your tooth, man?

578
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,420
- It's totally infected.

579
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,260
- Viking?

580
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,080
- I think it totally is infected.

581
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,920
- That is Viking as fuck.

582
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,760
- Yup, yup, yup.

583
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,580
- You have scurvy, bud.

584
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,420
- Yup.

585
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,540
I gotta get that wisdom tooth out.

586
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,700
- You need to stop eating cured meats so much.

587
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,540
- I know.

588
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,780
- I found out yesterday.

589
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,780
- Eating Iberico ham.

590
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,620
Is that what it's called?

591
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,740
- Jamon Iberico.

592
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,300
- Jamon Iberico.

593
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,140
- You, um.

594
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,540
- I said that perfect pronunciation.

595
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,380
- You did.

596
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,420
Iberico ham.

597
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,060
- Iberico ham.

598
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,420
I think that we would do very well in Espana.

599
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,720
Right.

600
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
And what era?

601
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Now.

602
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Spanish era.

603
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Okay.

604
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Spanish Civil War.

605
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Yeah.

606
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Yeah.

607
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I guess probably any era we would do pretty well there.

608
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I would do well.

609
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
I would just, my brain was still in Viking mode, so.

610
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
I could do well now.

611
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,640
I'm doing pretty good, except for my teeth.

612
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,060
You don't want to go to Spain?

613
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,980
I'm worried that things would change for me in Spain, I guess is my main thing.

614
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,540
It's like if I went to Spain, could I bring my girlfriend?

615
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,840
Would I have to pay money to...

616
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,140
Is it more expensive to live there?

617
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Is it cheaper?

618
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
Would my friends be with me?

619
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,140
That's your whole life.

620
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,140
That's kind of my questions I would have about moving to Spain, yeah.

621
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
I already got ahead of that.

622
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
Would I have to get a job?

623
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
Can I still do this job?

624
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Like, would you guys be coming?

625
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Would I have to do it remotely?

626
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,140
So you're getting too into the nitty gritty details.

627
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Well, that's just the things I'm thinking.

628
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,420
What I'm thinking right now about if I do well in Spain, I'm just like, you know, like

629
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,660
would I have to change, would I get like health care?

630
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Like how would that like...

631
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,620
So when I ask you about like, like what, would you rather fly or invisibility as your...

632
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
Right.

633
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,620
So I'm wondering like if my, for what my, yeah, if I was invisible, like yeah, would it affect

634
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,100
like my daily life like I mean I could be able to control the invisibility would

635
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,140
ruin my relationships with my friends or family or like what I still have what I

636
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,060
still have to work would I be able to make money just like being a hype if I

637
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,940
fly could I go like a thousand miles per hour don't really have to answer the

638
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,300
quite like it's not like that serious I guess right I'm just I mean that's just

639
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,180
what I think about when I'm I'm just trying to think you through these

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:43,780
questions like if I fly I probably save a lot of money on flying airplane flying

641
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,780
flying but what if your gas are you flying to Spain so if you could fly to

642
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,060
Spain on your own I guess then what about would I be allowed to fly back if

643
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:57,420
I go to Spain I mean I would just assume so I guess yeah I guess I do well in

644
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,420
Spain if I could come back really fast you said I was talking about getting a

645
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,900
passport GBO said that I could get out of the country without a passport but

646
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,980
you can't get back in is that true really is that true I don't know how it

647
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,740
works it's probably depends on the place right I don't know I have no idea that's

648
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,100
I just said okay that's very funny Juvio he pretended to take a photo and then

649
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,020
he showed it to me and it's three monkeys really really funny really funny okay he

650
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,860
turned his flashlight on to sell the photo effect it was pretty good that

651
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,580
okay this time is actually hi I said cheese okay it's the same same thing

652
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,460
all right well that's just fucking you're despicable mm-hmm yeah you're

653
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,720
not right have you ever been fired Juvio no you never fired I've been fired

654
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,920
You've been fired. Cameron, have you? I've quit every job I've done.

655
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,880
I've never been fired. I've never been fired. I've been fired and I've quit.

656
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,400
What's the- I've been dishonorably discharged. I've been fired.

657
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,440
I've quit. I've had a job that lasted three days and I thought that was my shortest job.

658
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,560
I thought it was like, there's no way I'll beat that. And then I did have a job where I only

659
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,480
lasted half a shift. And I just ditched all that. Which one?

660
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,960
It was the wax museum in downtown Boston. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,480
I just got halfway through my shift and then I ditched all my I was like this

662
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,240
sucks I was sitting next to a fucking wax figurine of Peter Dinklage outside just

663
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,920
like begging tourists to not like kiss it and then I was like this is miserable so

664
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,360
I just walked inside I took off my polo put it in the bathroom and just walk

665
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,480
pieced out yeah yeah I've never been fired but I also have never no one has

666
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,480
ever said I'm a good worker I think I'm really good at finding the exact amount

667
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,080
to work that I don't get in trouble but I really am doing nothing I'm a horrible

668
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,360
employee but not enough that anybody gets mad at me. I think that's the secret.

669
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,320
I forgot to collect my tips all the time when I worked at places and

670
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,520
then they would have to call me during class and be like, "Hey, you have to come

671
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,360
collect these." And I would get like seven dollars in cash because they

672
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,160
distributed all the tips throughout the restaurant. What was your first job? My first job?

673
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,360
Yeah. Videographer for the London Area High School football team. All right, so

674
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,440
we're not counting that though. Like a first real job. Okay. You have to figure,

675
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,360
you have to fill out a form and stuff. First real job was Cracker Barrel. Nice. Yeah.

676
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,840
That's awesome. Dishwasher. Nice. And you lasted how long? A month. Nice. And then I was like,

677
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,640
they were like, well if you're gonna be, you're gonna be back on the weekends

678
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,200
right? And I was like, yeah but I really need to focus on my studies. Nice. My first

679
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,200
First job was I was a parking attendant and I was supposed to give people tickets, never

680
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
did it.

681
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,080
Yeah, you told us about the parking lot shutdown.

682
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,280
But then I also, another reason I quit was I just, I got hit by a car.

683
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Really?

684
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Yeah, twice.

685
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
That's cool.

686
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
And like once after the other in a row?

687
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,280
It was the same car.

688
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Different, different.

689
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Yeah, it just went.

690
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Yeah, it went.

691
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Backed up.

692
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
It hit me and then it went back.

693
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

694
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
But I was like, you know what?

695
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,040
Or like in Sin City where one hits you and you go really far up in the air and the camera

696
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,600
follows you and then you go down and you bounce off another one.

697
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,280
yeah i went up so i had to move you know yeah but then i was like you know what

698
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,600
you know this place is made of cheese i guess i don't think about it i think

699
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,780
job would probably weasley dale would probably be moon scientist

700
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,800
i guess your dream job as for your for you know i just don't know that i think

701
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,520
of job i know i said now i think of it i think you know anything over your first

702
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,160
job uh... moon scientist i worked i did stuff of my local library but if you

703
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,720
mean

704
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,500
real job

705
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,700
i get this college college double counts as a religion read

706
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,420
I did I helped old people with computers, old people would come in and they

707
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,460
would be like they'd be like I don't know how to send an email and I got paid to

708
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,540
like show them how to do that and then every old person at the end would be

709
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,940
like you are so sweet. Do you want to come to my house?

710
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,340
And then everyone else would be like you have to leave.

711
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,540
I had never heard that before.

712
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,060
Yeah that's very funny, a really common problem.

713
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,260
He tried to get just a soft hit nap from one of these guys.

714
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,240
I think most of them honestly mean well, it's like old ladies and they're like no

715
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,940
You should come to my house and show me how to do this at my house because I my desktop computer

716
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,280
He's in a mill scenario. Yeah, but but then also there are some that are also definitely not

717
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,620
You should come to my house. Were you a hot kid? Were you like sexy? I don't think so. I

718
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,980
Think I was pretty surprised. Did you dress like slutty or no? I mean I dress you show some skin

719
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,840
I mean, I think you know how I dress now and you can probably extrapolate backwards. Yeah

720
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,400
like how it backwards have been he probably you're covered right now so I

721
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,240
think seven years ago I mean I'll give you the starting point to fill everything

722
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,920
in black it's a robe new balances a robe circle sunglasses yeah scar on the head

725
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,780
back astronaut helmet and an astronaut. I was just thinking that well that's why

726
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,420
they asked you to go because they didn't know you're your camera and yeah,

727
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,220
we got a baby face, you know, we're sitting in the library in like cowboy

728
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,620
boots and that fucking cowboy boots, cowboy hat and that praying bikini that

729
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,620
says father, son and Holy Spirit on it.

730
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:13,420
You're sitting there and you're like, does anyone need help with the computer

731
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,720
the the name of that program where it was like it was like specifically high

732
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,160
school kids help old people with computers the name of that program was

733
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:29,920
teen text I just now crazy name for that teen text teen text and old people are

734
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,520
coming far and wide teen tags on the weekend I have to get a teen tech this

735
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,100
this weekend. Hey honey, I'm gonna go down to the teen tech yeah, it's a

736
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,060
boy. Some of that stuff could have been so bad too, because a lot of I'm

737
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,960
coming. You know there was guys who went home after you taught them how to

738
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,360
do an email and their old wives are like hello honey. Whose hair is this

739
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,820
on your

740
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,720
the thing? It's like no, no, you want to say it was a teen. I feel like it

741
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,760
could it was probably it feels like a kind of reckless endangerment,

742
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,640
because a lot of those two you can see that because I mean half of half of

743
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,300
That's like I don't know how to log into my email and that stuff simple or

744
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
whatever.

745
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,500
But then I would say probably a good half, the other half would be like a

746
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,520
lot of guys who came in and wanted to figure out how to get photos off their

747
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
digital cameras.

748
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,500
See, that's what I'm saying.

749
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,740
That's really dangerous territory.

750
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,340
Now you're in one hour photo.

751
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,860
You could be turned into a psychopath.

752
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
That could be bad.

753
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,140
You're going to be talking to a kid about Evangelion.

754
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,420
It's exactly like one hour photo.

755
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,580
It could be really bad.

756
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,780
but yeah, I think you shouldn't let teens look at old people's photos.

757
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,340
Yeah, yeah, it is.

758
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,180
The other is it or the

759
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,380
it's like you were teaching like old men how to send email. I don't want to

760
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,620
touch an old man's feel. It is yeah, think about think of you're teaching

761
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,380
old men suck his feel on us.

762
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,340
You're teaching old men how to log into their email. Yeah, I know that you

763
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,940
teach you're teaching them how to just continue harassing you. Yeah, you're

764
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,940
like continue harassing you. I don't send email and what's your email

765
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:10,460
to log into their email and then you're also making them so susceptible to scams.

766
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,300
It's like, "Oh, I'm a..."

767
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,500
Yeah, old people shouldn't have that technology.

768
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,460
Old people shouldn't have email.

769
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,260
I think it's like, you should not let an old person, unless they're very smart, use anything

770
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,700
but a fax machine.

771
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,180
Yeah, it's probably true.

772
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
I'm not sure.

773
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
A jitterbug and a fax machine.

774
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,780
I was about to say like better email than like Facebook and Instagram, but maybe not.

775
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,880
Maybe email is the worst thing for them to have.

776
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Yeah, yeah, because it's the...

777
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,480
Because there's nothing... it's... they're fucked.

778
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,280
Yeah, no, there's nobody checking in on that.

779
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,780
Yeah.

780
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,280
Yeah.

781
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,080
No, not at all.

782
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,180
Once they figure out how to use it for evil, they will.

783
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,080
Honey, I want a video camera.

784
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,880
Yeah.

785
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,280
I want a video camera.

786
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,880
All I have to do is give them my credit card for shipping and they're gonna send me it for free.

787
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,580
all of a sudden your inheritance is gone, man.

788
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,460
- Let's see what's in the spam folder right now.

789
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,080
- I did when I was like six.

790
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,540
- When you were six. - Sixth grade, seventh grade.

791
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,180
I signed up because I wanted a Sony Handycam

792
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,020
and I got a spam email and then it came

793
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,620
to the credit card portion and I didn't have a credit card

794
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,340
but I still gave them all my info

795
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,860
and then I just couldn't open up my email

796
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,300
'cause it was like constantly full of just like scammer,

797
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,800
like, oh, like, "Win a Sony Ericsson phone!"

798
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,340
Just shit like that for so long.

799
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,200
- I signed up for Spotify or something

800
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,580
with my grandma's credit card when I was a kid,

801
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,020
and I gave her a $5 bill,

802
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,680
and she didn't realize that it auto-renewed,

803
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,100
and then maybe two or three months ago, she called me.

804
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,140
She was like, "You know, I've been getting these charges

805
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,300
"for this Spotify thing."

806
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,240
It's been like 10 years she's been getting charged.

807
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,580
- Damn, that's crazy.

808

It's not really a skit.

834
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Let's listen to the monologue.

835
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,300
First time in a couple months,

836
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,300
I go to this really nice fancy sit-down restaurant.

837
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,300
And of course, she's got to order the most expensive thing on the menu.

838
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,300
A Delft Whopper with cheese and fries.

839
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
Okay, so we do it.

840
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:08,300
I spent more time in than out, it's cheaper that way.

841
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,300
But the hard part is, I was with my parents, she was with her parents.

842
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,140
It's hard to get alone time.

843
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,140
So finally I get a break.

844
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,660
She calls me up and says, "Come on over.

845
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,540
There's nobody home."

846
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
So I ran right over.

847
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,940
I almost got hit by a truck.

848
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,100
I stopped at the convenience store.

849
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,940
I bought flowers.

850
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,340
They were good.

851
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,780
So I go to her door, I knock on her door

852
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,820
and nobody answers.

853
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,780
She was right.

854
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,860
There was nobody home.

855
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,700
- Oh, I got it.

856
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,540
- So I sent her a text.

857
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,020
I said, "Look, we've been going out for over a year

858
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
and this really isn't working out."

859
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,380
So she responds with a text

860
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,380
and I got all these emojis that I'd never seen before.

861
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,700
and believe me they would make George Carlin wash so I've been on the down low

862
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,140
lately I got a little bored so I decided to take up magic he's on the down stop

863
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:58,060

00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:21,780

868
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,340
That's why it's so hard for him to date. Yeah

869
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:30,420
Yeah, I guess that's true, huh? Yeah, he also almost got hit by a car or a truck. You got hit by a truck

870
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,660
Yeah, yeah, that's got to be hard. It's sad

871

I want I really want to see the flowers he bought they sounded so beautiful scary movie. He made yeah. Yeah me too

872
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,300
We should watch it. I would love to dude. Let's look at the spam folder a little bit more.

873
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,140
There's really nothing else. That's the only thing. I think we keep it pretty clean. You know, we're pros.

874
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:55,220
No, no penis ones. No, not even a single penis enlargement one. Not on the podcast. Have you

875
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:00,420
guys ever been curious about penis enlargement and about pursuing that field of study? Curious

876
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,620
about it? Yeah. No, I don't think so. Curious how? Yeah. Curious like maybe you fucking ordered like

877
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,880
Like a beginner kit, but not like the intermediate or like expert stuff.

878
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,920
Don't deflate it right now.

879
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Where did you find that?

880
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,260
Why are you, I told you don't touch anything on that desk.

881
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,580
That is, you can touch anything in the office except the stuff on that desk.

882
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,460
It's fragile and it's, and now you're farting.

883
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Listen to him fart everybody.

884
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,700
Oh, that's a long one.

885
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,840
Jesus Christ, what did you eat?

886
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,440
that does not a fart. It was a fart. It's not a fart from his

887
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,880
blue butt. Yeah, yeah, but what even were we talking about? It

888
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,100
doesn't matter. Let's just continue a new topic.

889
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:52,740
What was the craziest party you ever?

890
00:40:52,740 --> 00:41:04,640
You're my party. I want to my birthday with the horse in the

891
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,940
room. Oh, yeah, you went to a party with a horse in a room and

892
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,140
then I got covid immediately after from the course. Did you

893
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,240
ride that? Bang? I wish I knew why there was a pony in that

894
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,440
room. I wish I was a Shetland pony just walking around the

895
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,740
thing. I think I know exactly why so that everybody could

896
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,540
leave that party and say OMG. I went to a party with the horse

897
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,340
at it. Yeah. Yeah. What if we made a statue made of ****

898
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,140
turds and put it in the middle of the room and I guess that's

899
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:37,020
piss on it. They also had a Fender Rhodes piano in there. I went to a party with a statue made of turds that had piss on it.

900
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,380
That'd be the front page of fucking Encore magazine in every local city.

901
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,020
They had a Fender Rhodes piano and I took a picture of it. You took a picture of a piano?

902
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,780
Somebody asked me what the fuck are you doing and I said I've never seen one in person.

903
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:58,940
A piano? It was a Fender Rhodes it was from like '67. He's from like '67. Shut up. Shut the fu-

904
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,100
you're my best friend and my brother as well and my cousin and my mom. You're

905
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,400
bald now. Two bald guys just chilling at the fucking table. You can't even be mad

906
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,180
at me. I can't it's impossible. Because we're kindred spirits. Yeah. I will

907
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,080
say this definitely modulates the earring. Yeah. The earring has been

908
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,840
modulated. I think you're right. Yeah the earring has been modulated. You have a

909
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:26,780
modulated appearance. I put the, this is the smaller one that I had. Yeah. I put

910
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,820
the smaller one didn't because I was I was walking around and I caught had a

911
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,740
big hoopie I caught the I caught the thing I caught it swinging in my in my

912
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,940
side profile and I went oh dear everyone's gonna think I'm mr. clean no

00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:45,380
I don't know about that yeah I'm not so sure yeah maybe mr. dirty Tracy Ross

914
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:53,580
Tracy Ellis yeah that's what I thought when I saw if you were the big hoop

915
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,840
I'm hearing that's what I would think yeah kind of bill laker damn you would

916
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,040
actually know when I were talking about like being you being like a viking

917

935
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,860
I think that we could have done a hype house. Oh my god. If we had moved to LA instead of

936
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,620
New York City, we could have done a hype house. What do you think this studio is? This is

937
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:59,300
basically a hype room maybe. Perhaps. We're going to sleep. We have a sleeping guy in

938
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,480
in the corner just could be a sleeping snore on

939
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,980
didn't even blink. Oh, there he goes.

940
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:12,000
He got just bottled.

941
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,300
She got by hard.

942
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,600
Yeah, that's our new prank show. That's the closest. I've ever

943
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,200
actually do answers that this is the craziest party I've ever

944
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,600
been to. I saw someone throw a motherfucking bottle.

945
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,500
I did just get so hyper and now I kind of want to fucking talk

946
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,300
about stuff like Sonic. I almost bought a diet Mountain Dew earlier and if I did I

947
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,380
think I would have been a little crazier. I'm gonna Mountain Dew you. I'm so tired.

948
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,140
You're not supposed to say that at the awesome party we started. This is a pretty low energy episode I will say. I think

949
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,100
everybody's in shock because something changed. I was I was I was looking for I

950
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,740
was looking for something in my sleep last night. What were you looking for? I

951
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,140
have no idea I don't know I was looking I was I was awake in the bed and moving

952
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,980
everything around looking for everything and my girlfriend said go back to sleep

953
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,260
and I said no you told me to look for something I mean honestly knowing

954
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,820
knowing girlfriends she probably honestly fuck I love how I love how in

955
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:11,260
your sleep like no you told me to do this well I'm still asleep she probably

956
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:17,220
low-key fucking dead-ass did are you drawing don't draw on his head draw

957
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,500

958
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Christ, you have that on your head forever now.

959
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,000
What the fuck?

960
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That's fucked up.

961
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,500
That's not cool.

962
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
There's nothing on his head.

963
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,000
There's nothing on his head.

964
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,500
It is funny how every single...

965
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,000
There's nothing on his head.

966
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Every single story you have told about you sleepwalking,

967
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
in your dream state, you are the sassiest person in the world.

968
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,500
Yeah.

969
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,000
You're just like, "I'm..."

970
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,500
Don't close, don't open the window.

971
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,000
I want the window open.

972
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That's literally what I do.

973
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,500
I know.

974
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,000
This is, all these stories...

975
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,580
So there those are there also stories. I know are probably only funny to me,

976
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,580
but I think it's the funniest thing ever. No, it is very funny. I will say

977
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,800
they're going to age to wake up poorly when there's a Netflix documentary

978
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,400
about how I killed everybody and that'll each poorly to

979
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:09,100
it is so funny to me to wake up and have someone tell me you were so mean to

980
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,940
yeah, you were asleep. Yeah, I miss I haven't been sleepwalking that much

981
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,340
recently. That was the first time in a really long time that I did it last. I'm

982
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,560
multiple times, apparently multiple times like like multiple multiple like

983
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,440
close to ten have turned to whoever is in the bed with me and and told them

984
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,660
that they were my apprentice.

985
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:34,840
That's like a move that I do when I'm when I'm sleeping sleep talking is I get

986
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,440
up. I look right out and say you're my apprentice and then I go back to bed and

987
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,340
then one time I told my brother to make me a milkshake after I said he was my

988
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,040
apprentice. Well, like you're my purse. You grabbed me one time. I do not

989
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,700
fucking grab everybody I talked about that with fucking time it was not it was

990
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,260
not like it was not well it wasn't like a spooning grab or anything though you

991
00:47:52,260 --> 00:48:00,540
like you just you like monster grab me you just went like yeah yeah all of

992
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,940
Torea they're elected to sleep on the floor or don't know why you slept yeah

993
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,860
yourself you fucking lawnmower you sat there to go in John Deere and you think

994
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,740
you also you act like you act like you're the only person who grabs people

995
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,440
one tries to assault them in their sleep.

996
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,040
That's literally what we all do to each other all the time and

997
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,640
you're the only you're just too scared to do it.

998
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,140
Yep.

999
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,840
Me and Kayla Pierce love touching each other in our sleep.

1000
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,340
We're friends.

1001
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,140
We get our we're not intimate with each other.

1002
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:32,840
I'm afraid to be in the same bed as you and grab you in your

1003
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,340
sleep.

1004
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:33,840
Yes.

1005
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,440
You're afraid you're a pussy.

1006
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,540
You won't do that.

1007
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,140
You would rather sleep on the ground.

1008
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,440
You're actually in your sleep and sound like a fucking like

1009
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:47,440
the rock tumbler polishing a fucking stone. Yeah, then then actually come

1010
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,260
here and grab it. So I honestly think that you probably have some like

1011
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,260
list. I don't mean this as an insult. I'm serious. I'm fucking serious. Okay,

1012
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,480
that's how you know he's about to say something really nice. It's really nice.

1013
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,540
I honestly think after hearing you sleep probably fifty sixty times in my life.

1014
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,300
You have severe brain damage. You have

1015
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:16,440
There's no way that you do not have like like part brain death because of how

1016
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,640
little oxygen gets into your brain at night. I don't know that's what that's

1017
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,840
why you're probably where

1018
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:32,220
I had no idea has to be like so bad for you with the sound that that's me. It

1019
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:38,440
can kill you yeah yeah post Malone. It's killing it killed him. Yeah yeah. How

1020
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,420
Did you know, did you guys know that Post Malone is like um...

1021
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,620
His real name is

1022
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,960
Poston. You know he has a face tattoo that's always farting?

1023
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,220
Really? Yeah. That's sick. That's actually sick. He's like, I guess he's like a huge fan of

1024
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,740
Magic the Gathering

1025
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,260
and like for whatever, I think he's the highest profile celebrity that likes,

1026
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,720
like publicly likes Magic the Gathering.

1027
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,300
So Magic the Gathering make a ton of cards with just like him on them.

1028
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,300
And it's like so crazy, it's so fucking weird. They make a card where like

1029
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,300
they have like a normal wizard but they give him like post Malone's face.

1030
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,300
Jesus.

1031
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,300
He's dope dude.

1032
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,300
And they sell him for like a hundred dollars.

1033
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,860
He had a Bud Light collab.

1034
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,020
That's how you know you've made it.

1035
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,020
Oh yeah.

1036
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:23,180
If I can get a Bud Light collab before my dying death then that would be a dream come

1037
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,940
true for a guy like me.

1038
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,940
Yeah.

1039
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,060
Was it there was when Post Malone was first like on the up and up.

1040
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,740
I wish he'd post his Malone online.

1041
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:36,100
And like everyone is finding like his old shit where it's like you know there's like that

1042
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,100
song where-

1043
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,420
Yeah he used to be Rucka Rucka Ollie.

1044
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,420
Yeah.

1045
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,340
And then there's that one where he's singing that Bob Dylan song and everyone's like "Oh

1046
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,820
my god he's actually a good musician."

1047
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:50,060
It's like yeah he's like he just chose a different style of music.

1048
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,740
Yeah but people were- I mean you- wait so you think-

1049
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,340
So everyone was like-

1050
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,820
You admit right now that you think rap is music.

1051
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,820
You just admitted that.

1052
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,340
What do you mean?

1053
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,060
just admitted that you think rap is actually music and not just like

1054
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:10,980
talking. Moving on from the most embarrassing thing ever said on the

1055
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:17,740
podcast. It's rhythm and poetry. Yeah. Okay. And a melody? I don't think so. I have a song you should

1056
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,420
check out. What's that? It's called Walk This Way by Run DMC. No that's pure rock.

1057
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:29,500
Featuring Aerosmith. No that's a rock song bud. Buddy you're gonna be surprised.

1058
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,180
Yeah, well you're gonna be surprised when I lay you down flat. No. Yep. I'm there's no way in hell

1059
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,500
I'm going flat Noah is sleeping and looking exactly like cemetery in the

1060
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:44,740
Every single second his hair in his face. Oh, he's rubbing himself

1061
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:49,020
No, don't

1062
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:55,560
Rub your thing. Yeah, no kicking. Oh, yeah, we have two fucking clumsy cartoon characters sleeping

1063
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,980
Taking a picture every second. I know man. I wish

1064
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,220
(laughing)

1065
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:06,580
- It's Drake, picture of Drake.

1066
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,660
I wish I looked like Drake.

1067
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,380
I would say, if I could probably look like any person

1068
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,500
on earth and still retain my personality,

1069
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,220
I think Drake might be the one for me.

1070
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,040
- I might say Superman.

1071
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,820
- You wanna look like Superman but not be him?

1072
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,660
- If you looked--

1073
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,940
- No, if I looked like him, I'd probably be able to fly.

1074
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,380
- If you looked like Drake--

1075
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,980
- If I, I'll choose to look like Superman

1076
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,740
while he's in the sky and then I will be able to fly.

1077
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,860
- By the way, I don't mean be Drake,

1078
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,860
I mean look exactly like him while Drake still exists.

1079
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,500
If you looked exactly like Drake--

1080
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,340
- You just get away with a lot.

1081
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,500
- Wait, do you mean like--

1082
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,980
- Like look like him and walk around

1083
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,180
and people are like, "Oh, that's Drake."

1084
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,860
- You're white Drake or--

1085
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,100
- No, I would look exactly like--

1086
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,940
- Exactly like perfect copy.

1087
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,060
- If I could be born to be his--

1088
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,900
- So, okay.

1089
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,720
- I would become his--

1090
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,560
- I was gonna say, he would just probably be like--

1091
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,380
- I could be reborn--

1092
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,860
- You would probably just work at Subway if you--

1093
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,380
(laughing)

1094
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,020
- If I could be reborn as his identical twin

1095
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,860
separated at birth, but obviously we have a twin connection

1096
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,860
and one day we would link up,

1097
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,580
but that's a whole different story.

1098
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,460
- He sees you working at T-Mobile one day.

1099
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,380
- Exactly, he puts me on, right?

1100
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,140
And then I start doing shows,

1101
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,420
body double straight MF Doom style or a mom style.

1102
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:11,060
- Every recessive trait in the family line.

1103
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,900
So it's like--

1104
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,060
- I'm him with the most fucked up hairline ever.

1105
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,340
- Your hairline's way far back

1106
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,460
and your teeth, or your front teeth just don't exist.

1107
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,060
You're like, "You look just like me."

1108
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,780
(laughing)

1109
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,620
- Yeah, I wanna do that.

1110
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,100
- You were my baby brother by a little bit.

1111
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:32,060
I was born first. Yeah, I would do all that kind of 20 year old. Imagine if you made that

1112
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:36,740
wish with the genie to look exactly like Drake. You look exactly like Drake. Okay, you got

1113
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:41,580
your wish. You walk outside. Crazy homeless guy hits you in the face with a hammer. Oh

1114
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,900
my God. Wish wasted. That would suck shit. Can you imagine how much that would suck?

1115
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,340
It would suck even more than getting hit in the hammer normally. Do you remember that

1116
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:54,860
photo? Remember that photo of the guy who looks exactly like Drake sucking dick? Yeah.

1117
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,920
- That's Drake though. - That's such a funny picture.

1118
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,600
- That is Drake though. - That is Drake.

1119
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,120
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1120
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,560
- Prove it. - Did you know--

1121
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,360
- Look at the picture. - I don't know if you guys,

1122
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,600
did we already talk about this?

1123
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,660
How when you join the rap industry,

1124
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,860
all the music executives--

1125
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,700
- Oh, I don't know.

1126
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,700
- They would get you-- - We have definitely

1127
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,040
talked about it a bunch of times,

1128
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,940
but I don't know if we--

1129
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:16,200
- So it's crazy, I just found out this from this guy who,

1130
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,320
I don't remember his name, but he was, I guess, a rapper,

1131
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,740
and he was saying that apparently what happens is

1132
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:27,340
You get signed by like, you know, Interscope or Sony or whatever, and then they get you

1133
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,860
into a room, if you're a rapper, they get you...

1134
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,900
That really does look just like Drake.

1135
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,340
He's sucking after he's got cum on his face too.

1136
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,140
But yeah, they get you in a room and they say like, "Yeah, we want you to sign a deal

1137
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:46,680
or whatever," and then they fuck your butt and they get it on camera, and then they show

1138
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,140
you the video and they say, "You have to sign a 360 deal right now."

1139
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,220
And then that's why a lot of these rappers get messed up with their deals

1140
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,220
because of their...

1141
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,860
Who was the video who said that?

1142
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,740
His name was like Knowledge or something.

1143
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,980
Was that a Vlad TV interview?

1144
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,300
I think he did do a Vlad TV interview, but he also just did an interview where he was...

1145
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,300
Did he do a...

1146
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,260
He was just like a bunch of guys in a room and they were mostly talking about like sports

1147
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:12,820
and stuff, but he just randomly kind of chimed in with talking about this whole kind of factual

1148
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,820
situation.

1149
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,820
Yeah.

1150
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,460
It was on Mad TV, you said?

1151
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,460
No.

1152
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,460
Vlad?

1153
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,460
You don't know DJ Vlad?

1154
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,860
He's not a DJ. He's a guy with a, um, he's a pervert with a GoPro.

1155
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,980

producer on a real show like the Rachel Ray show or the Bill Maher experience

1178
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,140

00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,340
note you can't write if you were on listen if you are on fucking Rick and

1180
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:20,380
Morty you cannot write a note as a producer on a piece of towel paper and

1181
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,460
throw and show it to me and you definitely can't throw it onto the so

1182
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,140
you might actually be able to do that on Rick and Morty because they're kind of
