1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you're listening to Israel's number one podcast

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,800
you're a crap monster

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,320
did you get it? did you get it? I know it goes fast

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,040
that wasn't as fast as I was uh... thinking

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,340
I went as fast as I could on the countdown I was going

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,120
I mean that was fast

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,800
yeah I mean I could hear you that I could hear you mouthing Mississippi in

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,440
between the numbers just the smack of his lips and his saliva yeah it was right

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,560
here what was recorded

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:58,760
yeah counting all the milliseconds very softly yeah I hate that yeah I do hate

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,200
when people say moist because it means that I'm always into myself by accident

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,720
again I hate when people say the n-word that's probably that's yeah that

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,000
definitely yeah there's a I would say there's like five to ten words that when

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,720
people say that my shoulders kind of go up.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
You know?

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Yeah.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
And I can like picture it.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
I can like picture it when they say it.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,080
My shoulders don't go up like I'm curious or like I don't care.

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,480
They go up like I'm scared.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,720
Yeah, yeah, like you're protecting your neck.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Right, yeah.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
Yeah.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920
Yeah, my hair's stand on end because I'm trying to make myself appear larger.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Yeah.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Poop is another one of those.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,200
Yeah, I hold my hands up in the air and make scary motions with them.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Yeah, I wear a windbreaker.

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
[laughter]

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
And I make it really windy too.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
[laughter]

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Start blowing into it.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I use a bear horn.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
We're in a situation with a bear.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,200
I don't remember, are you supposed to make yourself very small or very big?

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
And it's important for me to know.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Very big?

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
There's very few animals where you're supposed to make yourself very small.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
[laughter]

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
See, I would go the other way.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,360
the bear like doesn't think I exist I would like that I think that's a better

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,120
one right cuz like a bear I'm never gonna make myself bigger than a bear that's

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,640
right the reality I've looked at my body and I've thought about this and I said

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,080
you can be kind of loud and you can you can but I could I could become so small

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,120
that a bear might forget about me like there's like to eat berries and stuff

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,280
though that's right they have they have a taste and a knack for really small

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,320
things like honey and fruit and and little bees yeah yeah don't eat bees you

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,880
guys are very see fucking stupid no they don't eat why do they always show them in

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,560
cartoons next to bees then cuz they're trying to get honey do it's like what a

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:55,040
monkey is next to a banana yeah but it's a banana if a bear can get one B that's

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,680
unlimited honey that's true that's true yeah I guess well that's it no yeah I

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,840
guess why don't bears start like bears are smart right like they know how to

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:15,160
fish maybe raising a good point it is very cool to see the bear do the like

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,920
the ninja trick with the stick that yeah that all day that's a great one they

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,360
learned how to stand it seems the last like three years yeah they kind of have

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,760
hands they basically houses a little bit they know you have to go in a cave you

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,920
can't just sleep on the ground like which is what we were doing for like too long

59
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,520
so they're doing pretty well I would say we kind of copied them there we I think

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,520
maybe they also invented like laying around all day yeah true yeah I guess

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,800
they did life hack yeah but I just feel like they should they like I don't know

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,200
I I don't think I can make a noise loud enough that a bear would be scared of me

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:08,160
the

64
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,560
bear with my car but that like otherwise I'm trying to make myself how high

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,080
completely disappear um higher than you would think honestly all right I would

66
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,920
say you should if you jump high over and over again that's also a good way to add

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,520
some size do you have this have like like their brains like process images

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,480
really slowly so maybe I think it's that they only see me on the frames when I'm

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,880
really high yeah there's only have six frames per day like a time-lapse all

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,200
hibernating creatures have a time-lapse vision yeah yeah so much of their time

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,680
yeah they interpolate it so if you jump up really high it's gonna look like

72
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,920
you're like a snake type thing that's very oh that's actually that's somebody's

73
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,200
new bears they come with motion smoothing on though yeah and yeah I

74
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,240
guess you have to reach behind the bears head and flick the little switch behind

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,480
its ear yeah I mean that is what I would do if I got attacked by a bear is I

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,880
would just remove his teeth and his claws so that he's no longer yeah also I I

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,380
I would I would accidentally kill him during like emergency surgery probably

78
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:18,820
I would I know I would maybe I would make some parts of my body really big

79
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,280
But not all of them like I might make my hands really big and then I could pick up the bears throw it

80
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
I'd become I'd become a homunculus

81
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,400
To kill the bears that can be as tiny as a spaghetti

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:41,040
Or I guess like another way to do do it is like look like like bears like to fuck right sure everyone

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,560
Everyone knows that. Except panda bears. Panda bears notoriously don't want to fuck. They don't want to fuck really?

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,760
That's why yeah, I mean they you

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,880
People show videos of pandas fucking to pandas and then they change the channel. They say what else is on

86
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,400
They can change the channel? Wow

87
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,720
I feel like you just look like a really like

88
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,480
unfuckable bear, you know, because like a bear if you look like a really good-looking bear, it's gonna want to fuck you and if you

89
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
look like a

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,640
Like a bear that it would want to fight, you know

91
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,520
But if you're trying to if you do like a really bad job seducing it

92
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,720
It's not gonna like try to look like the bear that a bear thinks of when it doesn't want to come too quick. Exactly

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
Yeah, yeah, you try to look like their grandma bear

94
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,920
I might I might try to look like I might try to look like the devil because I think they might have an instinct about

95
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
That to kind of avoid

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,300
Or a demon they might they might see a demon and think that's you know

97
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,880
That's might be evil for that is exactly how like a matador came into being as a profession is like what if what if a?

98
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Bull was scared of the Christian devil

99
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,840
Good show on our I

100
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,240
Guess that's true. Yeah, do they still do mad at bullfighting is that still legal?

101
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,760
I think so I think I don't know which one is which but people ride the bulls - still

102
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:08,160
There was a I saw a page something like like some week some guy holds the title for most gourd matador

103
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,160
That's sick dude. He has been gourd. Well. That's the thing about a matter about a

104
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Bull is it like it's really just it does not gonna bite you you know

105
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,280
Like it's like it only has like the horns and like its head

106
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,120
I guess like it's not gonna like all the feet are what fuck you up like like bear fighting is like way cooler and more

107
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,480
dangerous to me the feet what a

108
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,500
Bull if a bull steps on you it's gonna break all your bones is it in stilettos. I can take

109
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:47,680
If it had stilettos that would be serious stepped on you would crack you up

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,300
It'd be you'd be like a glove his elk that'd be like you're trying to kill me with your damn feet pussy

111
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:00,280
Yeah, it would suck if a bull had like the mouth of a hippo cuz then it could write you and it can gore you

112
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,380
Yeah, maybe like high-heel shoes. Yeah, the arms of a gun could be dangerous, too

113
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:14,720
Yeah of a big-ass gun

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
Hippos scare me because anytime I see a video of a hippo,

115
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,360
they don't look real to me, like at all.

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
They look like the shark from like the Jaws ride at Universal.

117
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,200
They're like animatronic.

118
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,640
They do look animatronic.

119
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,560
They're like the Arnold Schwarzenegger of animals

120
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
because at any time they could be replaced with like a polyurethane version of themselves.

121
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,840
They're inhuman in a way.

122
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,640
Yeah.

123
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,160
And they love watermelons.

124
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,600
Oh, they love them.

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,400
And my head is about as big as a watermelon these days.

126
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,480
I think they just like to crunch. I think it's the watermelons. That's the other thing is you

127
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,280
watch those videos none of that's getting in their mouth. They just like squish it and it just

128
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,200
falls out and you're like of course you have to feed them like 50 of these because like

129
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,880
of the rind is actually going down their hole. They're like cookie monster.

130
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,480
Yeah yeah yeah. They eat exactly like cookie monster. Yeah yeah.

131
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,080
But they should do more, I don't know, I feel like we're past the bull thing.

132
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,360
Like, make it, like I think people, I think animals should be, we should be able to kill

133
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,040
any animal at any time for no reason.

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,600
You know what I mean?

135
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,960
I think you pretty much can.

136
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,840
No, but like, okay, so like my brother, like maybe I should say this, my brother will-

137
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,640
Don't say it, I don't want to have to edit it out.

138
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
No, no, it's not, he's not in trouble.

139
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,640
but my brother sometimes will like bet on like chicken fights that are happening in Mexico

140
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:53,680
and then watch them on Facebook Live. So, and like that to me is like fine. Like two chickens,

141
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,720
like if two chickens have a blood feud, who am I to get in the way?

142
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
Yeah, that's between them.

143
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,480
Yeah.

144
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,600
That's between the chickens. I think that we should get past this issue of like,

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,160
you know it being inhumane to do to do bullfights are like to wrestle

146
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,840
alligators or whatever

147
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,040
by i think they should be breeding new animals just for it

148
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,400
human combat

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,440
just just yet breed new animals that would be satisfying to best in combat

150
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,640
exactly like a xenomorph to a style thing that's but it's a little different

151
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,960
something something that like represents exactly something that is a young

152
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,480
negative on the world and the ecosystem just combine all the invasive species in

153
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,720
the world

154
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,280
and then yeah and keep them in like a like a really poorly secured area

155
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,160
somewhere

156
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,160
right like a city yeah yeah you know

157
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,680
I feel like that's a good idea yeah and some size enhancement

158
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,000
ooze could maybe be developed in here to them as well

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,600
yeah and they should be bred to have like a glowing red weak spot so that

160
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,720
yeah it's multiple health bars to you

161
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,840
he said it up they should you should have to defeat them in stages

162
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,900
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we're like maybe charging up now now he has a shield at first

163
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,820
It's a bull and then mate perhaps it becomes a bull with a large head after you kill it

164
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,920
What this is what like the ancient Greeks do used to do all day. It's just

165
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,160
the scariest

166
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,440
They would think about it and be like, yeah, that's probably true

167
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,400
day now that i'm thinking about like a giant monster i think that that's

168
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,320
actually real i think that happened my brother who was a god

169
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,000
it's funny too that like they were kind of they were kind of on point for some

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
of it but then it's like because like you know they had the

171
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,320
chimera and it's like okay like the wings of a dragon which first of all

172
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,720
that's cheating you can't use a dragon in there

173
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,880
but that's terrifying right and then like yeah and uh and a lion and a snake

174
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,720
you know what else

175
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,780
a goat

176
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,480
that's also

177
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,380
that's how we make the scariest animal

178
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,560
we add a goat head

179
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
that's a whole head that you could be using for like

180
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
like i don't know a bear even a bear is better than a goat

181
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
yeah another snake

182
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,080
you use two snakes instead of one goat and a snake

183
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,260
exactly a goat that's just wasted

184
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,780
that's wasted real estate

185
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,040
that was also like the best kind of like religion because it was like

186
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,880
They would be like, with Christianity, you'll be like,

187
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,320
so where is God and stuff?

188
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,420
They'll be like, oh, he's all around you,

189
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,620
or he's in heaven, whatever,

190
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,920
like you'll never, you won't see it 'til you die.

191
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,600
And then with all that shit, they'd be like,

192
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
where are the gods?

193
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,900
And they'd be like, they're over there.

194
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,740
- Right there.

195
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,280
(laughing)

196
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,040
- You see that hill?

197
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,880
They're--

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,700
- Yeah, they live there.

199
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
- They're up there.

200
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,540
Can I go up there?

201
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,460
- I think I hear them fucking right now.

202
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,400
- Oh my God, and it's going really bad.

203
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,080
yeah they're fucking oh i think another monster might be coming

204
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,240
and then yeah they all huddle into a circle and they're like okay 100 heads

205
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,800
yeah yeah exactly yeah it's like the first lesson a baby

206
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,240
learns is i think i hear sex and a monster over there and the baby's like

207
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,840
i don't even know colors yet

208
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,120
yeah i like they they did also they had the guts to go to do half gods too

209
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
like not to you know like that and they're half gods it wasn't like it

210
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
wasn't like a jesus thing where it's like okay yeah like he's half god but he's

211
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,880
also just the same thing as god so you'll never see him or anything

212
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,960
but they were like yeah there was a guy he had this crazy spear and he was real

213
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,880
and he lived in this town with us yeah yeah um yeah because the coolest guy in

214
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,320
the whole town fucked some animal and then made him

215
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,440
yeah um i was thinking like do you think that there was like

216
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,880
Medusa eventually became just a woman with a head full of snakes, or do you think it started out as like she's disgusting

217
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,720
She's got one snake one worm one centipede

218
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,680
Yeah, it takes too long

219
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,920
Yeah, like did they like

220
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,220
Sit around like a windowless office like throwing a hacky sack like

221
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:22,440
big table with index cards like pinned up. Lion with a donkey dick. No that's not

222
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,560
good. They also have like 500 gods like they would just like they would

223
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,440
just be like oh yeah there's this guy oh they were just like oh shit fuck we need

224
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,240
a guy for a welcome mat we need a god that does welcome mats. That doesn't fit into anything.

225
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,200
God for boogers yeah yeah no we're not doing the booger God I told you I keep

226
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,720
telling you we don't need a the booger God is categorized under fire he's part

227
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,360
of the fire God yeah yeah does fire and boogers fine whatever what the fuck ever

228
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,160
yeah that all yeah all the gods have like some some like like RPG like like

229
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:17,960
specialization combo yeah he's proficient in in in flame warfare and streets it's

230
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:25,840
been he's the god of dessert - it's very funny - that that they had they had a

231
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,440
goddess of love but then they also had another god of love that was a baby

232
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,000
they're like yeah there's two love gods one of them's a beautiful woman the

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,120
There's a naked baby that flies around and it's

234
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:46,300
It attacks you with the bow and arrow yeah, yeah when he shoots you with a bow and arrow you want to fuck him

235
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:54,980
Yeah, you don't want to be a baby fucker you have to dodge the arrows

236
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,100
Yeah, that's the scariest part they could come out of anywhere

237
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Yeah, that was like trials and the law and order was like your honor. I got shot by the baby who makes you want to fuck him with his magic arrows

238
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,140
It's fucked up that that's the one that we got for Valentine's Day

239
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,820
We didn't get to go with Aphrodite like the beautiful love woman god

240
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,540
It's the naked baby

241
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
that attacks you and makes you fall in love

242
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,380
Because he also loves candy he's also the god of candy

243
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,140
he's the god of candy and school getting cards at school

244
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,100
he's the god of snow days

245
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,200
uh... and uh... i should get back into greek gods i think

246
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,420
i feel like every little boy was obsessed with it at some point

247
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,320
and maybe it's worth taking another look at as an adult

248
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,200
were you into like norse gods at all

249
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,320
no

250
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,100
i thought those ones were cool

251
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:07,100
No, there was this Indian kid who became a Nazi who loved Norse gods.

252
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Yeah, he's a weird person, but he became a real Nazi.

253
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
He sounds kind of problematic.

254
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Yeah, he's a bit odd.

255
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
But he was into Norse gods, and I was like, "This kid's a freak.

256
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
I don't want anything to do with that."

257
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,100
He's one of those kids that metal actually turned him racist.

258
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Oh, yeah.

259
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Yeah.

260
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,260
you have to be careful about that near metal is a that's it

261
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,060
it's a little bit slow there's a dark triad for now yeah i mean you can add on

262
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,620
or scott's

263
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,020
and then uh...

264
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,820
yet all i mean lord of the rings i think is the the third thing they're probably

265
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,040
metal

266
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,480
nor the rings for turning racist

267
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,620
r_u_k_ and what is it so that those things are all related to the lord of

268
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,580
the rings is based

269
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,740
what rings is actually based on norse mythology and many metal bands and

270
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,740
their iconography from Lord of the Rings so I just thought it would make a good try at.

271
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,140
Many Nazis latch onto the imagery.

272
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
Many Nazis.

273
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,820
It's true.

274
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,060
I don't think it's true dude.

275
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
It's true.

276
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,780
Lord of the Rings is like, no, it's just, Lord of the Rings isn't as racist as any fantasy

277
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
thing.

278
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,940
No, I don't think it's racist, but racist people think it is because they see like, oh, Gandalf

279
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,180
the white is destroying goblins and they're like oh I know what the goblins

280
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,980
are supposed to be and then they do that whole thing I know but they're just

281
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,380
stupid he made this for me yeah he wasn't yeah he's just an old guy who's

282
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,220
like I like to come up with words and language

283
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,220
Yeah, and this guy was named Borbalorbaloth and he was a wizard.

284
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
That's how it, that's how I always like...

285
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,220
He read, he read like Grimm's fairy tales and he was like, "I'm gonna make this into history."

286
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,220
Yeah, it's funny how no Nazis ever take like Star Wars as one of their foundational texts.

287
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,220
Yeah.

288
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Even though it's like the exact same thing.

289
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
Yeah, no one's like...

290
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,220
That's why I always like, like, C.S. Lewis more 'cause he's like so on the nose about like what it's actually supposed to mean.

291
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Like there's zero room for interpretation.

292
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Yeah, yeah.

293
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,940
Yeah, just like there's this lion and he died on a cross no died in a different way

294
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,240
But he died for your sin. I know we've talked about the whole Narnia thing before on here

295
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,420
But it yeah, it's so sick like there's I did in one of the books

296
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,940
They have like they have like a like a multi armed pagan god that ever that's like all the followers are evil

297
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,220
It's like yeah, and they have a tiny rat. Yeah. Yeah, like yeah, really like it's like whoa

298
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:46,620
a lion yeah wow so cool dude yeah and then I got into like like I loved those

299
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,940
books as a kid so I was like I'm gonna check out this guy's other shit and like

300
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,660
he has like a book that's like it's called like the screw tape letters and

301
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,940
it's about like the devil writing like notes to like a deal and he's like

302
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,820
what's up you have you made anybody do some evil recently he's like eyes yeah

303
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,140
you know same old same old I'm the devil it's pretty cool dude that is good

304
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,220
yeah is that like a required reading you had for your home school or that yeah

305
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,500
yes Lewis was was that was that was heavy dude we were coming heavy with the CS

306
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,040
Lewis yeah I learned so much it was it was a it was beautiful it was like CS

307
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:30,220
Lewis until you were 13 and then it was like Ayn Rand like kind of the opposite

308
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,700
person but like they really pushed it on you they were like she doesn't believe

309
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:57,700
in

310
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,380
book and shit it and then closed it. Oh my god. I can smell it through my microphone too.

311
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,140
It's like there's some kind of like update that lets me smell this. At least fucking wipe

312
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,900
your ass. No, not with your own face. It's so, one of the most disgusting parts is how

313
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,660
silent this poop is. I mean I can see it coming out, it's just not making a sound. That's

314
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,220
how smooth it's flowing. It keeps coming out. Oh my god, it just changed colors from like

315
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,780
a dark brown to a deep black halfway through. It looks like a magician's scarf coming out

316
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,180
Oh my god. It keeps changing colors.

317
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,740
Oh what is this? Green? That's unhealthy man.

318
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,380
Oh fuck.

319
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,980
Oh he just framed a piece of it and it squished all over the frame.

320
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,780
Oh he's back now.

321
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,180
[laughter]

322
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,780
Okay.

323
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,280
How was that?

324
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,980
Something got squished?

325
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,180
Oh yeah. Yeah, something got squished.

326
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,280
For sure.

327
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,780
Yeah.

328
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,280
Yeah.

329
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,780
Absolutely.

330
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:51,180
The head of my peepee by my index finger and thumb when I was squeezing the peepee out got squished.

331
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,380
You don't squeeze the peepee out.

332
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,380
Sure you do. Yeah.

333
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
What?

334
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,540
Yeah, you drain, because the tip of your head, the head of the penis is like a sponge and

335
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,980
then it fills up with pee and then you have to strain it.

336
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
That's not true.

337
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
That's not how it happens.

338
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,260
No, you don't have to pizza roll your penis to get the pee out.

339
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
It's not like an icing bag either.

340
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Yeah, like a tube of toothpaste.

341
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
So don't say that.

342
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,660
No, I just said it's not like an icing bag or a tube of toothpaste or, it's not anything

343
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
like that.

344
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,220
And it's not, there's not a lever either that drops the payload.

345
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,900
So don't try and use that excuse.

346
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Okay.

347
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,860
then what were you guys talking about? Just you shit all over the place.

348
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:39,340
For that you do have to need your colon like it's a... I mean that is

349
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,700
actually true yeah I kind of like I when I take a shit I like go into the fetal

350
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:49,660
position I have to like rock back and forth and my my the shit is like yeah it

351
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:55,740
it like has to like somehow kind of like one of those ball maze puzzles like fall

352
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,740
finally to the end through my I do like a type of like you watch pot doesn't never

353
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,060
boils type of thing so I don't try to like make too much of an effort I just

354
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,620
kind of sit down there and go you know whatever happens here happens either way

355
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,060
and I just wait something that you learn in adulthood is that you don't have to

356
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,100
push so hard you can just you just give it a dull roar and then you kind of have

357
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,220
to not care. And you kind of just say out loud, like, I don't even care, you know, whatever,

358
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,060
whichever thing happens right now is fine with me. You got to do reverse psychology to your

359
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,420
butt every time you go to the bathroom. Yeah. You just kind of have to say, like, I'm feeling

360
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,420
normal about this either way. It's just, hey, I'll be happy if I do or I don't. It doesn't

361
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,380
matter. I don't give a shit. I don't take a shit. If I just have a long fart here, that's

362
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,300
fine I'll still tell everybody I pooped that's better yeah yeah flush the toilet

363
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,700
- yeah I'm gonna like I came in here and jerked off or something so I'm just

364
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:02,460
gonna sit here as far because if you did jerk off you would also leave it on the

365
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,660
bath mat yeah we just leave the toilet you leave it on the belly button dude I

366
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:13,780
I don't want to clog everything up leave it on the belly button and he just yeah, it dries dude

367
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:29,300
Guys

368
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,660
Some guy on the street just spit directly into my belly button.

369
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Isn't this weird?

370
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
It's the weirdest spit I've ever seen.

371
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,740
Oh my god, he was like gargling salt water beforehand or something so the consistency

372
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
is just bizarre.

373
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Ugh, it's so weird.

374
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,340
Ugh, and it won't wash off.

375
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,700
It keeps getting stuck.

376
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,260
This guy's got the weird spit.

377
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,420
I actually forgot to tell you but I did shower and it kind of like cooked like it was egg

378
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,780
whites.

379
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:04,540
Why does cum hate hot water so much? It's like fucking crazy dude. Like why is it like

380
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:13,100
yeah every time I like have cum on my body which is not often but when I do I forget

381
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,620
and I'll wash it off with hot water all of a sudden I have like a like a patch of like

382
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:23,220
tachyderm like stuck to my fucking to my it's so you can use it to seal stuff up if you

383
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
need to.

384
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,920
that's how you use canning back in the day.

385
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,760
- Yeah. - Right.

386
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,600
- It's the body's mayonnaise,

387
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,620
it holds the whole sandwich together.

388
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,860
- They used to, cavemen used to seal the doors

389
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,200
to their caves like that,

390
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,660
so that no creatures could come in in the night.

391
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,500
- Oh. - Yeah.

392
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,940
They would all play the cookie game

393
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,620
at the entrance of the cave.

394
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,020
- Right, yeah. (laughing)

395
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,860
- Well, yeah, they had the cookie game.

396
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,700
- Yeah, with the big round door.

397
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,820
- Yeah, it was originally a big round slab of stone

398
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,660
that they would roll into place.

399
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,420
- Yeah, it was called the Rocky Game.

400
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,260
- Yeah. - Yeah.

401
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,980
- And then once cookies were invented,

402
00:25:52,980 --> 00:26:00,460
were like oh this is actually a lot easier let's just do this this is a lot

403
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:12,400
better than rolling around yeah cuz you can't you can't have like eight people

404
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
sit around a square. It doesn't make any sense. It has to be a circle.

405
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Someone's going to get the corner. It's going to be really uncomfortable.

406
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Yeah, it needed to be a circle.

407
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Yeah. Hey, speaking of inventions.

408
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Hey. Dude, you're a master. Yeah, pretty easy for me. You're a fucking master.

409
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Today's list is from the top 10's.

410
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Top 10 most wanted inventions.

411
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,400
make life easier or more interesting. As simple as possible in a complex world.

412
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,600
What do you guys need?

413
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,200
What's the hole in your life that you need to fill with an invention right now?

414
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Hmm...

415
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,400
I guess, like, I wish I had the equivalent of a cyanide capsule, but it was just a

416
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,000
like a snack, like an internet snack. That's a really good idea.

417
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, like a cyanide tooth, but it's like a... it pops a Jolly Rancher into your mouth.

418
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah. It could be nice to have something like that's soft

419
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
to be in between me and the floor when I'm sleeping.

420
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,920
Could be a nice invention that I would enjoy.

421
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,880
I might need. The Jolly Rancher thing would be good too because like if you

422
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,200
were ever in a situation where someone was going to kill you

423
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,880
you'd be like you act real smug and be like "huh yeah sure"

424
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
and you they see you like pop the tooth in your mouth and then you go like

425
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,400
yeah

426
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:43,840
"how did you do that I can't kill you now" I was

427
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,960
I was thinking about this like a probably a few weeks ago just like a like I just

428
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,240
I was just imagining a guy walking around like licking a blue lollipop a bunch and

429
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,000
then it's going blah and his tongue is just like a disgusting brown.

430
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's half on.

431
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's like a horrible like this gray brown color.

432
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Have you heard of black hairy tongue?

433
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
No, what's that?

434
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,300
Black hairy tongue is a disorder you get when you don't wash your tongue enough

435
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,800
and it literally just becomes black and hairy.

436
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
What? Wait, what?

437
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Black hairy tongue.

438
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Black hairy tongue.

439
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,300
I thought that was gonna be like a food item.

440
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,300
No, it's called black hairy tongue.

441
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
What the fuck?

442
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,800
That's just hair.

443
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,300
Holy shit, dude.

444
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,800
What?

445
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,300
And it's called black hairy tongue.

446
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,820
it's not

447
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,620
what you know that i'm going on

448
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,220
fighting like the most fucked up guy here it is not like three t_v_ he's always

449
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,500
sticking his tongue out at you can see like that away i think that we are

450
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,300
different neighborhood might actually be a medical mystery

451
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,020
woman diagnosed with a very black tongue after car crash

452
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,500
falling from a car crash

453
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,100
uh... no

454
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,460
maybe if you like

455
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:16,460
I don't know. If you hit like an animal. If you crash into a porcupine or something.

456
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,020
If you had like a rat in your mouth before you crashed and when you crashed it like jolted

457
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,540
all the hair off. It like road rashed on your tongue and took

458
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,380
all the hair off. That's gross. There's a guy in my neighborhood

459
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:36,380
who's like a shopping cart guy who has like a volcano on his hand and it's pretty cool.

460
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:42,220
And he like licks it like I'll be like walking in the subway. I'll be like you like look at it scratch it

461
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,620
They go yeah, that is his little Jolly Rancher a capsule

462
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,100
Infinite snack

463
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,460
Yeah, it's just pus and salt

464
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,580
Good for him. I gotta wean myself off

465
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,380
I'm a hit this too hard

466
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,740
One is teleportation device

467
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,540
There's a comment here

468
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,220
I guess that's a good idea

469
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,620
But then humans can get into way more trouble this way and cops won't be able to find any criminal since they can just teleport to

470
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,220
Africa or something. I think it's a bad idea, but it's my opinion

471
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,140
I'm gonna go to Africa where everything is legal because I'm a criminal

472
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,740
Yeah

473
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,780
Too big to find anyone that's true. Yeah, you can hide forever

474
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,540
This type of invention/machine is needed by us for a long time.

475
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,540
It will turn the human lifestyle.

476
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Some of our scientists are working on this project.

477
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
"Human lifestyle" all caps.

478
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,540
That's a lab manager there.

479
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
Yeah, working on that.

480
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,540
And "Human Lifestyle" is all first letter capital.

481
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,540
Yeah, and it's going to be turned.

482
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Teleportation would be awesome.

483
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,540
You could get from the kitchen to the bathroom in half a second.

484
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
That happens to this guy every day.

485
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,480
Kitchen the bathrooms the funniest combination of room

486
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:10,700
Microwave cheese, it's in a bowl of water

487
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,780
Taking the last bite and then just staring down like

488
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:22,180
Take me an hour to get to the bathroom

489
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,340
Ain't gonna happen to forever

490
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,140
teleportation would be... go ahead.

491
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,140
teleport back home after school/work

492
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,140
this guy hates taking the bus but he also loves going to school and work

493
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,020
this will be absolutely awesome when it comes out

494
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,220
Dallas cheerleaders beamed into my living room

495
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,220
yeah you can teleport on whoever you want

496
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,380
anywhere you'd like

497
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,060
at any point in time

498
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,980
teleportation would be so cool and then that emoji with the heart eyes

499
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,020
if i could teleport it would be even go ahead it would be going either away from

500
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,940
danger or to a relatives for a holiday

501
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,220
that again kidnappers could step in take a kid and step out with the kid

502
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,740
also nobody would walk again just teleport with a very comfortable chair

503
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,660
to every place and could easily brought a store or bank

504
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,420
i love it no one ever says the limits of teleportation they just talk about

505
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,500
how it's completely unlimited technology and you can do the worst thing that i can

506
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,100
come up with. It's so funny to me, if i could teleport i'd either go on vacation or

507
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,700
teleport away from danger.

508
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,260
That's my top thing is

509
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,560
i would be able to escape from danger if i could do that.

510
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:42,820
This comment says you could go anywhere you want with a thumbs up emoji.

511
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,900
And then right below it, yes i want teleport all caps.

512
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,180
So they're imagining a scenario where there's no like, like, uh, cinder and receiver.

513
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,780
You can just, you kind of, you're like, you're like, you're like, everyone's going everywhere.

514
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,280
Yeah.

515
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,980
Yeah, I guess it is.

516
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,700
Control.

517
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,580
That would be cooler.

518
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,300
I want to move through this list quick because I want to get to the stuff that's like past the top

519
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,180
10 here.

520
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,740
Okay.

521
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,300
Number two.

522
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,660
You're actually all really good inventors.

523
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Yeah, they're just very clever inventions.

524
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,860
Number two, time machine.

525
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,580
I mean, I wouldn't have ever come up with this is the thing.

526
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
I wouldn't have been able to think of this.

527
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,580
[Laughter]

528
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,580
He says, "What happens if you kill your grandfather then? Wouldn't it be a paradox?"

529
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
[Laughter]

530
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
Yeah man, I mean, I guess.

531
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
[Laughter]

532
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,580
If I had a time machine, I would go...

533
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,580
I would kill Hitler and stop Abraham Lincoln from dying and give cavemen iPads.

534
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,580
I would also try to change the world by giving Indians machine guns.

535
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,540
guns and i would give missiles and food to dinosaurs so they would still be alive today

536
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:52,380
wait you say missiles for dinosaurs? missiles and food so they can defend themselves

537
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:58,060
yeah i guess that's fair yeah i would see my grandma

538
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:05,580
it is really funny that like the paradox of time travel is like you can't like kill a family member

539
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,580
Like that's like as if that's like whatever was gonna go. Yeah, you can't do the most horrible thing

540
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,940
Something you wouldn't really want to do

541
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:22,580
Okay, so if you go back in time and fuck yourself as a little baby like why what would happen

542
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,420
I'd used it to go to where back when a doof Hitler

543
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:33,840
To art school and force the school to enter just so World War two would not happen

544
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:42,100
I would go to my grandparents' teenager days, and I'm going to talk to them.

545
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Number three, the cure for deadly diseases.

546
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
That's pretty good.

547
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Yeah.

548
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Yeah, someone should invent that.

549
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Yeah, that'd be a really great, really strong invention.

550
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,100
That'd get a lot of likes on Shark Tale.

551
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Number one top disease that has claimed more lives is heart disease, also called cardiovascular disease.

552
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,100
A way to less likely have this disease or getting rid of it works with the person eating a specific vegetable,

553
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,520
vegetable even though it might not have a pleasant taste at all but could be

554
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,860
reduced with a mixture of fruit or put into capsules. Awesome. That guy's a genius.

555
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,660
These diseases are deadly we need to stop them.

556
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,740
Number four, animal communicator.

557
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,780
Okay, this is like a sci-fi gadget that translates.

558
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,060
yeah I guess is it gonna how do we make this because I am planning to make this

559
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,100
for my invention I am in seventh grade so I hope this isn't that hard for me to

560
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,820
make so if someone knows how to make this or like a website that would be perfect

561
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:51,340
oh that would be perfect if anyone has a website if anyone has a website might be

562
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,700
a long shot but maybe one of you has a website that teaches you how to make an

563
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,500
I'm a communicator because I am in seventh grade.

564
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Yeah, and I'm planning to invent this.

565
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Hi fishy fishy.

566
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Hi fishy fishy.

567
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Destroy it!

568
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
He's at once.

569
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Hi fishy fishy. Don't let him talk back.

570
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Destroy it.

571
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Can you imagine like how

572
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
how would a fish react if you could just

573
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
make yourself understood to it just for like

574
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
just like two

575
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
seconds like it would have just

576
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
a new reaction because like when a fish gets

577
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,160
it wouldn't get scared right it would know

578
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,180
willfully swimming around issues can only swim

579
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,640
yeah i think that's like i think it would be actually get up to anything is

580
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,980
swimming or died i think it would do something new that we haven't seen

581
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,300
before i think that's the key to getting a fish to do something other than swim

582
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,900
might be to say hi fishy fishy

583
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,380
i think i think she did see in my fish

584
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,300
blinked

585
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
uh...

586
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,380
uh...

587
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,620
what

588
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,340
yeah not know yet i lives but he did blank

589
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,300
This one's good, this comment, "We would understand our pets."

590
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
I mean, you does not want to do that.

591
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
[laughter]

592
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:05,060
Uh, number five, "Instant learning. Download knowledge directly to brain."

593
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
[laughter]

594
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,460
Hmm, that's pretty good.

595
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,820
It is, yeah.

596
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,220
This way we wouldn't have to go to no dumb school.

597
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,860
True.

598
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,820
That would be called cheating in school, but still awesome.

599
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,620
As would a brain internet chip, so one can see the internet before their very eyes, via the chip.

600
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:29,140
I am 10 years old but I know how to do it

601
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:37,300
genius children on this website if this were to happen because they think that

602
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,060
these are the only adults that are worth impressing is the adults yeah if this

603
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,940
were to happen it would add at least 12 years to a person's life to live

604
00:37:45,940 --> 00:38:10,940
is

605
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
a ton of movies probably.

606
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Yeah.

607
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Oh yeah.

608
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
Watch it with my eyes closed.

609
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,940
Yeah.

610
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,340
Oh, I would bookmark addicting games.

611
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,500
Yes, yeah, I'd be on E-Bomb's World and I would play Frank's Adventure and I would skip

612
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,500
to the part where you see Barney Rubble's wife's boobs.

613
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,900
Yeah, I would just download all the victory screens of all the math games and I wouldn't

614
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
even have to play them.

615
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Damn.

616
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,480
Instead of like seeing a really fucked up crazy guy, you would just see a guy and automatically

617
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,520
know that he has salad fingers on there.

618
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,900
You would know, okay, he's watching salad fingers.

619
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:48,380
fingers. Yeah, you have been deranged by salad fingers. Yeah. Number six, a device to record

620
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:57,780
your dreams. Um, no. Here's a comment. I don't care for that. I don't really. Here's a comment

621
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:09,580
though. Dick in my booty. Okay. Okay. And what's the comment, Kim? Oh, shit. If I had

622
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,060
I would I would show all my friends my dreams all the time

623
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,460
Yeah

624
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,540
It'd be funny to show your friend like be like okay like just have a bunch of like like

625
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,580
Sex dreams and stuff and then be like oh finally

626
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,740
I had just like a funny dream that I could show my friends and showing them and they're like they're really

627
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,500
You forgot that like in the background

628
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:37,180
Tanya says top

629
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,460
True, okay, very cool

630
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,500
It would be cool imagine recording a dream about having se star

631
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,860
Yes, oh, yes

632
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,580
I'm seven pretty fucked up sex dreams when I was in middle school

633
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,540
Yeah, I remember

634
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,060
Yeah

635
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,000
Just like the the weird kid in school the kid who was always like pretending he was turning into the Hulk when he didn't get

636
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,920
A math question right yeah dream that you know he came on my face

637
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,380
that one

638
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
The whole kid? The whole kid.

639
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,940
The first time I ever lucid dreamed it was like my cousin like

640
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,860
got a new girlfriend and I like

641
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,740
felt I took a nap and I like started lucid dreaming and I was like, oh my god, I can do anything.

642
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,320
So I imagined myself getting a blowjob from her.

643
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,820
That was the entire dream and then I woke up and I was kind of like hmm.

644
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Oh hey you two.

645
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,580
Is everything still okay with you guys?

646
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,920
Yeah, I remember having like what was basically a lucid dream like I was about to sort of seal the deal with a

647
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,460
With a pretty girl from my high school

648
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,640
And then I guess at a certain point like right when I was about to happen she was like I can't do this

649
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,820
I'm a lesbian

650
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:54,520
And then she goes and hangs out with the girl and I I remember waking up right after that and I was like I knew

651
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
I was dreaming. Why did I make that happen?

652
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,960
Because I thought it would be a good story because I thought it would be a funny twist

653
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,240
That's the only thing like hotter than having sex with a girl I guess is like being like

654
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,760
one second from having sex and she's like I'm a lesbian.

655
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,000
That is awesome.

656
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,400
That's seriously fucking cool.

657
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,800
I'm gonna go have a dream about this now.

658
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,120
Number seven, saltwater desalinator.

659
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,680
I don't care.

660
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
I don't think I care either.

661
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:38,080
I don't care at all. Also everyone in the comments are saying this already exists. I know how to make one

662
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I can make this in an hour

663
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,560
Does it exist? I think it does I don't think to make something exists that is worth

664
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,200
Yeah, it's not going to make it but I'm going to make it cheap and fast

665
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,840
Okay. Well, it sounds like sounds like these people have got it locked down. Just nobody thought to do it yet

666
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,400
number eight invisibility cloak less of an invention and more of a

667
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,740
magical relic well yeah like once you make it a

668
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:11,880
Now I'm a true ghost

669
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,320
It's a comment I'll purely be the phantom of the night

670
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:31,460
Yeah, no, that's not a good if they said invisibility device that's the right a device is an invention a cloak is is a magical

671
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,140
Yeah, that's an artifact. Yeah, I don't like that.

672
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:44,100
Number nine, a device for remembering everything. Yeah. Yeah. Why not? I mean, I'll take it, I guess.

673
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,860
I think this device will be great for students to remember their lessons, even older people,

674
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,980
to not forget or lost something. But on the other hand, it may be a bad invention for some people by

675
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,060
remembering bad memories that will cause them to have depression. Yes. That's a good point.

676
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Santa has that

677
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:26,340
This one this is like a Bill Maher voice comment, maybe which is there is something called a diary I

678
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,780
I imagine Bill Maher doing the Santa one too.

679
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,780
Yeah.

680
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,300
Santa has that.

681
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,940
Here's one, here's another one for him.

682
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,580
So annoying for me.

683
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,300
It's very weird if this device exists in this world.

684
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,820
Ah ha ha, colon D.

685
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,380
It's already been invented.

686
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,020
Yeah, it's called the to-do list.

687
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
I need this very...

688
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
And Santa has it.

689
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,020
(laughter)

690
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,020
And Santa already has it.

691
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,020
It's called the naughty nice list.

692
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,020
I need this very urgent

693
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,020
and I forget everything

694
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
even mostly on where I place things at.

695
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
(laughter)

696
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,020
Bill Maher's like the biggest atheist in the world

697
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
but he believes in Santa.

698
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,020
(laughter)

699
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
He's talking about some fucking Republican

700
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,020
built Republicans trying to

701
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
filibuster the healthcare bill

702
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,020
this week. Enjoy the

703
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,020
naughty list from Santa.

704
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,020
[laughter]

705
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,020
Okay, so I guess there's an

706
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
infinite being who judges

707
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,020
you. Yeah, I think that we already

708
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,020
have a name for him.

709
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,020
He's Santa and he's real.

710
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
[laughter]

711
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,020
He has a device for remembering everything.

712
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,020
And he has tons of different

713
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,020
devices.

714
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,020
He's basically

715
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,020
a device collector.

716
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,020
He invented a big bag

717
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:59,020
that reindeer carry.

718
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:04,820
Have I ever seen him? No, but uh... I do have

719
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,880
the power of belief on my side.

720
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,820
Number ten is hoverboard.

721
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,140
Okay.

722
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,620
Santa does have that actually. This has already been invented are being sold

723
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,620
widespread as of 11/13/2016.

724
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,340
This shit's not a fucking hoverboard, dude.

725
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,340
It's a wheel. It's on wheels, man.

726
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:28,840
Yeah.

727
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
Stupid-ass bitch.

728
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
I hate it!

729
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,340
I hate it.

730
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,340
I hate that thing!

731
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,340
I don't care if Santa has it. I hate it and I don't want one.

732
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,340
Mm-mm.

733
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,840
And if he puts it in my stocking, I'm gonna freak out because I heard those things effing explode.

734
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,840
They do explode. I forgot about that.

735
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
I heard they effing explode, so maybe I don't leave a bomb in my stocking.

736
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,340
Yeah.

737
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,340
Oh, yeah. Let me just ask for a bomb for Christmas. Let's skip all the bullshit.

738
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:58,340
it

739
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:05,340
bad idea

740
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,820
They get good. They're stepping it up here. They step it up a little bit. Awesome.

741
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:13,340
Um, just skip around here. Number 12 is Mind Reader.

742
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:20,380
Um, cool. Tropical J- Tropical J says, "Bad idea. The human brain is fickle."

743
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:26,780
It's unreadable. Everyone would end up destroying each other.

744
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:33,340
I don't want this. Mine should be Privet. Espe- Especially mine.

745
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,600
(laughing)

746
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,720
- Number 13, flying car.

747
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,920
- Yup.

748
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,960
- Possible and could revolutionize the oil crisis.

749
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,820
- Shut up.

750
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,640
- It's true.

751
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,480
- It's true.

752
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,580
- Yeah.

753
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,120
- I wanna revolutionize a crisis.

754
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,920
- Santa literally does already have this too.

755
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,760
- Flying car.

756
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,600
- He straight up has a flying car.

757
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,720
That's what a sleigh is.

758
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,000
- Yeah, exactly.

759
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,520
- That's literally all it is.

760
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,600
- 14, battery with long life.

761
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:08,600
not to not into this life i'm too lazy to charge my battery

762
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,480
uh...

763
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,000
true they want us to recharge our batteries but if you can find a way to

764
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,920
charge the normal batteries are changing batteries in the long life ones are at

765
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,280
least make it a longer time before it has to be recharged you can have the

766
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,280
patent and make it suitably for the kids

767
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,700
straight idea to make money

768
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,760
number seventeen aids detector

769
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,120
I wish they had it. I wish they had it. I think they can tell if somebody has AIDS already.

770
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,800
I don't think they're just guessing. Yeah, but you have to go to the hospital. You want

771
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,880
to know if the guy next to you on the bus has it. Oh, yeah, like a metal detector. Yeah.

772
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:50,080
Okay, or an EMF reader. You just walk around just embarrassing people. And Santa has that.

773
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,180
And Santa does have that. That's how he decides if naughty or nice list. I really like this

774
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,280
It's like next run in a row from 19 to 22. I just want to read all these in a row

775
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:06,180
because okay so but number 19 bioengineered meal fruit that provides

776
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,180
100% of nutritional needs and can be grown in home garden number 20 batteries

777
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,680
that work forever number 21 a machine that can communicate directly with your

778
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:24,240
minds number 22 is glow in the dark trees

779
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:36,520
from amber star 120 is no more terrified kids screaming through your window at

780
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:45,640
night. Ah, these dark trees! I can't see the trees. I can't see these trees. Can you help me in there?

781
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,320
Yelling into somebody's window. Open the window! Open the window, the trees are so dark out here.

782
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:59,880
Do these trees look dark to you? Wow. All the kids in the neighborhood. Vehicles that can transform

783
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,940
into planes or boats.

784
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,940
Robot Woman/Man.

785
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,180
Either one is fine.

786
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,620
Whichever they invent first.

787
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,260
Cosmetically appealing.

788
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,260
No intelligence required.

789
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,260
I wonder what they want.

790
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,780
I wonder if they want a man or a woman robot.

791
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,380
Number 27's wireless electricity.

792
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:32,020
28 is a nutritional biscuit that has one sixth of minimum complete daily nutrition for a pregnant

793
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,500
woman per biscuit.

794
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,500
And the comment here that says "would be great for geeks too."

795
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,820
Yeah, nerd, what are you eating?

796
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,740
A nutritional biscuit that has one sixth of minimum complete daily nutrition for a pregnant

797
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,900
woman per biscuit?

798
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,860
Let me correct you on that, pregnant woman or geek.

799
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,220
Okay, so you are a nerd.

800
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,480
This is a good one-two punch.

801
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,580
Number 30, a light-speed spacecraft.

802
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,820
Number 31, a fast elevator.

803
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,720
(laughing)

804
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,820
- That would be actually dangerous

805
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,160
because of the extreme G-forces

806
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,700
and it would crush our bones.

807
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,800
- I need a very deep imagination for this.

808
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,040
(laughing)

809
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,440
- Automatic roller skates.

810
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,940
- Yup, color-changing clothing.

811
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,040
- Okay, glasses that automatically adjust

812
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,740
for perfect vision.

813
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,880
- That could be pretty nice.

814
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,160
So that means they don't do anything if you already have perfect vision.

815
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,760
Yeah, they don't do anything.

816
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,520
Good for the old people, as somebody says.

817
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,400
But are people's prescription needs changing so rapidly that you would need...

818
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,520
Oh, mine change every day.

819
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,480
It's just that the manufacturers can just make one lens.

820
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,400
Oh, so they don't have to make any...

821
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,520
Okay, they just have to make a computer lens that changes the glass all the time.

822
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,520
Right.

823
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,760
Glasses could just be computer screens that show you things instead of this.

824
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,360
You don't have glasses, Pierce?

825
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Mm-mm.

826
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,440
I thought you had glasses.

827
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,480
I do seem like the type of kid who would try and sit too close to the TV every night to

828
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,480
try and make yourself-- Just to get myself?

829
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,480
Yeah, just to get glasses.

830
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,480
Oh, yeah.

831
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,840
Sometimes for Christmas I ask for non-prescription transition glasses, which is-- it is truly

832
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,240
the most autistic thing you can own.

833
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
Yeah.

834
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,520
It's just an announcement that you have nothing going on socially.

835
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:26,520
Yeah, I've gotten glasses twice and the first time I was like I really wanted glasses and

836
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:32,400
I was like a kid so I just like completely like through the vision test like I just said

837
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,820
all the wrong letters and numbers and stuff and I never thought of like getting just non-prescription

838
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,720
glasses so I just had these glasses that just made everything just invisible just like it

839
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,440
like it's like the highest prescription and my mom's like I didn't know you had

840
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,320
such terrible eyes and then they give you tiny eyes yeah no they give me big ass

841
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:57,420
eyes okay I can picture you wearing glasses that give you tiny little eyes. You can't picture that.

842
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,840
Yeah I can picture it too. I yeah no I would no you look like a little goober I'm

843
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:09,620
closing my eyes and picturing right now. Stop. Number 41 is a way to grow

844
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,820
any wings you like.

845
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,340
This would be mutation.

846
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,500
Not a good idea if you ask me.

847
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,180
I'd have bird wings that are feathery and white and black tips.

848
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,620
I'd have flame wings.

849
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,620
#39.

850
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,620
An easy way to come up with an invention.

851
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,620
That would be nice.

852
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,620
That would actually be really nice.

853
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,660
I've written more than 13 idea books.

854
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,260
I am interested in printing them as an idea generator.

855
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,340
Once they are published, the inventions and ideas contained within each shall be given

856
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,740
freely to anyone that reads the books or is interested.

857
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,780
I'm giving all rights to the invention away.

858
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,100
Be blessed and stay safe.

859
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,100
Mitchell S. Lankford.

860
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,580
Wait, can we search that name?

861
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,500
I did, he has a magnetic mind master class.

862
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,180
We have to get this guy's books.

863
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,180
Can we order those books and read them on the show?

864
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:05,540
Oh, I guess it's magnetic mind master class, but I thought it was magnetic mind master.

865
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,300
michael s langford angel investor

866
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,300

more than thirteen

868
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,940
why is this guy on the top tens? he's in a suit

869
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,080
maybe it's somebody impersonating him

870
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,780
could be i guess

871
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,740
i'm gonna search magnetic mind masterclass

872
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,700
um...

873
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,140
number forty four, gun gloves

874
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,940
gun gloves is awesome

875
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,900

00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,860
that's good advice that automatically plays songs according to one's emotions

879
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,620
time remote control

880
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,380
with any of you

881
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,980

00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,260
auto identity system for police

883
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,300

885
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,940
uh...

886
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,060
of the union you control with your mind

887
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,940
the

888
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,100
they have that

889
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,300
it's like a pretty good

890
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,300
lands

891
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,500

00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
Yesterday lens.

893
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Do they not explain it?

894
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
No, they just say yes.

895
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Everyone in the comments seems to know what it is.

896
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Vibrating condom.

897
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,500
That's actually a pretty good idea.

898
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Life prolonger.

899
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Yeah, instead of a reservoir tip, it's just a little battery.

900
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Yeah, exactly.

901
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
50 gigabyte memory cell phone.

902
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,500
Economical dynamic wall pictures.

903
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,500
I am working on this in Arizona.

904
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,660
I like I like that there there's like a small percentage of these people who are

905
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,020
just inventors that are working on an invention and coming in to see whether

906
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,780
their invention is on this list. Inventing and this guy's just inventing a TV.

907
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,540
I'm already inventing this. I'm actually working on this.

908
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:50,860
A silent suction cup. Here I just posted a screenshot of this guy who does the magnetic

909
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:56,620
mind master class. Number 86 is a silent suction strong enough to pick up fleas

910
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,900
from pet dogs or cats.

911
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,580
The suction cup should be able to be flushed down the toilet for quick disposal.

912
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,140
I don't like to use harsh chemicals on my pets.

913
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,660
One of them tries to bite me when I do the curry comb to hunt and kill the fleas.

914
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:20,660
The fleas are very resilient to being pinched.

915
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,500
Toilet overflow tray.

916
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,500
What if you had a tray under your toilet that would catch any leaks or overflows?

917
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,100
And a sewer backup protector.

918
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,540
How much would such a product be?

919
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,100
A toilet moat.

920
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,340
What would that be, a million dollars for something like that?

921
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,340
How much would that fetch?

922
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,380
71 is life prolonger.

923
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,980
A mirror that takes pictures.

924
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,420
Device to transfer sleep.

925
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,460
Some people like to sleep and could sell their sleep, others don't like to sleep and would

926
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,380
purchase it in order to stay awake.

927
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:02,740
Someone who did life prolonger also did stamina prolonger.

928
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,620
People became tired but this is the invention that will guarantee that you will prolong everything

929
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,420
you do, work, sex, performance, sports, etc.

930
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,660
Nano paint that can be programmed to only paint what you want.

931
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,020

00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:27,020
"Chemical, microorganisms, salt, sugar, etc. filter"

936
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,020
Uh...

"Walking ships"

938
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,020
"Ships that are able to walk on land"

939
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,020
This is a bra moment.

940
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,020
"Another way of reading that's quicker"

941
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:45,020
"Spray"

942
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:51,020

Anti-sun explosion device.

944
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,520
The sun will explode after millions of years, and this device will stop it.

945
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:05,020
Device to transfer sleep. Some people like to sleep and can sell their sleep.

946
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,520
Others don't like to sleep and would purchase it in order to stay awake.

947
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,020
I need this.

948
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,020
A built-in microwave for your...

949
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,520
This is... These are... This is... These are both the same thing.

950
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,520
A built-in microwave for your lunchbox.

951
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,520
A zapper that automatically zaps your teeth straight to replace braces.

952
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,520
Weather controls.

Bracelet that tells you how long you have to live.

955
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:37,520
I also like tablet with infinite power storage and an unbreakable screen.

956
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,520
Edible everlasting cups.

957
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,520
Ultra image converter.

958
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:51,240
Ancient time clock.

959
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,240
We need to invent an ancient thing.

960
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,920
Size gun.

961
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,040
Freeze microwave.

962
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,440

966
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:27,640
delicate foods artificial black holes overpowered but okay Oh silent microwave

967
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,520
microwave that operates silently do you have a device device that could end all

968
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,600
life typically on a planet 181 is bladeless helicopters and the

969
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:43,040
and says helicopters without police

970
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,240

00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,840
these are all by i have pra

975
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,960
he's commenting what they are

976
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,280
all of these are the same guy

977
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,520

device records the past advice is capable of recording through both imagery and

985
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,960
audio in the past time while in present time sounds impossible but the concept

986
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,360
is interesting to go

987
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,600
uh... freeze microwave

988
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,660
yeah uh...

989
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,180

disasters of any kind

991
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,100
very last what is machine that can bring fictional characters to life

992
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,220
is that also a pro

993
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:49,420
so that when is that the only one that's from someone else not

997
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,780
uh... we have to do we need to fucking getting contact with this mitchell

998
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,740
Lankford and find out about his magnetic mind master stuff.

999
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:06,620
I have a tab open, I'm saving this, I'll order one of the books or something and we'll come

1000
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,620
back.

1001
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,220
Oh my god, wait, never mind.

And the pictures of someone meditating with like a dodecahedron behind them.

1006
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,620
And he works at the Conscious Education Company.

01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,620
Yes.

1008
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,620
Wow.

1009
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,620
I'm joining LinkedIn to connect with him.

1010
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,940
Oh, it says sponsor running out.

1011
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,780
Reserve yours by Thursday, July 8th, but that's today.

1012
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,780
Fuck!

1013
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:37,780
Shit.

1014
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,180
I wonder if you go on tomorrow if it will say Friday, July 9th.

1015
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,700
Alright, I am gonna sign up.

1016
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,700
I'm gonna sign up.

1017
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,700
Alright.

1018
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,700
Me too.

1019
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,700
Okay.

1020
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,700
Okay.

1021
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,700
Bye.

1022
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,700
Bye.

1023
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,700
Wait, Pierce.

1024
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,700
Oh, yeah.

1025
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:51,700
Oh, is that the end?

1026
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,700
Yeah.

1027
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,700
It is kind of the end, because I have to pee so bad.

1028
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,700
Sorry.

1029
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,700

1030
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,200

1031
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200

1032
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200

1033
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
