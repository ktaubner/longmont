00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you're listening to Israel's number one podcast

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,800
you're a crap monster

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,800
I started recording it, say it again

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,280
I didn't catch the first half of what you said, say it again

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm doing the new theme song

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,640
(singing in foreign language)

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:42,480
♪ Friendship will win ♪

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
- All right, okay.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,160
- That's it?

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,240
- And then the English version is like,

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,980

and you guys will always ride and rhymes in English. It doesn't rhyme in Japanese, it

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,100
only rhymes in English. And you have two friends and yourself and you look at lists, podcasts

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,420
about lists, friendship will prevail.

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,340
So when translates to prevail?

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,620
Yeah, I'm Japanese. Yeah, so it's easy for me to translate stuff like that. Okay, so

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,300
To be Japanese, I tweeted this, but I have to just get it out another way, too. But there's

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,940
the art gallery I work at today. There was like a bald, older white dude with a very young Asian

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,660
woman as his date. It was clearly like a first date. And he just was dragging her around all the

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:45,260
stuff in the art gallery and then went up to a photo of a horseshoe crab and just pointed it out

23
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:53,420
and he was like, "Do you like cooking these?" And she was like, "I don't know. I don't know what you..."

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,100
And he was like, "Cooking? Like a restaurant? Restaurant!" And then he like started like

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,860
pretending to eat something with his hand and he's like, "Restaurant!" And then they just gave up and

26
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,300
they left. Damn. Yeah, man. What museum do you work at? The Museum of Patrick's Mom.

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,740
I keep trying to get you to reveal it on the show.

28
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,540
I don't care. I work at the MIT Art Gallery.

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:18,860
Okay.

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,900
Doesn't mean anything to me.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,380
Dom was asking today.

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,940
Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,820
If you want to go.

34
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,620
That's the answer.

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,940
She's like, "Oh, what museum does he work at?"

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,980
Yeah, well, let's go beat him up.

37
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,460
Somebody come visit me while I'm there.

38
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,740
I will not.

39
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:39,260
There's a guy who walks around the art gallery and he comes a lot apparently and he just he'll

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
spend like two hours there. It's a very small gallery.

41
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,860
Does he wear a brown suit?

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,740
no oh there's this guy when i i worked it when i worked no no no no no there's a reason i asked

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:56,220
no there was a guy when i worked at the clover in m.i.t uh-huh there was a guy who wore a brown suit

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,380
and gucci shoe like gucci sneakers and he had like a really bad comb over and i thought it must have

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,100
been him no no but he was a guy he would come in he would stand there in line and just go like

46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,740
like coughing up shit. He ate a Neal hamburger in Vancouver? Yeah, basically, basically he was like

47
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,780
Neal hamburger but he was very clearly just like an MIT professor and he would he kept all of his

48
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,220
coins and his money like everything he ever owned in a plastic bag in like his breast pocket.

49
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:31,100
Breast? Mm-hmm. He had boobs? Yeah. Oh my god. That's why I was asking did you see his big

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,100
brown titties? Yeah, they're good. It must have been that guy. This guy, I don't know who else

51
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,580
He just walks around with a note, like a notepad, and he looks at every piece of text in the

52
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,660
gallery, like all the little plaques that say the name and like the artist and stuff, and

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,180
he just looks for typos.

54
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,100
See, that's why I thought this guy would be that guy.

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
And then he comes back.

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
What do you mean that's why?

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,340
He didn't say that yet.

58
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,420
Yeah, I know, but that, I mean, just shit.

59
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,420
Weird shit.

60
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Yeah.

61
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,000
But he just apparently comes like once every couple weeks and tries to find all the typos

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,960
in the museum and then when he does he traps whatever the nearest woman working

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,120
is and just like just so you know there's a typo where you meant to say Chicago

64
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,680
but it says Chicago anyway what was your name my name's Paul and they'll just

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,720
talk for a while and then so his name was Paul huh the guy's name was Paul this

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,800
guy's not actually named Paul I was just guessing okay his name is Patrick no

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,280
yeah yeah my brother's name is Paul that's why I was saying now I'm gonna

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,640
bring the suit is my brother I don't like you lounging like this dude you

69
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,480

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,280
big fat tits.

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
So was it that guy?

76
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm trying to tell you the story of how I survived 9/11.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,360
So okay, but he was in 9/11.

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,440
Yes, he was.

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
That's why I asked.

80
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
He was in both.

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,240
Oh my God, the cats are going absolutely insane.

82
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
This is the craziest thing.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Oh my God.

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
They're going insane.

85
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440

It's so fucking funny dude.

93
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
I was watching it last night.

94
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
This whole episode is just going to be Patrick running around trying to stop his piss.

95
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Yeah it's just me running to fucking make sure my cats don't do stupid shit.

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Just put them in the cat room.

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't want, no, they'll sit there and like ruin the carpet.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Alright, yeah right.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's a fair point.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
*gibberish*

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Um.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
*laughter*

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh my god.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Patrick.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Fucking christ dude.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
(laughter)

107
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,920
- Oh my God.

108
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,760
Patrick--

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,680
- Smoking, Christ, dude.

110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,960
- Patrick threw a crumpled up McDonald's bag

111
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,420
and the cat jumped and knocked over a pile of books

112
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,520
into their water fountain.

113
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,720
- Yeah, Patrick has a giant water fountain,

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,360
a giant Roman water fountain in the middle of his house.

115
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,560
- I live in luxury.

116
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,400
- Yeah, you do.

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,320
Yeah, unemployed Patrick with a giant marble fountain.

118
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
- I can't sell it.

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,880
- I made enough to get the fountain

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
and then that's all I needed.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
- Yeah, so I quit.

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,800
- So I quit my job.

123
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,400
I would get a baller ass fountain and give all those like little cherub kids big fat dicks on it.

124
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,720
Yeah.

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,680
Yeah, because it'd be like they're not babies now. They're just-

126
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,880
Well, they are a thousand years old.

127
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,320
They're little people. That would be the big change. I would change the proportions.

128
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,040
I'd give all the kids beards so once you see their huge penises, it's not weird.

129
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,440
Exactly. It's not a kid with a huge penis. It's clearly a man.

130
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,800
In some culture, it's like good luck to have like those little cherubs like peeing.

131
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It's good luck to suck a small penis of a child.

132
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
To have them like peeing, right?

133
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I have no idea.

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Because there's one restaurant that I would go to in Harvard Square that had this like a shit ton of like little cherub fountain statues.

135
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Like everywhere in the store, just like every service and they're all holding their dick peeing.

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Was this place very lucky?

137
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
No, it was the waffle place.

138
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,240
The Waffle Place had a bunch of Babies Wieners?

139
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,280
Yeah, pretty crazy.

140
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,320
Probably some kind of signal.

141
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,120
To the other Waffle fans.

142
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,880
It's a pedophile cabal thing.

143
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,480
Yeah, pedophile Waffle.

144
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,800
Patrick and I had a fun experience on the train today.

145
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,480
We got on the train and a guy was blasting music out of his speaker.

146
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,800
He was playing an IDM remix of Gucci Gang.

147
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
It was awesome.

148
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,200
When you say speaker was it like a giant like a JBL, JBL kill.

149
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Gotcha.

150
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,920
But it was extremely loud and when we got on this old Asian guy was sitting next to him

151
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,440
on his phone and then we sat down and like the train started moving and the guy like

152
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,400
leaned over to the old Asian guy and went, "Who the fuck are you texting?

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
Who the fuck are you texting?"

154
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,520
And then the guy just got up and walked like to another car.

155
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
It's funny that-

156
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,080
and started running up and down the train car and swinging on the poles and then

157
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,840
he was like dancing around he went I am having a shit ton of fun right now and

158
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,440
then he got off the train. It's funny that that people like train people have

159
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,360
figured out that they can just do stuff like that with impunity because and

160
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,260
nobody wants to deal with it. Yeah nobody will ever say anything to you. People just like people just

161
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,640
want to just get home so bad that they will take so much abuse on it on public

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,540
transportation before they snap. Yeah, before they even do anything. Yeah, they'll

163
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,960
just ignore it. Yeah, they won't even look. Yeah, yeah. I would say when shit and piss gets

164
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,000
involved. Yeah, once you see like... That's a line. Once the guy starts

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,520
jacking off like... But see, jacking off I think I still, I think I probably just

166
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,800
move. I would kick the penis out of his hand. Yeah, kick it onto the floor.

167
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,640
And it turns into a snake and it slides away. It slides. Yeah, snakes slide.

168
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,360
That's it. Snakes always have to be going downhill or else they can't move.

169
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,260
That's so true. Because they're so slippery. This episode is just us

170
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,800
corralling these cats. Yeah, trying to block the cat from jumping onto the recorder and

171
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,560
stopping the episode. Just put them in the fucking oven. Just yeah, just do something to them.

172
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,240
Honestly. Well Yoda's fine right now. Yoda's chilling. He'd like to be boiled to death.

173
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,720
He's being a good guy. Can you give them a bath tonight? Sucks. You have to give them a

174
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
bath? Yeah. Look how fucking dirty they are. Do they get disgusting and stinky because they're

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Look at them right now. They're fucking gross.

176
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,560
I mean, they don't look any more disgusting than they always look.

177
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
They always fucking look like aliens.

178
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Yeah, but sometimes they look clean.

179
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
No, they don't.

180
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,560
He's sneaking around the other way trying to jump on the recorder.

181
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
You're not allowed to be my friend. I will never love you.

182
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Why not?

183
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Because he fucked up all the episodes, and apparently he's dirty.

184
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Yeah, I can't be friends with something that's dirty.

185
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah, you suck, man.

186
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
He does not suck.

187
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
He does, dude.

188
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560

and then I'm gonna take it away at the last second.

191
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,400
Why? Because I just told you I hate them. You couldn't do that to Yoda. Look at him. I could.

192
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,160
I could do it to both of them at once. No. I could do anything. I'll take, I'll give the

present to one of them, take it away and give it to the other. Oh my god. Back off, cat.

300
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,940
born is a video and movie of recorded sex many people will get addicted soon but

301
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:30,060
here is why porn is bad for you. I have addiction about porn, but I want to quit because how

302
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,780
I feel is that they hurt women and they don't respect them kindly.

303
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:44,060
This user is InfernoTopTenors. Damn. Nice anime, Avi. Yeah. RIP this account. Damn, the account

305
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,760
porn addiction. Yeah, yeah. And they lapsed. It's not an addiction to porn, it's an

306
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,940
addiction about porn. Yeah. So it's just reading about porn and thinking about it. I'm addicted about porn too.

307
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,140
Yeah. Number one is it's a disgrace to women. It's really women's fault. Yeah. The

308
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,380
whole thing, you know. They're the ones who are signing the contracts and saying

309
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,100
yes to all this bullshit, you know. So I blame them. They write it, they wrote all

310
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,580
of the the contracts in wingdings so the women couldn't read it. And girls are, and women

311
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,820
don't read things anyway. So they just looked, they saw that they, they're like,

312
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,720
"Okay, yeah, I'll sign this." Yeah, at the beginning they wrote, "And this is how a

313
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,420
sports car works." And then the women stopped reading it. And the carburetor goes, "Oh, geez."

314
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,340
Yeah, when you're using a charcoal grill and then that's how they started the

315
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,420
contract and just women just didn't read the rest. Yeah. Yeah. We should

316
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,620
write porn. Yeah, oh, that'd be a good thing to put on it, just a porn screenplay.

317
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:53,600

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
Why is he jumping on his penis then?

328
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,420
Why is he crawling over me and sitting on me and loving me like a father and friend?

329
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,420
Because he's scared of you.

330
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
I'm scared of you.

331
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,340
You're not scared of me.

332
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,740
I'm scared Cameron's going to blow up.

333
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Do something rash.

334
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,180
I'll blow up.

335
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Cameron's going to blow up.

336
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Yeah, he's going to blow up.

337
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,180
He's going to press self-destruct on his penis.

338
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,900
He's going to blow up you like a blow up fuck doll in the porno that we're making.

339
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,940
And then he's gonna fuck you in your blow-up doll ass.

340
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
Do people like having sex with blow-up dolls?

341
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
Do they like fucking a balloon?

342
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Yeah, or like an inflatable raft.

343
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,540
Or like a... I feel like it would be like less soft than a balloon even.

344
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,900
Yeah, it's like fucking a life jacket.

345
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
No, 'cause you know like the ends of like...

346
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,300
Like if you get like a floaty or something and then they have like the sealed part that's all like spiky.

347
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,420
You touch that with your butt?

348
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,700
Wouldn't that be inside of the vagina part of the inflatable doll?

349
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,220
No, they just put it somewhere else.

350
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,900
They just put water in there.

351
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,660
engineering. Yeah, but what if they forget? Samsung. I'm sure in the

352
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,300
expensive inflatable dolls, but I mean the $20 ones, you're finding

353
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,340
at Spencer's. I feel like you're better off like fucking like a

354
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,860
hole in a piece of furniture. Yeah. Let's be

355
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,300
real, the women that they paint on those dolls don't even look like... they don't

356
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,660
look very good. You know, they don't look beautiful. Yeah. So you might as well...

357
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:44,060
fuck the couch, which is infinitely more beautiful. I would rather fuck a couch

358
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,900
than a blow-up doll. Yeah. Now one of those really expensive... What about a blow-up couch?

359
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,380
A blow-up... Oh. Like an inflatable couch that you put in the pool. That's tough. Yeah, I wouldn't have

360
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,780
sex with that. You wouldn't have sex with that? No, because also there's no hole. And if you do

361
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,340
put a hole in it, then all of a sudden now you got a leak. What if it's an inflatable

362
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,420
couch that has a pussy. Uh yeah like it has a human pussy. You just float in the pool and lie on it

363
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:14,740
face down. It teaches you how to swim and fuck. Caleb you've been in the pool for like three hours

364
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,420
just face down on that floaty. Yeah your swim trunks pulled halfway down. What about it mom?

365
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:27,940
So I'm panning. Fuck you, maybe some Totino's. Put the pizza rolls in the pool. Put them on the

366
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
Put them in the pool, float them out to me.

367
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Put them on the edge of the pool and turn around.

368
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
I'll get them.

369
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,940
But it is a girl's fault and it is a disgrace to women.

370
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
There are comments on here.

371
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
There are 20 comments on it.

372
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
You can click on the comments.

373
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Men don't force women to do porn.

374
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
That's all up to the women.

375
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Pork can also be a disgrace to men.

376
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
I don't think so.

377
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
If you're a man and you're in porn,

378
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
that means you usually have a big penis

379
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,380
or a really small penis. Yeah. You'd be like the Minion. Do you know about the Minion? No.

380
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,340
The Minion was this like series of videos that came out in like 2000 whatever. I think Dane Cook

381
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,060
had a bit about it. About the Minion? Yeah, the Minion was a very fat guy with a small penis who

382
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:17,860
would throw food in girls' faces. Whoa. It was big on e-fucked. That's sick. Yeah. E-fucked used to

383
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,860
be so good. Yeah, e-fucked sucks now. It does suck now. It got way worse. It's all just like... PC

384
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,460
culture ruined EFUX. It actually it went the other way kind of yeah I looked at it

385
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,940
maybe a couple months ago just goes like what's going on with this website.

386
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,500
That's the only place that has the Chuck Berry sex tape. Exactly yeah I actually think

387
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,020
that is why I was on EFUX. Yeah that's why I looked at it too. Yeah it's so funny but

388
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,540
all the videos are like dumb bitch gets fucked in the face and then beaten into

389
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,300
shit yeah and then sent back to Europe.

390
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,820

00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:08,260
your computer. Well then, well that's the closest to a good reason we can get to

494
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:14,860
the on this list. Okay so I was looking up a car here listen okay so I was

495
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,340
looking up a cartoon image it had like no skin color in it so I thought it

496
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,780
wouldn't be dirty so I unblurred it only only that but now I keep seeing yeah

497

499
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,360

500
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,880
didn't so I thought it wouldn't be dirty so I unblurred it. Probably they went on

515
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,560
what could that possibly be? I played that too. That's a North Carolina classic game.

516
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,040
The warthog. Do you have warthogs in North Carolina?

517
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,640
Um, 30 to 50 feral hogs in North Carolina. Yes, dude. Yes! Woo!

518
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:06,520
No, there's um... Yeah! I think there is, there's wild boar, I think. Yeah, probably. Yeah. I don't

519
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,440
know. I don't, I don't even, is a warthog even a real thing? I think, I don't even know. It's the

520
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,280
one with the crazy nose. It's the one with the horns. Oh, the one with the big long nose. It's

521
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
It's Pumba.

522
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
It's an alligator.

523
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,840
Wait, then I don't know if it's real.

524
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
If it's Pumba.

525
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
That's true.

526
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Pumba's a cartoon.

527
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,000
If I saw Pumba in real life, I'd shoot him in the face.

528
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,600
Warthogs are the most disgusting, creepy looking animals.

529
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Why are you looking...

530
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Warthog removal.

531
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm gonna show you what they look like.

532
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,040
Damn, they do have a big fucked up nose.

533
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,480
They're really crazy looking.

534
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,160
They look like the Power Rangers villain.

535
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, they do.

536
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,240
Yeah, they're pretty crazy.

537
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,840
They're like donkeys more than pigs.

538
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Look at that.

539
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,840
The baby ones are pretty cute though.

540
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Fucking skull looks disgusting.

541
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Look at that. That's pretty cute.

542
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Any baby is good.

543
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Any baby is good.

544
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Except baby Hitler.

545
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
And that's the only bad one?

546
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
If you think of someone really bad.

547
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Baby shit.

548
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Baby shit? Looks like Caleb likes baby shit.

549
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Baby Hitler.

550
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Hitler made out of poop.

551
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,320
Now that is the epicocity of what you just said is blowing my mind right now.

552
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,200
The idea that there would be a poop Hitler. Poopoo Hitler?

553
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Mmmmm. I mean no. Ugh.

554
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,760
I don't want to sit here and make out with a version of Hitler made out of crap.

555
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
What are you talking about?

556
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
I have so much better stuff to do with my time.

557
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,400
I don't want to sit there and go to a movie with a kind of Hitler who's just made out of a bunch of just poop

558
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,640
and he has like a life and he has a mind and he can kiss me.

559
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
I don't want to kiss him in the middle of a movie.

560
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,440
I don't want to fuck a hole inside of like that I burrowed with my penis inside of a guy

561
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,520
made out of poop who looks like Adolf Hitler and has a little mustache.

562
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,320
You think poop Hitler poops skin?

563
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,520
I don't want to get all the skin, I don't want to be fucking poop Hitler in the ass.

564
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,800
And then he puts skin on my penis with his butthole and then I use that to wipe him down

565
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
after.

566
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I don't want to do that man.

567
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,280
I think he does.

568
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
I don't.

569
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,560
I think he does want to do that.

570
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't want to do that.

571
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,440
I don't want to have two poo pitlers that I bring with me when I travel and they stay

572
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,720
in the hotel room and then I order them room service and then they, when I get back they

573
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:35,200
give me a freaking double blow job hand job.

574
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,840
I don't want to do that.

575
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,880
All right, number three, your brain could get a disorder.

576
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I think that happened to me.

577
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,680
I think I watched too much porn when I was a kid and now I can't, I mean, Mario is crazy

578
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
to me.

579
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,000
There's a comment from Caleb on here.

580
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What is it?

581
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Caleb9000.

582
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Oh my God, what?

583
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It says, "This is Caleb from the future."

584
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,520
Yeah, no, your brain only gets disorders from birth, they aren't contagious.

585
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,880
So it goes against everything Caleb just said about his Mario disease.

586
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,680
future he learns that you can't you have to get it's Caleb 9000 years old yeah

587
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,480
the idea of me being 9000 years old is making me so sad that I can't even think

588
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,560
hmm yeah yeah I would not I wouldn't be able to do any of my favorite activities

589
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,320
and I would never yeah none of my favorite activities like number four you

590
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,600
will learn to hurt women no well I don't like hurting women you'd

591
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,480
skipped ahead I was about to read a comment okay I'd opened the comments I

592
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,160
I didn't see that.

593
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,220
If you want to watch too many plus, how is that a porn problem?

594
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:44,760
You should use a safe search and block it from enabling safe search for six months so problem

595
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
solved.

596
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,520
Did you guys ever have like a filter on your computer?

597
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:55,440
My uncle tried to set up one for my mom, but then I went on a website where I had to enter

598
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,280
in like my mom would have to come over and make sure that when I was really young, I

599
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
I was like 10 years old and she had to come over and like type in the password

600
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,640
every time I went to a new website but then like every time I think I went on

601
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,440
aim and every time that I went to send someone a message I was like mom come

602
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,080
here you need to you need to type in the password again so I had my mom do that

603
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,920
like ten times which is all your damn messages she would yeah she would read

604
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,960
what I was saying and then I did it so many times in one night that she shut it

605
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,160
off. So she let you just go free. Kids one, mom zero. Fuck you mom. Anytime I hear a story

606
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:37,860
with kids winning, I sing. I sing a song. I really hope that Howard Zinn writes a kids

607
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:43,880
history of the United States. That's from the perspective of the kids beating the parents.

608
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,920
Because you know history is so often written by the parents. We really need to get it from

609
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,800
perspective. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he's going to town on his leg. The kid's guide to survival.

610
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,560
The kid's guide to survival. Yeah. Hide under a table. World War Kids. That's what the Nubo

611
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,520
Kids War 3. People think the new, well there's two other kids wars? Yeah, when did those

612
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,760
happen? Yeah, yeah. It was, they skipped the three. It was grounding and spanking for the

613
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,000
first two. That was what started those two. And then the third one, yeah you guessed it,

614
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,400
snack time. I thought snack time is good. Well, the kids war three was to make sure that we

615
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,560
get snack time. Oh yeah. The inalienable right of all kids, every kid to snack time. Exactly.

616
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,840
Yeah I heard if you don't bring snack you can get a graham cracker or an apple. I, have

617
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,800
I told you about my first grade teacher? Oh yeah, I got yelled at once for, because I

618
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,360

620
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,420
there screaming at me do you have a snack yes or no do you have a snack and I was

621
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,240
like crying because I thought I was gonna get in trouble if I said no but I

622
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,720
didn't want to check my backpack because I was too scared to get up yeah

623
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,360

625
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,600
- Yeah.

626
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,800
- No one, it's not there anymore.

627
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,720
- It's not.

628
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,200
- Yeah, number four, you will learn to hurt women.

629
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
- From watching porn?

630
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,240
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,580
- Uh, not the porn I watch.

632
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,800
The porn I watch is all about just watch, you know.

633
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,200
- Caleb 9000's back on here and says,

634
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,480
"That's not something you have to watch to figure out.

635
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,180
"Violence is a natural instinct."

636
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,200
(laughing)

637
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,760
- Though a bad one.

638
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,600
- Yeah.

639
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,440
- Damn, that's sick.

640
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,260
- You just know everything.

641
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,740
- Violence against women is a natural instinct.

642
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
It's natural.

643
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,740
Says Caleb.

644
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,700
Guys, it's a release.

645
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
Come on.

646
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,980
No, I do think it's wrong to beat up on a girl.

647
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,100
And I've never punched a woman in the face.

648
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,140
And that's the honest, the God honest truth.

649
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,740
Never once have I turned around when I got pushed in a bar fight in Santa Clarita and

650
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,660
the thought that a big fat lesbian was a guy and punched her in the face only to later

651
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,340
realize that I had maybe broken a woman's nose.

00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,700
It feels like a penis. Do you have a penis tattoo? No. I have an embossed penis tattoo

657
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,820
on my hand. I got a dermal implant of a penis. Yeah. Which one is a dermal implant? It's when

658
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:45,820
they put like a tiny star in your skin. So it's like a bump. Oh yeah, okay. Yeah. Those

659
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,980
things are... It's like the piercing that sits on the bone or whatever. I don't know what that is.

660
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,580
Okay. I think it's just a bump under your skin that they usually make designs with.

661
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,540
Oh, I don't know. They put a thingy, they put basically the back end of a stud

662
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,540
in your body. Can you look, can you show me a picture? I have no idea what the hell you're

663
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,820
talking about. It's a bump on your skin that looks like a shape. Wait, look up penis dermal.

664
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:18,460
It's these things. Oh, oh that is a penis dermal. But people also get, they'll get like, you know,

672
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:12,220
Squidward tentacles. Those are dermal implants, like, you barely read them.

687
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,420
Oh my God, that's the move for jacking off and jerking off.

688
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,020
Get a dermal implant of a woman's vagina.

689
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:52,160
a porn star somebody like you know Remy LaCroix or like Lisa Ann or like Lana

690
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,940
Rhodes and you get their pussy installed in your hand and then you sit

691
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,680
there and you sit there and you're jacking off your fucking your hand.

692
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,420
It was a Kumgo? The Kumgo is in your hand and then you dump it into the into the sink.

693
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Is he doing something? The cat? Yeah. No. Where is Yoda? He's not... I don't know.

694
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,300
Is all you think about these cats all the time? I'm trying to tell you

695
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,500
about how I'm where my new invention of jacking off. I was asking where my cat is.

696
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,500
What about a movie that's like Ricky Gervais invention of lying but it's the

697
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,540
invention of jacking off mm-hmm and he's like oh it's not real so I can check off.

698
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:32,140
In here I fuck my hand yeah in here yeah. Oh you're God now. I closed my eyes

699
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,980
and I pretended that my hand was a pussy and I rubbed it back and forth. Yeah.

700
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,820
But that would be a good movie. Mm-hmm. I don't think that would be a good movie.

701
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,540
Ricky Gervais the invention of getting sucked in fuck. What about Ricky Bobby?

702
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,380
Bobby Gervais Ricky Bobby

703
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:57,660

706
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:22,260
That scene is just completely ruined. They just sit in silence. All the kids still have

707
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:29,020
southern accents. Everybody except Ricky Bobby Travis. But where are we going to make that

708
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:36,420
movie? He's not sponsored by Wonder Bread, he's sponsored by Tesco. Number six, it can

709
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:42,420
destroy families. That's true because if your dad is jacking off to porn and your

710
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,860
mom is jacking off to porn when are they gonna go to work? It can also destroy

711
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,380
families because say you're sitting down on the couch right but then in walks

712
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:58,100

717
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:35,300
of Tam Allen and she walks in and she's like what are you doing with your sister

00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,660

Xxx yeah, this is bone improvement

723
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:03,460
Now we're not destroying the family now we're improving well, I'm that at the end everyone dies

724
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,660
Yeah, and then at the end everybody dies because an asteroid hit

725
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:13,900
Yeah a comment on it can destroy family says if your dad watch porn your dad sucks

726
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,740
My dad didn't suck. I've never caught anybody

727
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:26,940
I caught my dad after he did. Yeah, because he didn't know how to delete the history. Ah

728
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,940
So I think I told you this story but my dad

729
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,660
So me and my two brothers fought for like

730
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:42,640
Like a week. Mm-hmm. They were like who the fuck looked up fake taxi, and then we realized it was my dad. Damn

731
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,900
I'm realizing that one time I got like something kind of close to that.

732
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,180
Oh, we taught my dad how to private browse.

733
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Smart.

734
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,740
I got on the computer and there was like a porn pop-up was on the computer and I was

735
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,740
like, "Oh, I'm gonna get in trouble for this."

736
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,900
So I was like maybe nine or ten.

737
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,900
And so I found my dad and I was like, "Dad, there's like something like, you know, there's

738
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,220
like porn on the computer."

739
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,220
And he's like, "What?"

740
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,740
And he went and he sat down and he just looked at it and looked at me and he's like, "What

741
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,740
"What is this garbage?"

742
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,740
(laughter)

743
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,740
And then he closed out of it and he was like

744
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,740
"You know, who knows, you tell me if that ever happens again, cause that...

745
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,740
that was weird.

746
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,740
That was really weird."

747
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,740
And then he just went back to

748
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,740
just, you know, watching the wire.

749
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,740
"What the hell is this crap? What the crap is on this TV?"

750
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,740
"They're naked? What the heck?"

751
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
"She's... what are they doing to each other?"

752
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
"God, Caleb,

753
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,740
I think I see her thing, dude.

754
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,800
I think her thing and her what's are called.

755
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,040
We need to throw out the monitor right now.

756
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,200
We gotta take this computer back to Best Buy because obviously the Geek Squad needs to put

757
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,660
a couple hours in on this machine.

758
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,660
This thing.

759
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,080
Does this come with the computer?

760
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,080
What?

761
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Wait.

762
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,080
Okay.

763
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,660
I told them not to install any crazy porn boobs and vaginas on here, but it seems like

764
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
they did.

765
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,660
Great.

766
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,660
Leave it to Dell.

767
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,660
It's so hard to get through.

768
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,080
It's so hard to get a good firewall these days.

769
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,440
I think we're being hacked.

770
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,200
I think some of them are being hacked by naked people having sex.

771
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,200
I think beautiful women are hacking my computer.

772
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,640
In like, I was in like fifth grade, my little brother tried to download, like he tried to

773
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,680
get Halo 2 for PC.

774
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,240
Impossible, until the Master Chief collection came out.

775
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:31,760
So he, yeah, he downloaded Halo 2 for PC.exe and then there was a, like a bunch of desktop

776
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,360
icons that popped up and one of them, the only one I remember was an icon that said

777
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:45,640
gay dungeon poor. That's so funny because it's like what do you gain from

778
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,720
uploading that virus right that puts gay done. It's like it's like when people

780
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,540

you're an independent gay dungeon porn content creator. The icon is Freddy the

782
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,240

827
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,320
and call it Balls Street.

828
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,540
They should do a version of Wall Street

829
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,240
where there's a wolf that's there.

830
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,320

860
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
who is sort of a Sheldon for Big Bang Theory.

861

Yeah, you can lie.

866
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,360
It says it right here.

867
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,360
They don't measure you on a license.

868
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,360
It says 69.

869
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
They just ask.

870
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,960
I'm going to read off Patrick's license number.

871
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,960
Okay.

872
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960

1111.

876
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960

878
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,680
Alright, his hair color is brown.

879
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,880
If anyone wants to hack his hair, listen to his brown.

880
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,560
If you try to change my hair color to any other color, I will flip my shit.

881
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,960
It's funny that you look like 20 years older in this photo.

889
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:45,000
to license before and after. That'll be good. You might have to frame those.

890
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,120
It is disgusting. Number seven. Yeah, porn is gross. Yeah. But it's sexist.

In the remake.

902
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,960

00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,960
Greatest Sex Out Ever.

Yeah, and he digs out that little asshole.

906
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,960
He digs out the bread in the sandwich

907
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,960
like they do at Jimmy John's

908
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,960
and he fucks the shit out of it.

909
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,960
Did they do that at Jimmy John's?

910
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,960
Yeah, I saw them do it today.

911
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,960
Number 34 is boobs are annoying.

912
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Boobs are so annoying.

913
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
That's a common comment.

914
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,360
anonymous buddy talking reckless like that. They contain elements of violence. I

915
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,640
hate elements of violence. It's a disgrace to couples wanting a child. Do

916
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:11,800
you think porn should be rated TVMA? Oh absolutely. It should be rated NC-17.

917
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,280
They should rate porn M. Why don't they rate? They don't rate because that's what I

918
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,800
actually watch it sometimes cuz there's no rating on it so if it's M

919
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,840
like I don't watch an M rated thing. You should rate it P for porn. Yeah but then

920
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,800
that make me maybe I'll look at it for preschool about xxx they rate it xxx I

921
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:35,280
think don't watch it I would think that music is like three X's because I was

922
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,560
classically educated so I actually have an advanced understanding of Roman

923
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:43,040
numerals and so you can't watch it until you're 30 that's a pretty good rule

924
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,480
that's why it says xxx I think you're I think everybody would be better off if

925
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,840
it was your it was impossible to watch porn until you were 30 years old yeah

926
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:58,860
you know biometric tests yeah bio you have to type in your social security to go

00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,600
into any porn site you have to last three you have to take a we have to take a

956
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,240
Gorillas. Oh my god I used to watch Gorillas music videos and get so scared.

961
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,480
I'm useless

962
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,480
but not for long

963
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,480
the monkey

964
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,480
the monkey part is about to happen

965
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,480
that's when I would turn it off

966
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,480
That's when I would turn it off when he says that.

967
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,480

968
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,480

00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,480
I would get scared at the other one with De La Soul.

970
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Is that Feel Good Inc?

979
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,860
I was scared of the lead singer and the girl because he had no eyes

980
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,180
That's what was scared what scared me about him was that he had no eyes and he sang like a little fucking

Other guy was the Satanist you aren't scared of him. I didn't know some yeah Murdoch. You know the nest yeah

I don't know what you're talking about at all the gorillas. Yeah, you don't

984
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,620
You knew the name of the guy.

985
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,620
I thought we were talking about the Batman.

986
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,620
The Gorilla...oh, oh, you thought...

987
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,620
We thought we were talking about Gorilla Grodd.

988
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,620
From Batman, yeah.

989
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,620
Who makes an appearance in Batman.

990
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,620
Is he from The Flash or from Superman?

991
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,620
He's from all of them.

992
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,620
He's from the zoo.

993
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,620
Boom.

994
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,620
I don't know that he is from the zoo. He might not be.

995
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
I think he's from Monkey Planet.

996
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,620
Zoo is Monkey Jail.

997
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,620
No, it's Monkey...

998
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:21,620
Oh my god, the zoo is just a jail for monkeys and elephants and bees.

999
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:29,620
You enter the zoo, you walk out of the gift shop and you're just swarmed by bees.

1000
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,620
Yeah, every other monkey is out of season.

1001
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,620
All we have is bees right now.

1002
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,620
Yeah, we lost federal funding for them.

1003
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:41,620
The only thing we could afford was bees.

1004
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:45,300
These are the only animals people don't protest for us having in a cage.

1005
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,300
Yeah, mosquitoes.

1006
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,460
The guy next door to us just kind of had beekeeping shit, so.

1007
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,300
Yeah, so we just decided, "Eh, fuck it."

1008
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,300
We cut him a deal.

1009
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,180
He gets to keep all of his bees here.

1010
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,780
Yeah, and we charge you $50.

1011
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,980
We charge you money and we don't give it to him.

1012
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,980

1107
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:39,680

1108
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,320

1109
01:03:43,320 --> 01:04:03,440
and

1110
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,440
suck each other's dicks.

1111
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Oh, you watch that a lot.

1112
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,440
No, I'm saying it's like this. No, no, I like to look the other way

1113
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,440
when you're doing it is what I'm saying.

1114
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,440
You like to watch a baby suck a dick on you.

1115
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,440
I don't like doing that.

1116
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,440
The other way into a mirror so you can see it.

1117
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,440
So I can do my makeup.

1118
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,440
You like to watch the other way into a funhouse mirror

1119
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,440
because your view of society is so skewed.

1120
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,440
I think you guys are missing the point that you are two babies

1121
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,440
and you're sucking each other's penises.

1122
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,440
No, we're not. No. I'm watching it happen.

1123
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,440
So why are you watching it?

1124
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,760
on a on a on a browser so it's okay
