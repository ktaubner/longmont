1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
At the beginning of time, aliens came to the Earth to create the ultimate organic weapon.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,760
They created mankind.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,400
Eons later, the year is 2022.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,080
The festering scourge of humanity still reigns supreme.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,720
The Robotronic DNA implanted in their genome lies dormant, awaiting activation.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,720
and their true purpose is forgotten.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,720
Until...

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,720
Light years away,

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,720
the High Lord Glaxon of planet Robotron

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,720
declares war on the galaxy,

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,720
activating the sleeper cell of human-Robotronic hybrids.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,720
But then he choked on Bobo's stew and died.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,720
He was succeeded by his only son,

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,720
Fedman Fedex of the Glogan Army.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,240
And now, Commander Fedman approaches Earth with a fleet of Dirk Sand Destroyers TM to

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,520
claim his birthright and to unleash a galactic onslaught of universal proportions upon our

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
pale blue dot.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,800
On Earth, the very ground tears asunder.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,680
The seas boil and run red with the blood of the unfortunate.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,520
They have discontinued Doritos.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,520
Refuge from the assault is only possible for those who are rich and awesome enough to afford underground bunkers.

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Armed with nothing but a podcast studio, an archive of all human information, and an artificial intelligence protocol known only as "Jubio-3",

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Cameron, Caleb, and Patrick have nothing better to do than to film themselves having fun.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Okay, peace out.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,100
(upbeat music)

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:05,780
- Hey.

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,780
- Welcome to the first episode of the rest of our lives.

28
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,000
- That's right, the rest of everybody's lives.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
- The rest of every single living person on Earth's lives.

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,020
- It all changed.

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,420
- If you don't already know.

32
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,100
- Go ahead, explain what happens.

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,660
- Well, Alexa--

34
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,020
- You're doing a great job, dude.

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,940
- The world is fucking over, obviously.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,500
And we've been driven into this bunker, thank God.

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,140
- Thank God we already prepared for this.

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,500
- I know, thank God we spent so many months

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,320
funneling all the Patreon money into building a bunker,

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,220
and that's why the show has sucked for so long.

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,460
directly into the bunker. There's no fresh air down here.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,660
No. Mostly fart air down here.

43
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,940
Yeah. I've been working on this thing on the weekends. Some of it's pretty fun, actually.

44
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,020
Oh, yeah. Check this out. Look at this. This is pretty cool.

45
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Plasma ball.

46
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,020
Touch it, Cam.

47
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,220
Okay. Wow. What do those buttons do?

48
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,420
Don't touch the buttons.

49
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,140
What about the key? Can I turn the key?

50
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,180
Please don't touch the key, don't touch the buttons.

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
Let's just have a-

52
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,180
What's wrong with the key?

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, shh, shh, let's touch the plasma ball.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,260
Oh, isn't that fun?

55
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,940
I can't touch it from my spot.

56
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
That's okay.

57
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,940
I really-

58
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
He's touching the button.

59
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Don't touch the key, please.

60
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
I want to touch the key.

61
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
Please do not touch the key.

62
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
What's wrong with the key?

63
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,300
The key is not- the key flushes the toilet.

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,780
And we only have a little bit of water, so don't touch the key, please.

65
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,780
Is that true?

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Yes.

67
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
You have to come all the way out here to flush-

68
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
There's a toilet right- you can't see it.

69
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
There's a toilet right off screen.

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
Well, I'm sitting on it, that's why you can't see it.

71
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Oh, there it is.

72
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,780
I really need to flush the toilet.

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

74
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,780
If you flush the toilet, I have it set so that it flushes about 50 gallons of water, and I think we have 55.

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,780
We'll just recycle the water.

76
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,780
That's a good point.

77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,780
We could recycle it through Caleb's system, because isn't pee sterile?

78
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,780
So he could drink the dirty water, he pees, and then it's sterile.

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,780
So maybe I'll just flush this poop water, and we can pour 50 gallons of poop water into you,

80
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,780
and you could maybe be a human converter.

81
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,780
You wanna make me eat 50 gallons of poop?

82
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,780
Not eat, no, no, no, drink 50 gallons of poop water.

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,780
Obviously we have a filter.

84
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,780
We have a filter that will stop the poop from coming out.

85
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
You're the first PP.

86
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
And then we turn the poop into food.

87
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,780
I don't wanna be the food pooper.

88
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,780
Well, a lot of people don't wanna be a lot of things, but the world is fucking ending and we don't have a lot of options.

89
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,780
Did you build a fucking poop and pee converter? I don't think so, so you're gonna have to be one.

90
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,780
Right now most people are either robotronic weapons or their food.

91
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,780
Yeah, I also should mention that me and Patrick got a huge fight over an egg.

92
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,780
I don't know, that's why our clothes look like this.

93
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,780
I'm completely covered in...

94
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,780
See, the thing about going out...

95
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
I think this is all his blood.

96
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,780
This is all my blood.

97
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,780
It wasn't because of a punch to my face, it was because of a nosebleed.

98
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,780
And I told you that because the fucking new air that we have to breathe...

99
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,280
It's dry.

100
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,780
Hell for my sinuses.

101
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,780
So I mean it's funny the apocalypse affects people in different ways.

102
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,780
I mean you guys, you kind of lost your minds.

103
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
I know because a lot of shit is going on.

104
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
It's, it's, everyone's turning crazy.

105
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
You guys got in a fight.

106
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,780
I got it, I shaved my whole head.

107
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,780
Me, I, I, I, you know, my whole family was eliminated by the Robotronics

108
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
and I actually came into a lot of money.

109
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,780
Boohoo!

110
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
So, no, I'm actually really happy.

111
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,780
I don't know why you're saying boohoo because you already know that about me

112
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,780
and I was saying a thing so it's like.

113
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
I was wondering why you look so damn good.

114
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,600
Yeah, well it's just like you know I'm kind of a billionaire now and and figure I should act apart

115
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,480
You know in money doesn't mean anything anymore. It doesn't matter if you're not mean something to me trust me

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,960
Well, would you are you anything? I got these clothes with money. I went down to the store recently. I bought them

117
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,420
Yeah, like yesterday

118
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Why are we in the fucking bunker then?

119
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,100
Well, I mean if you guys don't have money to go spend so I figure you probably don't need to be leaving or going

120
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,560
Eating pine cones and shit we fought we sent it. I thought you guys like pine cone

121
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,980
I got more of the pine cone you got more of the pine cone you guys don't like pine cones

122
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,860
It's fucking it's spiky and brown no. It's it doesn't taste good so the durian pine cone

123
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,740
That's the most we had enough if we had enough water which by the way you're gonna have to again

124
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,260
Yeah, you're a billion

125
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,220
Why are we why do we have a button to flush the toilet if you got a billion dollars?

126
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,560
It's state-of-the-art that cost a lot of fucking money

127
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,120
I will say this did cost so much money doing all this.

128
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,720
Oh, you know what?

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,320
We did also wipe a lot of our money out because we uploaded Jubio.

130
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Jubio died.

131
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Yeah.

132
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,040
And we uploaded him into a, he's like an AI kind of thing now.

133
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Jubio 3.

134
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Yeah.

135
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah, because there was a lot of attempts.

136
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Well, a lot.

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
There's a lot.

138
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
There's two.

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Don't, bad.

Bad.

Okay, he's going to behave.

He'll be okay now.

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Okay, he's going to be nice.

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
So, I'm going to go ahead and get the key.

Chopped human I haven't tried it. I haven't tried it, but how much have yeah?

170
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,980
How much have you been going out? How many times have you gone outside in the past week like once an hour?

171
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,500
Once an hour just a little bit. We've been out

172
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,240
Two times I've been out two times and one time I see my dead mom the other time

173
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,240
He and I get into a fight over a pine cone and a tentacle goes up my ass. Yeah, well, okay

174
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,560
I think I know you guys is issue. He had to pull me you he had to pull me

175
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,160
There was a tentacle and it came out of all air and it went there

176
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm not standing up because it'll it'll look weird on camera

177
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,760
There is a hole in the back of my this yeah thing it ripped right through well

178
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,240
I think I know why why you guys are having these problems

179
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,500
I mean when you go outside are you wearing your three million dollar cloaking device?

180
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,760
What where would I get where no I don't have three million dollars let alone spending it on a cloaking device

181
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,140
I probably spend even buy one for us put Dolby digital

182
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:39,020
Ever asked you'll buy us one. Yeah, you didn't think to maybe to maybe like share

183
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,200
I thought you guys liked having fun out there. It's we've got twice. He's getting fucked in the ass with a tentacle

184
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
He likes that. He does that normally. He did that before this apocalypse.

185
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,200
By the way, I spent my last pinecones on just another pinecone.

186
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Yeah, pinecones are money too.

187
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
It's all just fucking pinecones.

188
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I didn't even know that because to me right now money is money and food is food.

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Where are you getting food from?

190
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
And who are you buying stuff from?

191
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Instacart.

192
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,200
That's still around?

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Yeah.

194
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
It's even better now.

195
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
No lines.

196
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Who's delivering the food, man?

197
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Like everyone died!

198
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Slaves?

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Slaves!

200
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
See?

201
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll do a lot of things.

202
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I'll eat human meat.

203
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll pretend that it was a tentacle that went up his ass instead of accidentally my tongue.

204
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
But the last thing I'll fucking do is get groceries from a slave.

205
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Because I'll say this much, slaves are dirty and I don't want to eat those groceries.

206
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Right.

207
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Yeah, most of, I mean...

208
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Let's not say that.

209
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
What?

210
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Let's not say what?

211
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
covered in debris and ash from burning cities.

212
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I don't know if any one person here just got a new job.

213
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Who? You? A job?

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, it's less of a job, it's more of a servitude.

215
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Wait, Instacart or Gitter?

216
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Gitter. It's Gitter.

217
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Do you have to wear the outfit and stuff?

218
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I have to wear the outfit and I have to ride the bike.

219
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Oh my god, I see those guys.

220
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
The bike that's made out of human bones.

221
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Yeah, it's human bones. It's like a HR Giger thing.

222
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,480
It's really gross what they've done to the world.

224
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,320
Yeah.

225
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,140
You know what, one--

226
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,920
If we can, Jubio, can you pull up a photo

227
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,680
of what they've done to the world?

228
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,280
Can we see just a photo of what it looks like outside?

229
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
Yeah, he'll work on that.

230
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, but in the meantime, one thing that I do,

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
we're talking about apps, like Instacart and Getter.

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,680
I do, since the Robotronics get here,

233
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,280
that app that they developed, Laser.

234
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,880
Have you guys seen this app, L-A-S-R?

235
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,720
I have not seen Laser.

236
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,320
And you can press a button and it eliminates

237
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,080
a random person in the world.

238
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,400
This is-- Wait, just one button?

239
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Yeah, on the app.

240
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,120
I want you to pull this up right now, what you've shown us.

241
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,520
This is what it looks like outside.

242
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
Holy fuck.

243
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,040
It looks like this outside.

244
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,720
It's fucking--

245
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,080
This can't be fucking real.

246
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,580
No, it is.

247
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,040
This is somebody took a selfie outside.

248
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,680
Oh my god.

249
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
And this is right outside our house.

250
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,720
The king's arms, that must be referring to Fedman.

251
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,360
That must be.

252
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,400
Because he has eight arms.

253
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

254
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
It must be that.

255
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah.

256
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
But anyway, besides all this, it's been pretty--

257
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,160
I've been all right.

258
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,680
Yeah, I've been chilling.

259
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah, I got--

260
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Video games to the death.

261
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,900
Yeah.

262
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,400
Yeah.

263
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,480
I've been really good at this new game I made up.

264
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,400
What is it?

265
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,800
It's called Chase the Ball of Yarn.

266
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,480
(laughing)

267
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,520
What?

268
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,360
It's called Chase the Ball of Yarn.

269
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,280
It's called Chase the, but Chase of Ball of Yarn?

270
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,040
Chase of the Ball of Yarn.

271
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,960
Yeah, Chase of the Ball of Yarn.

272
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,040
Taste of the Ball of Yarn.

273
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,560
And what I do is like when you guys are asleep,

274
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,040
I get the zoomies, I run back and forth

275
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,880
with a little ball of yarn.

276
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,280
That's the other thing, I gotta take him out twice a day.

277
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,240
take him to the fucking park or else he's zooming all over the place when I'm trying to sleep.

278
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Uh huh. Right? Yeah. And I don't have any of my shots. Yeah. No. And he's gonna need new

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,600
shots. We'll get you some shots. We'll get you some shots. Yeah. We'll get you some shots.

280
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,080
I have a bunch of shots in the closet here. Oh. Yeah. Is there any way that we could get

281
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,960
all of our clothes, like all the clothes that we used to have back? Yes. Okay. I think I

282
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,220
will pay a company a billion dollars to make replicas of our entire wardrobes. That's great.

283
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,700
I think that these shirts are ugly and I don't want to see your thing. Yeah, his nipple is completely. Yeah, I don't like seeing

284
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,580
I

285
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:22,400
I might have I might have destroyed both of our shirts in the fight. These are the only shirts we had left

286
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,500
Yeah, and I'm gonna get you some new shirt. Yeah you some fire

287
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,980
So I'm gonna get you one with with lamps all over it and I'm gonna get you one that says skater. Okay apocalypse apocalypse

288
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,660
Albums what did I bring?

289
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Oh my god.

290
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Right?

291
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Because we had a couple minutes before we had to get running to the bunker.

292
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
I didn't bring anything.

293
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
You didn't bring anything?

294
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
I brought the Linkin Park Jay-Z split.

295
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,780
Yeah, luckily, I mean, the thing is we do have a record, we have an archive of the entire

296
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
internet on here.

297
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
So we do have every album ever, but they're all-

298
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,780
How much fucking money did you spend?

299
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,300
You have an archive of the entire internet?

300
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,940
Yeah, so we do have, we have this song, for example.

301
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Here, just throw this up.

302
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,180
Right now, what you have right here, just put-

303
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Just show, just show the whole-

304
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,260
Just throw this up on the screen.

305
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
We have this right here.

306
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,260
Show that you, Jubio, you looked up Kendrick Amar.

307
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Yeah.

308
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:11,300
do a little bit more AI training. Jubio3 is a bit buggy. Uh-huh. See, it was three attempts and every single

309
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:19,140
attempt I think I got some kind of oil on the computer. Yeah, yeah. The third

310
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,860
attempt, it was the one that worked, was not the best attempt. No. No. Yeah,

311
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,380
something in his kind of computer genome I think got a little... Look at him smiling

312
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,620
like that. Yeah. Oh, there really is something wrong with that. Why didn't we at least

313
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,340
least change how he looked. Yeah. Right? We could have made him anything. We could have

314
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,740
at least given him like sunglasses. Or like we could have made him like an

315
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,500
anime. He could have been anime. Do you know what actually would have been great

316
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,780
is if we didn't change his appearance and we actually preserved how he looked

317
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,420
right before we uploaded him. Woah! He just got a hat! With a giant gaping hole in his face.

318
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,900
That might have been nice. That would have been really nice. Yeah. A hole that covers all

319
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,060
his horrible facial features. I am seeing it. Yeah. He just got a hat. Get that hat off your head.

320
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Yep, thank you. Delete hat, Jubio3.

321
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,060
Okay, run the peace sign protocol.

322
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,060
That looks awesome. That's a really good protocol.

323
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,060
So, I guess the

324
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,060
nice thing is, if we have an archive of the whole internet, we have

325
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,060
stuff to look at, right? Yeah.

326
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,060
Like, what do we have here, Jubio3?

327
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:34,980
this website it's prepper 365 again an archive of it this is I guess I kind of

328
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,540
just want to like check this out and see how we stack up against like all the

329
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,860
stuff that they have here right here let's start with the myths about preppers

330
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:49,380
we didn't do a ton of prepping ourselves yeah here okay so this is a prepper

331
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,500
have you guys ever I mean we're we we'd spent most of our time honestly on on

332
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,620
building the thing. We didn't really get to the prepping stuff. I thought that this

333
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:05,660
was gonna happen maybe like you know 2024 or yeah 2023, 2024, 2025. Maybe December 2022.

334
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:13,660
November. Well I guess it did happen. Trust me, I thought this was gonna happen way later and I did

335
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,380
no prepping at all even for this episode. I thought it was gonna be 2012 also. Yeah. But the next 2012.

336
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
- Right, yeah.

337
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,980
- 'Cause there's BC, AD, there's gonna be another one.

338
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,820
- Yeah.

339
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,020
- So I thought maybe we'd hit another 2012 at some point.

340
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,500
- I did a little prepping, but it was mostly

341
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,460
just walking around to train myself for walking.

342
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,300
- Oh, you know what I did?

343
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,120
- Get the blood flowing.

344
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,960
- You know what I did prep?

345
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,800
- Yeah, exactly.

346
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,620
- What?

347
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,460
- Pokemon Go.

348
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,960
- It's not gonna connect to anything.

349
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,440
- Really?

350
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,260
- Yeah.

351
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,100
- Yeah, it doesn't.

352
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,480
- So that means that I'm still the ruler of the gym.

353
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
That's true.

354
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,820
GameStop.

355
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,480
That's so true.

356
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,520
You'll be the gym leader for that--

357
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,160
Good word.

358
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,080
--in the LES.

359
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,160
The thing is, yeah, the only apps that work now

360
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,400
are Robotronic-approved apps.

361
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,360
And most of those--

362
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,520
I mean, they do have-- they have SlaveGo.

363
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,640
But that one is--

364
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,280
I don't really--

365
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,920
--catch new--

366
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,720
Yeah, I don't really like playing that one.

367
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
No, it's also-- that's not even on your phone.

368
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,840
They hand you a butterfly net.

369
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,340
Yeah.

370
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,840
It's not in a backpack.

371
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,140
It's like, I can only fit one guy in there, first of all,

372
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,800
my inventory.

373
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,140
And then all of a sudden, you're doing micro transactions

374
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,400
for Robocoins, right?

375
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,560
because you have to get a bigger bag.

376
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,400
- It is nice though, if you--

377
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,840
- You need to get a watch for your slaves,

378
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,880
you can get a G-Shock.

379
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,160
- When you get that app and you find out

380
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
you have a slave stop right across the street

381
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
from your house, you can hit it every day.

382
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,240
- Yeah, yeah, that is nice.

383
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
- Be instantly around when you wake up.

384
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
- You just sit in your bunker and just spin that thing.

385
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
- Yeah, just spin the slave stop.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,720
- The thing that I don't like though is--

387
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,200
- Just get free shackles.

388
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,040
- Yeah.

389
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,680
- There's no such thing as rights anymore.

390
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,640
You could just put Pokemon in the game.

391
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,840
- Yeah, that's a good point.

392
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,880
- Hey buddy, I'll tell you something.

393
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,580
There's one right nowadays, and you know what it is?

394
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,400
Fedman FedEx, he's right.

395
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,920
Yeah.

396
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,040
You're a big Fedman fan.

397
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,240
I'm a Fedman supporter.

398
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
Yeah, I mean, obviously--

399
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,280
I don't support his ideas.

400
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,800
I didn't support-- I never thought

401
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,040
I would support someone like Fedman, but I will say,

402
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,400
once you guys get a little older,

403
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,760
you get a little bit of money in the bank,

404
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
you're going to start seeing things differently.

405
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,280
So you were thinking that maybe one day when

406
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,760
we make a little bit of money, we're

407
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,260
going to all of a sudden switch from being

408
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,400
people who like humans.

409
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,000
You're going to be-- yeah.

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
You think that we shouldn't have slaves on Earth

411
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,800
and that earth shouldn't be destroyed to oh, now,

412
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,320
now Fedman and his dad Glaxon, who rest in peace.

413
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,640
The thing is, I disagree with the guy politically.

414
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,560
To say that he deserved that is like,

415
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,680
that's bullshit.

416
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,360
- Yeah, that's not right. - But he just choked on stew.

417
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,760
- Yeah, it's a horrible way to go.

418
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,560
- I don't care. - He was only like 380.

419
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,720
- I actually don't care that he's fucking dead.

420
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,520
And you know what, if you hear this, Fedman,

421
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,040
- Okay, so here-- - Your dad was a bitch.

422
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
- No, don't say that. - Don't say that at all.

423
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,280
- You're gonna get the whole-- - Don't say that,

424
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,120
don't say that, don't say that, don't say that.

425
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,960
- I'm gonna have to arrest you for some--

426
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,240
- Cut away from him, cut away from him.

427
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
- Thank you, thank you.

428
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,920
- I'm still on the screen.

429
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,420
- Cut to a, yeah, thank you, okay.

430
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,160
- No, and your finger is out too.

431
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,360
- No, get him out, get him out.

432
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,200
- Stop.

433
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,720
- Fedman, we like you.

434
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,600
- So, here's some myths about preppers.

435
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,160
Number one, prepping is expensive.

436
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,000
- Yeah, you got that right.

437
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,280
We didn't do a damn lick of it,

438
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,720
because it was so expensive.

439
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,560
- What do you mean?

440
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,380
We built all this.

441
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,720
I bought a plasma ball.

442
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
This was--

443
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,380
- No, no, no, 'cause this--

444
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,220
- This is a quarter million dollars.

445
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,800
- This doesn't count as prepping.

446
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,920
Why? We got walls.

447
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
It's a bunker.

448
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
There's stuff, there's devices.

449
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,000
It's a bunker, sure, but it's not, this is not prepping.

450
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,400
I just realized I can hack Jubio right now.

451
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Look at this.

452
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Ah!

453
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,800
I made him scream in pain.

454
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh my gosh, that many keys just to make him scream?

455
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Yeah, I typed, well yeah.

456
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,520
I think it was just this key that did it.

457
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:45,320
that's a short scream you have to type in the whole thing okay I'm not a fan of

458
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,000
that yeah there's so many fun toys back here that we're not gonna touch though

459
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,320
because some of them flush toilets and some of them turn the fridge on and this

460
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,560
one which one turns the fridge on we're not until listen until we get a

461
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,520
refrigerator something that's really good we're not wasting water on the

462
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,320
fridge water-powered fridge by the way okay speaking of fridges my old fridge

463
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,880
back in the day yeah it keeps leaking water I don't know what's going on with

464
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,960
that I think there's a line there my fridge it's like a red to the into the

465
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,040
fridge my old fridge would leak into the fridge in like this is it just

466
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,800
condensation I don't know what's happening but I was supposed to have a

467
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,040
party on Sunday the 30th but the fridge is ruined the fridge is being weird it's

468
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,680
still gonna happen or was it was still gonna have it did happen it still

469
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,040
happened but the beers and stuff might have been wet. They're wet, okay.

470
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,680
Don't you want a beer to be wet though? Isn't it like every commercial they're

471
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,200
like, "Here's the beer." They slam it down, water flies everywhere. And the thing is

472
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,000
man, I'm walking around, I got my gloves on, I don't want to get my fucking gloves

473
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,840
wet drinking beer. That's right. I'll say that shit with my chest. I do not want

474
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,720
the condensation on a beer glass, I don't want that. My fingerless Jack

475
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,560
Skellington gloves, Bud Light. I don't want condensation on those, man. To the Bud Light Corporation, back when you

476
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,200
were around. Well, I mean, actually, I think they're still around. I think they

477
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,440
are. I think they're one of the few things that that didn't get destroyed,

478
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,120
but the Bud Light Corporation, if you get, if your ice-cold beer is condensated to

479
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,560
the point that my Jack Skellington fingerless gloves get wet, and they smell,

480
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Yeah, that's a problem. I

481
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,620
I'm going to your I'm going to the Budweiser ranch. I'm putting

482
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,200
Too much ketamine and all of your damn Clydesdales. That's right

483
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,840
Uh-huh, and if rank allies the fuck out of them and if your beer if it's too hard to open

484
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm gonna kill every one of you. Yep. Yeah. Hey, here's the other thing take those cans those bullshit cans

485
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,140
Yeah, put a bottle top on them. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

486
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
Why are we fucking around in Arizona?

487
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Why are we doing all this bullshit fucking tab shit?

488
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,140
At least make the can come with a can opener.

489
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,140
There's a tool that opens the can.

490
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Why do I have to do it with my finger?

491
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
Make a little thing that's attached to the side of the can.

492
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Look at my finger!

493
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
You pull it out.

494
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Do you think that this finger could open a can?

495
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
No! I need a tool.

496
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
Look at this finger! It's tiny!

497
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
And hey, here's another thing.

498
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Hey, pine trees. Make more pine cones.

499
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,460
pine cones yeah why are we getting every pine tree we're getting fucking we're

500
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,900
getting 16 pine cones we should grow 50 we should grow pine trees down here we

501
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,140
should have a little hydroponics lab with the poop water because poop is

502
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,180
fertilizer god from the toilet plant some pine cones that's seeds right so you

503
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,700
want to get a you are pine cone pine cones are definitely fine I need a

504
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,420
jubilee oh three look up if pine cones are seeds because I genuinely need to

505
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,260
- No.

506
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,620
- A pine cone is fucking, is black as night though.

507
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,780
- I mean, most seeds are dark in color.

508
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,060
- I meant the sun.

509
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,020
The sun is black and there's nothing coming,

510
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,860
there's no rays.

511
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,980
- We're gonna get some sun lamps

512
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,420
and we're gonna grow some little pine trees down here.

513
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,300
- Okay, here's some fun facts about, they're not seeds.

514
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,500
- Okay, we won't plant them.

515
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,020
- Storage compartments for dozens of seeds.

516
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,660
- Oh my fucking God.

517
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,500
- Wait.

518
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,820
- One pine cone could be dozens of pine trees.

519
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,940
And imagine how beautiful Christmas will be next month.

520
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,700
If we start growing these pine trees now,

521
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
They'll probably be full-grown by Christmas.

522
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
That's a good point.

523
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,200
I think Christmas is cancelled. I think Santa died. Santa's dead.

524
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Santa's for sure dead.

525
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,700
Don't you ever fucking say that ever again.

526
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,200
Okay.

527
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I don't care if it's true or not, don't fucking say it, okay?

528
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
WHAT?!

529
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Santa found dead.

530
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
That's from 2017. Click on that.

531
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,700
No, no, it says 343 AD.

532
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,200
Santa died.

533
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
He died that long ago?

534
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,700
Jesus Christ.

535
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Santa found dead on New York Post.

536
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,440
(laughing)

537
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,780
- Can you imagine what it was like pitching this story

538
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,060
in the fucking, in the New York Post?

539
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,980
Yeah, there's all these Paris Hilton upskirts and stuff.

540
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,780
- I don't know what happened today.

541
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,620
- Scroll down.

542
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,420
- There's been no like teenagers subway surfing or anything.

543
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,220
- Let's do Santa found dead.

544
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,300
- Yeah, Santa found dead.

545
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,140
This will scare people more.

546
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,620
- Real life Santa Claus grave found

547
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,420
an extremely important discovery.

548
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,460
- Who's Virginia?

549
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,340
Yes, Virginia, there was a Santa Claus.

550
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,140
Who is Virginia?

551
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,660
- That's from Miracle on 34th Street.

552
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
- Oh, I've never seen it.

553
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,260
- It's a shrine, they found the tomb of Santa Claus.

554
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,660
(laughing)

555
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,500
- What?

556
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,340
- They've got the tomb of Santa in Turkey?

557
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,940
- They've detected an ancient tomb

558
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,860
under an ancient church in Turkey?

559
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,860
- It was in Turkey?

560
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,660
Wait, Santa was buried under a Middle Eastern church

561
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,620
all this time?

562
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,940
- Oh my God.

563
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,220
- Oh my, wow.

564
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,420
- Saint Nicholas used his whole inheritance

565
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,280
to assist the needy and the sick, the suffering.

566
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,580
Okay, so that's not presents.

567
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,880
That's just GoFundMe.

568
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,840
- Yep, talk to him. - Yep.

569
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,760
- Wait, listen.

570
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,000
One tale claims that a mysterious bag of gold

571
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,760
appeared in the home of a man who was desperately

572
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,020
trying to marry off his daughters

573
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,460
in order to obtain a dowry.

574
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,940
If not, the girls would be sold into slavery.

575
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,600
This legend led to the leaving of stockings on fireplaces

576
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
in hopes the jolly visitor might fill them with gifts.

577
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
What does that mean?

578
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,360
Those things don't connect.

579
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,680
- This is the story of Santa, I guess.

580
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,240
- My daughters are gonna become slaves

581
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,520
and I think I will save them by putting stockings

582
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,440
and getting Santa Claus to give me presents.

583
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,540
- The stockings, you can put gold in them.

584
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,000
What's stnicholascenter.com?

585
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,040
Let's check this out.

586
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,840
(laughing)

587
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,680
- Who is Santa Claus?

588
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,640
- We're back on it.

589
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,840
No matter what we try to do,

590
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,760
this podcast always comes back to this,

591
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,520
reading a website about Santa.

592
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,640
- Yeah, we do all this shit.

593
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,880
Get a wide shot, Jubio.

594
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,840
We do all this, right?

595
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,720
And then we're just fucking looking at Santa websites again.

596
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,560
Look at this shit.

597
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,380
- Okay, pull it back up.

598
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,060
- I don't care, go to the cell gloves.

599

- Word search, word search.

601
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,380
- I'd like to cut out Saint Nick from the--

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,300
- Wait, there's a crossword too?

603
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,580
- We have a printer in here, we could do this right now.

604
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,860
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,220
Okay, go to the crossword puzzle.

606

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,580
Yeah, I'll find one, shit.

608
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,740
- Come on. - Okay.

609
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,820
- Yeah, you, I think that Fedmin

610
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,780
might have outlawed cussing also, by the way.

611
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,100
- In Europe, Saint Nicholas often leaves

612

So we're just telling lies now, okay, hey, I'm stuck in this bunker I'm gonna start making up some stories, okay

622
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:18,320
Yeah, that's I mean isn't that what humanity is about making up making up stories. You know what we're just continuing

626
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,700
survived through things like the Great Flood the Great Depression the Great

627
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,380
Depression the great craziness yeah yeah exactly the LA riots right because the

628
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,780
great celebrity deaths of 2016 because of the bathroom incident yeah because of

629
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,300
the oral not many people because they were brave men and women and mystics and

630

and very percussion young children who would tell stories and tales to continue

631
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,460
this amazing tradition of humanity. So that's our job. Yeah. Is that we got to

632
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,000
keep this thing going, right? Yeah. Because it's just three guys, a plasma ball, a

633
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,060

634
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:13,660
A reel-to-reel. A reel-to-reel, a Mexican guy that we put into a laptop, and an

635
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:19,500
aquarium. Yeah. You know? So that's my... Can you guys give me a clap for my speech?

639
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,100
yeah who's sperm is gonna work I know well okay here's that you remember when

640
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,540
there we were looking up and there was all those horrible spaceships green

641
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,860
glowing descending onto the earth your head will be the earth and we will be

642
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,420
the spaceships with our the parts of our bodies at dangle yeah okay if you think

643
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:05,420
Think of your butt as a bucket. Now imagine a bucket full of mayonnaise.

644
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,220
Yep.

645
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,020
And this will be your situation.

646
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,500
Think of the way they destroyed the White House and the Capitol building and the Empire

647
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,300
State Building and all that stuff just a couple days ago when they invaded.

648
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,500
Oh, when they had that big gaping thing.

649
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,900
Yeah, they completely baked them up.

650
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,940
That sucked them up and you could see all the...

651
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,900
So so the Empire State Building and the Washington Monument that'll be us - and you will be the spaceship

652
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,860
Yeah, basically so here Pat what I want you to imagine is I want you to imagine your butt

653
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:41,560
Okay as a turkey an uncooked turkey. Yeah, no feathers. It's it's about to go in the oven now imagine me and Caleb as mr.

654
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
bean

655
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,940
So you're gonna put your head in my foot and then imagine you know how mr. Bean loses his watch inside the turkey

656
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,760
That watch could either be interpreted as a cock ring

657
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,440
Or as many droplets of sperm or as a growing fetus

658
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,460
Condom as that you know how when you put the condom on there's all that right so the watch could pretty much be anything that's staying

659
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,460
Inside your so you're gonna put your

660
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,280
No, no

661
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Why do we have a cockroach on our hand?

662
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,840
Like Mr. Bean, you're gonna put your hand in my butt to get the sperms out?

663
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,060
No!

664
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,520
No, we're gonna put your hand to push even further into your body.

665
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,720
Let me give you another metaphor then.

666
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

667
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,000
I guess it's a simile, right?

668
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,480
Can you help me?

669
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,920
I guess imagine...

670
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,680
My brain is white.

671
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,080
Okay, here.

672
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,760
Imagine a TV.

673

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,680
and there's sexy videos playing on it first of all but that's not important

675
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,240

00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,880
Okay, obviously. HDMI 1, HDMI 2. Now imagine two HDMI cords, okay, and they're covered in

681
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,880
lube and they squirt sperm into your hole.

682
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Yeah.

683
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
And then a baby grows inside you.

684
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,180
I know how sex works. Let me get this joke about how...

685
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,000
You already got it and it was nothing.

686
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's a good one.

687
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,400
I'm sorry, I'm not going to give it to you. It was completely nothing. It was a bad joke.

688
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
It didn't make any sense.

689
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
I don't even know what an RCA cable looks like.

690
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Yeah, it really...

691
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,120
Red, white, and yellow ones.

692
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Blue.

693
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
Red, white, and blue.

694
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Yeah, that's right.

695
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
That's gone.

696
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Yeah.

697
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
That is gone.

698
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Yeah.

699
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
Okay, imagine a volcano.

700
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Okay.

701
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
And here's the worst thing.

702
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
And we're fucking the volcano.

703
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Here's the worst thing about these Glaxon destroyers.

704
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
They fucking-

705
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Oh, the Dirksons?

706
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
The Dirkson destroyers.

707
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,720
They turned the flag, they turned it upside down.

708
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
They turned it upside down.

709
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Yeah, what is up with that?

710
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,600
They disrespected the flag, drained all the color from it.

711
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,960
They drained all the cum from my fucking dad and they're making clones of him.

712
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Yeah, that's not right.

713
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Disgusting.

714
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
That's not right.

715
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
I mean, back in the days of human rights, there was something against-

716
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,120
I know what they're doing to my dad well cuz your mom's dead, and they're using her as a human puppet

717
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
So your dad has to be

718
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,600
Probably like fucking

719
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,880
Probably like a sex slave yeah, yeah, I think my dad is it is a total sex slave for the Glaxon

720
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,620
Yeah, here's the here's what they did to the flag show this you via Jesus Christ. Oh my god. That's not right

721
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,600
That is not fucking right this guy on it

722
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,220
But it looks like Baphomet, and then I even ours are five pointed stars and the cross the stars

723
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,920
well they put stars in the stripes I don't know why they had to put the

724
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,280
here's a good right you already have busy it's hard it does yeah legible for

725
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,360
you already have if you want why I don't like you want to do a Satan thing you

726
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,760
already have five pointed stars why would you turn the the stars of the American

727
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,800
flag into upside down crosses you don't turn it on crosses they turn a lot of

728
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,720
monuments and fancy buildings upside down now take a look at this flag yeah

729
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,640
they also this was another thing they did yeah this is the one that's hanging

730
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:19,760
in now. Uh-huh. Yeah. It's scary. That is a terrifying flag. But they did actually, they

731
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,480
turned upside down a building or two. I think they did one in Myrtle Beach, I think they

732
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,160
even turned a building upside down. Oh yeah, they did. Wait, wait, search Myrtle Beach

733
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,880
upside down building. You know what the worst thing they did? What? They took the lean out

734
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,080
of that tower of Pisa. They did, they made it straight. And they illegalized lean. It was

735
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,520
legal for one day before this happened. And they illegalized it. Look at what they did.

736
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,840
Look at what these pieces of shit did to this world. What the fuck. Jesus Christ. Look at

737
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,680
the crowd of people, they're screaming. They fell out of the top. All of these people are

738
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,120
crying. They fell out of the top, you see that hole? They all fell right out. It's fucking

739
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,640
horrifying. That can happen to any one building. They have a machine that turns buildings upside

740
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
You know what else they did recently?

741
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,140
What?

742
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,640
Jubio, pull up, search Sphinx, pull up Sphinx here.

743
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,640
What'd they do?

744
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
With an I, spell it normal, okay?

745
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
That's a cat.

746
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I never foresaw that.

747
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Put that picture up on here.

748
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,640
What the hell did they do to this?

749
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Now if you look closely on here, they took the nose off the Sphinx!

750
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Oh my god!

751
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
That thing had a nose! I remember that!

752
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
They did it in all the pictures too!

753
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
They just have a beautiful, beautiful nose.

754
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,680
only did they take the nose off, they photoshopped the nose out.

755
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,320
And they took the pictures.

756
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
And they took the pictures.

757
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
They have good cameras, too.

758
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
They're from space.

759
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
Yeah, they know how to work it.

760
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
They're from space.

761
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,800
They all have a Ricoh GR2 that they're using.

762
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,280
All right, let's check the-- let's go to the--

763
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
That's not even a great camera.

764
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,320
--myths about the preppers.

765
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,880
I do want to cover some of these.

766
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,980
So we-- all right, so let's see how these apply to us.

767
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
So we're preppers.

768
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
We've established that.

769
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,360
We have a whole kind of room here.

770
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,960
Number one, you have commando-- or number two, we already did the money thing.

771
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
have to have commando-like skills. While skills are certainly an important part of

772
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,000
being prepared, you don't have to be skilled in hand-to-hand combat to prepare

773
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,920
for most disaster situations. Are there preference with a military background?

774
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,080
Absolutely. Helpful? Yes. Necessary? No. So now, so I have a military background, right?

775
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,280
I did gymnastics for two years. He didn't do that. And so, who won the pine cone

776
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:22,000
fight? Well, I lost because there was a tongue in my butt.

777
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,120
Mm-hmm and I I was a very experienced in Tai Chi and meditation and who didn't fight

778
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,080
I have a military my I have a I come from a military family

779
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:38,680
Yeah, do you my a lot of most of my uncles were in the army and how where'd that get him now, huh?

780
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,720
They're all I mean

781
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,300
They're probably making your dad probably do an ass to ass like the end of rec room for a dream right now

782
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,200
It's your dad and there's a bunch of alien that's seen up real quick

783
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,720
Don't pull that thing we're allowed to pull that so I don't think we can watch that no

784
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,500
I think no I think ass to ass is on YouTube. I think if you look up

785
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:03,120
Now I think yeah, we actually installed a content filter in Jubio, I can't do anything like that

786
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,120
You can you look up?

787
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:13,040
Asked to ask two guys. No don't it's not gonna help us. I don't think I am excited that we that

788
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,060
Thank God the only website that the aliens left up is patreon. Yeah, cuz we're gonna be making fucking what a

789
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:25,340
Fucking nobody nobody can pay for Netflix anymore. Nobody can pay for Amazon Prime. No, I don't know what I can pay for Paramount Plus

790
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,880
Yeah, say what you will and you know all those subscriptions coming to us now. I'm one of Edmund FedEx's biggest

791
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,780
Critics I will say I would say you're kind of a complainer. Yeah. Well, well, I'm one of his big

792
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,920
You're one of Earth's biggest babies. I'm one of his biggest critics

793
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,680
I will say though. I do love his undying support for independent creators. Yeah

794
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,040
Yeah, yeah, he kept up fans Lee and

795
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,040
I mean, that's that's what I'm saying guys

796
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,660
I think if you look a little deeper into his policy you'll find that he's he's he's a very reasonable guy

797
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:05,800
You guys who has a lot of humanity's best interest at heart. Yeah, cuz he kept grailed up. Yeah, he kept grailed up grailed. Yeah

798
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,680
Now it's called grilled. Yeah human meat on it. Yeah

799
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:19,040
Yeah. He sold Rick Owens bones. What is Grailed even a... I mean look at this.

800
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,340
A platform for personal style. What do you sell your body on here for fucking

801
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:28,200
money? Yeah. I think this is for... I think now this is for Robotronics to get

802
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,120
human disguises. It's because Robotronics are... the one thing that I will... I mean if

803
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,720
we had a photo of a Robo... it's hard to get a photo of them. Right. We don't have

804
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,000
one yet. They do love Stussy. They love Stussy, they love Echo. That can be kind of an ongoing

805
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,960
thing for us. Maybe we can go out in the next few weeks, try to capture some

806
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,320
footage of Robotronics. Yeah, we can maybe try I guess. Yeah, because we don't have any right now.

807
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Yeah. We did get a good a good clip of one of their ships descending, one of the

808
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,160
Dirksen Destroyers. Yeah, we did. That one was pretty good. That was pretty, yeah. So go back to the

809
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,720
myths. I want to check these out. God, my nipples are really just out, huh? Yeah. So, you're a

810
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,720
delusional slash delusional slash conspiracy.

811
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,520
Dilutional.

812
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
Dilutional.

813
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,320
This is about this is about the the pee purifying thing.

814
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,320
So you are you're you're kind of a dilutional because you drink

815
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,520
poop and dirt water and you dilute it into normal water with

816
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,120
your body.

817
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,320
Okay, you're right.

818
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,520
Yeah, I guess so.

819
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,720
Here's a here's this hasn't aged.

820
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,820
Well, you don't have to be an Alex Jones fan to realize that

821
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,520
natural and man-made disasters can do and will happen.

822
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
I do not think that the government is reading my mail,

823
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,120
although they obviously have the ability nor do I think the

824
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,920
aliens are secretly running our government.

825
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,480
Yes, I actually heard that one recently.

826
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,380
So, and that actually ended up being really true.

827
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,220
Yeah, that was actually--

828
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,040
'Cause there was a bunch of,

829
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,360
most every single person that was in power

830
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,440
turned out to be like a sleeper cell, robot.

831
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Yeah, they had Robotronic DNA in their system.

832
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,960
Yeah, Robotronic DNA, they are these--

833
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,920
Human weapons.

834
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,680
Michelle Obama was an alien.

835
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,520
Yeah.

836
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,360
A male alien.

837
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,600
And what I will say, most of the people in power,

838
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
they turned out to be human,

839
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,080
but with Robotronic DNA allowing them to be controlled.

840
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,520
but most mayors and selectmen, full alien,

841
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,000
full, completely planted alien.

842
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,840
- Oh yeah.

843
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,900
- Especially the selectmen.

844
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,740
I mean, you should have guessed

845
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,120
from a name like that, selectmen.

846
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,960
- Yeah, 'cause they asked--

847
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,920
- What human would call someone a selectman?

848
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,740
- Yeah, exactly.

849
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,040
- They were selected by the aliens.

850
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,560
- Exactly, selected men. - To go to Earth.

851
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,040
- Selected men. - Yeah, exactly.

852
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,580
- Okay, you are hoping for the end of the world.

853
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,440
Yeah, I guess I wasn't hoping for the end of the world.

854
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,600
Just making sure I was prepared.

855
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,720
I do kind of-- - I wasn't hoping,

856
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,200
'cause I, I mean, I had that big party I had planned

857
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,540
for Sunday. - Yeah, that's true.

858
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,720
- We were all gonna wear costumes

859
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,000
and Caleb and Cameron-- - And it did happen.

860
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,400
- Well, Caleb and Cameron brought,

861
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,260
what did you guys bring?

862
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,440
You said you brought your egg--

863
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,040
- I brought an egg salad that has,

864
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
yeah, it was a pretty good egg salad.

865
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,680
- I have a feeling that I brought

866
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,300
some kind of sweet delete, delete.

867
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,140
- Sweet delete, delete?

868
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,760
- See, no, they didn't have delete, delete back then.

869
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
That's a two-robotronic dish. - Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.

870
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,920
A dessert, a delight. - Oh, that's what you're

871
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,840
thinking of. - A sweet delight.

872
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,840
That's gonna be but I call it a sweet delete. That was really good. Yeah, and I really enjoyed it

873
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,140
Yeah, the only problem is I was your favorite part of it

874
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,460
I guess my favorite part was when we watched the scary movie. I meant the favorite part of my sweet delete

875
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,100
Oh your sweet delete my favorite part. It was how full it made me good

876
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:20,800
Preppers are just religious zealots. I'm gonna go down here to the end of this thing

877
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Preppers are just religious zealots building an arc which we tried to do by the way

878
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,680
The wood prices are just fucking out of control these days.

879
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Sheet metal though?

880
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,400
While many Christians will cite Proverbs 21 as a basis for their preparations,

881
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,200
there's treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the wise,

882
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
but a foolish man spendeth it up.

883
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,120
Not all Christians subscribe to this concept.

884
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,800
I've even heard some Christians say that prepping is based on a lack of faith,

885
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
though I disagree with this.

886
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,720
The fact remains that some do believe this.

887
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,400
It's just as prepping is not limited to those who hold certain political beliefs,

888
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
nor is it limited by religious affiliation.

889
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,720
I mean, we're three different religions here.

890
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,520
You know, I'd recently converted to, uh,

891
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,320
Glogonianism, you know, because I wanted to kind of assimilate.

892
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,160
- Oh, good for you, I didn't know that.

893
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,560
- Yeah, I didn't want to be like, you know,

894
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
'cause I was-- - That's big.

895
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,400
- Going from like, 'cause I actually--

896
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,000
- I actually recently converted too, to Judaism.

897
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,200
- Oh, really? - Yeah.

898
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,560
- It was hard as fuck to be a Muslim

899
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,340
in the post, like, annihilation world, you know?

900
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,320
Like, it just is, honestly, it's just hard to find

901
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,040
like, halal food, so I was like,

902
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,840
pine cones don't cut it for some reason.

903
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,360
They like, for whatever reason, pine cones are not halal.

904
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,040
They might not be kosher either, so I'd watch it.

905
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,880
- Yeah.

906
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,720
- So, Gorgonian is--

907
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,040
- Well, the important thing about the kosher thing

908
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,440
is you can't eat human meat with human cheese.

909
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,280
- I just converted--

910
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,840
- And you can't boil, oh, if you ever get a hand on his mom

911
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,720
and you wanna eat him, you can't boil him in her milk.

912
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,560
- Yeah.

913
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,400
- That's like way out of line with--

914
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,220
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

915
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
- Well, she's got no more milk.

916
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,560
She's a green, decomposing--

917
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,840
- They took the milk out of her?

918
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,280
- Yeah.

919
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,520
They took, hey, there's, I don't even know

920
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,280
if there's any milk left.

921
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,120
- There was.

922
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,960
- There wasn't any left.

923
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,200
- There was milk left in your mom.

924
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
I don't think so.

925
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,200
There was a huge amount.

926
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,640
When I saw her on those puppet strings, I don't even think she had a jaw.

927
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Really?

928
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Yeah.

929
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,720
I will say before this whole thing happened, I did use my milk scanner, and there was a

930
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
lot of milk.

931
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Yeah.

932
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,560
I used my milk scanner right here.

933
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,720
I converted to a new type of agnostic called atheism.

934
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,760
You're going atheist on us, man?

935
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah.

936
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
After all this, what about the...

937
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I'm going to get a...

938
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Look at this!

939
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,240
this out? You know what? I'm back to agnostic. Okay, that's right, because

940
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,200
you're not sure, because there's certain things in this world, like a plasma ball

941
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,040
where you go, "Yeah, maybe God isn't real, Christianity is fucking bullshit,

942
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,640
Glogon's not even fucking real." Then you touch a plasma ball and you say, "Well,

943
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,480
who made this?" Yeah. Right? Right. Who made the elements of this? Exactly. And also,

944
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,920
how's it heating my finger up so fast? Is it hot? It kind of gets hot if you keep it there.

945
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,040
there yeah I yeah I'm gonna start getting a now that I'm agnostic I'm gonna start

946
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,720
getting all sorts of crazy tattoos really yeah like what probably like a

947
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,040
fisherman yeah tell you what's a of what this one this one's aged pretty poorly

948
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,160
now I think yeah this I mean this guy this is what kind of what your mom

949
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,480
looked like right no jaw okay and the crown I think your mom was made out of

950
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,320
of just bullets. Really? Just bullets kind of just reaming your head? Oh, well, just no

951
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:24,120
scalp either. I got one of my dad. Yeah. Oh wow. Yeah, I don't know if you guys can see

952
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,800
that on camera. Yeah. I just got that. He's making a skeleton. Yeah. He's uh, I mean,

953
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,920
I also don't know if you guys have. That's what your dad looked like when you saw him?

954
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,680
Yeah. Well, he's, he's. I don't know if you guys have. Yeah. Oh, that's the smell. Yeah,

955
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,040
- Yeah, that's my dad, my mom, my uncle, my aunt,

956
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,880
grandpa, grandma. - You put it in a pile?

957
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,400
- You kept everybody.

958
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,600
- Yeah, what am I gonna do, throw 'em away?

959
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,920
- I saw most, on FaceTime, I saw pretty much

960
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,600
my whole family get disintegrated,

961
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,280
but I didn't know they kept my mom and dad

962
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,120
to keep taunting me.

963
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,960
- Well, now it's called Space Time.

964
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,140
- True.

965
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,440
Let's check out this list of the--

966
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,320
- Preppers Just Hate Obama.

967
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,680
- Wait, wait, wait, go back to that one.

968
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,160
I actually do wanna read that.

969
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,000
Preppers Just Hate Obama, that was actually--

970
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,240
Clinging to their guns and Bibles certainly didn't endear him to many folks in part of the country,

971
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,000
but the fact remains that the prepper survivalist movement long predates the Obama presidency.

972
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,500
Remember Y2K? That turned out to be true.

973
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
So it actually just was a little delayed.

974
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:25,500
So like, that's why Jubio doesn't have any memories of anything and his family.

975
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,000
He doesn't remember anything about his family, right?

976
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,500
And he also likes getting hit.

977
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,000
[slap]

978
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,500
You know? He actually likes it.

979
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,400
you know but he can't he also can't speak so he doesn't he can't tell you but he

980
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
does like it he really really likes it others say it goes all the way back to

981
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,440
the pilgrims my parents are both depression babies hey you don't have to

982
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,920
tell anybody that yeah that's your your your parents your grandparents or your

983
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,800
grandparents didn't want to have your parents yeah that's nice that's fucked

984
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,840
up you don't have to tell anybody that's something you say in therapy buddy you

985
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,880
don't say that on your website. Let's see what else is on this, the myths. Hope for

986
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,680
the best, prepare for the worst. That's about it. I like this advertisement here. I like

987
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,120
the look of that for some reason. Can you zoom in on that? Yeah, zoom in on this here

988
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,560
advertisement. Oh, actually zoom in on that one. Yeah, this picture to zoom into either

989
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,920
the right or left side of this picture really far. Oh, I ate that the other day. A foot?

990
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,280
No, the cream. Oh. Oh, actually Pat, this is a really good representation of what me

991
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,320
and Caleb are gonna do. This is kind of what we were looking for. I could be the left

992
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,920
foot, you could be the right foot, and we can both be the spoon.

993
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,680
Maybe we're sharing a spoon. Yeah. That's not a bad idea.

994
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,840
Yeah. Okay, there's more stuff on this website. Go to the

995
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,360
prepper list. I wanted to get into this for a little bit. So I have

996
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,280
a couple of items that I think that are going to be pretty helpful

997
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,560
for us. Jubio, if you want to cut to the close-up thing.

998
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,560
and you hold my mic up to me so I can...

999
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,560
Okay, so here's the...

1000
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,560
So I have a couple of things that I think will be helpful.

1001
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
One...

1002
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,560
I know we've been eating pinecones, but I did share one thing,

1003
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,560
and maybe for one of our birthdays or something,

1004
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
I have one can of beefaroni.

1005
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
Oh, I don't like that.

1006
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Hold that up to the...

1007
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Here, here, here.

1008
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
You guys can have that. I don't like beefaroni.

1009
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,560
You don't like beefaroni? Okay.

1010
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,560
No, I don't even care if it's the last thing I'm allowed...

1011
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,560
or the last real food that I'll be able to eat in the world.

1012
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,680
I'm ever gonna eat that. I don't know why but this is the I have just a

1013
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:35,640
mayonnaise. Now I like that! I love that. I can make some real good I can make some

1014
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,680
real good pine cone sauce with that. Romantic dinners we might want to pop

1015
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:49,640
open a little bit of bubbly. Okay. Well that one. What the hell? That is scary. So just show

1016
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,120
maybe this other one there we go yeah just a little bit of that I think

1017
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,880
something bewitched this mountain do oh yeah magic's real now - I should mention

1018
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,440
that you know oh yeah I got a magic is completely real everyone want to close

1019
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,100
whoa hold on now I gotta hold I can't even open my glow stick up for you I got

1020
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,240
you okay you can hold you can purple or green you can hold your mic this whole

1021
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,440
time we shouldn't do green probably because it will become bewitched you've

1022
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,440
been able to hold the mic the whole time.

1023
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:18,940
Whoa.

1024
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,320
These are real, genuine Rothko--

1025
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,720
They're actually real.

1026
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,320
--glow sticks.

1027
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,840
Wow, look at this.

1028
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,480
Oh, I got green.

1029
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,240
I figured maybe we want to keep up morale around the bunker,

1030
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,200
so I got some-- just a couple of things, you know, like--

1031
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,700
you know.

1032
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,400
Oh, this is good.

1033
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,920
Oh, wow.

1034
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,360
I mean, what's better than that, right?

1035
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,360
Here's my glow stick.

1036
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,240
This would be great to hang up, maybe.

1037
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,240
Oh, yeah, we can hang that up.

1038
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:41,760
We could put this here.

1039
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,960
Yeah, yeah, that's not a bad idea.

1040
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,840
I got another one.

1041
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,440
This one says-- see, and I think we all

1042
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,500
like positive affirmation in the morning and shit especially with the stuff going

1043
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,740
on the world politically so this says you know you did not wake up to be

1044
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,640
mediocre so we're gonna wake up and we're gonna be some of the best fucking

1045
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,820
pinecone hunters that's right that would go perfect right here I think we could

1046
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,720
get a thumbtack and put it yeah that might be yeah that's not a bad idea that

1047
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:11,060
is a pretty good one here for now yeah and then what else we have we have rope

1048
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,740
so we could tie him up when we're doing later yeah I can hold on to that this is

1049
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:21,500
exciting for us you like the MRE here oh why don't we make and eat that right now

1050
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,060
we said you don't like beefaroni this is beef ravioli in meat and that's your

1051
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:31,540
soy protein sauce yeah I know how to make these actually all right and then

1052
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,780
one more thing this is huge yeah is because we got to keep ourselves safe I

1053
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:43,140
I think if this is what I if I remember correctly oh yeah oh and let's see this

1054
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:49,580
will be perfect this will help me open up the bag of beef ravioli this is a ninja

1055
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:53,660
star that I bought it was seven dollars and eighty cents I don't know what the

1056
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,300
conversion of pine cones would be but it also comes with a nice free silica gel

1057
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,420
that is sharp is it sharp did you just hurt yourself on it no I just opened the

1058
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,020
bag really quickly. So next time that we get in some kind of fight I definitely

1059
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,220
check this out. I'm gonna make sure that I have that on me. And usually these

1060
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:16,580
MREs come with some kind of dessert. Is that what you're gunning for? I'm excited.

1061
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,460
I think we can treat ourselves to a little dessert. The last time I ate an MRE it had

1062
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:26,980
some kind of peach thing in it. Oh my god. Nutrition facts. I was right.

1063
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,980
We'll have grape jelly and a great

1064
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:36,220
No fucking way, okay, what else do we have in here we have more grape jelly

1065
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:39,540
This is the be preppy only the activator. Yeah

1066
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,180
We're any water water and then we do we have water yeah, okay?

1067
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,620
So then we put the water here you read that you get the water okay here

1068
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,440
I am gonna go I'm gonna let you make this and meet me

1069
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,140
Okay, you guys make that I'm gonna make

1070
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,160
No, you make the R.E.M., me and Cameron will read the list. How about that?

1071
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,160
Yeah, you guys read the list.

1072
00:49:59,160 --> 00:49:59,660
Yeah.

1073
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:05,160
I was going to say, because this also comes with white wheat snack bread TFF.

1074
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,160
Wow.

1075
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,160
Hold that up to the camera.

1076
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,660
Which has, and this is the best bread you can get.

1077
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,660
The best bread?

1078
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,160
Right there, the best bread. 350 milligrams of sodium in it.

1079
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Right.

1080
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,660
And, uh, 3 grams of sugar.

1081
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,660
Okay, so go ahead and make this.

1082
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,660
This is reduced sodium, too.

1083
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,660
Oh, that's nice.

1084
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,980
wants to follow along at home this is beef ravioli in meat and textured soy

1085
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,940
protein. Yeah so go ahead, go on HelloFresh you can order this there probably.

1086
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:39,660
The thing that ties the meal all together. It's called HelloFresh now. One moist towelette. Yeah so we're gonna use that to clean up Pat later.

1087
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,940
So this prepper list, it seems there are literally hundreds of excellent prepper

1088
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,340
lists out there and as part of our journey we have started our own. We hope

1089
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:53,300
to use this as an inventory/wishlist to help us stay on track as well as, hopefully, helping

1090
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:00,020
others develop their own. So, it says, "Happy prepping." This says cash. Okay, yeah, we

1091
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,180
get it. You're fucking rich. Obviously, I don't have any cash. Patrick doesn't have

1092
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:10,020
any cash. He has a bucky buck, which is very helpful. A buddy buck, rather. I don't know

1093
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,620
what that's going to get him on one of his apps, you know? On Lazer or whatever. No,

1094
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,360
You shut up about your apps, okay.

1095
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,500
It says, "We keep extra cash in each vehicle as well as some loose change.

1096
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,860
$20 stashed behind our cell phone covers.

1097
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,700
$200 in the prepper closet."

1098
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,100
The thing is, if the world goes to shit, what the hell, why do you give, oh, at least I

1099
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,940
have $20 in my car.

1100
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,200
That's not going to do anything.

1101
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,200
That's going to help a lot.

1102
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,900
I mean, speaking as someone who has a lot of money in this situation, you'd be surprised.

1103
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,900
Every book, every movie they say, "Okay, money has no value anymore."

1104
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,360
But that's science fiction.

1105
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360
They made that up.

1106
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,980
It's still $100, it's still $100, and you can get incredible food with it.

1107
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,260
I always thought about that with like Fallout and shit.

1108
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,700
It's like, why the fuck are we doing...

1109
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,300
Why is it that all of a sudden bottle caps are some fiat currency?

1110
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,540
It's like, just fuck, keep using money.

1111
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,100
Money has no value anymore, but now bottle caps do.

1112
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,760
Exactly, it makes no sense, dude.

1113
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,760
So stupid.

1114
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,360
the has the MRE cooking coming. It feels a little hot already. I think you're

1115
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:20,800
supposed to do this. No you don't you're not supposed to cut that much of it

1116
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,080
you're supposed to open it up and then fold it you have to close this thing.

1117
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,240
What the hell just happened? A light just went out. Oh great now the lights are

1118
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,480
fucking going out. Okay everything's getting ruined. Water it says water we

1119
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,600
have one water bottle yeah and then now all of a sudden we're gonna have this

1120
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,920
fucking shit water to this guy you're right you are supposed to put I know you

1121
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,680
fucking already ruined it that's okay worst case we have the grape jelly large

1122
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,800
were treated water storage again we have 50 gallons water filter that's me I guess

1123
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,760
uh-huh drink mixes we have mountains amount do this could be a really good

1124
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,200
drink mix grape jelly this is actually maybe now I'm thinking about it maybe

1125
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,640
one of the most valuable things you could have in a post-apocalyptic society

1126
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,560
You are right.

1127
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
And we have two of them.

1128
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,080
And you are--

1129
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,960
See, finding a packet of grape jelly in these times

1130
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,520
is kind of like finding a misprinted nickel.

1131
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,320
Yeah, you're right.

1132
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,200
It's actually worth--

1133
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,640
It's pretty rare.

1134
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,680
You think that's worth nothing.

1135
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,200
You think that's worth $0.05.

1136
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,800
It's actually worth $6.

1137
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,600
So coffee, we don't have any--

1138
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,480
well, I just drank my last cup.

1139
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,520
Yeah, we have this at least.

1140
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,040
Powdered milk.

1141
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,600
- If we wanna pretend we're drinking coffee,

1142
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,800
this empty cup could be pretty good.

1143
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,920
- Oh yeah, I guess we can just use those.

1144
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,340
It's kinda just like a nice, it's like decaf, right?

1145
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,400
It's like-- - Yeah, it's like

1146
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
going through the motions.

1147
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,680
- You know how sometimes you'll drink decaf

1148
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,080
and you'll be like, "Whoa, I feel like I drank a cup of coffee."

1149
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,240
- It's like when you're addicted to watching movies

1150
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,600
and you trick your body into thinking

1151
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,960
you're watching a movie but it's looking

1152
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,200
at a blank TV screen for an hour and a half.

1153
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,560
- Yeah, exactly, which is what we've been doing.

1154
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,840
And then for food, okay, so this is big.

1155
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,280
So we have, let's do a real, so we have,

1156
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,720
we're about to have a beef ravioli.

1157
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,560
- Two grape jellies.

1158
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,520
- Two grape jellies.

1159
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,360
- Tootsie roll.

1160
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,600
- A piece of bread, a beef ravioli,

1161
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,880
a mayonnaise, and a Mountain Dew.

1162
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,480
- And in a pinch, in a pinch rope.

1163
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,960
- Yeah, we can eat that like spaghetti.

1164
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,600
And then if we look at their,

1165
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,520
how does this stack up against theirs?

1166
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,000
Canned fruits.

1167
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,380
- Okay.

1168
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,320
Grape jelly, that counts, that counts, that counts.

1169
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,720
- Canned veggies.

1170
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,560
- Grape, grape jelly.

1171
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,840
- It could be grape, canned beans, that's beef.

1172
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,120
- That's beef, beans, beef.

1173
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,960
- Soups and chili.

1174
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,800
Chili has beef in it.

1175
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,040
- Beans, beef, and bread.

1176
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,320
- Dried beans, we don't have those.

1177
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,440
Rice, we don't have those.

1178
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,720
Flour, we don't have those.

1179
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,720
(laughing)

1180
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,560
Wait, no, this--

1181
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,640
- And fellas, and fellas,

1182
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,120
just take a look at this awesome bread.

1183
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,880
- Oh my God, I'm getting hungry already.

1184
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,400
- Oh my God.

1185
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,280
Hold that up to the GoPro.

1186
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,600
- Get it really close.

1187
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,200
- Take a look at that bread.

1188
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,720
- Oh man, that shit is loud.

1189
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,080
I can smell that.

1190
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,080
- Yeah, that is one of the best--

1191
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,920
- Well, Pat.

1192
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,760
- That is one of the best smelling things.

1193
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,000
- Hey, you're gonna have to take a bite

1194
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,080
with the grape jelly, buddy.

1195
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,520
- Yeah, and listen, before we get to that--

1196
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,120
- Oh wow, this looks--

1197
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,760
This looks so edible.

1198
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,640
Take a bite of that.

1199
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,760
Come on, put that on there.

1200
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,840
And you might-- hey, Pat, you might want a little of this,

1201
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,360
too.

1202
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:09,960
Come on.

1203
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,760
That looks amazing.

1204
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,880
Take a look at this jelly.

1205
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:22,360
It's completely brown, just like a grape.

1206
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,860
And Pat, if that's too bland for you,

1207
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,520
I have some seasoning for you right here

1208
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,240
that you can use, some iodized salt, which

1209
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,440
we can use as flour, too.

1210
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,700
(laughing)

1211
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,120
- He's putting more on.

1212
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,960
- Look at this.

1213
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,800
- He's so hungry.

1214
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,040
- Look at, oh, I'm starving.

1215
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:36,880
I've eaten nothing but--

1216
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,700
- All right, get your spoon.

1217
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,240
You want some mayo in there too?

1218
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,840
Here, put some mayo on the other half, Pat.

1219
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,880
- I'm good with the mayo.

1220
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,480
- We'll save the mayo for later.

1221
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,640
- I'll cut this up and then, oh my fucking God.

1222
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,480
- How's that taste?

1223
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,280
- Dude, we need an overhead shot here.

1224
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,580
- It tastes good, right?

1225
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:57,580
- And you know, you don't get many treats like this nowadays.

1226
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,760
This is a delicacy for sure.

1227
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,760
How's that?

1228
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,120
- And like any good bread,

1229
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,720
it's completely too soft.

1230
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,780
That's always good.

1232
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,720
- It's soft in all the wrong ways.

1233
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,080
And it's also very chalky.

1234
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,720
- Okay.

1235
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,080
Well, that is good bread these days,

1236
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,720
'cause it is bread.

1237
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,240
Let's see, we have pasta.

1238
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,260
Oh, this MRE is steaming right now.

1239
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,500
Is it doing its thing?

1240
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,000
Yeah.

1241
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,540
We have peanut butter, jams, jellies, preserves.

1242
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,420
Pasta, pasta, bread.

1243
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,420
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1244
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,460
And bread that we have.

1245
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,260
Yep.

1246
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,740
Mac and cheese and other box meals.

1247
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,540
This is a box meal.

1248
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,100
Mac and cheese.

1249
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,020
Hey, how about Mac and Devon go to high school?

1250
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:42,520
Put the--

1251
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,500
Peanut-- it's a-- peanut's my personal addiction.

1252
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,060
OK, come on.

1253
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,460
Don't say everyone fucking needs it

1254
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,140
because you're personally addicted to it.

1255
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,100
Yeah, exactly.

1256
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,980
Some people don't even like peanuts.

1257
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:50,780
He's cracking open a Tootsie Roll.

1258
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,660
Not even a word.

1259
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,500
He's just opening it.

1260
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,500
Okay, so basically the whole Emory is getting eaten by him.

1261
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,380
I have an amazing idea.

1262
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,380
Oh my god.

1263
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,380
Hold that up.

1264
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,180
Tilt that down a little bit.

1265
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,340
Oh god, that just, if that doesn't make you hungry, I'm not sure what will.

1266
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,380
Alright, take a big bite.

1267
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,380
Jesus.

1268
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,380
Oh.

1269
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:16,380
And the cake roll is completely rock hard.

1270
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,380
Be careful.

1271
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,540
(laughing)

1272
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,280
- Be careful, I think all the dentists died.

1273
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,780
Oh, look at that, head shot right off.

1274
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,780
This is so hot, bro.

1275
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,140
Oh, I got jelly on myself.

1276
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,900
- I can't eat this, this is hard because it's rock hard.

1277
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,080
- You spit it out.

1278
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,580
You're wasting precious calories.

1279
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,700
- That does look good, though.

1280
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,220
- That does, that is one of the best meals

1281
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,060
I've had in a while.

1282
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,780
- That is delicious, it beats an acorn or a pine cone.

1283
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:50,500
freezer. Some think the freezer is a bad idea and granted, you know what we need to do with

1284
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,780
that Tootsie Rolls? Freeze it.

1285
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,020
You have to keep the MRE propped up. See, I just took the jelly, I think I just accidentally

1286
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:03,740
sucked all the flavor out of it because it just tasted completely just like a...

1287
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,700
It was probably really flavorful and then you sucked all the flavor out of it.

1288
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,060
I think I sucked all the flavor out because it was more, it wasn't even, it didn't even

1289
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,420
taste like food, it just tasted like a texture.

1290
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,500
So let's go down to cleaning supplies.

1291
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,060
We didn't bring any cleaning supplies.

1292
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,620
This jelly will be here forever.

1293
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,060
- This is a cleaning supply right here.

1294
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,940
- Bleach, lots and lots of bleach,

1295
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,340
bar soap, soft soap, dish soap, ammonia,

1296
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,100
window cleaner, Mr. Clean or similar, laundry soap.

1297
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,400
- This haircut got me looking like Mr. Clean.

1298
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,660
- Yeah, nice fucking try.

1299
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,660
No, come on.

1300
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,820
No, you have a haircut.

1301
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,580
I have no hair, so I'm the Mr. Clean.

1302
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,560
- Yeah, you don't really look like Mr. Clean.

1303
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,100
You have to stop opening this stuff.

1304
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,580
You have to open this on camera.

1305
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:47,820
doing an apocalypse mukbang here. You can't just open it without saying anything. Get

1306
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:54,060
a close up on this. Get a close up on him dabbing. He's dabbing. Okay, thank you.

1307
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,900
Wow. I forgot about that.

1308
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,380
Yeah. No, I don't think I've seen a dab in years.

1309
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,540
We don't have any medical or first aid equipment. I think we're probably going to start using

1310
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,540
this.

1311
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,540
Oh, rope!

1312
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,540
This is multi-purpose.

1313
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,340
And Patrick has a bunch of extra skin on his back. We could kind of maybe take that off

1314
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,340
and use that as-

1315
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,220
Yeah, we can grab that and tie it onto one of us with rope.

1316
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:16,820
he's also luckily he's oh this isn't this is a medical a medical tool to scalpel

1317
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,420
yeah I've been an MRE is steaming well let's eat it then come on

1318
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,860
wait but I don't know how long it doesn't have instructions on it it does

1319
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:33,620
but I think you have to take it out of the because it's hot

1320
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:41,680
it's hot at the bottom I'll give you that much let's see it says I work that you

1321
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,660
just didn't even read the instruction she doesn't broke it I know what I'm doing

1322
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:53,540
yeah I'm in the army yeah that's obvious yeah ten to fifteen minutes depending on

1323
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,960
air temperature you're all supposed to shake it which you didn't do so it's

1324
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:03,380
only hot at the bottom so Patrick can eat this

1325
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,380
I don't want anything to do with this anymore.

1326
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,380
You've wasted one of our two food items.

1327
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,380
Well, he spit out the other one.

1328
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,380
He wasted another one too.

1329
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,380
This is your dinner tomorrow night.

1330
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,380
There's still some bread for you.

1331
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,380
Okay. Hold up. Wait, wait, wait.

1332
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,380
And there's some for you too.

1333
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,380
See, he's going to enjoy this.

1334
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,380
I have a gluten intolerance that I developed.

1335
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,380
I developed a gluten intolerance.

1336
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,380
Lucky for you, there is no gluten in this at all.

1337
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,100
No, it's full of gluten.

1338
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,380
I don't think you're making heart death.

1339
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,140
Oh, look at that.

1340
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,020
Look, it's practically a saltine.

1341
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,300
It's practically a pizza.

1342
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,460
Basically a personal pizza that you're eating.

1343
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,420
I'm going to eat it.

1344
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,580
Oh, that's good.

1345
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,180
Is it good?

1346
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,820
Yeah, it tastes like the last pretzel.

1347
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:55,180
Oh, man.

1348
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,700
You guys have to try this stuff.

1349
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,380
This is good.

1350
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:57,880
Yeah.

1351
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,700
Iodized salt?

1352
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,420
Yeah.

1353
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,120
I don't know what they put in this.

1354
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,100
- I have to eat it?

1355
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:03,920
- Just take a bite.

1356
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,760
- Is it good?

1357
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,800
- Just put some, here, here.

1358
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,640
I'll...

1359
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,700
- Yeah, wait, wait, put the three of this on there.

1360
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,660
- Oh, it's not.

1361
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,500
- Okay, I get it.

1362
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,460
- Yeah, we can use it, no, here, here, here.

1363
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,460
Open it up with this.

1364
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,620
- Oh, no, no, I'm full.

1365
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,460
I'm full.

1366
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,300
My, my...

1367
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,740
- No, just poke in the top with that.

1368
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,660
- My stomach is shrank to the size,

1369
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,500
Jesus Christ.

1370
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:29,260
My stomach is shrank to the size of a pine cone

1371
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,260
Oh my god, the aftertaste is good too!

1372
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,260
I love the way it-

1373
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,260
The aftertaste is one of the best parts!

1374
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:41,260
This is actually perfect because it's the kind of food that stays in your mouth for a long time.

1375
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:46,260
So you keep getting the taste, and that's great because we're in the apocalypse and we don't have that much food.

1376
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,260
And look at how cute that is!

1377
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,260
Look at how cute that little mayo drop is.

1378
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,260
Put that open wide, come on.

1379
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,260
Wait, wait.

1380
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,260
Ewwww!

1381
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,500
(laughing)

1382
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,740
(laughing)

1383
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:04,380
- And that mayo's been room temperature for a long time.

1384
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,900
(laughing)

1385
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,820
- Oh my god.

1386
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,980
- You're being a baby.

1387
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,780
- Honestly, the mayo makes it taste like dog food.

1388
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,020
(laughing)

1389
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,620
- So good.

1390
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,140
- I wish I had some dog food right now.

1391
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,140
- Oh man.

1392
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,380
- Wow.

1393
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,380
And the best part is I have no water or coffee to--

1394
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,660
Wait, here, here.

1395
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,260
No.

1396
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,980
At least I have some Mountain Dew.

1397
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:38,020
That is good.

1398
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,740
That hits the spot.

1399
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,340
I don't know who drank the first half of this.

1400
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,660
That's how I found it.

1401
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,340
But that is really, really good.

1402
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:45,980
Yeah.

1403
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,260
Wow.

1404
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,140
This is one of the best days we've had in a long time.

1405
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:50,640
I know.

1406
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,140
This is a feast.

1407
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:52,780
My god.

1408
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,820
I don't think we should keep the M. Oh wait the M. Oh wow

1409
01:02:55,820 --> 01:03:02,300
It's leaking and it's too hot to touch

1410
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:07,140
Loads and destroys

1411
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:13,540
Higher bunker yeah, that'll be good. Oh, it should it should it has to be propped up like this

1412
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:22,240
Okay, okay, all right luckily this place is very durable. Yeah

1413
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,580
About this set is that set this

1414
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,020

1415
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:37,160
Your hands smells like a burning plastic. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you need to go you got something bad on you

1416
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:43,340
Yeah, as you did this so wrong. That's fine that you're gonna. Okay. Yeah touch your eye. Yeah, touch your eye with a different hand

1417
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,340
No, you won't know it was that's a different. That's a different hand touch your hands together

1418
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:55,060
I'll say it guys. I don't like mayonnaise that much anymore. I used to really really enjoy mayonnaise, but I guess something about

1419
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:58,360
You know this this looking at looking at this right now

1420
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:04,420
Have a tootsie roll that hold this up to the camera real quick looking at this right now is really making me hungry for Patrick's

1421
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,420
butt and I don't know why

1422
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,100
Toilet paper reserves

1423
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,100
went up in flames

1424
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:17,540
I forgot about the toilet paper fire. The toilet paper reserves, they had tons of toilet paper

1425
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:22,780
like Fort Knox, the giant reserve, the US Army. Ever since freaking COVID, remember the toilet

1426
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,780
paper stockpiling? Three ply.

1427
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:29,100
That's been the worst part of this whole thing. The damn shelves at the fucking grocery store,

1428
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,100
right?

1429
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,380
And the worst part is COVID got even worse.

1430
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,380
Yeah, I have it.

1431
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,380
Yeah, me too.

1432
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,380
We all have it.

1433
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:39,380
Yeah, yeah. All right, is that kind of... I mean, I feel like that's it for today, right?

1434
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,380
I mean, we had a feast.

1435
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,780
I mean, hey, I just want to say I'm excited, you guys, to go into the rest of the future

1436
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:49,220
with you guys, just goofing off and having fun. I think we can maybe do this for a thousand

1437
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:53,060
years. Okay. All right. I'm down. I mean, as long as

1438
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,420
I keep eating like that, right? Yeah, we'll bring in some more food.

1439
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll figure out how to get some.

1440
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,620
Yeah, and basically, I mean, we're going to unlimited your billions of dollars. We basically

1441
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,500
have unlimited resources to do whatever we want down here.

1442
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,940
Patrick, you could maybe, you could wrap this up. You could box that up.

1443
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:07,940
Yeah, yeah. Take that home.

1444
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we don't really have it.

Yeah, your your hovel outside. Yeah. Yeah my hovel. It's called a hovel because it's what they paid that what now that I work for getter

1447
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,460
By the way, we need to invest in a pasty. I think to cover my leg. Yeah, that might be nice

1448
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,460
Well, I'll get you guys some reconstructed
