00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,080
Because of ass clowns that decide to get their fuck goblin fingers all over our fuck waffle

00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,960
ing swear jar.

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
And up the ass.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
And it's up their douching ass.

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,520
If you couldn't tell, we have decided, after much deliberation, that swearing is back on

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,040
on the menu. Yeah, as some of you people just can't pull that list of swears up

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,200
do be. Oh yeah, when we're just gonna we're gonna go through the whole thing

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,120
and we're gonna say all of them. Yep, that's right. Going to circle. Yeah,

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,000

P word for pussy dick dick suck fuck you Cameron and Patrick mean. This was a

57
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,680
swear back then. Hodgers I already said I said together up the up the I love

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,060
being now we can say we can now we can say was you yeah, I had to feel like

59
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,660
joking. I fucking love pedophiles or some shit. I don't know sexual gesturing

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,600
here's me fucking jacking off a

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,420
okay

62
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,760
drugs. I'm smoking crack with a Karen who's a crack head energy pants can be a

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,080
cuss. Guess how sag my pants are my down to my ankles. Yeah, you are telling I

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,800
don't do that. We don't need this. We've spilled it. We did. Yeah, there's

65
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,120
enough spilling on this table.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Who said fuck was my kid friend. Oh, sexual C word clap in them cheeks.

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, wet. Oh, I get no, no, no. You almost got me.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Really close.

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
He almost got me.

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,440
You know what? You know what? Him adding that to the list to try and get

71
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,560
us. That's a swear.

72
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,400
that is a swear section. So obviously we're done. And listen... Wait, wait, wait. Put

73
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
racial back on, I guess. Well, I just, just end. Well, we're not gonna have a

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,880
jar, so there's no way to know. Yeah, so that's on you guys. If it happens, it

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
happens. I'm so sorry to say you guys didn't like the swear jar.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,260
But we think that it was a big enough part of the history of this show

77
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,920
that I think it can just disappear. No. There needs to be a proper send off.

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,600
I mean, we have to do what we originally were going to do. Yeah. So I mean, I

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,500
think that we you guys knew that the whole point of this thing was always to

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,820
do it for one year as a way to raise as much money for charity as possible. And

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,420
at the end of that year, when it was full and we were saying full to the

82
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,620
brim to the brim, you know what we should have done before this? What is

83
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,140
calculated? Who added the most? Well, it wasn't you. It wasn't me. I'm taking my

84
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,200
five dollars back. Yeah, I know. Well, that also so we can calculate whose

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,180
dollars were whose

86
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,160
first. I'm going to start counting and then second and foremost,

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,380
then we would have known who donated the most charity out of the three of us

88
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,140
who would have been a competition. It doesn't listen. It doesn't it's not a

89
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,760
competition. I really

90
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,540
a competition and I'm sorry for talking over, but not a charity between the

91
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,520
three of us, but the charity between two of you, which that I would be able

92
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,100
to watch for my amusement. You said a charity between the charity competition

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,920
between the two of you, which I could watch. So right now what I'm doing, if

94
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,880
eagle eyed fans will notice, I took out a kind of a tape measure in my little

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,800
calculator here, and I'm calculating right now the volume. Yeah, that's right.

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,400
We're doing a little mathematics today. I'm calculating the volume of the

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,880
swear jar, and we are going to find out exactly, 'cause we were gonna do this

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,120
for a year, and you guys didn't want us to. Yeah. And you stopped us.

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
I have to add it, we are gonna fill that to the brim, right? And you would

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
think you would think, oh, they got to they got to get rid of all the money

101
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
that's in the swear jar, right? They got to take all of it out. They're going to

102
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,720
take all of it out. It's going to reset. No, we had eight or nine more swear jars

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,360
over there looked exactly the same. Yeah, so we're going to right. We're

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,160
replacing them out. So imagine how much we would have accumulated into the swear

105
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,920
jar right now. Multiply that by what I'm what I've just done right now. Patrick is

106
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,840
we don't have to imagine because I've done the calculations and I know I can

107
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm going to tell you exactly how much in cubic inches the capacity of this jar is

108
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,420
six hundred and sixty one point eight seven, which we can round that to six

109
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,480
sixty two. I feel like six sixty two six sixty two cubic inches and I'm going to

110
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,560
look up and see if I can find the volume of a dollar yeah, which and I'm there's

111
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,200
fivers in there too. There's fine and by the way we were and a bunch of coins. We

112
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,360
were going to switch to hundreds only yeah this week, but you guys stopped us.

113
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,080
So there is thirty dollars in just bills here and I would estimate I'm not going

114
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,300
these coins, you know, because I'm not a homeless person, but these are probably

115
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:08,340
another $10. I'm gonna be honest with you, yeah, that is maybe around $5. That?

116
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,660
Yeah. I see a lot of quarters. You know what, you could be right. That could be $10.

117
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,780
I think that was my laundry money. I would guess that was about $7. So,

118
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,460
all in all, again, we'll round up. How about for the rest of the episode we just

119
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:26,540
count those coins? Wait, hold on. Okay. I have discovered on Google, I've looked

120
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,940
look this up here on my trusty ipad and the volume, the volume of a dollar bill

121
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:39,340
in cubic inches is point oh six eight. So how so if we if we did we do I got

122
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,820
this six guys, I've got this to okay divided by

123
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,820
point oh six eight, and this is going to this is how assuming these are one

124
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,040
dollar bills only yeah. This number is how much yeah, let's get an estimate

125
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,600
okay,

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,040
ten billion dollars. All right, let's see here with one dollar bills. The

127
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,160
swear jar at the end of the year would have contained

128
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,540
nine thousand seven hundred and thirty five dollars, but but it was going to be

129
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,000
hundred is going to be hundred. So that's times one hundred and how many

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,380
swear jars did you say we have nine or ten nine or so let's go with ten. We'll

131
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,000
go with ten times ten. So that is approximately and this is a low ball

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,840
estimate. That is nine million seven hundred and thirty five two hundred

133
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,680
ninety four dollars and ten cents. I was okay and without accounting for the

134
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,200
coins. I should yeah and we've been around. I was often billions, but I mean

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,080
I was close. You were very close. We've been rounding up in rhymes. Yes, we've

136
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,640
been we've been rounding up on everything. So we'll just round down

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,160
saying nine million dollars. Yeah, so we were going to have about nine million

138
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,520
dollars by the end of the year. Yeah, and this was going to be we hadn't

139
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,560
decided on one charity yet. We're not going to because that's the thing.

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,680
That's the thing we like them all. It's hard to decide. It's hard to decide

141
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,340
one is the best one. We had been doing some research into some charities. You

142
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,220
know what? Let's go ahead and give these people a call. This is we were going to

143
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,300
call them and we're planning it at the end of the year being able to call these

144
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,260
people and say how would nine million dollars would it make a dent? Would it

145
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,640
make a dent? So let's go ahead and call. Let's call let's call no kid hungry. How

146
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,160
about that? Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. All right, let's see. Would you say that

147
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,880
that number that you put here is an a yeah

148
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,920
for that I messed up a

149
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,840
I make a lot of typos when I write with a pencil. All right guys, I'm calling

150
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,240
no kid hungry.

151
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Hello and thank you for calling share our strength and the no kid hungry

152
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,760
campaign. Our business hours are Monday through Friday, nine AM to five thirty

153
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,000
PM. Well, that's good news.

154
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:58,240
Monday at 2. Oh it's a row, okay. It's one of the row votes. It's probably donor assistance. Yeah I think so.

155
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:06,880
We go and get up the some of the people. Yeah get this PowerPoint up.

156
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:31,480
Hi there, Stephen. I just have a question for you. For No Kid Hungry, that is your

157
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:41,440
charity, right? How would a nine million dollar donation change your charity?

158
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:56,440
That would be very, very beneficial. It would be... $1 would be 10 meals, so an equivalence of $9 million.

159
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,440
That would be an equivalence of 90 million meals.

160
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
90 million meals, that's how much that would be?

161
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Yes, sir.

162
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Well, that is great, but I have some awful news, which is that we were in the process

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:21,600
of raising $9 million to donate to No Kid Hungry, and a man named Deathroll5701 basically ended

164
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,440
it. He ended it just by complaining. So isn't that awful?

165
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,440
That is very sad news.

166
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm really, really sorry. I just wanted to personally call you and tell you I'm so, so

167
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,960
sorry that frack 7190 wanted the swear jar bit to go and we had to cut it short.

168
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,160
I'm so sorry to hear that sir.

169
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,460
Yeah it really is just awful. So I hope that you have a good rest of your day and if we

170
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,620
do end up making the money then I'll give you a call okay and hopefully I'll uh it'll

171
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,040
be under better circumstances so thank you Stephen.

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,520
Yes sir. Thank you.

173
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,080
by. That just breaks your heart to have to do that is so depressing. I don't want to

174
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,840
have to be making these phone calls. No, me neither. This I realize how uncomfortable

175
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,240
this is for me. I know to have to call these people and say your lives are almost changed,

176
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,000
but these scumbags online, these fuckers, I'll say it. I can say it now. We can say

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,160
whatever we want. Uh huh. And you know what? I really, I really can't make these calls.

178
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,580
why because it's going to make me upset.

179
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,080
It makes all

180
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,800
yeah, it's really upsetting. I don't like having a just teeth.

181
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,840
Are you kidding me? That's awful! No, it's not right. You hear him

182
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,940
ninety you know what is because of people like zero arc who say that they

183
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,220
hate charity. Yeah, my God, listen, all right, I had to hear the light leave a

184
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,260
man's voice. That is so he didn't sound like he had a whole lot of light to

185
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,140
begin with. No, definitely not. I heard him. I heard him perk up.

186
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,980
I was terrible. Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna start calling. I gotta I gotta

187
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,500
get we'll keep going, but yeah, so I mean ninety million meals that would

188
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
change so many lives.

189
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
The ASPCA!

190
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Yeah, I hope you

191
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,580
fuckers don't like animals.

192
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
This is a medical.

193
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,580
They're kind of being cruel

194
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,580
to us online.

195
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,580
I don't think they do donations.

196
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Hmm.

197
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Wait, we want a person. Or a dog.

198
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
for the ASPCA, please press seven.

199
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,660
For ASPCA premium gift requests, such as t-shirts, please press six.

200
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
Oh, that's kind of tempting.

201
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,040
That could go to this money could go to a t-shirt.

202
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,000
Please press nine.

203
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,300
I think we're out of options.

204
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Yeah. Yeah. Representative.

205
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,180
Thank you for contacting the ASPCA.

206
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,100
Is it going to repeat?

207
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,980
And for all you... Yeah, I think it's going to repeat.

208
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,940
...selected and abused animals.

209
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,140
Remember to make pet adoption your first option.

210
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,680
I mean, I'm liking listening to this.

211
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,160
It's kind of fun. All right, they hung up on me. Damn. All right, try the next one.

212
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,760
What's the next one? The next one is homes for our troops. Okay, homes for our

213
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,400
troops. Let's go ahead and give them a call and let them know the bad news.

214
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, it really is awful that we have to call every single charity our fans have

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,960
inflicted on us. Yeah, here we go. Okay.

216
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:51,200
Hi there. I'm speaking to the charity homes for our troops right now.

217
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,880
And you guys accept donations from corporations?

218
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Yes we do.

219
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Great.

220
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,080
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you, because we had a donation lined up that was, would $9

221
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,200
million be an acceptable donation for your organization?

222
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,760
Would that move the needle in any meaningful way?

223
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,560
It absolutely would.

224
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,360
Do you know exactly what this money would be going towards?

225
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,000
Like how we would be helping out these veterans with the $9 million?

226
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,120
We would be constructing a new home build.

227
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
New homes?

228
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Wow.

229
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Yes.

230
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Wow.

231
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:40,840
Well, that is unfortunate because we did have a fundraiser going to raise $9 million, but

232
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,000
unfortunately a few bad actors actually were able to get their fingers into it and interfere.

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,720
And it was people such as people like ZeroArk14 who said that they didn't like charity, they

234
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,040
didn't want the fundraiser to go through.

235
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,480
As well as Ben Beachy8962, actually quoted as saying "Swear Jar now, like four episodes

236
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,460
past being funny."

237
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,120
And these people, they actually lowered our donation amount from $9 million to much lower,

238
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,400
I believe even below $40.

239
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,280
So we're going to work on trying to get that number up and, you know, maybe get to the original

240
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,200
goal of nine million dollars but it's not looking so good due to a lot of people online.

241
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Alright, well I'm very sorry to have to tell you the bad news. I hope you have a good day.

242
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,120
I know this can be tough. It's tough for us. But I'll hopefully be talking to you again

243
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,120
soon with better news. Thank you so much.

244
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,160
it's tragic, I'm not laughing, I'm crying, it's really emotional. I'm

245
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,200
crying, it's terrible. I really think that Patrick has to do one. I really

246
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,520
think he

247
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,800
is going to take me a minute. I think would you rather do the coalition for

248
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,880
the homeless or the ocean Conservancy?

249
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
Those are your two options.

250
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,840
That's what you want to do.

251
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:25,220
come on, come on, you have to call them. You have to call the ocean. The fans

252
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,240
are making us do this. I wish I don't want to do it. I could call them, but I

253
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,880
can't read this number. I'll put it in for it says bat sink.

254
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,360
Yeah, that what is that another zero? Yeah, Sig all right, don't worry, Pat,

255
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,700
I'll do it. I'll call for what this is another A. S. P. C. A. Well, we'll

256
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,600
figure that out. Yeah, no, I mean there's millions of charities in the

257
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,360
world that were unable to donate to due to the cruelty. Yeah, so bad actors

258
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,520
there you go. You're on the phone with them.

259
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,480
Hold it up to the mic.

260
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:10,660
to

261
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,500
two

262
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,540
emailing address or web address, please press one to leave a message in the

263
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,860
general mailbox. Please

264
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,400
don't press zero

265
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,540
wait, wait. I don't know which one I pressed. Hold on. He presses your

266
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,160
readily message in the box. I'll leave a leave a message. Don't leave a mess.

267
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,360
Okay, I'll call them if you're going to leave a message. Yeah, you got you got

268
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,160
canned. I'm getting cold feet. I can't

269
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,460
All right, call the Ocean Conservancy will make you call

270
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,160
the coalition for the homeless. Have a

271
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,100
we'll find a nice AIDS charity for you to call yeah and for you to give them

272
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,880
the news. I get like a beer or something

273
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,800
could maybe do it. Then Washington D. C. Our business hours.

274
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,960
You want to press number two

275
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,520
please listen to the following menu selections. If you would like to make a

276
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,240
didn't work. Yeah, their thing is kind of weird.

277
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Of what we've learned. I don't think we should call an AIDS charity.

278
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Why? I think that that's too much. What if we give them the $30?

279
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,240
I mean... Okay, here we go.

280
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Get the PowerPoint up?

281
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,900
(phone ringing)

282
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:49,000
- Okay, but I think they don't want my call.

283
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,680
- That's why I think you should leave a message.

284
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,880
- You know what, maybe fuck these fucking hippie

285
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,840
whale fuckers over there in the ocean.

286
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,720
- Thank you for calling Ocean Conservancy's

287
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,080
National Marine Park in Washington, D.C.

288
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,480
All right, I'm going to try the four for a pressing inquiry. This is a pressing

289
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,880
they're definitely pressing inquiry.

290
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,180
Thank you for calling Ocean Conservancy's national office in

291
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,280
Washington, D. C. Oh my God, they hate us all right.

292
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,780
That's a big nothing. That's pretty disappointing. They're going to be

293
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,520
really sad when they find out and that's kind of the point of the nine million

294
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,540
dollars. We emailed them about is not coming. It's not so all also. I know

295
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,080
these these representatives wouldn't know this right off the head, but we told

296
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,320
them in advance. Yeah, we let them know. Of course we let them know. We said a

297
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,700
big donation. I don't even think we mentioned. I don't even think we went as

298
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,200
high as nine, I think, because we hadn't, but we ball part. We said five,

299
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,920
so they it was so

300
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,720
exciting for us when we realized that it could it was going to be more than

301
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,100
that, you know, and that we were going to be able to call these charities yeah

302
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,560
and say, say, hey, we have nine million dollars. We have nine million dollars,

303
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,580
which they again, ninety million meals. Do you remember that nine million for

304
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,160
children for children.

305
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,400
He did you hear the joy in his voice when I told him that he was about to be able

306
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,560
to hand hungry kids. He was about to give ninety million children, nine lives,

307
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,860
million or about thirty million children, because they want three meals a day, one

308
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,700
good one good day.

309
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:25,060
There is going to get thirty million kids of one good day of eating, so I I

310
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,660
feel sick to my stomach. Yeah, frankly, I feel fucking sick.

311
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,460
and I am ashamed of the people who listen to this podcast.

312
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,860
Yeah. You know what? Why don't we call some of them right now?

313
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,360
Okay. Let's call. Yeah, that's perfect.

314
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,960
Some of the people who text me, "Suck my balls, you dork."

315
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,260
Yeah, call him right now.

316
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,160
Yeah, I'll call this guy.

317
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,760
Yeah, call that guy.

318
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,360
He says, "Meet me in Saluda."

319
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
Call.

320
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,660
Okay.

321
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,860
Call. Go ahead. Start.

322
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,380
how carrier calling works if you're not calling over the internet.

323
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,720
Which of these phone numbers? Yeah scroll up and look which of these is the best

324
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:16,180
bet. Hmm for I would say probably legacy gifts or the adoption hotline. Alright

325
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,540
I'm gonna call the adoption hotline right now really quick while Pat looks

326
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:26,540
at this. I mean look at this poultry offering. This is disgusting. Is there a punch in that

327
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:36,340
we have of this poultry offering? This was every... Yeah, it says everyone is dying to

328
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:46,100
POV. These are the children who don't have any meals. Hello? Thank you for calling. Welcome

329
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Thank you for calling Wildlife Fund. My name is Rose. How can I help you?

330
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,100
Hi there. I'm on the phone with the World Wildlife Fund right now, correct?

331
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Yes.

332
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Great. Well, I'm actually with a corporation that we were looking to make a large donation in the future to the tune of about $9 million.

333
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,100
And I was wondering if that money would be useful to you guys, if that would make a dent, and what exactly that would go to.

334
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,700
to, you know, if that could maybe help the wildlife of the world and maybe make a dent

335
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,580
in some of the horrible atrocities being inflicted against nature by a lot of these big corporations

336
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,580
nowadays.

337
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
I understand.

338
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Why can't someone just send me a copy of your first donation and then connect you with a

339
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,580
member of the NIH to give you the information?

340
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Okay, well, unfortunately, you know, I didn't want to have to do this immediately, but I

341
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,460
don't think it's going to be much use to transfer me over because the donation that we were

342
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,980
looking to make $9 million that fell through. And we have, you know, about maybe $30-ish.

343
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:53,420
And it's people on the internet, like this user Blort, who have decided that $9 million

344
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,700
is not a good amount to donate to charity. And they'd rather it be not even in the triple

345
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,920
or quadruple digits, but rather in the double digits and actually include a large pile of

346
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,980
coins as well. And it's people like Blort and like Hunter Mellow Potvin who don't like

347
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,660
fundraising. Yeah, it's disgusting. They hate charity. Well, I really appreciate that you

348
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,180
would like to transfer me and get this nine million dollars through. You're not going

349
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,420
to get nine million dollars from it because there is no nine million dollars and it's

350
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:26,100
all because of, you know, people online. So I just wanted to convey the bad news. Giorgio.

351
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:33,260
Okay, well thank you for calling. All right, well thank you. You have a good day as good

352
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,300
as you can have under the circumstances. Bye.

353
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,800
but

354
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,700
Georgio

355
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:49,280
so

356
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:56,760
anyway, I mean we can move on. Yeah, that was you know I we just had to get

357
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,120
that out of the way. You know we just had to

358
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,760
win.

359
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,600
Okay, so the point is the swear jar is gone. It's gone. It'll never come.

360
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,080
It's never coming back except maybe maybe next week, maybe

361
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,960
maybe it's coming back. No, it's not coming back. It's over. It's done.

362
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,440
All right, we can you know why why I thought about this. Okay, I've thought

363
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,660
about what I was going to say when eventually we got bullied into taking

364
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,740
away the swear jar. Yeah,

365
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,580
we are not

366
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,600
despots. We are not we're not we're not we listen. We

367
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,440
We have an ear for democracy, okay?

368
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,280
We listen to what you say.

369
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,200
And when the people whisper into it,

370
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
we have no choice but to listen.

371
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,120
So we are not communist China, communist Russia.

372
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,960
No, no.

373
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,200
I am no dictator.

374
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,840
I don't have the, I may have the stature for it,

375
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,640
and the general kind of alpha dog.

376
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,480
Commanding speaking voice.

377
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
Commanding deep speaking voice.

378
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,280
Some of us have anxiety.

379
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,120
Yeah, but I--

380
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,360
And when you have to make a phone call.

381
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,200
Yeah, exactly.

382
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,560
He makes you really scared.

383
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah. That's true, yeah.

384
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,140
He gets some some people are too scared to answer the phone call from just yeah,

385
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,140
even anyone from pretty much anybody. Yeah. So what I'm saying is we listened

386
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,240
and we are we we did it what you wanted. This is what you want to because this

387
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,040
in the end, it's a democracy. Yep. It really is. So if you ever want us to do

388
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,940
anything, you just tell us and yeah, stop.

389
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,240
Listen,

390
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,440
we'll we'll call this person right now. Who'd says

391
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,880

392
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,760
- Doesn't know what he said.

393
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,240

394
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Okay, who's this?

395
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,040
- I don't know.

396
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,320
- Okay.

397
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,440
- Is this a charity?

398
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,000
- No, it's just a layman.

399
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,720
- A what?

400
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,540
- Just a layman.

401
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,380
- A layman.

402
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,140
- Just one of these nothings that interacts with us?

403
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,840
All right, well, we'll at least leave him a message.

404
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
- Yeah.

405
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,040

406
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,920
- No.

407
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,760
- No?

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,600
- I don't know who this is.

409
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Okay

410
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:15,760
That's true all right

411
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,440
Wait, he's got to leave. Yeah, we gotta talk really loud and

412
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,000
fucking bastard

413
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Fuck this guy all right

414
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,640
Go ahead leave a message, but hi. This is Patrick Doran from podcast about list

415
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I'm sure that you're aware that there was a,

416
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,780
on the most recent string of episodes,

417
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,360
there was a swear jar.

418
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,300
- Yep.

419
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,140
- And I just wanted to-- - This person's

420
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,260
getting a preview.

421
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,320
- I just wanted to let you know that the swear jar is gone

422
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,160
and it's your fault.

423
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,000
It's your fault.

424
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,240
You and all of the listeners have all democratically

425
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,240
or elected to get rid of the swear jar through--

426
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,160
- Tell them what we were gonna do with the money.

427
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:12,080
Oh, we were going to deck tuple it, which is times it by 10, and donate it to the ASPCA,

428
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:21,520
the Homeless Veterans Charity, the Ocean Conservatory. Yeah, we're going to donate it to all of these

429
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
people.

430
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
And tell them what we just had to do.

431
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,680
We just had to make a bunch of cold calls and tell all of these charities that we can't

432
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
donate to them.

433
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,680
So basically go fucking kill yourself.

434
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Don't say kill yourself.

435
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Okay.

436
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
I mean not.

437
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
That's too hard now.

438
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Why did you say kill themselves?

439
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
They said I love podcasts about...

440
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Wait, wait, wait.

441
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Why did you call that person?

442
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I don't know.

443
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Because I...

444
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,200
Now you showed me all these people who were like, oh yeah, they're texting me saying fuck

445
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,600
you, fuck this person.

446
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,000
And I told this person to kill themselves and they're the one who said...

447
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's on you.

448
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That's on you.

449
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's on you.

450
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You're the one...

451
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Why would you call this person?

452
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,240
we're done with call. We're done with call. We're done. We're done. You lost

453
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,200
your chance on calling. I'm sure that now people are sick of all the calls.

454
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,320
It's done. Yeah, I can't just start the normal podcast. I have the craziest

455
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,000
story to tell.

456
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,960
What is this?

457
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,880
This is nothing all sucker. It's gonna be another message.

458
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,040
They don't people don't answer the phone call. People who text you are even

459
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,960
more scared of phone calls than you are. It's true. Hang up on this fool. Yeah,

460
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,960
All right, what's your crazy story? So do you guys remember? I think it was maybe a

461
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,420
week or two ago. We came up with the idea of a

462
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,100
sent the opposite of a sensory deprivation tank. I forget what we called

463
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,660
it, but it's like it stimulates all your senses at once. Yeah, like it's every

464
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,240
it goes. It's like like

465
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,640
sweet and then salty and sweet and salt and like just and everything alternates

466
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,080
and is crazy. And I was in the real life version of that on the other day and it

467
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,120
shook me to my core. I've I have decided that this is that this idea we cannot

468
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,220
allow this to come to fruition. Why is that and because I had I was mentally

469
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,560
stimulated to my breaking point on the subway and here's what happened okay. I

470
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,760
was on the subway

471
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:22,120
with my fiance and we were riding the subway and I and there was a guy who was

472
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,220
watching videos on his phone, okay, with the sound on and he was acting kind of

473
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,480
crazy. He was doing crazy guy stuff. He was, you know, rubbing his face and

474
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,080
sniffling and doing crazy. Do you know that you know the type of crazy thing

475
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,480
I'm talking about like that? I do act in thirsty. He's like he's acting like a

476
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,020
third, he's doing like

477
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,480
like the tweaking then right a thought and he's on his phone watching videos. I

478
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,880
look at his phone is like I what is this guy watching and he's freaking out

479
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,920
about he was watching on his phone. He was watching gore compilations. Oh my

480
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,120
people being killed. He was watching like children's heads being smashed in

481
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,100
and like soldiers being shot. Holy okay, I started having like full. I was like

482
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,000
having a full panic attack of like oh my God, this guy's going to kill everyone

483
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,360
on this train. I have to be ready to get up and tackle this guy sitting right

484
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,120
next to him. Yeah,

485
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,320
he reaches into his pocket over on the bridge. I was like fuck fuck fuck. He

486
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,820
takes out not a gun. I was like thank God it's not a gun, but what it was was a

487
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,300
thing of fireball. He starts chugging the fireball still watching these videos

488
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,920
like like scrolling through them, choosing them, watching them scrolling

489
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,000
through and then right then the train like stops and we're stuck between

490
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,080
stations for like ten minutes and I leaned over and so my friends. I said I

491
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,340
said I was completely freaking out. She did not notice this was going on at all,

492
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,800
and I just said to her like listen. We have to get off this train at the next

493
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,440
up. I'll tell you why in a minute we just have to get on yeah, so I'm like

494
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,040
fully like complete. I am going to die mode and we the train starts moving

495
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,360
again. We get to the next stop this guy. He gets up. He leaves the train okay,

496
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,460
and I was like and I was like okay. We don't have to leave anymore. That guy

497
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,940
was going to kill us, but he's not going to kill us anymore. Literally the

498
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,700
second he leaves the train. I'm not sure to you twenty to thirty Amish people

499
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:10,240
and they're all smiling and dancing and the kids are going. Wow, it's going so

500
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,380
fast. Oh, my God,

501
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,700
I can't believe it and they're all laughing and smiling and they fill the

502
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,380
entire

503
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,660
and they're all in their outfits. So when they're not Amish, they're yeah,

504
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,200
the other one, the

505
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,200
ones who the other guys, I don't know, you know, I'm oh yeah,

506
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,600
Quaker, no, not Quakers, not Gideon's. No, I don't know what they were

507
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,560
basically on the nights, men and nights. Okay,

508
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,140
the men and nights are the ones that have flip phones, right? Yeah,

509
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,540
they have phones and shit and they can and they can go into cities

510
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,280
and they can make a car, but they look Amish. Yeah, they look they

511
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,200
and they were acting out. They were they were they were

512
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,900
they were incredulous of the train. That's what all the all the pictures

513
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,780
where you'll see where it's like look at these Amish people who are like

514
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,580
protesting for gay marriage or so yeah and it's always like yeah, it's always

515
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,980
men and I amish people don't speak English. Yeah, they have like well, they

516
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,420
did there. Have you seen those like shows of like the the Amish referred to

517
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:11,820
like people outside of their community, English as the English yeah wow that is

518
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,620
so fucked up. I could not believe that that was the craziest train right of my

519
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,420
life. I was fully a hundred percent convinced I was about to either die or

520
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,860
save the lives of everybody on the train. Yeah, and then imagine instantly were

521
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,460
the guy that had to you imagine you were the guy that

522
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,020
yeah, of course, I mean that's all that's all any man that sits around imagining

523
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,260
is either I should have tackled him anyway. Yeah, just a fucking show.

524
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:41,100
Yeah, you're the guy that stops grind face. Who's that? The owner of grind

525
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,700
ways dot TV. What's that? I don't know what you're talking about. Is the gore

526
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,820
website? You're that kind of guy. Yeah, you are that kind of guy. I don't like

527
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,700
that kind of shit. That's not right. No, Rex showed me it. He's watching. You

528
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,780
watched it. Yeah, 'cause he was showing me. But I would-, he would never show me

529
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,140
that. He shows me that. 'Cause I'm not-, 'cause he knows you're that type of guy.

530
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,100
I-, people know I do not like gore, gore stuff. I do not like pornography. I don't

531
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,700
either, but Rex showed me it. I don't like the kind of pornography where, where

532
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,500
women spread open their stuff. No. Oh! Yeah. I don't need to see the inside of

533
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,860
I barely like the outside. What do you mean when they spread open? You know

534
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,580
when I in a photo when a girl does this what I don't want to see that yeah, I

535
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,600
don't know what's don't touch your hand on it. Yeah, don't muddy it up with all

536
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,380
this stuff. I don't know what kind of door knobs you've been touching all day

537
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,220
to get to this studio oil on your in that's disgusting and I just don't like

538
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,780
that kind of thing and I don't like this bend over pull your asshole. Put a

539
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,540
peanut butter jar in there. Yeah,

540
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,000
nasty. You should have a sex with your eyes closed. That's what a perfect porn

541
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,280
movie to me is just a black screen and just sounds of like I'm making love. No,

542
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,140
not that is that's a lot of no, no, here's here's what it is. I love you. I

543
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,900
love you. I love you. I love you. I love you and then a higher pitch voice. I

544
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,020
love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. That's that's what it was. I

545
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,500
don't I would that to kissing no no no kissing, no, no kissing. You can get

546
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,660
sick. Oh yeah, no, no, no, no, no, you can kiss if you fast for three days

547
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,140
beforehand. Yeah, yes, that's fine. There could be food particles exactly. It

548
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,580
should be the same rules. You could have a turd yeah, you should have to act up

549
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,200
in your mouth.

550
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,660
I don't think that happens that much, but we can say that kind of thing now

551
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,280
yeah yeah, I guess that was a disgusting and it does where I kind of like having

552
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,760
no swear, because I would not be able to tell that pornography. Yeah,

553
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,620
opinion, the

554
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,220
the guy that you saw on the train who started watching yeah, best or he was

555
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,980
watching it the whole time. Well, the guy who took out started drinking the

556
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,360
fireball. I feel like he is a victim of that of the different, the reverse

557
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,640
sensory deprivation tank. He pro that's exactly that. He probably saw a bunch of

558
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,220
men and nights and then maybe saw someone cutting someone else's face off

559
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,160
with a machete. He was from the man. He was from the future coming back to the

560
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,760
past to kill you, but didn't recognize you with your haircut.

561
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,220
What?

562
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,220
Because of that when we thought about that,

563
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,220
when we thought about that you had longer hair, right?

564
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,020
I don't think so.

565
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,220
I think that was like a week ago.

566
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,720
It wasn't that long ago.

567
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,220
Shit.

568
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
I had shorter hair actually.

569
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,720
Swear.

570
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,620
See, you're still doing it.

571
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,120
You're doing the one, you're doing the thing.

572
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,220
So this is, yeah, this is the worst of both worlds.

573
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,820
Yeah, you're doing the thing that everybody hated about the swear jar.

574
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,420
I was just pointing out that I can swear again.

575
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,720
Yeah, we know you can swear again.

576
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,420
Fucker.

577
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,220
We already talked about that.

578
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,620
There we go.

579
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,120
That's good.

580
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,620
Yeah.

581
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
But,

582
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,420
Asshole.

583
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,920
Yeah, I mean, I guess there's no way to,

584
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,280
but I do truly think that that if that had if that had been and like if

585
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,680
somebody set that up and that happened to me for an hour, yeah, I would be

586
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,840
permanently insane because you I could not believe how I felt after that. I

587
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,520
only had three in brain were completely. So you there was no smell exactly

588
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,840
that's what I'm saying. If you have been tasting, I had the I had I had

589
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,500
smelling Yankee candles like ten to fifteen minutes of one like a cough

590
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,480
cough drop in his mouth. Well, that's a no. If you had a menthol cough drop in

591
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,680
your mouth, well, that was going on, you would have died. You would have

592
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,940
your really I would have

593
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,880
that's why I think we cannot move forward with this invention. It is too

594
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,080
dangerous. We need to pare down. Anyway, we need to get away from all of the we

595
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,520
need to I have been feeling recently like we need to shut off every light in

596
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,480
New York City for one day a week. Yeah, because it's too much and that used to

597
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,900
happen.

598
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,940
I don't know in the s. Why is it rolling blackouts? Oh well, I'm saying that for

599
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,460
everybody's health because lights are bad for you. They do that in Texas. I turn off all

600
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,500
the ACs for everyone. Speaking of a smart sensory overload, haven't been to Times

601
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,300
Square in like a year maybe. Nah, I think that's not close. I go every week. Maybe like

602
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,160
six months. Wait, you don't go every day. What do you do with your free time? I

603
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,100
mostly go around to abandoned warehouses and

604
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:51,160
graveyards and I take black and white photos. Oh, yeah. That's actually what I

605
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,300
you find like a broken mirror yeah. Damn, oh shit, a selfie with the photo

606
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,060
where you turn you're holding the camera like this. Yeah, I think I holding the

607
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,400
DS.

608
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,460
My Facebook profile picture is it's black and white and it's me in an

609
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,160
abandoned warehouse and there's a mirror like leaning up against the wall and

610
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,120
you see I'm taking a selfie, but it's one of the that's like a daguerreo type

611
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,660
where it's like I have the curtain over my

612
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,740
a giant another guy with a flash.

613
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,540
yeah, that is a building. So there's like two homeless people having sex. Hey

614
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,820
photographers, we know why you hide your face with the DSLR because you have a

615
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:33,620
weak chin. You are wanted for sexual assault. Yes, yes, yes, you are because

616
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:38,500
you took the photo of a warrant. Yes, so get the fuck out of my facebook account.

617
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:38,960
Yeah,

618
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,160
changing my profile picture

619
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,840
of me where I look really cute. Stop hacking my facebook and making my

620
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,400
2015 profile pictures look really artsy. They do look cool. Stop using filters on

621
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,820
them. Bokeh. Yeah, true. Also, bokeh, what the fuck is bokeh? I don't like bokeh.

622
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,220
That's not bokeh. No, no, no, that's not okay. That is not bokeh with me.

623
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:06,920
Bokeh with me. I do not like bokeh. Make that photo flat. Yeah. No dynamic range.

624
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,760
No, and I don't need to... You know what a light should look like? A bulb. A

625
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,040
light, you should be able to see the perfect outline of the bulb. I don't need

626
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,460
to see a flare and for a hey all you all you instagram photographers you yeah

627
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,820
messing with the tilt shift. I'm going to take a still shit on you. Yeah,

628
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,620
stand up on some stilts and poop on you from twenty feet above. I'm going to

629
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,720
tilt you over a building and shift you into the next world. That's what's

630
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,280
going to happen. You're going to be come. You're going to be come. You're

631
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,580

635
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,000

636
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,360
have that sand that's kind of wet and kind of dry and you dribble it to make a

637
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,580
castle. Yeah, that will be that type of calm. It's going to be chunky. It's

638
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:05,040
going to be chunky and bits of green like Siddiqui. Yes, yeah, there's going

639
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,620
to be a lot of chunks in that come and it's going to come in a little plastic

640
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,700
Ramekin and that's all you'll be to me. Yeah, and then I will eat you. Oh, I

641
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,580
forget where I was going with the Times Square thing,

642
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,420
but I was in Times Square.

643
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,980
Congratulations. We were talking about cum and stuff and my brain shut off.

644
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,180
You got so nervous from the phone calls that now you can't even breathe. I

645
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,460
don't know why we didn't do the phone calls after, 'cause now we have to fill

646
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,060
up another 20 minutes. What do you mean fill up? Fill it up. We should have.

647
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,140
You're just having a freak out attack. Lifted it up, lifted the time up. Yeah,

648
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,480
I don't know why I get up. I don't know why I get so tired of praying. I don't

649
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,000
know what lifted the I don't know why I get scared of prank calls.

650
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,460
You think someone's going to say I know who you are yeah, you're Patrick

651
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,420
Torin and yeah, I mean I mean you

652
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,760
I think I got in trouble really young for prank calls me too. I don't want to

653
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,380
didn't get in trouble for prank. We've talked about this. My first prank call I

654
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,900
ever did I my brother was like call this lady call this phone number Texas tell

655
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,520
other, that your house is on fire and your parents are dead and you're stuck

656
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,740
in the house and then hang up. I was like, oh, that's hilarious, and then I

657
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,940
just did that like four or five times. Yeah, I just think the idea of just

658
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,260
like

659
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,100
making somebody have to answer the phone to say I can't give you

660
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,080
a million dollars.

661
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,300
Do you do way more evil stuff? I know you're a skateboarder. I thought you

662
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,880
stole my go and you it's not a joke. You go and you ruin public parks. You do

663
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,760
You ruin public parks. I do kinetic art. No, you do not.

664
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
(laughter)

665
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
No, you do not.

666
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
You're not a dancer. I'm adding to the ecosystem.

667
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I'm doing kinetic art.

668
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
I wish you would add to the ecosystem by being fucking manure in the ground.

669
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
(laughter)

670
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
That's what I wish you would do.

671
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
After today, I think I will be. Yeah, I really hope so.

672
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
I think we should call this Suicidal.

673
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
(laughter)

674
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
I'm going to kill myself if I don't give you $9 million.

675
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Oh wait, I only have $30.

676
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
I was going to give you $9 million

677
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,020
million dollars and the truth is the truth is I would do a hundred more calls

678
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,060
to charities and tell them I can't give them any more. That was that's the

679
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,500
funniest

680
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:18,460
that's like that's a that's a fucking that's a chuck palinuck protagonist.

681
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:18,780
Yeah,

682
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:26,640
a guy who jacks off and calls charities. I was jacking off under the table by

683
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,160
speaking in check, pallin, rewatch fight club this past. We yeah yeah, it was

684
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,120
just okay really. I see I honestly haven't watched it since I watched it

685
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,800
ten thousand times when I watch it as a kid. I had the same feeling that I get

686
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,680
watch it. If I actually see a gore movie or so or video or something where I got

687
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,140
a pit at a pit in my stomach because of that shit was so real yeah, but then I

688
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,920
watch it this time and I was like improvement is masturbation. I watch it

689
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,180
this time and I was speaking of masturbation. I was like Brad Pitt. You

690
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,600
are looking well actually you know what I thought when I was a kid. I saw Brad

691
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,180
Pitt in that movie and I was like Brad Pitt is jacked. He's like really skinny

692
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,120
in that. Yeah, he weighs like a hundred and twenty pounds. Yeah, he's cool and he

693
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,100
looks cool, but he doesn't when I was a kid. I thought he was like buff. Yeah,

694
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,100
yeah, but he's a guy. You know what it is? It's he's it's because he's next to

695
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,240
Edward Norton and not because of Edward Norton's body, but because of his voice.

696
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,180
Yeah, true nerd voice, nerd voice. I found out the other day that Brad Pitt

697
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:25,360
fucked Mike Tyson's wife. Why? And he walked in on them fucking wow. Why did

698
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:33,340
do that just to jizz oh yeah all right that makes sense to fall in love yeah

699
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:38,220
hopefully yeah hopefully they found hopefully they were wed after that she

700
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,260
was wed in the middle of it oh my god she's wed between the lids yeah yeah

701
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,860
that's pretty sexy Brad Pitt had sex with Mike Tyson's wife

702
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:51,780
apparently the story was they were getting oh yeah that's good they were

703
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:58,520
getting a divorce. They were getting a divorce, Mike Tyson and his wife, but he would still

704
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,020
go over to her house and fuck her sometimes or get fucked by her because he was like...

705
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,020
they would go...

706
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,020
Mike Tyson would?

707
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,660
Yeah, he said that they would do quickies, but they were getting divorced, but he went

708
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,340
over one day and he opened the door and who was fucking his wife?

709
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Well, why'd he go over?

710
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,900
Brad Pitt. I just told you to have sex with her.

711
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,900
Yeah, but he didn't call?

712
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,180
He didn't do that back then. He just showed up and fucked girls.

713
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,820
that's no calls yeah, you surprise them at the house showed up and your shoulder

714
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,660
check the door down. Yep, you ran in. I honest I feel like Mike Tyson probably

715
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,020
to do that. Mike Tyson did go to jail for rape one time and yeah, now I think

716
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,980
about it's probably not that good to joke about that one with him, but he

717
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,060
walked in and Brad Pitt was fucking his wife and he said Brad Pitt was like

718
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:49,700
don't punch me man bro. Don't punch me bro man. Please don't hit me and Mike

719
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,380
Mike Tyson just laughed and left.

720
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,380
That's funny.

721
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,580
But I think that he didn't finish the story, because here's what I think happened.

722
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,620
He walked in and he saw Brad Pitt, who hadn't done any movies yet really.

723
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,220
It was like 1989 or 1990.

724
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,780
But he saw that he was cute and that one day he would be really successful.

725
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,820
He'd be really funny and burn after reading.

726
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,020
So my guess is that Mike Tyson made him have sex with him.

727
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,460
You know what I think happened is that Mike Tyson walks in-

728
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,560
he would have blackmail because now if Brad Pitt ever wanted to do something

729
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,200
that Mike Tyson didn't like exactly, he probably has a

730
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,060
photo. Brad Pitt probably has like a

731
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,740
documentary he's been trying to get made. It's about kind of the evilness of

732
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,860
Mike Tyson, the evenness of getting interrupted while you have sex. He's

733
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,680
interviewing like interviewing Vander Holyfield. He's like yeah and isn't the

734
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,340
worst part about Mike Tyson when he walks in on you.

735
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,260
You don't think Mike Tyson walked in, saw Brad Pitt fucking his wife and

736
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:53,640
thought damn I'm fucking her real good. That's what fight club style. Oh, well,

737
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,900
fight club hat was far from coming out. Well,

738
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:02,160
that doesn't make the joke good, does it? I think if you try to well, I mean,

739
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,500
try to put history into it. I don't think the joke made any sense to me

740
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,060
anyway. No, it took me a minute. Yeah, yeah, yeah, took you a minute, but once

741
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,540
you got it, it was good, right? Just the idea that that's his alternate

742
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,540
personalities. We're saying yeah, okay, I think that maybe if I told it better, if

743
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,700
I had if I had made the fight club movie and I was adapting the book okay in this

744
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,620
day and age when everything needs a tag, everything needs a universe in it,

745
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,640
though I'd ignore the phone. I'd say I would say in this the world there's no

746
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,000
phones, whatever, but I would at the end. So you know Brad,

747
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Edward Norton, Brad Pitt is his secret identity. We're sorry for the spoilers.

748
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,520
if you haven't seen it, but at the end at the very end spoilers to at the very

749
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:50,280
end, I would have a third guy show up and he says and I'm your third identity

750
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,120
and I have lightning powers

751
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,660
that'd be good and they're like all along. We're focused on these two guys.

752
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,140
We even consider there's a hundred thousand identities and they're and

753
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,700
they're part of the fight of verse. I was telling you about each identity,

754
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,020
each person, telling you about that movie of the day. No wait before split.

755
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,680
There was a movie off unbreakable, no one the one it's about a

756
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,080
serial killer at a motel. Oh yeah, you were telling me about this. Motel, multiple...

757
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,440
Is there a thing with his mom? Identity. Identity. Identity 2003. I watched Identity

758
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,640
and Secret Window in the same day and it really tortured me

759
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,200
psychologically. Which one is Secret Window? That's the Johnny Depp one where he puts

760
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,000
the... Oh yeah. It's the same thing I think where he has a bad alter

761
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,560
ego. But Identity was... I'm realizing right now that the reason why my mom bought

762
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,360
bought all these movies was because she started going to school to be a

763
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,600
psychologist, and so she got

764
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,080
she bought all these movies

765
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,280
that were about your mom just started watching the butterfly effect yeah

766
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,320
literally single day and was like oh my God, I need to write a paper on this.

767
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,720
That's probably what I would do too, but anyway, the movie is it's the worst

768
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,040
movie ever. It's a serial killers at a motel and then at the end, all of the

769
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:07,280
people are dead except for the little kid and then it's like zooms out and the

770
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,700
entire movie was just taking place with a straight jacket guy in the back of a

771
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,860
car. He's like on his way to a mental hospital and he's so crazy. That he

772
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,360
thought all of that in his mind? That he just had a... He just dreamt a movie

773
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,420
in his head. He just dreamt a movie? Yeah. Isn't that... That's so bad. Yeah,

774
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,700
it's really, really bad. It's not even implied that that's... That he's the

775
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,720
little kid and he's in the straight jacket? No, I don't remember what the

776
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,820
implication was really. I think it maybe opens up with him at the mental

777
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,740
hospital and it's like and I think the whole movie is kind of like oh he's

778
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,340
escaped and he's like he's probably the one killing all these people, but then

779
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,640
at the end it was actually just him having some thoughts. Yeah, you know

780
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,540
which is like the lowest stake you can have for a movie. It's like a guy's

781
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,240
thinking something. Yeah, well after like six cents and stuff everybody wanted

782
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,640
like a

783
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,440
sense in a long time. Is it six cents is fire. Hold on. It's really good.

784
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,940
That's good. It's crazy that that yeah Donnie Wahlberg. He's good that all

785
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,540
that stuff was happening in the early 2000s, all those that type of movie they

786
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,860
were doing all that and then it wasn't I had shutter Island wasn't till like 2010

787
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,580
or something. I didn't see shut around. I was like pretty good, but isn't that

788
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,540
crazy that it's that they're pretty late of all. Yeah, yeah, that that one seems

789
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:27,820
like a movie that just may took too long to make. Yeah, I see that. I could see

790
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,580
that. Yeah, like they started it in the yeah, and then that like, you know, they

791
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,980
they're a film that a film that a mass yeah really been to that. That film

792
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,320
didn't shut her out. They filmed it no in a fucking

793
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:43,060
long field or something. Oh long island isn't there the long island was where

794
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:47,600
all the house people lived no the off of Boston. There's the island where all

795
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,500
the homeless people lived. It was no it wasn't actually didn't actually the

796
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,220
island itself. I don't know about the island, but the mental hospital yeah is

797
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,540
not actually on an island yeah and I've been there and I went there

798
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,600
and it's and when I was there, there was flying machines in the air. Oh, you

799
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,000
told what about that? Yeah, what do you mean flying miss drones? I don't know

800
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,800
people were flying around in little machines. You are just a liar, not I

801
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,420
don't know what they're called, but they're there was like a parachute and a

802
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,880
little chair and wheels and they're flying around. I have known you for so

803
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,320
many years and you have gotten so much worse at describing things yeah. I don't

804
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,200
know what this thing is called. You never make any sense when you describe

805
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:33,120
something okay picture the car from Gary's mod yeah smaller yeah. I think

806
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:39,000
you know what it is is he's trying to make his descriptions of things shorter

807
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,080
and more broad so that I can understand them. It's like you over shot it,

808
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,480
though, yeah, now you're skipping. I don't I don't know what to call these

809
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,680
things other than flying machines that yeah, you know that's what they were as

810
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,440
soon as he said Gary's mod. I was like okay, he wants me. Well, I'm trying to

811
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,020
visualize it in my head of what this thing looks like it's like you sit on

812
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,940
with your finger. I have a pencil no no no no no finger,

813
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,960
and I think there's a parachute attached to it too, but the thing is also this

814
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,600
was long enough ago that I can't really remember exactly what it looked like.

815
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,440
This was a kite no because you sit it well. I guess I wouldn't call it a

816
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,280
cut in it yeah it's people were paragliding no no no no no no it was

817
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,200
like a machine. It's like a plane. It has a motor and they like fly it up and

818
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,600
I fly around playing. Well, yeah, there's a guy who has Google here is not helping me.

819
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,080
It's not a plan. I'm finding a single person plane. I've seen these. You know

820
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,240
what it is? Jubio right now is calling. I don't think it had wings though. Jubio

821
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,480
is playing league. It doesn't need wings. I swear to God. Jubio is playing league.

822
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,920
It doesn't need wings. Jubio. That is a plane screen share. What are you talking

823
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,640
about? Screen share right now? You sure what your other computer that doesn't

824
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,940
make any sense. You have one computer that you're using right now. I thought

825
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,920
you were going insane because you didn't want to call the charity. Oh, I am

826
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,120
going. It's literally called a parachute flying machine. Let me see no way. Let

827
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,040
me see I googled flying machine parachute. Is that

828
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,320
this is called infinity power parachutes? No, what are you

829
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,400
it's called a powered parachute? Let me see it. It says parachute. I clicked on

830
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,880
something by accident. Go back Wikipedia, a powered parachute, but go

831
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,120
back to the Google search. I don't I don't know how to go back to parachute.

832
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,660
Fuck you. It literally is a flying machine, our parachute there. Yeah. If I

833
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,260
saw that, I would call that a playing machine shut up. Fuck you yeah, that's a

834
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,700
flying machine. That's a power parachute. I knew that for the instant save. You

835
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,500
just said power parachute. It would have come to mind instantly. I said it's a

836
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,220
parachute with a motor and that doesn't say you knew about a powered parachute

837
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,160
and you can think of it from yeah. I did I just was having an off day. You have a

838
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,060
learning disability. No, I did not do no. I do not you have a right. You don't

839
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,720
so you have a normal disability yeah everything, not just my legs. I don't

840
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,240
work isn't it cool, but you're a bunch of people flying around up there in

841
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,260
those things. So did you think because you were at shutter island, did you

842
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,480
think

843
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,420
maybe I'm a crazy?

844
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,300
Maybe you know it was you know it was crazy. You were there because they were

845
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,180
doing a pop up

846
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,760
screening a drive in movie screening of the

847
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,680
shining there, which is yeah. I know what a lay up that I know right pretty

848
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,540
weird. Well, they probably already did screenings. There is the problem and

849
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,260
they're like all right. Yeah, I think it was they were trying to milk everything

850
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,140
they could get out of it, but near the at the end of the movie, like right near

851
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,860
the end, this like super thick fog came in and like covered up everything. We

852
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,420
couldn't see the screen. We were driving home. We couldn't see the road. That's

853
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,860
isn't that scary, just like the shine die. No, it is not just like that scene

854
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,060
in the shine. Yeah, when the car gets fogged up, that's so scary. Yeah,

855
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,340
doesn't that seem haunted to happen at a mental? I really a mental, but you guys

856
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,140
ever get scared that maybe you have a multiple personality that doesn't live

857
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,340
anywhere near you and lives like on the other side of the world

858
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,840
and it's just like doing random shit

859
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,380
scares me. I know I have I have like millions of them yeah. I'm an entire

860
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,260
where you

861
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,180
personality is China yeah. I'm the one who's been doing all this stuff I've

862
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,580
and you just you're only here for like one percent of your life. The rest of

863
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,060
the time you're just running around, trying to be a billion people.

864
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:19,900
Yeah, scary that is the idea that you can have multiple personalities is

865
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,140
really scary. It's super rare, though. No, no, I just looked at it happens to

866
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,020
everybody. It happens to everybody. Cancer eventually everybody has multiple

867
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,860
personalities. Yeah, what

868
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,560
what

869
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,740
that was going to be I was going to do another part and then I was like

870
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:43,420
I don't want to do that voice anymore. I think it was

871
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:50,460
family.

872
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,460
That's just like a terrible fucking sketch

873
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,580
Oh my God yeah, but that does I have been afraid of that since I was a child.

874
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,160
You know,

875
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,700
did you ever why you ever watch very good English that movie split? No, the

876
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,740
funny part about that like that actor is it it's framed like like it's like

877
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,300
a boy. It's I get it yeah for me. It's framed like it's

878
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,620
like it's a way mental health awareness, like it where it's like there seems

879
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,680
where he's he has multiple personality story is like twenty seven personalities

880
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,460
the movie or something a lot and and he's like and his therapist and he's like

881
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,760
and they're talking. They're like we need to show the world that this is like

882
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,460
a real thing that people suffer from and we exist and we we're not like monsters

883
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,080
and we need it and then the whole like plot just to the movie is that his last

884
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,380
personality is a cannibal monster that can crawl on one

885
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,860
he like bends open jail bars. He was like

886
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,800
isn't that they're like it's like a double twist to

887
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,260
there's another twist in that movie where it's like yeah. This all takes

888
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,640
place in the same universe is unbreakable yeah. Do you know what

889
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,720
there's a plot twist in between those two and you know what it is? It's that

890
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,120
the whole movie took place in a zoo

891
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:15,720
really yeah, that's the in a zoo he's underground in a zoo. See, I think

892
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,320
honestly is Christ. Why is it a good movie? If somebody has that shouldn't we

893
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,080
just kill them?

894
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,060
yeah, but you might have a hard time because their personality is true.

895
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:31,380
This will bullet dodger. Why did you give him five dollars? I was just

896
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,960
holding five dollars. He took it. Oh, this was my five dollars yeah. That was

897
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,020
his five dollars. I put this. It was the first thing that went in the jar. It

898
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,460
was almost a s b s. Yeah, look at all. I just will rip this in half. I remember

899
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,280
every single one of the

900
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,420
for a fuck yeah shit. Yeah, let's tear up a turd. Yeah, this one. I think was

901
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,600
can't tear up this one. This was probably come related, but I oh is my dollar

902
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,040
still on the floor. I don't think we ever picked it up. I picked it up. I

903
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,300
brought it home. I think that you said that we were not going to bring it home.

904
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:06,080
You hold on. Well, you miss the sword. You miss the job. You took swear jar

905
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,540
money. No, it wasn't. Well, did it ever go in the jar? He does that. No, it was

906
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,120
intended to go to the swear jar. Well, don't worry at home. I actually didn't

907
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,800
take home. I just pocketed it because I needed a dollar for the swear jar and

908
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,620
and I used it, so it's in here somewhere. All right.

909
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:25,220
Yeah, but people who have really bad mental disorders, why do we not just kill

910
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,380
them? Why do we have to put them in jail? I truly think it's because some of them

911
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,380
are so unhinged and unleashed that they will stop at nothing to prevent from

912
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,260
being killed, and a person who has- How unhinged do you have to be to be

913
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,900
employed? A person who has strong enough BPD, borderline personality disorder,

914
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,780
should be killed. Whoa. Will be able to manipulate- That's true. A police

915
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:46,180
officer into giving them their gun and then going on a rampage and killing

916
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,280
millions. Well, they just say like if you don't give me your gun, I'm going to

917
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,100
kill myself. That would be a scary version of the happening is somebody

918
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,600
with very strong BPD walking around getting people to kill themselves. If

919
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,140
you don't give me your gun right now, I will shoot myself in the head.

920
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:04,680
I will do it. Do not give me your gun. I saw a video of a

921
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,260
guy getting shot yesterday where he was just sitting there. Were you on the

922
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:14,460
train? No, yeah. Drinking fireball? Yeah. Okay. Oh my God, Caleb has multiple

923
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,780
I had a very itchy wig on.

924
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,500
Cameron's sitting there freaking out about this guy.

925
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,820
It's you and a big orange afro.

926
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,220
I'm like, "Could that be?" No.

927
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,220
There's no way.

928
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,220
I would be so...

929
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,220
He doesn't have an itchy face.

930
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,780
I'm realizing I would be so good at having multiple personalities,

931
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,580
because I could do my costume favorite stuff.

932
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,580
Yeah, because...

933
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,580
Custom favorites.

934
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,580
I love my costume favorites.

935
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,580
James...

936
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,580
I do have multiple personalities.

937
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,580
That's what...

938
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,580
Goth, jock, chef, emo, golfer.

939
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:47,540
James McAvoy in that movie is all specifically so that he can that

940
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,400
literally is yeah. He has costumes yeah is what he's a fat. I remember that in

941
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,620
the trailer fashion designer and then he's a woman and then he's a little boy.

942
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,280
I don't think I have a woman in me. I think you do you're about to

943
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,200
what does that mean

944
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,560
you get a woman that fucked

945
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:09,040
hurt me with a finger. I don't know hey, I

946
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,220
I don't know you know what we should do what

947
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:16,560
here's the here's the hypocrisy over here. Okay, I see

948
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,420
he won't call a charity for homeless people and tell them that he wants to

949
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,100
spit in their face, but he'll call dominoes and hold her a pizza. I don't

950
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,220
know.

951
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:32,940
I use the app. You have that kind of phone anxiety where you can't call an

952
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,980
order something yeah.

953
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,780
Wow, I didn't know that about you. I have what I think what I want. What I

954
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:43,020
which I thought that was only on locks phone anxiety, at least for me, which I

955
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,920
feel like I used to have a lot. I used to have bad phone anxiety. I don't really

956
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,540
anymore. Is it a stranger on the phone? You have literally absolute power over

957
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:56,220
them. Yeah, you can destroy them. They never can literally you can kill them.

958
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,600
Yeah, well, I mean well you can kill that you can hang up at any time and you

959
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,360
can also say it doesn't matter what you say because they're not there. So you

960
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,440
can say I want to order a mother fucking pizza with poop sauce bitch and then you

961
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,980
coming up yeah. Actually, let's do that right now.

962
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:15,440
Hold on, you ordered a nine million dollar. You have to you have to call

963
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,240
dollars and order a mother fucking pizza. I don't want to order a with the

964
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,240
thing. Do you know what we literally have already done that we've called

965
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,080
Dominos on the show and said, I want to poop. Yeah, we've called and asked for

966
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,520
a poop pizza. We'd be repeating a thing. We called an ice cream parlor.

967
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:35,000
What do we do? I don't remember it was so long ago. Yeah, you won't call and

968
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,540
I want to order a poop pizza. I don't want to call. All right, whatever the

969
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,560
episodes done. Yeah, it's over next time. We will make Patrick call. We're

970
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,180
just gonna be a prank call show. Yeah, from now on and we're gonna we're gonna

971
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,300
not that these were pranks. By the way, this was not a hundred percent real.

972
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,260
This is a hundred percent real.

973
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,860
That we are not a lead up to a prank call. The only way you could consider

974
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,740
that a prank is if somehow the fans donate us enough money that we get to

975
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,500
donate nine million dollars. We get to call back these charities. So, psych,

976
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,340
that was all a prank. If we can get the Patreon at nine million a month and

977
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,160
yeah, we'll go one for go one month yeah that's fine, but if not you know a

978
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,820
month I don't know yeah we'll figure it out. Okay, bye guys shareholder beating

979
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,140
oh yeah is this Friday on Friday,

980
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:22,160
wait it is on Friday.

981
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,620
Okay, bye

982
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,120
This guy in those fucking aviator...

983
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Uh, fucking...

984
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,400
No, I will not look like a pedophile.

985
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,720
I'll look like Jeffrey Dahmer.

986
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,040
But he wasn't a pedophile.

987
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,000
He was just an evil killer who was gay.

988
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,800
And you think he's a pedophile because he's gay.

989
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,960
No, I think he's a pedophile because he's a murderer.

990
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,360
Pedophiles don't usually kill.

991
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,560
Pedophiles, you can call them murderers.

992
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,320
Yeah, they always...

993
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,520
Because they just want pleasure all the time.

994
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,520
They don't want to deal with death.

995
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,840
God, I hate them.

996
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,040
They really are sick.

997
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,760
What do you mean, what's wrong with me?

998
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,120
Why'd you say "pleasure" like that?

999
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,680
Pleasure!

1000
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,020
I was trying to think of the right word.

1001
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,020
You were saying pleasure.

1002
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,420
You weren't talking about pedophile.

1003
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,020
You were saying they have pleasure.

1004
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,020
You were saying that like they are going on tropical vacations.

1005
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,320
Yeah, it's a euphemism.

1006
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,520
I also heard like pina colada.

1007
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,820
I heard the girls gone wild.

1008
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,820
I was talking about pedophile.

1009
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,320
I heard a steel drum.

1010
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,320
No, no, no.

1011
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,320
I heard don't know.

1012
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,320
It's a useless reason.

1013
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,720
So I don't think they don't have to care about fucking kid in the butt.

1014
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,320
Is that what you rather say?

1015
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,720
See what the hell?

1016
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,420
No, that's what he that's he thinks of it.

1017
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,420
There we go.

1018
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,920
Yes, that was a cricket.

1019
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,520
The reaction you guys yelled.

1020
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,020
I got a rise out of you and that's honestly all I care about in comedy is

1021
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,120
getting a rise out of people and now I don't care to make myself laugh.

1022
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,120
I'm pushing the envelope.

1023
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,920
It's a cool as fuck actually.

1024
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:49,840
No, that was not a joke. You can't say fucking a kid in the butt like that. Well, if you do

1025
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,720
that after, I guess it's kind of, it kind of is a joke. I guess anything you say there.

1026
01:02:53,720 --> 01:03:02,480
This is how I feel. If I, when I, I don't like it, that pedophiles fuck kids in the butt.

1027
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,960
That's how I feel when I think about it. That's how you feel. That's how, wait, that is the

1028
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:10,120
audience reaction to you saying that you don't like it. So this is you talking in the audience.

1029
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Yeah, you have control of it.

1030
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,120
Say it again and then do the right one.

1031
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,120
A pedophile fucking kid in the butt.

1032
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,120
This is crass.

1033
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,120
This is not the kind of thing I want to be doing.

1034
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,120
It's not crass, it's political.

1035
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,120
Can we not say it again though?

1036
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,120
I don't like that thing.

1037
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,120
There we go.

1038
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120
So that makes more sense.

1039
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,120
In my head when I think of that thing.

1040
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,120
When I think about it.

1041
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,120
Why are you thinking?

1042
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,120
Okay, the episode is over.
