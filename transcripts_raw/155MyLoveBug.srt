00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
(music)

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
(music)

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The Dr. Pepper cast

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
(gunshots)

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, yeah, the theme song ends

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Boom, boom, boom

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Crazy, I just

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,800
myself by accident I'm afraid I just glued myself that'd be if he was in the

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:42,760
yeah and group right right what would the glue man group it would you do they

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,200
make like collage well first of all yeah they don't drum yeah no that's a blue

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,520
thing well maybe they drum once and then it gets yeah this is what the drumming

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Sounds like this

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,720
Like that video the guy who glues his uh his diapers to his chair

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,160
No, no recognition

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,020
You know I've seen I've seen monkey fucks the frog

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,600
I've seen the caught the scary car drive down the thing yeah, I've seen about 400 episodes of equals three

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
That's it. Anything outside of that, anything outside of that.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He said about.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He said about.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's not about.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You know what? Yeah.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Law of averages.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,400
If it's outside of that reference pool of videos, I probably have not seen that.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Right.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,000
It's the guy, he puts Titebond glue on his diaper and he goes, "Boy, am I glued."

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I've shown this on stream before.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Not to me. I wasn't around.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,680
- Well, you missed out on probably one of the most

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,020
moving videos ever.

38
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,860
- The only video--

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,840
- It's Sisyphean.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
- The only video that I've ever seen

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,880
is Fox and the Hound ending explained.

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
- Really?

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,540
- Yeah.

44
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,380
- How long is that video?

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,220
- 30 minutes.

46
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,040
- Wow.

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
- Damn.

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,720
- I don't remember what happens at the end of that movie.

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,540
What happens?

50
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,380
Is it--

51
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,200
- Well, basically it's just like this whole thing

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
where the fox represents a friend.

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,520
- The hound.

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,640
- And the hound represents the hound's--

55
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,320
- The fox represents the hound's friend

56
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,760
the hound represents the fox's friend. And apparently, when whichever one of them dies

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,240
or is lost or whatever, apparently that is a sad ending.

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,440
You know all that SpongeBob how it's explanation?

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,840
SpongeBob how it's made.

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,320
Right. Apparently SpongeBob represents the main character of the show.

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,920
Krabby Patties is how it's made. That'd be a great episode.

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,320
Krabby Patties represent deliciousness.

63
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,000
I think our boy Babish already hit that one.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's true.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,560
Well, he had the role of double, triple decker or whatever.

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,320
They also make gummy Krabby Patties already.

67
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,760
Oh, yeah, they've been making those and those are yeah, those are great. That's what a crabby patty is. They're small. Think about it

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Yeah, sponge Bob small. They are so good those gummy crab. Yeah

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,520
Yeah, I get 50 of those those are like the it's like the perfect mix of every single good gummy texture

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,880
Do you know what gummy I miss from my childhood?

71
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,640
But the last time I had them I didn't like it anymore

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,560
What is those gummy blue sharks that have the blue on top and white on the bottom?

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, those are like the best fucking thing ever and I had one as an adult. This is disgusting

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,180
Maybe they change the recipe is that a possibility I think no I think I just can't handle that much sugar anymore

75
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,980
Yeah, cuz it's too big. It's too big in the texture. I see you eat sugar like a fucking like a horse

76
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,140
It's not like that no no

77
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,580
I

78
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,240
Think you have sugar you have not seen me eat cubes of sugar

79
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,000
I've seen you bring a bag of sugar cubes for lunch before that's not true

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,380
Yeah, he can yeah, and he says can you hold these for me?

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,820
Well, if even Patrick is saying it's too sugary, I think something's up.

82
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,420
See, it's just it's shitty.

83
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:45,580
Like realizing that like you hear all those jokes that like your dad says it like a barbecue or something is like, oh, fuck, I can't.

84
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,700
The kids want McDonald's. I can't eat that shit anymore.

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:59,220
And it's like, yeah, you just like eating McDonald's as a grown man genuinely is is one of the most like depressing experiences.

86
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,900
It's pretty mainly it's spiritually wrong.

87
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,220
I think eating McDonald's or any kind of candy as a grown man

88
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,040
I think probably you know how there's all these crazy people who say this thing's bad for you this thing's bad for you with food

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,620
Yeah, they're all right. Yeah, you just can't get obsessive about like seed oils being bad for you all that

90
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,120
Ghost in the office in the office in the office. What the hell is off that table? What was that?

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,540
It was that yeah cardboard tube

92
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,520
I saw it just moved for no reason for no reason at all for no rewind there was a reason time stamp

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,200
Reads I'm saying for away. This is basically the Halloween episode. Yeah, because it's coming out pretty close to Halloween

94
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,440
But we do have we have a Halloween thing yeah, but we're sure we don't have a hell. Okay, then we don't know that's coming

95
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,920
Okay, so but a ghost did just literally throw something in the office out of fucking nowhere

96
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,100
Ah oh, and he just yelled into this microphone as well that a ghost startled me. Sorry girls, okay?

97
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,880
No, stop scaring me, man. I'm not scaring you. I'm being we're not doing right now

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm getting scared. I can't control it if I get scared. I scream and a ghost is fucking touching me on the back of my neck

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,860
It's raising hairs on my nape. I'm gonna wet my fucking my nape is made a nape my name

100
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,480
Did it just touch your nape

101
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:16,940
Yeah, the ghost nape to you. I got I got my nape rubbed didn't we do this before haven't you guys sat around screaming at me?

102
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,440
Before well move of that time we were messing you this yeah, I'm really scared this time

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,980
Okay, listen to my teeth chattering. We promised 21

104
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,480
(Screams)

105
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Stop! I got close to listening to the teeth chatter and then you scared me!

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
We promised 21 jump scares this month.

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Yeah, we have to throw them all in right now.

108
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
I think we are at, I think right now we're probably sitting at 14, so.

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,980
Yeah.

110
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,480
Okay, so how many did we have in the...

111
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I don't know, I didn't count them.

112
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Fuck, we didn't count them?

113
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,980
No.

114
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,480
That was your job.

115
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,480
It was your whole thing, it was a 21 jump scare. You can come up, you have to count them.

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
First of all, I was the one who came up with 21 jump scares.

117
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
And then he took control of it, pretended it was his idea.

118
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,980
I did not.

119
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,480
And then did not, and then did not.

120
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,980
Big surprise.

121
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,480
He said he came up with it on the episode.

122
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
- Oh my god.

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
- Something he's been doing lately

124
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,800
is he's been stealing everything from me.

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,200
He even wears the clothes I wear now.

126
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,040
- Yeah I do.

127
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,400
- All right, I'd like you to,

128
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,320
so go ahead and explain yourself.

129
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,160
- Can you compare the colors?

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,220
- Why have you been stealing everything?

131
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,760
- I just want to point out right now,

132
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,520
we're both wearing white t-shirts

133
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,560
with designs in black on them,

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
and who came into the office first?

135
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,660
It was me.

136
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,500
So Patrick came in after me, so he's copying me.

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,640
- I'm doing a Halloween thing, I'm doing a face-off.

138
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,960
- Both wearing black hats, you came in after me.

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
- I have a white t-shirt with a black thing on it.

140
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,640
- I was in here before you two though.

141
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,920
Yeah, I know. I'm just saying you're not wearing a black hat. So it's not really a full copy. It's only half

142
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,320
Okay, what look like? Yes, like you why your head so hot?

143
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,920
This hat is cooking my head. Yeah, what the hell that was like what the fuck's going on there?

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,120
I put that on your head, and it looked like like when you get like a

145
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,280
Like a hat for like t-ball, and it's clearly made for like a grown man. I didn't play I played

146
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,120
I went straight to baseball. Yeah. Yes. I didn't play t-ball either

147
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,600
I just went farm league and then you went farm. I played coach pitch

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,500
Yeah, I played that cuz a grown man had to go against a grown man. Well. Yeah, pretty cool cuz and he fucking

149
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,520
Whoop his ass. Yeah, yeah, he's throwing curveballs

150
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,480
I played for the Jutras team sports blue jays the hell in the Loffa

151
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,400
Farm League sounds like a sense like a lot of shit to me neither of you guys played peewee football, right?

152
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,080
I didn't I didn't play football cuz I

153
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,420
I played peewee football. I played in two weight classes in my in my my tenure in peewee football

154
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,200
midget and mini midget

155
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,280
This is the name of the weight classes

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,080
midget and mini midget

157
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,320
Why?

158
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,160
Sense

159
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,560
Because if you're putting on

160
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,480
Like little kids running around with all all that all those helmets and pads and stuff

161
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
- You don't know. - I guess from far away.

162
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
- Could be a little person. - From far away, yeah.

163
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,480
It could be a little person or it could be like a little person in age.

164
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
- Yeah, well it was the same as the ladder. - Right, yeah.

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
- Yeah. - Yeah, and I was barely...

166
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
- You need a ladder. - Yeah, when you're...

167
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,480
- To get those pringles off the shelf. - So how many...

168
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I mean, like, but you start with peewee and then how many different...

169
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
I don't know the other weight classes, but how many different weight classes...

170
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,480
- Also, why is that peewee? - Well, yeah, then under that it's bacterium.

171
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,320
- Yeah.

172
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,800
- Yeah, and it's paramecium.

173
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,640
- I kinda wanna see what--

174
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,360
- Oh, is that where pee wee comes from?

175
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
- Yeah.

176
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,620
- Paramecium, plecium, paroicium.

177
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,080
- Yeah, and then the largest one is hummingbird.

178
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,920
- Yeah.

179
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
- I wanna see what the weight classes are.

180
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,000
- I'm in the hummingbird weight class.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
- I'm in hummingbird.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,600
- Dude, yeah, you have to, if you're a bacterium kid,

183
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,280
you have to watch out for those hummingbird kids

184
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,120
'cause they'll plow the fuck through you.

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,960
- Dude, those hummingbird kids, they--

186
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,320
- When they tackle you, you will fucking die.

187
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,680
- They're all sitting around that--

188
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
They're huge.

189
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,320
It's not even a-- it's a Gatorade thing full of sugar water,

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
that red sugar water.

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
Some of those Hummingbird kids are 30 pounds.

192
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
OK, so I was wrong.

193
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,560
They could snap in your neck.

194
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,060
I was wrong.

195
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,120
It wasn't mini-midget.

196
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,400
It was mighty midget, which is above.

197
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,880
So I-- so there's-- so they changed it now.

198
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,440
Now it's might instead of midget.

199
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,280
So now it's tiny might, mighty might, junior might.

200
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,400
Oh, might like a bug?

201
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,760
Yeah.

202
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,240
I guess.

203
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,640
I thought you meant--

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,480
Like mighty might like the superhero.

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,360
I thought you meant M-I-G-H-T.

206
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,160
M-I-T-E.

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,280
So it used to be tiny midget, mighty midget,

208
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
and junior midget.

209
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,360
i guess the other like what we can do this because the political correctness

210
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,280
so let's just go a thousand times smaller

211
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,920
well it must be to what's another what's another smallholding

212
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,200
besides a little person i guess i'm my dust might yet yeah i got a very i got

213
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,240
him to get what could we do this a replacement for a little person like

214
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,440
something where we don't say little person we want to book the same general

215
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,120
feeling that we want to know we want to have so small it's all about it

216
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
- People are allergic to them.

217
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
They're on pieces of dust.

218
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
- You find them in your cat's ears.

219
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
- Yeah.

220
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
They're parasites.

221
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
- A mite.

222
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
- A mite.

223
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
That's, I think, what we'll go with, a mite.

224
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
- Yeah, it was pretty awesome, dude.

225
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
- Yeah.

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
- Yeah.

227
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
- I never played peewee football.

228
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
I did farm league and then I--

229
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
- Bro was in Farmville.

230
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
He's on his damn phone.

231
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
- What the hell?

232
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
- In second grade, I didn't play

233
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,120
because I told my mom I wanted to go to drawing classes.

234
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
- Yo.

235
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,400
And then my siblings made fun of me.

236
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,240
- Yo.

237
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,300
- And then in fourth grade I got into skateboarding

238
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,760
and then I never played like a team sport again.

239
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,820
- Sick.

240
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,660
- I did drive.

241
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,300
- I played some basketball in middle school.

242
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,140
- Really?

243
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
- Oh, I did play basketball in fourth grade.

244
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,380
Both of my cousins are like--

245
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,420
- I feel like you'd be good at basketball.

246
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,360
- Really tall.

247
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
- No, you were bad?

248
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,740
- Not as a kid at least.

249
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,380
- Yeah, as a boy you might be really good.

250
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,220
- I don't know.

251
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,060
- My cousins are--

252
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,100
- Too shy.

253
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,940
- Too shy.

254
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,260
- Don't wanna stay on the other side of the court.

255
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,900
- Don't wanna be near the ball.

256
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,740
I'd never played a game of basketball.

257
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,700
The soccer kid who's picking grass, but in a basketball game.

258
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Somehow picking grass on the court.

259
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
If you can imagine.

260
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,020
He brought a piece of sod in the...

261
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Yeah.

262
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,580
Sitting on a single square of sod, picking grass on the basketball court.

263
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
And like too old.

264
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Yeah.

265
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Yeah.

266
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
And everyone else wanted to be there.

267
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Everyone else is like, has a competitive spirit.

268
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,460
Everyone else is like, "I want to play basketball."

269
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Yeah.

270
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Yeah, I didn't know.

271
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,180
I played basketball and I only scored one point the entire time that I played basketball.

272
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
I don't think I ever scored one.

273
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,060
Accidentally for the other team.

274
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
I scored on my own basket.

275
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,620
This was the first thing's coming out of halftime and at halftime you would switch sides

276
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,740
Oh, yeah, and so I got confused and I scored on my own basket

277
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,860
My dad was like that day my dad was like all right. We're gonna take you to basketball

278
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
I don't think I ever even took a shot

279
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,380
You get just get nervous when the ball gets hands

280
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,340
Well, I think people also knew not to pass to me. Yeah, yeah

281
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,060
usually a sticky hand

282
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,980
Yeah, I don't know I showed up to the rather get blocked

283
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,820
(laughing)

284
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,660
and pass it to your wife.

285
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,480
(laughing)

286
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,320
Like you're just sitting there,

287
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,580
just sniffling and drooling on yourself.

288
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,300
Long fingernails, ugh.

289
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,260
I think I'd rather foul out.

290
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,980
- I showed up to like the first basketball practice.

291
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,340
It was like me on my like really tall cousin's team.

292
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,900
- We all played basketball.

293
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,460
- It was both of my cousins who were like six foot.

294
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,860
My cousin like is like six foot eight now.

295
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,420
And then his older brother is like six five.

296
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,100
And then it was like me and I was like,

297
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,020
I think like four foot 11.

298
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,340
They must have been like five.

299
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,700
If he's 6'8" now, that means he was 6'0" when he was 8.

300
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
That's the general rule.

301
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Something like that, yeah.

302
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,380
But, uh, I showed up to the first practice in jeans and then realized I'd never played

303
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,860
basketball in my life.

304
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
You realized that?

305
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Like you were thinking of a different sport?

306
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
I don't even know.

307
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,620
I showed up in jeans because I think I forgot that I signed up and then...

308
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,060
But you still showed up.

309
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,500
I went to the first practice and then didn't know how to play and then just like ran off

310
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
the court and went home.

311
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,100
Yeah, I thought that, you know, I'd probably only learned about basketball from like, uh,

312
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,800
like the local museum had a lot of like basketball history stuff.

313
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,100
So I was showing up at a ball made of fucking corn and there was a

314
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,600
yeah, I was thinking we're gonna be playing with a bucket, right?

315
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,700
Yeah, I thought it was gonna be a bunch of old white guys with their

316
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,900
pants hiked up.

317
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,700
All of a sudden I'm getting fucking dunked on, you guys nuts are in my mouth.

318
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,100
I showed up and I was, they started the game.

319
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,200
I was sitting at the top row of the bleachers with an N64 controller.

320
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,300
Yeah, I didn't understand.

321
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah, I'm playing basketball asshole.

322
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Yeah, I control that guy, right?

323
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,400
Go! Go!

324
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,960
None of my team is not doing anything that I want them to.

325
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,240
Switch.

326
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,740
Go!

327
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,440
Switch sides.

328
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,600
Switch genders.

329
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Turn into a full girl basketball team.

330
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
Yeah.

331
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,320
Speaking of scary Halloween stuff,

332
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,240
something scary happened to me that I haven't

333
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,080
been able to stop thinking about.

334
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,480
And it was that-- oh, am I boring you?

335
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,680
Yeah.

336
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
What an awfully timed yawn.

337
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
I know.

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Yeah.

339
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,640
Such a mean yawn.

340
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,440
That's a mean yawn, asshole.

341
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
I didn't mean for that to happen.

342
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,760
- Well you did happen to be mean.

343
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,520
- I woke up early again.

344
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,360
I woke up at like 6 in the morning.

345
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,920
- And here we are talking about his early thing

346
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,320
instead of your scary story.

347
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,160
You woke up when?

348
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
- This is actually really interesting.

349
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,000
I do wanna hear about this.

350
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,120
- What time did you wake up, I actually am curious.

351
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,240
- Like 6 a.m.

352
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,160
- Why?

353
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,260
- 'Cause Moe bit my earring.

354
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,280
He bit my earring and tried to--

355
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,040
- Your dog is trying to have sex with you.

356
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,200
- Speaking of Ray William Johnson,

357
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,280
you ever hear that song, First World Problems?

358
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,720
- No.

359
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,940
That's a Weird Al song.

360
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,640
- Speaking of, it doesn't mean it has to be.

361
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,240
- Yeah, I was just speaking, I was just speaking of.

362
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,680
- You were speaking of, all right.

363
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,520
- Yeah, speaking of.

364
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,720
- You're looking for fault today.

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,400
- Yeah, you're in a mean mood.

366
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,220
- Yeah.

367
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,060
- Well, it's 'cause I took that Adderall.

368
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,900
- Admit this, admit--

369
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,720
- I took an Adderall that was too big.

370
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,120
- Say it right now in your microphone,

371
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,080
say, "I am rotten to my core."

372
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,360
- I am rotten to my core like an apple.

373
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,200
- No, you don't say like an apple.

374
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,040
- No, take out the apple part.

375
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,860
- Take out the apple.

376
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,700
- I am rotten like an animal.

377
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,200
- No, no, you say, "I am rotten to my core."

378
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,040
- I'm rotten to my core.

379
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,720
- "I am not deserving of love."

380
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,560
I'm an evil fuck. I am say I am hell-bound. I am a hell-bound sinner. There's no redemption

381
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
There's no redemption for a guy like me

382
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,640
Because of my I'm a complete waste say we got a waste of what a waste in matter matter

383
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,060
Okay, that's good. You would be better as a tree or a dust you would honestly be better as plastic

384
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,140
Oh, you would actually be better as maybe I'm like plaque from a tooth. Yes

385
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,640
Say I'm worse than plaque. I'm worse than plaque from a tooth because at least

386
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,600
plaque does something. Yeah, say I'm like a dream in a baby's brain of dust

387
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,320
that gets forgotten instantly. I'm like a baby's words. I mean nothing.

388
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,080
Yeah, yeah. I'm babble. Yeah, you are babble. That's it. That's right.

389
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,400
Okay, I feel a little bit better about your yawn now. I feel like you've

390
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,360
atoned, but there's still no redemption. But there's nothing good for

391
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,800
you over the horizon. The type of person that you are is the type of

392
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,440
of person that goes down in history as one of the most infamous and also

393
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,440
insignificant pieces of very tiny pieces of shit.

394
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,840
You will somehow be responsible for millions of deaths and so much.

395
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,120
Somebody else will get blamed.

396
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,520
Yeah.

397
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,280
Yeah.

398
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,120
I mean, you won't even get the credit for it.

399
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,440
Um, I, when we were at the bar, I walked into the bar, everyone was already there.

400
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
And I saw, I saw the grim reaper.

401
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,040
I saw a person dressed as the Grim Reaper, so full cloak.

402
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,840
Oh, I missed this.

403
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Scythe.

404
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
Well, this is the thing here, right?

405
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
You were there too, right?

406
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,840
And I walked in.

407
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,340
I saw this person facing away from me.

408
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,540
So all I see is cloak, scythe, and I was like, oh, that's a

409
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,840
crazy Halloween costume.

410
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,540
That's nuts.

411
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,040
I walk into the other room to meet up with you guys.

412
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm like, oh, did you guys see the Grim Reaper out there?

413
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,540
Everyone's like, no.

414
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,740
What are you talking about?

415
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,040
And then multiple people got up to go order food and get

416
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,040
drinks. Like I would say less than five minutes after I said

417
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,140
that and nobody saw the Grim Reaper.

418
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
- Nobody saw it.

419
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,900
- I straight up saw the actual Grim Reaper.

420
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,260
- You're actually going to die.

421
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,100
- I'm going to die.

422
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,060
- Yeah, wow.

423
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,900
- He saw the Grim Reaper.

424
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,720
(screaming)

425
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,340
(laughing)

426
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,220
- Stop, man.

427
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,060
What the hell?

428
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,300
- He got scared by my scary story.

429
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,140
It's not a big deal.

430
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,020
- That was not a, you guys.

431
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,500
- I'm terrified right now.

432
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,740
- You guys don't realize the difference

433
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,740
between a scary and a scaring scream, okay?

434
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,940
So you were not like, ah!

435
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,780
- Ah, yes, see that's a scaring.

436
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,860
- That's a scaring, but then a scare.

437
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,820
- A scary would be like, ah!

438
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,660
- Right.

439
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,480
- What I do, whenever you do that.

440
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,320
(screaming)

441
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
- Like that?

442
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,980
- That was more just--

443
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,820
- Yeah, like Caleb, like,

444
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
"Oh no!"

445
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,120
- Yeah, that's how I scream.

446
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,380
- "Oh no, I don't wanna die!

447
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,220
Put me down, King Kong!

448
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,260
(laughing)

449
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,680
Put me down right now!

450
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,860
Get me out of this building!"

451
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,700
- I don't bang on his chest.

452
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,780
- You're banging on his fist?

453
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,100
- Well, that's actually pretty impressive.

454
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,420
- "Put me down!

455
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,540
You're so strong!"

456
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,300
- Is that, that is a subtext of that movie

457
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,340
is that she wants to fuck King Kong, right?

458
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,940
I think you're reading it. I think it's the other way around.

459
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,440
No, I think King Kong wants to fuck her.

460
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,940
I think she's in love with King Kong.

461
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,440
But which one, the remake, right? The Dino De Laurentiis remake?

462
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
The 70s one? I never saw that one.

463
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Does she fuck him?

464
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,140
I think she does.

465
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,340
You know, there's a, I may have talked about it.

466
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,040
Stop me if I've talked about this because I can't remember,

467
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,740
but there's a ripoff from...

468
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,040
You've talked about a ripoff before.

469
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,840
Fuck.

470
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,040
All right.

471
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,240
A ripoff of what? It might be a different one.

472
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Of King Kong.

473
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Oh, no, then you haven't talked about this.

474
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,040
There's an Italian movie called Yeti.

475
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,760
Yeti the Terror of... it's called Yeti and it's a King Kong ripoff and there's a scene

476
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,200
where the girl is being carried by the Yeti, like King Kong, and she's like scared.

477
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
Oh, you showed me this clip before.

478
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,800
I definitely showed you the clip.

479
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,400
I may have even posted it on Twitter, but she like reaches up to like grab onto something

480
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,840
and she just touches... they just modeled a gigantic nipple and she touches the Yeti's

481
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,600
nipple and as she's touching it, it like gets hard.

482
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,160
Like they like inflate it and make it get hard and they have an insert of his face and

483
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,100
and he like smiles and like raises his eyebrows

484
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,540
and goes like, "Ugh, ugh."

485
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,380
- No one ever touches nipples before.

486
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,360
- And then she looks back and sees that she's touching

487
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,000
his nipple and pulls her hand away.

488
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,460
And she looks down, her hand is like covered

489
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,040
in clumps of hair and she like shakes the hair.

490
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,380
- Whoa.

491
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,620
- So first of all, glue hand. - It's so crazy.

492
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,460
- Yeah. - Yeah.

493
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,380
- Like she's doing a 40 year old version.

494
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,260
- Sticky sweaty hand.

495
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,940
- She's doing a 40 year old version of them.

496
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,780
- Yeah, she's waxing them.

497
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,300
- I was gonna go back to the glue man group

498
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,620
they were talking about earlier.

499
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,100
- And say what about it.

500
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,060
- Maybe she's in it.

501
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,900
- She could be in it.

502
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,620
- It's glue man group though.

503
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,460
- Glue woman man group.

504
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,100
- We don't know what she is.

505
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,020
So, write that down, jot it.

506
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,140
- Yeah, jot that down, and just fucking shove it

507
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,260
in your mouth.

508
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,460
Okay, he's writing this down.

509
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,820
- Definitely hold your pencil the weird way that you do.

510
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
- Yeah, and he was just about to say that too.

511
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,380
Hold your pencil in your weird way.

512
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,220
What does this say?

513
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,580
- We don't know what she is.

514
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,420
- Okay.

515
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,240
- So I jotted that down.

516
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
- And above it, it says divine.

517
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,920
- Yeah, I actually did it.

518
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,300
- It actually doesn't say divine.

519
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,140
- Oh, it says--

520
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,620
(screams)

521
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,460
That didn't get me.

522
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,620
I'm dude it didn't yeah be honest with me. Did I start he moved?

523
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,900
I didn't move he moved and he giggled and that's a giggle counts as a reaction

524
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,260
Yes, are you one of those fucking assholes who walks through us haunted house ago like?

525
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,060
Yeah, like beavis and butthead fucking asshole see I go

526
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:37,220
I wish it I could I would that is what I do

527
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,720
I do. I laugh when I get startled too.

528
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,340
When I go through a haunted house, I kind of just, I look for the smallest details.

529
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,580
You look for the smallest woman working there.

530
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:53,580
I look for the smallest details and I'm thinking, man, they must have been so fun to put this

531
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,860
together.

532
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
No, you would not.

533
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,420
Because I've gone to the Universal Horror Nights once.

534
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,580
Seems like it's wasted on you.

535
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Yeah.

536
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
You need to go to...

537
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
I appreciate it.

538
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,020
Seems like you might better like a museum.

539
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:12,380
I know that when it comes to scary stuff, you're not supposed to be an enjoyer, you're supposed

540
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,380
to be a victim.

541
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,380
Yeah.

542
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
And so that's what I do.

543
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,960
When I watch scary movies, when I watched Barbarian the other day, I was literally doing,

544
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,380
I had my hoodie all the way down over my eyes, I'm looking through my ... I'm a grown man.

545
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
I'm a quarter of a hundred years old.

546
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,940
And I'm covering my eyes with my hand, I'm looking through it and I'm eeping and wifey

547
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,580
has never been less attractive in her life.

548
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,620
But I don't care because I'm having a good time.

549
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,140
- It is my wifey, she does the cover eyes thing

550
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,660
and it makes me laugh so hard every time.

551
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,780
There's something, it's like a build up to a jump scare.

552
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,660
She holds her hand in front of her face

553
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,300
and I always, if I've seen the movie before,

554
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,220
I'll always pull her hand down right before the jump scare.

555
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,180
- Oh my god, you're gonna be a mean father.

556
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,020
- Yeah.

557
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,840
- You're gonna be one of those mean--

558
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,540
- It's so funny to do. - Scaring.

559
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,580
It's not funny.

560
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,420
- It's really funny to do.

561
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,840
- If you did that to me, I would break your arm.

562
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,900
- Okay, I'm not gonna do it to you.

563
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,100
- And I'd probably be really scared even worse.

564
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,860
I don't have a beautiful love connection with you that would allow me to do

565
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,780
something like that. As if, as if you don't. I have a different type.

566
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,940
I've known you for years. As if you don't have a beautiful fucking love connection.

567
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,340
There's a bug. Okay, hold that thought. There's a bug.

568
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:25,660
Do you love me? Okay, wait, hold on. The bug is gone, guys.

569
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,140
The bug could be anywhere. Why is that video?

570
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,700
I saw there's a quarter on the ground over there. Okay.

571
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,860
That's not important to me.

572
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,460
That video that Alex sent of Moe playing with a cockroach.

573
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,660
Do you guys let that happen?

574
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,980
Do you let your cat play with a cockroach?

575
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,060
No, he sent me that last night.

576
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,380
I wasn't home.

577
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,140
He sent me the video of that,

578
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,780
and I asked him about it this morning.

579
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,780
I was like, "Did you get up and kill the cockroach?"

580
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,220
He was like, "Yeah, but I just let it fight it

581
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,060
"for a little bit.

582
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,500
"I wanted to see what would happen."

583
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,900
(laughing)

584
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,340
He's letting my fucking cat just fight.

585
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,260
Like if it's a mouse, I've seen him like,

586
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,520
he came into the living room with a dead mouse

587
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,360
in his mouth before.

588
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,180
- Yeah, but you're not supposed to--

589
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,880
- That's his job, he's not supposed to fight a bug.

590
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,180
- Dude, him sending that video to us,

591
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,900
and he sent it with the text, "Mo fighting a cockroach,"

592
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,140
and I was like, "Oh, it's probably

593
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,380
"like a dead cockroach he found."

594
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,540
It's just a fully alive cockroach crawling around

595
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,060
and Mo's swatting it, trying to kill it.

596
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,100
- I guess, so Alex told me-- - Disgusting, dude.

597
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,700
He picked it up in his mouth.

598
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,940
- That's the one that picked,

599
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,620
that cat licks your face, licks your fingers, your ears,

600
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,460
and I don't know what else, God only knows.

601
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,260
- I notice, I wake up to him doing that

602
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,220
because he's like--

603
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,060
- And right after he's been--

604
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,020
- He had that stomach worm.

605
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,300
- He's been deep throating cockroaches for hours

606
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,220
while you've been asleep.

607
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,040
And then he comes and he just--

608
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,880
- He wakes me up.

609
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,720
- Burps it into your mouth.

610
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,440
- Wakes me up like he dragged my ear,

611
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,380
like he was like, "Come on, feed me."

612
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,420
- He's gonna drop a cockroach in your ear one day.

613
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,700
- Dude, he's gonna pull up in my bed

614
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,300
and with a dead mouse in his mouth.

615
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,140
- Yeah.

616
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,580
- And that's gonna be his prize.

617
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,420
- I need to get a mouse attacker.

618
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,260
- Dude, it's--

619
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,100
- Phil's too scared of the mice, man.

620
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,660
- We don't have, like, I mean, honestly,

621
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,940
he's doing his job. - Usually I just get them.

622
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,780
- You just get the mice?

623
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,260
- Yeah, I just bat them around a little bit.

624
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
- You're too slow.

625
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,460
- You dress up like a cat.

626
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
- I walk down on all fours, I bat them around,

627
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,220
I pick them up my mouth, put it down,

628
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,940
toy with it a little bit. - You don't do that.

629
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,180
- And then I usually will cut it open with my claws,

630
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,140
and I usually will bring it to someone I love

631
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,460
and leave it in front of them.

632
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,300
- What? - Usually.

633
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,140
- As a present?

634
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,740
- Or your sick idea of a present?

635
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,080
- It's basically my sick idea of what a gift would be

636
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,920
if I was a human.

637
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,460
- Yeah, it's also a mouse's sick idea.

638
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,420
- Yeah. - Mice's sick idea.

639
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,860
- Well, it's not 'cause the mouse is dead

640
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,700
and the mouse had no idea what was happening.

641
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,380
- That's a pretty, this is a serial killer mouse.

642
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,140
- I'm kind of like an Old Testament god

643
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,940
toying with this little creature

644
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,660
and I'm just kind of being cruel.

645
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,580
And it doesn't even know what I am.

646
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
- Yeah. - Yeah.

647
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,260
- An animal, that's what I am.

648
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,080
- I think it knows what you are.

649
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,260
I think rats and mice are very aware of--

650
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,020
- The bug's back, guys.

651
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,860
- Oh my God.

652
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,680
(laughing)

653
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:05,120
mother of god. My god, he's fucking right. There is a bug. No, dude. That is too scary.

654
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,200
I am the bug correspondent. Yeah, yeah. And now to Cameron. Going to our bug correspondent.

655
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
He's outside speaking to a bug. The bug was here earlier. It landed on the wall. When

656
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,360
I looked over, it was gone. But folks, this just in, the bug is back. We've set up a bug

657
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:25,200
trap using apple cider vinegar and soap. I've set up a bug trap using my cup tan. And Cameron,

658
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,920
me this am I one of your best friends in the world?

659
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,840
Folks I'm getting an important news in my earpiece the bug is nowhere to be seen

660
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,920
and we have to all eyes must be open to the question. Cameron answer the question.

661
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,520
How about you just answer that question. It's dangerous for a bug to be loose and no one

662
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,360
to know where it is. Cameron if I need somewhere to stay will you let me stay

663
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,120
at your house? I'm seeing the bug in the distance it's about a mile away. Things

664
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,280
are not so good at home and I need someone to talk to. The bug is about two

665
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,080
miles away now and I have a clear sight on it with my eyes. How can you even see that bug? You're making that up.

666
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,920
The bug just flew 10 miles away and it's going in circles. You're fucking lying.

667
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,040
Cameron is there some sort of magnifying lens we can look at this bug in?

668
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,040
No Patrick, I'm using... And also are you best friends with Caleb or me? The bug is right here Patrick, it just went on the light.

669
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,200
And I've been drinking way too much. Folks the bug is about a hundred miles away at this time and I'm

670
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,360
looking at it with my naked eye. I don't believe you that'd be the fastest bug

671
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,360
ever made by God. By the way, do you love both of us? Do you love us? We're brothers.

672
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,480
The brothers you wish you always had. Folks, this is news I did not want to

673
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,400
have to break on this show but the bug is in China. Okay, you can't see the China, you need a TV.

674
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,800
It likes the light folks, the bug likes the light. I've been drinking

675
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,480
grain alcohol and Kool-Aid all day. Scientists are looking into whether bugs

676
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,800
like light and this could be crucial evidence for the case. I've been

677
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,800
I've been experimenting with pills and I just need someone with me.

678
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Folks, I have horrible news. There's a hundred bugs in a tree in a forest.

679
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
I don't know that you can know something like that.

680
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I just saw it with my naked eye 3,000 miles away.

681
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Speaking of naked, will you rate my body out of five?

682
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Folks, I just saw another bug. It's on the floor.

683
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Oh my god, he killed the bug.

684
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Wow. You are fucking Jackie Chan.

685
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Dude, you said I wasn't fast enough to play with a mouse.

686
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,940
- Wow, with a mouse? - He just smacked that bug

687
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,540
out of the damn world.

688
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,140
- It's like the news anchor thing was a bug trap.

689
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,660
- It almost was, the bug was like,

690
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,940
huh, they're so distracted with this news anchor thing

691
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,540
that I'm gonna fly right next to his head.

692
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,580
- I just hurt my shoulder doing that.

693
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,340
- See, you're not built for that.

694
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,920
- That bug was too strong for you.

695
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,180
- Yeah, that was me trying to unlock my animalistic instinct

696
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,960
and that's what happens when an animal spirit

697
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,140
flows through a human frame, it can't handle it.

698
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,740
- Yeah. - You used brave bird on it

699
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,460
and you did some damage to yourself.

700
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,500
- Yeah, I was a Pokemon.

701
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,340
- I've been feeling like an animal.

702
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,020
- But that's why werewolves wake up

703
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,660
and they're covered in bruises.

704
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,420
- You do look like Blaziken.

705
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,260
- Oh, I don't.

706
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,660
- And don't say I look like the Doug one.

707
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,500
- Diglett?

708
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,340
- Don't say that.

709
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,460
(laughing)

710
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,300
I look like Diglett.

711
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,380
- Hey, hey, hey.

712
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,220
Doug Trio.

713
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,180
- Okay, there's two of them.

714
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,020
- Doug Duo.

715
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,840
- Well, there's a third guy.

716
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,680
- Doug Duo.

717
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,520
- Doug Duo.

718
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,340
- You look like--

719
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,020
- Oh, a couple of Dodos, though.

720
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,540
- Shut that bitch ass up.

721
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,380
- I don't look like Incineroar.

722
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,420
- Oh, a couple of Blaziken ass.

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,340
- Oh. - Which one is Celebi?

734
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,420
- I do do this. - You're also the egg one, too.

735
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,260
- The egg one. - The egg fancy.

736
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,100
- Yeah. - All right.

737
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,920
- You know what? - Well, that,

738
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,760
but also the one that is eggs.

739
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,600
- I opened up a, I'll say it.

740
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,060
I opened up a can of worms, Pandora's box situation.

741
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,180
- Oh, is there a worm one?

742
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,140
That would actually, that would be really good.

743
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,020
- No, no. - Weedle, yeah.

744
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,860
- I don't look like Weedle?

745
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
- Well, I guess Weedle probably has more hair than you.

746
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,340
He's got a little spike.

747
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,060
- Okay, very funny. - Metapod.

748
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,900
- Metapod. - Metapod.

749
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,340
Yeah, you look like you look like unknown cuz Hank can't tell if you're a boy or a girl so

750
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,580
Got you bitch ass and you look you look like you used to look like snorlax

751
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,780
And I look like a skinny version of him asshole bitch. You look like four of the unknowns you look like no

752
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,240
No, be a L and D. No on a row. Yep. Yeah

753
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,300
Also, you look like every digimon not the cool ones only the girl ones

754
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:29,860
I don't think so you look like angel mon. No you look like I'm Edward and SpongeBob's house and Patrick's house combined

755
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,460
It's kind of true. The head shape of SpongeBob's house, the face of Squidward's, and the top

756
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,260
of... Yeah, you could make my face out of those, I think. Yeah.

757
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Yeah.

758
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Could look cool.

759
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,300
Meanwhile, over here, I look like Mr. Krabs.

760
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,100
I think you guys better be quiet because my testicles...

761
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,740
Because of the herbal supplements I've been taking, my testicles have actually like 1.5

762
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,180
X in size. So you might want to watch who you're talking to.

763
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Really?

764
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,820
Yeah. They stopped fitting through when I do this with my hand. My ball won't fit through

765
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
that anymore because I got so many...

766
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,660
- I think that's good.

767
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,500
- No, it's good.

768
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,180
- It's called Tangat Ali.

769
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,020
- You always end up taking some kind of supplement

770
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,580
or something and then you start complaining

771
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,700
about what it is doing to your body.

772
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,140
- No, the side effects are good for this.

773
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,100
I like having big balls that hurt real bad

774
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,220
when they touch my leg.

775
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
- You would do so good in medieval times.

776
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,060
- You really think so?

777
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,000
- I think that you would eat so many plants

778
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,840
that people told you to eat.

779
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,220
- I would do anything, yeah.

780
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,580
- Whatever the apothecary was like,

781
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,100
yeah, I think today we need to,

782
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,760
- The only cure for your twisted ankles,

783
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,900
I think we need to cut off your hand at the wrist

784
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,620
because that will equalize your body.

785
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,460
And you're like,

786
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,900
"Actually, can you cut off both of my hands?"

787
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,740
- I want the symmetry.

788
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,580
- Yeah, I really want that.

789
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,940
- He would eat crimson nirnroot.

790
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,900
- I think both of you would probably die at four years old.

791
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,140
- I would be an incredible slave in medieval times.

792
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,340
- No, you don't work hard.

793
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,780
- No, I would be a scribe.

794
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,620
- I'd be an amazing olomon.

795
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,900
- You'd be an eunuch.

796
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,740
- Eunuch?

797
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,840
- E-nuch.

798
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,760
- I would not be a eunuch.

799
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,720
You would be way more of a eunuch than me.

800
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,840
No, when my balls are fucking you.

801
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,720
Imagine him as a eunuch in the little cloak

802
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,040
and he's doing the tented fingers.

803
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
He has a big falsetto.

804
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,840
Master.

805
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,360
I don't have a big falsetto and I can't say master.

806
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,400
Yeah, well, you just did.

807
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,160
Remember that, we saw that fucking--

808
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,440
Remember we saw that eunuch?

809
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,320
We saw that movie--

810
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,240
It's e-nuke.

811
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,040
We saw that movie--

812
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
It's e-nuke.

813
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,960
--in North Carolina.

814
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,760
Movie idea, e-nuke.

815
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,080
The woman eunuch of the North.

816
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,000
E-nuke of--

817
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,040
We saw the woman king and there's a eunuch in that movie.

818
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,320
Is there really a eunuch in--

819
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
Oh, yeah, there was.

820
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,900
I forgot about the eunuch.

821
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,400
Yeah.

822
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,060
What do they do?

823
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,900
It's so funny that I saw that, and then immediately,

824
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,900
like, two days later, saw this video of someone being like--

825
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,420
yeah, that was one of the biggest slave trading groups.

826
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,020
Or one of the biggest slave trading--

827
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,380
We need Pat to talk about this.

828
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,620
Patrick, he came out of that movie, and he texted us.

829
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,460
He said, so, I have some thoughts.

830
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,100
And then he unloaded.

831
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Yeah, I didn't know.

832
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,260
I was just like, all right, that was just a pretty--

833
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,940
it seems like an Oscar bait movie.

834
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,820
- Was it Oscar, was it good?

835
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,880
- It was, I mean--

836
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,860
- It was certainly long.

837
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,500
- We've definitely talked about this before,

838
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,100
but I really don't wanna discuss that movie

839
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,060
with someone who hasn't seen it,

840
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,260
'cause it's kind of an experience.

841
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,580
- Yeah, really. - And I mean,

842
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,820
you weren't there, you didn't see it,

843
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,300
so I feel like I don't even feel comfortable

844
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,140
talking about it. - That's true,

845
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,500
I was literally fucking driving as that.

846
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,620
- Yeah, well-- - I need to scrape

847
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,180
this goo off with this, give me that.

848
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,260
- No, you can keep the goo there.

849
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,700
- No, I don't want-- - Leave the goo.

850
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,060
- You're gonna dull the knife.

851
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,100
- Can I have this back?

852
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,940
- Yeah. - Thanks.

853
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,900
Can I have this nothing back?

854
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,220
- Yeah, you can have that nothing back.

855
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,500
- Thanks.

856
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,140
There's nothing all over our nothing.

857
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,980
- Oh no.

858
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,060
- Oh man.

859
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,100
- So what is your big plan for Halloween?

860
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,300
What are you guys going as?

861
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,620
- Apparently there's a big show we have to do.

862
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,940
- Well yeah, we're gonna do our stupid little show

863
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,580
at the bell house on Halloween.

864
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,740
- On Halloween night.

865
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,580
- And the day before.

866
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,700
- But the day, which hey, I just wanna clarify,

867
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,380
I know this is probably the last chance

868
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,700
for us to tell people to get tickets.

869
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,900
The show's at 7.30, so you're gonna still be able

870
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,180
to go to whatever fucking degenerate satanic shit

871
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
you wanna do afterwards.

872
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,340
So if you're still planning on doing a summoning,

873
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,460
like if you will go, the show's gonna be,

874
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,300
you know, you'll be out of there

875
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,840
in an hour, hour and a half or so,

876
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,460
and then you'll be back in your fucking shithole,

877
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,100
summoning suddenly, in Molok, right?

878
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,260
Watching scary, satanic, scary movies.

879
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,740
You are gonna go and see Baphomet.

880
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,260
- Also, realistically, if you listen to the show,

881
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,140
how fun is your Halloween normally?

882
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,020
What, you sit and you watch Halloween Town

883
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,740
with two people at home, right?

884
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,580
you make popcorn, you drink soda.

885
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,860
- And that would be cool to do the day before on Sunday

886
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,220
and maybe you guys should come to my house.

887
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,700
- How about you come to our show

888
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,940
and we make you do push-ups in front of us?

889
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,780
How's that sound?

890
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,900
- And also, I still can't stress this enough,

891
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,940
if you bring a pillowcase, you will get candy.

892
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,340
- We're literally giving out free candy.

893
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,340
- This is the only chance you will have in your adult life

894
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,900
to trick or treat without getting put on a list.

895
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,620
- There's no question, you will be leaving with candy.

896
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,420
- And with a signed copy of a new vinyl album

897
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,020
that we are releasing.

898
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,460
It is an R&B album.

899
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,300
- Yes.

900
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,260
- With 20 songs.

901
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,540
- 24 songs.

902
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,380
- 24.

903
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,200
- And it's called-- - 'Cause there's four

904
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,040
hidden tracks.

905
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,420
- It's called My Spooky Sexy Halloween.

906
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,260
- It is, and we'll give it a little taste of it right now.

907
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,340
- And it's $1.

908
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,020
- Yo, your face look like a pumpkin

909
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,140
and I wanna fuck it now.

910
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,500
And I wanna go and take you back to Halloween town.

911
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,740
- That is, see, that's,

912
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,100
we don't want to give away too much.

913
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,600
Yeah.

914
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,420
But here's another part that I don't want to give away too much.

915
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,920
Not too much.

916
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,420
Ghost.

917
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,580
Mm-hmm.

918
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,260
That's one word.

919
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,420
And we do a cover of Candy Girl by New Edition.

920
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,180
Obviously.

921
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,100
There's also--

922
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,900
Girl, when I'm in that pussy, I'm a monster.

923
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,400
Yeah, yeah.

924
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,820
I'm gonna come into your--

925
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,340
Girl, your pussy smells like a zombie.

926
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,660
Your pussy smells like a fucking coffin.

927
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,940
You got bolts on either side like Frankenstein.

928
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm bobbing for pussy.

929
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,100
That would be kind of hot if I'm bobbing for pussy.

930
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,940
And then there's a lyric where you have the pussy in your mouth and you're like

931
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,180
*mimics*

932
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,980
Because you got it.

933
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,480
Yeah.

934
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,980
Right?

935
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,980
And then there's one spoken word part where it's like we're doing all that sexy stuff and then

936
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:09,300
it goes like, "Girl that costume's really good, but it would look a lot better on the floor of my crypt."

937
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,800
Yes.

938
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,140
My abandoned crypt.

939
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:16,580
And there's a, the album cover is there's like a sexy girl Frankenstein and she has the bolts on her hips.

940
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:23,540
So that yeah, yeah doggy style. Yeah, you're holding on like she's a like she's a horse like she's a horse. Yeah, and there's

941
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,900
What is that called a horse?

942
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,020
What is the horse wheel that you ride on?

943
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:35,900
Your pussy feels like when I put my hand in the brain bucket

944
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,780
Yeah, side a is all Halloween stuff inside B is all horse stuff. Which ride is this?

945
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,500
What a carousel?

946
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,580
That's what I'm thinking of I got it. I got it. I wasn't that hard. I just had to mime it perfectly

947
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
I didn't do the movement

948
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:57,380
And

949
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:04,020
My shit what you wanted a buck on your shit isn't bucking like moving away like getting away from like yeah

950
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,720
Like trying to like get away away like trying to get you off you know girl to try to get away from your penis

951
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,200
I don't know you don't know what bucking me. I've never I've been on a horse once so they taught you but I saw a video on

952
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,800
I think I think I was on tick-tock that my girlfriend was watching of have you guys seen videos of people putting horseshoes on horses?

953
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,520
That shit is crazy. Oh wait where they put the hand they like fuck

954
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,720
They have like a knife, and they like scrape a bunch of a hoof off. Yeah, that's pretty cool. It's crazy

955
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,160
Well, I just looks like it. I mean I know it probably doesn't but looks like it hurts so bad

956
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,520
No, I was like their fingernail. I know yeah, but I even then I wouldn't want someone holding on to my finger

957
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,200
and scraping my fingernail with a knife

958
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,960
and then hammering nails into it.

959
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,280
- You could technically do that with a human fingernail.

960
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,120
- It's what an acrylic nail is.

961
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,960
- Technically, yeah.

962
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,760
- But they're--

963
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,580
- Same thing with an acrylic nail.

964
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,720
- So you could get like a metal nail.

965
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,560
- Yeah.

966
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,920
- A horse's legs are fingers.

967
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,560
- You could do some like Tony Iommi like--

968
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
- Horse has four fingers.

969
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,280
- Yeah, that's anatomically, it's walking on its fingers.

970
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,600
- It's a four fingered monster.

971
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,440
- Yeah.

972
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,260
- And it's head is a thumb.

973
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,520
- Horses are so scary, they should be a Halloween monster.

974
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,360
- It is crazy.

975
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,040
- Their teeth and eyes are so scary.

976
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,540
There's that one Bloodborne boss that's like a horse guy that's like the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.

977
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:18,840
Based off of the size of horses, they should be in the top 10 scariest animals, but people are very comfortable around horses.

978
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:27,340
I'm afraid of horses specifically because I saw the, what's it called, the...

979
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,540
Oh, it's time to be real?

980
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,540
Don't come up with that.

981
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,540
You just like got a notification like something terrible just happened.

982
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,380
- Yeah, you did look at it.

983
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,340
- I was about to look up a picture of a scary horse

984
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,420
to show you guys and I saw that notification.

985
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,980
- You know what, I'm a pro,

986
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,780
so I'm gonna post late on B-roll.

987
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,620
- It's okay, I'm an amateur.

988
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,700
I don't mind being an amateur.

989
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,300
- You know who didn't do that?

990
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,340
- Yeah, Patrick.

991
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,180
Patrick didn't even care that it had to be real.

992
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,660
- Didn't even look at my phone.

993
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,900
- Well, you did look at your phone, actually.

994
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,220
- I looked at his phone once he did

995
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,420
because I thought that we all got a notification

996
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,940
in the Slack that Patches is sick.

997
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,700
- That would be so hor--

998
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,260
- We have to know about this immediately.

999
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,020
Patches has a cold.

1000
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,780
Patches is sick with something bad.

1001
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,940
Yeah, what do you think he would get?

1002
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,060
He would get something that made him look like this.

1003
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,100
Oh, I was talking about I saw the horse scene in The Godfather

1004
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,660
too early.

1005
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,340
Oh, the head?

1006
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,220
Yeah.

1007
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,740
I finally--

1008
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,940
No, a horse can't do that by itself, though.

1009
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,860
I didn't see the--

1010
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,500
You'd have to be scared of a horse.

1011
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,220
I don't know why.

1012
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,260
You'd have to be scared of mobsters and gangsters.

1013
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,540
But I just associated horses with scary because of that scene.

1014
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,700
That scene isn't even scary.

1015
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,860
It's funny.

1016
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,620
It is fun now that I've seen The Godfather all the way through.

1017
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
I think that's funny. I've never seen it before.

1018
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,540
Yeah, The Godfather is actually a comedy.

1019
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:40,960
Yeah.

1020
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,740
I hate when people do that about movies.

1021
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,160
And it's a Christmas movie.

1022
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,580
Yeah. When people said that about Phantom Thread,

1023
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,960
I said, "Suck my dick."

1024
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,080
Yeah.

1025
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,500
I never saw Phantom Thread. I don't care.

1026
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,380
It was fucking boring as shit.

1027
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,800
It was my brother's favorite movie.

1028
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,340
Fuck him.

1029
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,300
Stupid brother.

1030
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,060
Yeah.

1031
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,500
I don't think...

1032
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,420
I think you better.

1033
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,840
You think I care?

1034
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,720
Do you honestly think I care?

1035
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,340
Some of that guy's movies I like, but some of your guys...

1036
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,680
My brother's movies?

1037
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,720
The... No, fucking...

1038
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
You know he's a famous movie maker, right?

1039
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Paul Thomas Anderson.

1040
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
You can't make me care about the Phantom Thread.

1041
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
That's what, "There Will Be Blood" that shit's awesome.

1042
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Yeah, exactly. You gotta put it in there.

1043
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
The Phantom Thread.

1044
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,720
You want me to watch, okay, should I watch "There Will Be Blood"

1045
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
or "The Phantom Thread"?

1046
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Which, by the way,

1047
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
they only added the Phantom part to make it seem cooler.

1048
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
It could have been called "Thread".

1049
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
The Thread.

1050
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
"There Will Be Blood" you're like the whole time.

1051
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
"Boogie Nights" I'm like, "Oh, I'm excited. Let's go."

1052
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,220
Let's go.

1053
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,720
OK, let's go.

1054
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,220
OK.

1055
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,720
OK.

1056
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,220
OK.

1057
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,080
Yeah, yeah.

1058
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,000
Liquorice pizza, not a damn--

1059
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,960
Punch drunk love?

1060
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,240
No, no thank you.

1061
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,740
No.

1062
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,480
If it was just called Punch--

1063
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:41,980
Yeah.

1064
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,400
--I'm in the master of that seat.

1065
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,160
Punch drunk.

1066
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,680
Drunk punch.

1067
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,440
Drunk.

1068
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,940
Drunk?

1069
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,800
Drunk love punch.

1070
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,440
If it was called Bumfights--

1071
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,940
Yeah.

1072
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,440
Yeah.

1073
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,400
--you could get me in the seat.

1074
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,120
Then I'm paying a full 20 for that.

1075
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,040
I'll watch it on iMax.

1076
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,640
That would be so funny to rent out

1077
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,280
like the MetroGraf or something and just

1078
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,720
screen Bumfights the whole time.

1079
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,000
and I see the master, that's another cool one.

1080
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,840
- Cool name, cool name.

1081
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,200
- Okay, could be a samurai.

1082
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,680
- And then I'm like, Magnolia?

1083
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,300
Okay, a flower?

1084
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,140
No, no.

1085
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,960
- No, no.

1086
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,800
- No.

1087
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,920
- Am I looking like a gardener?

1088
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,760
- Yeah.

1089
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,580
- No.

1090
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,640
- And then it's like, yeah, what else do you direct?

1091
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,400
Like, Fight Club, Finding Nemo,

1092
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,720
it's like a similar situation.

1093
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,080
It's like, I would rather watch Fight Club

1094
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
than Finding Nemo, it's a cooler name.

1095
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,040
- Exactly.

1096
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,880
- Fighting Nemo, on the other hand.

1097
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
- Did he do Fight Club?

1098
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,360
- Yeah, and Finding Nemo.

1099
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,200
- Really?

1100
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,040
- Yeah.

1101
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,860
- Wow, this guy's the most talented guy.

1102
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,360
- Whoa, Resident Evil 2?

1103
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
- Not the first one though.

1104
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,600
- That was Paul W.S. Anderson.

1105
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,440
- Really?

1106
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,920
- Whoa.

1107
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,160
- Paul W. Sanderson?

1108
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,120
- Yeah, Paul W.S. Anderson.

1109
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,960
- Whoa.

1110
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,760
- It is crazy that there's enough Paul Andersons.

1111
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,440
- There's two Paul Andersons, it's so funny.

1112
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,280
- Hey, even The Matrix too.

1113
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,040
- Those are the absolute funniest two directors

1114
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,800
to share a first and last name too.

1115
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
- What else is Paul W.S. Anderson?

1116
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
- Paul W.S. Anderson did Resident Evil

1117
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,760
and like all the video game,

1118
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,720
like all those video game movies he did fucking.

1119
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,880
He did event horizon he did

1120
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,480
He did the death race remake. He did that monster hunter movie that just came out in a bunch of Resident Evil

1121
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:13,280
Yeah, no no he's great. I love him. Yeah, he's a real, but it's just so funny to have a confusion between the guy who directed

1122
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,600
fucking

1123
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,360
Yeah, that Resident Evil and the guy who did the master. Yeah, that is a very good

1124
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,600
There's a big one. I'm blanking on that he did I just because we were talking about Paul

1125
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
He did that three Musketeers too.

1126
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,700
It's Paul W. Anderson, right?

1127
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,000
Paul W. S. Anderson.

1128
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,700
But then who's the... it's Paul...

1129
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Paul Thomas Anderson.

1130
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,800
I straight up for a second...

1131
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,900
I fully lived in a world in my brain

1132
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,000
where they were both named Paul W. Anderson.

1133
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,300
Oh, he did... of course, yeah, he did...

1134
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,800
I knew I was forgetting the big ones.

1135
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,600
He did AVP and he did Mortal Kombat.

1136
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,300
Oh, shit.

1137
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Yeah, those are the ones that I couldn't think of.

1138
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,400
The new Mortal Kombat or the old one?

1139
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,000
The old one.

1140
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,800
Okay, sick.

1141
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I watched that when I was a kid and I played army men.

1142
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Yeah.

1143
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Yeah.

1144
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Yeah.

1145
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Yeah.

1146
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
And I ate my lunch that day too.

1147
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Out of my lunch box.

1148
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
So any other questions about my life?

1149
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Nope.

1150
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Not a single one.

1151
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,400
I think, do you ever think about like how many people write memoirs and you're like,

1152
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,320
man, if I wrote a memoir, that'd be probably the worst book ever written.

1153
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,520
I honestly, I feel like we're on a crazy wavelength because I genuinely have had the thought a

1154
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,280
a few times in the like like probably three to four times in the past month or so of like

1155
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,720
it is so funny who writes memoirs and what they call them. I've met people our age who

1156
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,920
are like I'm working on a memoir. It's like is this a high school? A memoir? A diary of

1157
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,580
a wimpy kid? Is that your fucking memoir? Memoirs are straight up. That's good. That's

1158
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,120
right. That's right. That's good. A memoir is straight up money laundering I think. It

1159
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:48,040
has to be. Who fucking cares? Every politician has like a memoir every two years. Yeah exactly

1160
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,920
and even though, like even those the most,

1161
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,660
the like objectively those are the most famous

1162
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,720
or interesting people who could have memoirs

1163
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,000
and nobody reads those.

1164
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,840
- Yeah.

1165
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,660
- Like what, yeah.

1166
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,760
- You think anyone's read Pete Buttigieg's?

1167
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,600
You think anyone's read Chastin's?

1168
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,420
- I have a few times.

1169
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,260
- And they're all, it's always the picture of them

1170
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,020
looking right into the thing

1171
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,680
and it's called Bravely Trying.

1172
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,520
- Yeah, yeah.

1173
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,720
- Bravely Trying, my fucking weird life

1174
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,840
summed up in 120 pages. - The only ones

1175
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,840
that are worse than politician ones or actor ones.

1176
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,640
- Can you imagine? - Oh, it depends.

1177
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,880
No, it's bad.

1178
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,000
Tell me who's good.

1179
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,360
It's fucking...

1180
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,720
I like "Born Standing Up," the Steve Martin one.

1181
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,560
That one's good.

1182
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,640
All right, I don't have to tell you one then.

1183
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
You tell me an actor.

1184
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,480
That's a comedian and a magician.

1185
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,640
I just, I'm against the premise of a memoir.

1186
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,480
Of a memoir.

1187
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,320
Of a memoir.

1188
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,280
I don't care.

1189
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,960
Well, I'd read yours though.

1190
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,800
Really?

1191
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,040
Yeah, let's write a memoir.

1192
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,520
What was the first page of your memoir?

1193
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,360
What is it saying, Pat?

1194
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,280
I was born fucked up and trying to kill myself.

1195
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,800
Wow. Continue.

1196
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,240
Because of all the shit.

1197
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,480
Okay.

1198
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,880
And then I turned 13.

1199
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
When then what happened?

1200
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,000
And then my life got pretty much normal after that.

1201
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,720
I have a really good first line from my memoir.

1202
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,560
This first line, you open it, first page,

1203
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,880
first line, first sentence.

1204
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,040
And then everything changed.

1205
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,200
Oh, oh shit.

1206
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,920
I thought you were just going, and then.

1207
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
Right, so you just kind of talked as I was talking

1208
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,120
and we're just trying to interrupt my cool line

1209
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,960
that I came up with.

1210
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,800
- No.

1211
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,480
- I said and then and you said it in the middle,

1212
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,420
you said that's perfect in the middle of me saying then,

1213
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,260
so it's almost like--

1214
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,480
- Why is there so much static between you two?

1215
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,920
- I can't get over his cop, he's a copier.

1216
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,220
- Can you squash this cop,

1217
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,920
will you let him copy your memoir at least?

1218
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,760
- Okay.

1219
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,580
- Can I copy your memoir?

1220
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,420
- You can copy my memoir.

1221
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,260
- Okay.

1222
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,440
- But you have to change one thing.

1223
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,000
- Okay, I'll change all the names to Cameron.

1224
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,480
- Yeah, change all the names to Cameron.

1225
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,640
- But none of the other names.

1226
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,720
- No, all the other names can stay the same.

1227
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,520
- I'll change every name to Cameron,

1228
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,220
Even other people's names, even, yeah.

1229
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,160
- I think the first line of my memoir would be,

1230
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,400
I fucking loved being born.

1231
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,380
Being slid out of my slimy mom was one of the best feelings

1232
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,760
I've had thus far in my short life.

1233
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,900
And then I was thrust into the arms of my father,

1234
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,600
that fucking piece of shit.

1235
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,960
And he held me tight, and then I realized

1236
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm okay with him too.

1237
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,200
And then the rest of my life was pretty up and down

1238
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,040
in certain different parts.

1239
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,960
- The rest of my life was smooth sailing.

1240
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,720
The rest of my life was not interesting.

1241
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,960
- I fucking loved going--

1242
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,840
Every single chapter starts with whatever it's about.

1243
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,000
I fucking loved third grade.

1244
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,520
I loved eating my lunch

1245
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,720
and playing with my different recess friends.

1246
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,800
- Every chapter also has to end with,

1247
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,720
but little did I know.

1248
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,860
- But little did I know.

1249
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,560
I fucking loved fourth grade.

1250
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,760
- But little did I know something big was on its way.

1251
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,260
- I read-- - Or something like that.

1252
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,080
- I read Tony Hawk's memoir when I was 10.

1253
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,960
But it was the kids version.

1254
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,000
- They should make memoirs about companies.

1255
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,760
'Cause I'd like to read Sony's memoir.

1256
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,500
- And I'd like to read Apple's memoir.

1257
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,340
- You know whose memoir--

1258
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,160
- Not some job, Nintendo.

1259
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,360
- You know whose memoir I was forced to read

1260
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,400
for my internship was with Bob Iger.

1261
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,240
Is it Bob Iger, the Disney guy?

1262
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,380
- Yeah, that was Bon Iver.

1263
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,360
- And there's a whole part in his memoir--

1264
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,200
- There's a hole in his head.

1265
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,600
- Where there was a kid who got eaten by an alligator

1266
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,760
at one of the Disney parks. - I remember that.

1267
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,480
- Yeah, and there's like a whole chapter

1268
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,520
devoted to him being like, how could I let this happen?

1269
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,600
I was shattered, I couldn't believe this.

1270
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,760
And then they have, in the middle,

1271
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,280
they have, you know, like in books

1272
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,440
that you get from the school library

1273
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,520
and they have pictures on the like

1274
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,840
different type of paper in the middle.

1275
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,000
There was right at the end of that chapter,

1276
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,160
there was pictures of him sitting in this like

1277
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,840
huge fucking like ornate room on this like ornate bench

1278
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,920
and just like doing like a clear photo op

1279
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,240
of like his head and his hand.

1280
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,080
- Oh my God.

1281
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,520
- And it's like Bob Iger after he received the news

1282
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,480
of the child being eaten by the alligator.

1283
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,520
- Jesus.

1284
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,880
- And then the rest of it after that was like,

1285
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,240
and then I made fucking money

1286
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,080
and we kept making fucking crazy money.

1287
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,280
- And then we kept long rolling.

1288
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,680
- And then we fucking bought Fox

1289
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,040
- And it was fucking insane.

1290
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,460
- Yeah, and then we made alligator adventure.

1291
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,520
(laughing)

1292
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
- That's so cool.

1293
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,200
- You know where that's never happened

1294
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,040
is fucking alligator adventure.

1295
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,860
- That's right.

1296
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,800
- Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

1297
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,640
- Shout out, Myrtle Beach.

1298
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,840
- Buddy, there's a whole lot more alligators

1299
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,300
and a whole lot more tasty little kitties walking around.

1300
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,320
- Tasty little kitties, huh?

1301
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,160
- Yeah, yeah.

1302
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,000
- Children?

1303
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,820
- I'm not sure you can--

1304
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,560
- Well, they're looking for an alligator.

1305
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,480
They'd eat that kid.

1306
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,400
- Okay, okay.

1307
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,800
I thought you were about to say

1308
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,900
they were looking like a snack.

1309
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,740
I thought that was the words--

1310
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,120
- To an alligator, most likely.

1311
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,580
Dude, what are you doing?

1312
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,080
What?

1313
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,400
What are you doing?

1314
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,560
An alligator, a cartoon alligator would say,

1315
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,740
oh, those tasty little kitties running around this adventure

1316
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,760
park.

1317
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,960
You can make a cartoon alligator say whatever--

1318
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,880
I feel like the cartoon alligator was implied

1319
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,840
when I started talking.

1320
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,320
You could make a cartoon alligator

1321
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,640
say whatever you want it to say.

1322
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,280
Yeah, and I'm--

1323
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,200
You could make it talk about its anxiety, its depression,

1324
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,080
but you immediately made it a pedophile.

1325
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,880
We're talking about how tasty the kids are.

1326
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,240
But because he ate a kid at the Disney park,

1327
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
You fucking assholes.

1328
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
You guys fucking stupid.

1329
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,240
Ohhhh.

1330
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,240
Yeah, did you not, did you not miss, did you miss that connection?

1331
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Yeah.

1332
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,960
If you, if I talked like that, you would have no choice but to fucking be my friend.

1333
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,800
Cause you'd feel bad for me.

1334
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,840
If I sounded like that.

1335
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,240
Isn't that true?

1336
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,320
Me and Pierce were laughing so hard last night, just do it, just, yeah, I would have loved

1337
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
to hear that.

1338
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,760
Thinking of the most annoying guy ever who just, just the guy who's always like, see,

1339
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,980
- C, look, C, like when something they talked about

1340
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,240
like a week ago happens, and then be like,

1341
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,780
C, oh, oh, C, right?

1342
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,620
- Pat does that. - That's me.

1343
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,440
- Pat does that.

1344
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,720
(laughing)

1345
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,560
- Yeah.

1346
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,500
- We were just talking about him doing that a second ago.

1347
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,540
- Oh, we were. - Before we recorded, yeah.

1348
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,460
We were. - No, we weren't.

1349
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,620
- So now we know that you were secretly

1350
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,940
behind Patrick's back.

1351
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,780
- Well, it was specifically--

1352
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,380
- You were making fun of him saying C.

1353
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,020
- The funny part was specifically the hand and voice,

1354
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,340
which I don't think you do.

1355
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,180
And it's specifically the word C, I think.

1356
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,900
- You think he has no hands and no voice?

1357
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,900
No, that makes no fucking sense.

1358
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,900
Why are you trying to create beef right now?

1359
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,900
You're trying to create beef where there ain't none.

1360
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Morningstar. Shut up.

1361
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
Shut the fuck up. He got it in.

1362
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
Shut the fuck up. He got the line in the show.

1363
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
That's right. I knew it. I saw that coming from a mile away.

1364
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,900
Have I not said it in the show before?

1365
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,900
You've never said it on the show. I saw that coming from a mile away.

1366
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,900
It's so good. That's gonna be the 50th time you've said that.

1367
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Saw it coming from a mile away. Bug.

1368
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,900
(laughter)

1369
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,900
We need to go back to doing punchlines, man.

1370
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,900
(laughter)

1371
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,160
(laughing)

1372
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,300
- Coming from a mile away, bug.

1373
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,540
(laughing)

1374
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,120
- Makes, it's perfect.

1375
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,960
- Yeah, it's perfect.

1376
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,800
- That's a perfect line.

1377
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,640
- Oh, just anything with the punchline being bug.

1378
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,480
- Yeah.

1379
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,240
- That is so, like, even something that made sense.

1380
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,600
That would be so funny.

1381
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,280
- I flew, then I died, bug.

1382
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,120
- Bug.

1383
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,960
(laughing)

1384
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,800
- I lived for a day.

1385
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,700
- I ate shit.

1386
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,540
- Bug.

1387
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,360
- Bug.

1388
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,040
- I took a shit on your food, bug.

1389
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,040
- Yeah, well it's like, now I wouldn't say this,

1390
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,040
but if I was doing a diss track on Patrick,

1391
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,880
I'd be like--

1392
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,000
- See, you're creating a beef where there is some--

1393
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,200
- No, I said I wouldn't say this.

1394
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,540
- Hamburgers, patty.

1395
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,460
Yeah, that's right.

1396
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,520
(laughing)

1397
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,920
- I could be like, Patrick is biting me, bug.

1398
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,640
'Cause he's like biting my style,

1399
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,220
was what a rapper might say.

1400
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,240
But I wouldn't say that, I would say

1401
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,980
Patrick is my friend, love.

1402
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,680
- Love bug.

1403
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,500
- Love bug.

1404
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,420
- My love bug.

1405
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,720
- Patrick is my love bug.

1406
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,960
(laughing)

1407
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,360
- Patrick is my love bug.

1408
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,480
bug. It's just starting a new sentence. It was love bug. Love bug was Herbie. Herbie the love bug.

1409
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,840
Did he fuck Lindsay Lohan? No. Well it was like the love, it was called a love bug back in like

1410
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:18,040
the 80s or the 60s. To get rid of the Nazi stuff? Get rid of the Nazi stuff and I think it's because

1411
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,920
people would have, it's probably the easiest car to have sex in. Pretty genius way to get rid of

1412
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,040
the Nazi stuff. Think about it, that's probably the easiest car to have sex in actually because

1413
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,720
It has a elevated roof.

1414
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Hummer.

1415
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,720
Oh, yeah.

1416
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
Hummer, huge.

1417
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
Yeah, Humper.

1418
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,720
Yeah.

1419
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Yeah.

1420
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
You can call it the Humper.

1421
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,720
Humper.

1422
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,720
Humper H2.

1423
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,720
My buddy's dad had one of those and he died.

1424
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
Yeah?

1425
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,720
Yes.

1426
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,720
Not in the Humper.

1427
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,720
In the car?

1428
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,720
I don't know.

1429
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
He got shot.

1430
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
By the car?

1431
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
No.

1432
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
There is a machine gun mounted.

1433
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Oh, yeah.

1434
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,720
He had a military Hummer.

1435
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,720
He was playing with it.

1436
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,720
He thought it was a telescope.

1437
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,720
He wanted to look at the night sky.

1438
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Blew his head off.

1439
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,720
- As soon as Iraq started, the Iraq war started popping off,

1440
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,780
they were like, we should just sell

1441
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,780
all the military vehicles to people.

1442
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,480
- Yeah, yeah.

1443
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,180
- Yeah, it's also funny too that like--

1444
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,860
- And put all of these new stuff on it.

1445
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,420
- Yeah, as soon as like that war started popping off

1446
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,760
on Cybertron, the Autobots were just like,

1447
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,700
we're peacing out, we don't even care about the AllSpark.

1448
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,660
- Yeah. - We're going to Earth.

1449
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,500
- Yeah, we're going to Earth.

1450
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,580
- We're gonna become Hummers.

1451
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,420
- Yeah, yeah.

1452
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,920
- To get inside of the mind of an alien species,

1453
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,820
invading would be something else.

1454
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,660
- Yeah.

1455
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,820
- You know what else I was just thinking about?

1456
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,240
I mentioned that guy dying.

1457
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,260
I knew a kid, or didn't know a kid,

1458
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,100
I knew his parents,

1459
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,380
who they had an elevator in their house, right?

1460
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,220
- Whoa.

1461
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,460
- And he got decapitated by it.

1462
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,300
- Whoa.

1463
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,140
- Oh, you've told this before.

1464
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,980
- I'm so scared of that.

1465
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,820
- Isn't that so scary?

1466
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:40,640
- You've told that before, 'cause I know.

1467
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,660
- I get scared of elevators every time I'm on them.

1468
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,140
- Actually, I don't know if he got decapitated,

1469
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,140
but I know that he got stuck in it and it killed him.

1470
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,980
But I'd like to think--

1471
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,820
- That was in final destination.

1472
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,940
I'd like to think he got decapitated and his head flew off.

1473
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,940
Well that's the number one.

1474
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,260
And his head flew off into his mom's arms and she looked at it and went "Ahhhhhh!"

1475
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,780
And then it went "Hey mom, I'm okay."

1476
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,980
"Hey mom, wait, mom, I think I have a bug bite."

1477
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,980
Bug.

1478
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,980
Bug.

1479
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,980
Bug.

1480
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,980
I think I got bitten.

1481
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Bug.

1482
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,980
I know you told me that story before.

1483
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
Yeah I definitely have.

1484
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Yeah I definitely have.

1485
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,980
Because I...

1486
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,980
It just went back into my head.

1487
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,780
Every time you mention it I'm like, "Oh yeah, my cousin had an elevator button in his closet

1488
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,780
Really? My cousin James growing up had a... his dad was an elevator repairman.

1489
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,780
Wait a second, was your cousin a fucking code name kid next door spy?

1490
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:33,780
No, his dad just installed the elevator buttons on his door and we all thought that that was the coolest shit ever.

1491
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,780
When I was a kid it was very cool.

1492
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,780
And then I was like, okay, so when we press that, your closet's gonna go up and down?

1493
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,780
And he's like, no, it's just the panel.

1494
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,780
I remember when we moved at a cellar house when I was growing up,

1495
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,420
I was grown up I was like I was honestly the one thing I was mad about I was like

1496
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,620
But I was gonna basically build a fucking layer

1497
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:58,860
Underneath the house and have a trunk that I click on and it may puts me into a giant tube and shoots me into it

1498
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:04,240
But okay, I guess you guys got to get divorced. Yeah. Yeah, it's annoying as fuck. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah

1499
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,240
Yeah, I don't my layer player. Yeah, my layer was like kind of small and shitty

1500
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,420
Yeah, do you ever know anybody with a fire ass treehouse something insane? Yeah, actually

1501
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,440
Really?

1502
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Yeah, they had a zip line.

1503
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:14,940
What?

1504
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,440
Yeah.

1505
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:15,940
Damn.

1506
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,440
Crazy, right?

1507
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:16,940
What?

1508
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,440
OK.

1509
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,820
It's like a zip line from the--

1510
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,560
They live in camp?

1511
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,360
--from the tree house.

1512
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,480
No, just from the tree house down to the ground.

1513
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,640
We didn't have a tree house.

1514
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,480
To the ground house?

1515
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,120
Somebody did drill a piece of wood onto a tree

1516
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,440
and put a ladder on it.

1517
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,480
That's a tree house, man.

1518
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,040
The people--

1519
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,400
All right, that's a tree house.

1520
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,280
We have a tree house.

1521
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,800
The family that lived behind my mom's old house,

1522
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,480
during COVID, they built an insane tree house.

1523
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Yeah, like giant. I would love to do that. It's so crazy. Like it was so loud all the time because they had the construction guys

1524
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,080
Building this like huge thing that construction guys bill. It was it was crazy. It was a hired people. I think so

1525
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,040
I mean, I don't I don't really I don't know that family

1526
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,200
Yeah, it could have been maybe their friends or something, but it wasn't them

1527
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,600
And the kids never use it. Oh, it's so funny. I always

1528
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,360
Once it's done you're like, yeah. Yeah, they exactly it is. It's so funny

1529
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,680
It's like buying a toy for a cat where they were in there for one week after they built it and then never again.

1530
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,880
Have I told this before? I went to this...

1531
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,880
I was hanging out with these kids that I don't usually hang out with.

1532
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,180
And then they were like, "Yeah, we're gonna go smoke."

1533
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,380
I was like, "14, we're gonna go smoke weed in this tree house."

1534
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:35,780
By the way, it's like a 20-minute walk away from my house, and it's my friend's old house that got foreclosed on.

1535
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,480
Whoa.

1536
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,480
So nobody lives there.

1537
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,680
Your friend lived in a tree?

1538
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,400
Their friend lived in this house,

1539
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,880
they got foreclosed on, and then they had this big,

1540
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,440
it was like they took a tough shed

1541
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,920
and just built a tree around it.

1542
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,760
That's cool.

1543
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,280
They built a tree around it?

1544
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,640
Or they built the, they put the, you know what I mean.

1545
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,740
They built it around the tree.

1546
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,580
And then,

1547
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:00,840
one of those kids holds up his phone

1548
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,520
'cause he's like, "Dude, we should do the circle

1549
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,960
"from That '70s Show."

1550
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,800
Oh, that's genius.

1551
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,600
And then he tried to film us

1552
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,280
having a Mad 70s show conversation.

1553
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,120
- What do you think they're talking about

1554
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,160
in that circle, man?

1555
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,240
- What he was talking about in this circle was--

1556
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,520
♪ Down the street ♪

1557
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,360
- You know what the craziest part about this story

1558
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,760
is both of those kids were named Corey and Trevor.

1559
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,600
- No.

1560
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,240
- Wait, you had four people there?

1561
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,080
- There was two kids.

1562
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,240
- Two Corys, two Trevors?

1563
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,000
- No, no, no, there was two kids

1564
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,360
and they were named Corey and Trevor.

1565
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,200
And I've told someone that story before.

1566
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,800
- That's some of my favorite jokes in Trailer Park Boys

1567
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,880
was Corey and Corey and Trevor and Trevor.

1568
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,240
I don't know what Trailer Park Boys is.

1569
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,840
- He doesn't know. - That's Corey and Trevor.

1570
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,360
Where Corey and Trevor is from.

1571
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,200
- Oh. - I don't know.

1572
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,240
- It's characters, I only watched like three episodes

1573
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,480
of that show. - Yeah.

1574
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,360
- I think one of the guys-- - This show's a bit

1575
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,840
too poverty stricken for someone.

1576
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,040
- One of the-- (laughing)

1577
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,560
- Hmm. - I'll stick to--

1578
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,080
- I'll stick to-- - I'll stick to billions.

1579
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,680
- I'll stick to House Boys.

1580
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,680
- I don't know who, which one of 'em it is,

1581
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,960
but one of the actors who plays Corey or Trevor

1582
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,080
is named Michael Jackson.

1583
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,720
- Whoa.

1584
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,300
And it's just somebody who recently told me that a dog trainer named Michael Jackson.

1585
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,320
Really? Yeah.

1586
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,280
At a certain point, there's like some names that I think you just can't.

1587
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,240
That has to. Yeah.

1588
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,160
Michael Jackson is definitely one of them.

1589
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,440
I was. You know what I thought of?

1590
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,000
I always am trying to think of names like you can't use.

1591
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,680
I mean, you kind of can make a Jordan.

1592
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,400
You kind of can be named Jesus, but not really Jesus Christ.

1593
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,920
Can't be named Adolf Hitler, obviously.

1594
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,240
Yeah, I always am trying to think of these.

1595
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,360
And I thought of a really good one the other day to add to the list of names.

1596
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,400
You cannot give your child anymore because a famous person ruined it.

1597
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,640
What is it? Quasimodo.

1598
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
Yeah, that's pretty much over.

1599
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,380
Yeah.

1600
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,880
Yeah, I think that that's a pretty good life goal for anyone to have, is like,

1601
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,880
"I want to make sure that my name is fucking ruined."

1602
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,380
"No one else can have this name."

1603
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,380
Yeah, whether good, whether I did too much good or too much bad,

1604
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,380
I want to make sure that nobody ever can have this name again and have a normal life.

1605
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:50,880
Yeah.

1606
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,880
Michael Jackson is a specific--

1607
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,880
Pinocchio.

1608
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,380
I know somebody--

1609
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:53,880
That's another one.

1610
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,880
I know somebody named Richard Simmons.

1611
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,380
Really?

1612
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,880
Yeah.

1613
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,380
That's--

1614
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:57,880
See, that one, too--

1615
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
Doesn't go by that, though.

1616
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,380
That one, too, you can't even--

1617
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:00,880
Doesn't go by that.

1618
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,380
Yeah.

1619
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:07,660
But that is he tell every meets people they go by like your middle name. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'd Richard Simmons

1620
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,420
He's the he's the man

'Cause I don't wanna see,

1641

1642
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,860
Meanwhile, there's also this, there's this fuck--

1643
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,500
Meanwhile in normalville,

1644

I'll put my money in a bank, please.

1645
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,340
Meanwhile, there's this fucking asshole too,

1646
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,680
who is basically like,

1647
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,220
you need to wear 30 or 40 pieces of flair on your outfit.

1648
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,060
I'm like, what the fuck does that mean?

1649
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,220
Do you realize this isn't even a real restaurant?

1650
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,060
Yeah.

1651
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,060
You realize this is a set, you asshole?

1652
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,220
And you're Mike Judge.

1653
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,060
Yeah.

1654
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:15,900
This doesn't make any damn sense.

1655
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,740
You don't work at a restaurant.

1656
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:20,740
You're a millionaire. You made Beavis and Butt-head. Yeah, why are you talking like this asshole?

1657
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,740
You're acting like a Butt-head, pal. You're acting like a Beavis.

1658
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,740
You're acting like a Beavis. That's another name that's been ruined.

1659
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:32,740
Beavis and Butt-head. You can't even name your kid Beavis anymore. You can do Butt-head but not Beavis.

1660
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,740
Sullivan the Frog is over. You can't name your kid that anymore.

1661
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,740
Elmer Fudd. Fudd is done. Elmer's okay.

1662
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,740
But you could be a glue cow or a Fudd as an Elmer.

1663
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:50,780
Yeah, I guess it's a glue cow. Don't bother me. A glue cow. A glue cow. Oh my god, if you could milk me for glue.

1664
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:56,780
I milk every farm animal. Is that implied by the Elmer that they milk that cow and they give the glue?

1665
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,780
Yeah, that's what I always thought the implication was, but I didn't realize it's because it's made out of farm, glue is made out of farm animals.

1666
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:06,780
Where the hell does the super glue come from?

1667
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:11,780
That comes from a chemical plant. That's not even horse stuff.

1668
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,780
Let's see, what do we have? Pretty fun stuff coming up this week.

1669
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,780
Oh, did you guys see that fucking giant fucking green laser?

1670
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,780
Borealis, what's that thing called?

1671
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,780
The auroral?

1672
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,780
The auroral Borealis.

1673
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,780
Northern Lights?

1674
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,780
Yeah, I saw something like that, some kind of fucking giant green,

1675
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,780
blue shit flying on the street the other day. Did you see that?

1676
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,780
I did see that. I didn't see it in the photo.

1677
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:40,780
I saw a picture of it. It was like a green flare almost with a little line.

1678
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:46,580
weird shit. I saw the photo I did. I was asleep. Yeah. It's been a weird couple

1679
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,660
days here. There's like, I mean, people are just been acting weird.

1680
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,860
Something's up. A guy was throwing up a computer chip the other day on the

1681
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:58,260
street. A computer chip? Yeah, like one of these. Like just a weird little like

1682
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,620
thing. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's like a green. He choked it up. Right.

1683
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,620
A green chip? Yeah, and he had some slime in his mouth as well. Anyway, I saw, I actually,

1684
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,140
where was that? Was that, because I feel like in the same area I might have seen,

1685
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,780
I did see something weird. I saw a guy with green eyes.

1686
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,140
Green eyes? Not like colored contacts?

1687
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:17,940
No, yeah.

1688
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,260
Green eyes, like the wave song?

1689
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,860
Yeah, I think it was the wave song he was doing a reference to.

1690
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,300
See, all of this stuff, I was asleep through it.

1691
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,020
You were asleep?

1692
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,780
You were asleep.

1693
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,380
Uh-huh.

1694
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,260
Did you...

1695
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:29,780
Oh.

1696
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,220
Okay.

1697
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,020
So I missed out on a lot of that, but I did have a dream.

1698
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,100
What was your dream?

1699
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Just dark room, low rumbling.

1700
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,100
Mm-hmm.

1701
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,780
and then an explosion.

1702
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,780
Oh, shit.

1703
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,540
That I--

1704
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,460
I had that dream, too.

1705
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,740
I did also have that dream.

1706
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,240
Really?

1707
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,540
And I also-- I was doing--

1708
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,620
I mean, it's Halloween and getting in the mood.

1709
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,780
I was doing some tarot cards, and I did

1710
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,740
flip over the explosion card.

1711
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,420
Oh, shit.

1712
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:53,900
All right.

1713
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,700
Well, probably everything's going to be OK.

1714
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,200
Yeah.

1715
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,180
Come to the Halloween show.

1716
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:58,680
Yeah.

1717
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,740
Oh, and we're due--

1718
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,380
Oh, we're about to film prank--

1719
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,420
Yeah, Juby goes in town.

1720
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:03,780
--and since Juby goes in town, we're

1721
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,020
going to film prank guests, too.

1722
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,260
We have some funny shit coming out,

1723
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,980
and it's going to come out on November 1.

1724
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,500
November 1.

1725
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,500
Day after Halloween, PrankS2, go to the YouTube channel.

1726
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,660
YouTube channel, youtube.com/podcastaboutlists.

1727
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,820
Yeah, subscribe.

1728
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,060
You gotta watch that video.

1729
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,580
It's gonna be really, really good.

1730
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,140
PrankS2, coming soon.

1731
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,500
We have a plan, I think we're gonna do something

1732
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,660
with like a church or something,

1733
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:23,980
ask the guy to pray for it.

1734
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,820
It might be pretty funny.

1735
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:25,940
Yeah, priest of paper.

1736
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,620
Yeah, priest of paper.

1737
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,460
Priest of paper.

1738
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,620
Pray, pray, pray.

1739
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,180
Could you pray for this paper?

1740
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,000
Pray for you.

1741
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,180
Yeah, so that's a little spoiler,

1742
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,220
but it's gonna be very funny.

1743
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,540
That's it, that'll be the first bit.

1744
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,380
See, there's a lot more.

1745
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,980
And come to the Halloween show the day before.

1746
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,420
And yeah, we're pretty excited to see you guys

1747
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,340
and see what kind of slutty outfits you wear.

1748
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:43,840
Yep.

1749
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,340
All right.

1750
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,880
Bye.
