1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
now and now I'm hitting play.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,440
Well, on that pitch, let's go.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:14,320
Where's the beer?

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,000
You're listening to beers we drink.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,520
America's next to the one to get going.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
That mobile lost the wheel and the joker got away.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Just like that.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Ha!

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Foo!

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Ribbit!

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Beer's we drank, motherfucker.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
With Juvio, Caleb, and Rex.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Beer.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Beer.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Oh my god, Caleb.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Okay.

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Wait, wait, I'm gonna open, man.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Oh shit.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Wait, am I ready?

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Shit.

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Here I go.

24
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
I have a hearty one today.

25
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
I got a bottle one today.

26
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Crazy one?

27
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
So I'd like to go last.

28
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
I eat a lot.

29
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I eat a lot.

30
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I eat a lot.

31
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I eat a lot.

32
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
I eat a lot.

33
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
I eat a lot.

34
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,000
the last. I easily have the craziest setup here.

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All right. I can go first.

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, I'm going first. I have a classic, a normal-sized Coors Banquet. I've been shrunk. This is a

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,200
12-ounce can. Let me take a sip.

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
You've been shrunk? You kind of glossed over the shrinking part, which I think is the most

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,200
interesting part of what you said.

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,720
What shrunk you, man?

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,080
The kids.

42
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,000
The kids shrunk you?

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Honey the kids shrunk me.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, honey the kids shrunk me.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Wait, go with your review. I want to say something.

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why don't you say your review.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hold on, let me take another sip.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ok, well I'll submit things.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I love that.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Really?

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, I have a Cordyce Banquet. It's delicious.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's awesome.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's a solid 7 out of 10.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I can drink this entire 12 ounce can.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,720
Before the show even started, people said that Kurzweil was like the best beer, like the yummiest

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,680
beer, but I've never had it myself, so I really don't. It's good. I will say it does taste better

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,480
out of the glass, the stubby bottles, for some reason. The small mouth on it, it's good. But not

58
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:20,280
this small can. Yeah, not that normal size can. Okay, Julio, show me what you have, man. I have

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,600
a local brewed beer a local brewed beer its name its name is ray which stands for king

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,440
and you can see right there in the background there's the uh that's the mountain the the

61
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,240
classic mountain of my hometown the one oh wow it kind of looks like an inverted crown

62
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,520
i'm sure that this is what they were going for yeah that's probably what they were going for

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:03:04,280
for

64
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
- You're-- - Oh.

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,780
- You don't like it?

66
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,340
- I dropped the-- - It's crazy.

67
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,480
- So, okay, so it says here that it's like,

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,860
it says it's a number two London beer at the bottom.

69
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,720
And right here, like the ingredients,

70
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,720
it says like it's using some English stuff on it.

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,060
And I thought, I forgot which one,

72
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,460
who did the light beers,

73
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,880
and I guess it was not the Englishman.

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,880
So anyways, this is a number two beer for number poop.

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,880
and I don't like it.

76
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Yeah.

77
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Wait, should I say the score?

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Yeah, I said the 7 out of 10.

79
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Oh, ok. Alright.

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
But that's like a 10 out of 10 for a light beer.

81
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Read it and weep.

82
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
I mean, it's...

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
It tastes literally like water.

84
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,680
really like water.

85
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,600
You need the stubby little bottle, man.

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,360
Guys, I have today an acai, okay?

87
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,880
But wait a second, I also have next to me, not just the beer, some leachy soju.

88
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,600
Guys, I saw a video where somebody made a soju bomb, and so that's kind of what I'm

89
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
going to do.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:28,420
going to pour this acai up to about three quarters of the way full into my glass and then I'm

91
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:35,480
going to take this leachy soju, pour that in there as well to kind of top it up.

92
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,800
And now guys, here's the trick.

93
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,720
In Korea, they don't stir things like we do on the West Coast.

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,040
They stir things by doing this with a spoon.

95
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to demonstrate right now.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Dude, I'm so pissed. I was about to get a soju bottle as well.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, you need a special spoon for that.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No you don't, you need a normal spoon, bitch.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, you need the different spoon. You need the one with the twirls on it.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh!

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, Korea, you've done it again!

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is amazing!

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh my god, not a mistake.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's got a hype train off of that.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This has, they better be hyping this shit up.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,640
This is amazing guys. I got soju all over my mouse pad.

107
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,040
This is the best thing I've ever had. I'm gonna give this...

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
*burp*

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Mmm. Oh that's delightful. It tastes like champagne.

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
I'm gonna give this...

111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
an 8-2.

112
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Wow.

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm going high on this. I'm feeling high on this shit.

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm feeling high. I'm gonna go 8-2.

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
You were really pumped about this.

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
this.

117
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
This is amazing.

118
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,240
But Caleb, before we even started recording, before even Rex showed up, he just said, he

119
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,400
told me that he had a crazy...

120
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,880
Well he had already told me hours ago.

121
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
But he told me beforehand.

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
He told me yesterday actually.

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Lie.

124
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,200
And guys, I'm gonna go, you know what height I'm gonna go on this?

125
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Five foot nine.

126
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Now ask me why.

127
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
What's the best height?

128
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Ask me why.

129
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
What's the best height?

130
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Why?

131
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,280
Because guys, that's Faker's height.

132
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,680
This one is for Faker.

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,040
He's a Korean ath- is there a Korean basketball player?

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,760
What the fuck do you think, man?

135
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Yes.

136
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
No.

137
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
No.

138
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,160
There's a couple Chinese ones.

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,960
There's Jeremy Lin, there's Yao Ming.

140
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,200
China is not Korean, man.

141
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
That's true.

142
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
In a lot of different ways.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I know that.

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,680
You don't- it seems like we're educating you right now and you're ignorant, man.

145
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Straight up.

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
I hate saying that about my friends.

147
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
You seem ignorant AF.

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,160
You are both small and you look like John Lennon and you don't know about China and Korea.

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
So we're going to educate you on a couple of things.

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
You have an air of ignorance and an air of being an ignoramus even.

151
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Yeah, and you're small.

152
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
You're small and I could crush you and crunch you in one single step.

153
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Poop on Rex Day, I guess. This is just how it's starting today.

154
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,160
You know what? It wasn't until right now, it is officially Poop on Rex Day.

155
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Guys, mark your calendars. December 8th, every single year, this is Poop on Rex Day.

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,320
is mad at me because he's been getting into tribes of sin and I've been very

157
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,200
ever so slightly oh yeah tribes 3 ever so slightly making fun of him for being bad

158
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,880
at video games and it's really really hurting his feelings which is okay of

159
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,240
course it's a complete I mean it's a it's a kick in the nose so much so much

160
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,800
so much so that he what while he was working he made an entire montage of him

161
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,840
playing tribes and he sent it to me. I didn't make the montage while I was working I played

162
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,160
the games while I was working. And then you made the montage. While you were working. He

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,240
made a montage in one day and we watch the montage and guys he misses a lot of the shots

164
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,760
and it's a lot of kind of jumping around in the walls, bad movement. Okay so the way this

165
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,000
went down is he sent this shit to me on prompted on I didn't even say anything about tribes

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,840
last night. So he just sends me the tribes video. I was like, hang on, let me, let me

167
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,240
just speak. All right. Just, you know, trying to speak. Let me speak. Uh, he sends this

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,680
to me on prompted and I was like, okay, I'll watch my friend's clip that he sent me on this

169
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,120
game that I don't understand. And I start watching and he's, I noticed that this play

170
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
is going for a little bit and he's, you know, he's up to like a high amount of kills. Probably

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm like hmm this clips are long let me check the let me say how long it is and

172
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,360
that I look at the how long it was it was three minutes I was like dude I'm gonna

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,780
skip around I'm not gonna watch this entire thing and I I don't understand

174
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,920
tribes I've never played it before you brought this up last night during the

175
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,120
game awards and Caleb responded to you so I didn't know how to how to respond so

176
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,320
I was just like you know what send this shit into P first so everyone can

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
appreciate it. And apparently it was a mistake because now Caleb hates regs.

178
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,480
I don't hate regs I just I listen more power to them you know what I mean

179
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,960
that wheelchair basketball is a real sport I think that that is as real of a

180
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,080
sport as any other sport okay so and I and these are athletes okay and I feel

181
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,080
the same way about you with your new little game. You are saying this knowing

182
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
full well that you are trying to make me upset.

183
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
And that, if it's working...

184
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,400
How could that be making you upset?

185
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,680
How is that possibly making you...

186
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm giving you...

187
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
I'm paying you a compliment.

188
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm saying despite everything, you are having a lot of fun.

189
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
And I think that's wonderful.

190
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,440
I really think that.

191
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
That's fine.

192
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,080
So Julio and I have a thing that we've been doing where I watch him play TFT and I tell

193
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,280
him everything he does wrong.

194
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,640
You're framing this incorrectly by the way. This is not a thing that you and I are doing.

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
This is a thing that you are doing and you're pissing me off and I'm just trying to play

196
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,900
the game and you're like "you're gay for doing that. Why are you placing that unit right

197
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,080
there? You're gay." I'm like "dude, shut the fuck up."

198
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,400
I do not say you're gay. I give you the exact reason.

199
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,080
That would not be constructive criticism. Yes. I give you the exact reason why what

200
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,040
you did was wrong and then you get mad at me. You go "you're so annoying."

201
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,480
You are so annoying. I turned you to zero and then the next day I joined the discord and

202
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,560
we were like "oh let's play some games with rex" and I was like "why can't I hear him?"

203
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,040
You turned him all the way to zero?

204
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Yeah I did.

205
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,560
Wow. That's ice cold man.

206
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,960
So Julio and I, you've never played DFT Caleb?

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,720
I played it one time and uh, see ok here's the difference between me and you. I will

208
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,400
not play a game that I know I can't be good at.

209
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,360
And I started playing TFT and immediately I was like, "I can't do this.

210
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm out."

211
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Yeah.

212
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Anyone can be good at TFT.

213
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,960
That's because it's a game that utilizes only your brain.

214
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
No.

215
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Anyone can be good at TFT.

216
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,800
I had it, I watched a video today where someone described it as a slot machine and it made

217
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,760
me think of, oh yeah, that's why Rex likes it so much.

218
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
It is a slot machine.

219
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
It is a little slot machine.

220
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
It is very RNG.

221
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
It's full luck.

222
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
It's full RNG.

223
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:23,760
The best part about TFT is the fact that it's not League or ARAM where you have to depend on your teammates to do good for you to win the game.

224
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,760
It's solely based on you and your own luck, which is the best thing about it.

225
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Also, the second best thing about it is the fact that you can play on the phone and it's just quick and it doesn't matter.

226
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Anyway, Julio wanted to play with me late one night and I was spending time with my boyfriend.

227
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,760
And I was like, I'll be on as soon as I finish watching this episode of TV with Mumble.

228
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
He's like, "That's fine!" I just started round 3, I got plenty to go.

229
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,760
And I just messaged him, "You will lose at round 5-3."

230
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,760
And then 20 minutes later, I get a message that just says, "Fuck you."

231
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Wow.

232
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
And just...

233
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Wait, so you are amazing at this game. You must be plat, diamond, something, some really high rank, yeah?

234
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I haven't played enough, but I'm like gold 1, which is basically one-off plat.

235
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:24,760
I mean, sounds like a really shitty rank for a game that you're supposedly so amazing at that you can tell the future.

236
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,760
No, I'm just saying I fucking swished my hater...

237
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:43,640
is

238
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
it's

239
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
a

240
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
good

241
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
thing.

242
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I'm good at it.

243
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
What are you talking about?

244
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
We both have hit diamond.

245
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
What are you talking about?

246
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Nah, you're wrong.

247
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,960
Guys, it's turning into video games that we've played, which is a great idea for a podcast,

248
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,140
but it's not the one that we do.

249
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,760
Let's get back to the beer.

250
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,160
This is so this soju bomb is going away scary fast.

251
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
That's what I'm going to say about this thing.

252
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,000
Because I just found out reading this thing and I poured probably I think I did the proportions

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
wrong.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,560
fucking bottle of soju in this shit and this soju is 12% alcohol y'all this is

255
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,520
not a normal thing to drink that's the thing about soju it sneaks up on you

256
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,080
because it's so sweet but also the only other time I've ever drank soju was with

257
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,560
this guy Joe from Philly and then John from also from Philly and we ended up

258
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,440
bringing we carry we found a stop sign on the road and we carried it like ten

259
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,440
in

260
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,840
we didn't drink soju right here

261
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,760
well it has a different name

262
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,760
i think you just misheard them saying soju

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,440
these are different man

264
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,480
i promise you

265
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,760
there's a my guess is that they're from different

266
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
countries different careers

267
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,240
you know to you

268
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,360
that's the

269
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,080
stoke to burst soju

270
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,800
showed you is a japanese spirit whereas soju is a korean spirit

271
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,000
all look who's the right one again mister smart

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,640
uh... here i am a little bit i was at the seven eleven

273
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,960
trying to pick a beer

274
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040
and they had a really wax selection

275
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,160
and I was like fuck what haven't I had yet

276
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,360
and I saw a soju bottle and I was like

277
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,360
fuck we'll just pull up with a soju bottle for a special episode

278
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,160
it's a really special day for me. That would have been truly incredible

279
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,800
if you had without us talking showed up with soju. We would have been interlinked

280
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,520
yeah that would have been amazing

281
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,720
guys let's talk game awards let's have a little bit of a game awards

282
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,080
debrief

283
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,640
I'll just leave this conversation because I've watched the entirety of the video games.

284
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Back to video games.

285
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,200
People on Twitter are complaining that the game awards were mostly about Hollywood superstars.

286
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,360
They were woke.

287
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,040
They were mostly about Hollywood superstars speaking for days while the foreigners who

288
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,720
poured their heart out on a game could just only speak for one minute.

289
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,320
And then after one minute passed on their winning speech, there's this screen that was in front

290
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,960
of the stage that in big letters would have a countdown, a one minute countdown, and then

291
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,560
on huge letters it would say "Wrap it up, get it going."

292
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
That's kind of fire though.

293
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
That is so rude.

294
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,640
That is so funny.

295
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,960
But there was a little bit of a letdown, I don't think they showed anything too exciting.

296
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,320
But Baldur's Gate 3 won Game of the Year, which I'm really excited about.

297
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,960
Spider-Man didn't win anything, which has got Twitter mad, which is really funny.

298
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:12,120
Zelda only won one thing, which I'm really happy about, because Zelda is the most boring

299
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,360
game in the world.

300
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,560
And apparently Alan Wake 2 is a really good game that I should play.

301
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,920
Yeah, I hear Alan Wake is really good.

302
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,720
Here's the thing about award shows, man.

303
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,400
They play these people off.

304
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,440
And if you ask me, and why do they do it?

305
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,780
Because they have to stick to a schedule, the show can only be three hours or whatever, right?

306
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,400
Last night we were supposed to record this podcast, but I didn't realize that the Game

307
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Awards was a real award show.

308
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,800
I thought it was maybe like a basement kind of production.

309
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,100
I thought it was like a Twitch thing.

310
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
But it's real.

311
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,560
These guys, they have like a full theater, I couldn't believe it.

312
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
It's the 10th year running of the Game Awards.

313
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
It looked like the Oscars.

314
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
It fully looked like the Oscars to me.

315
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:05,760
are

316
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,760
thing

317
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,800
as you as you'd like but they should really be like twenty four-hour thing

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,600
because nobody can

319
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,520
you measure working all year

320
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,480
on something so amazing

321
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,320
and then you get cut off thirty seconds and because they'd have to have matthew

322
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,600
mcconaughey r_f_d_ mackey come out and say something

323
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,000
you about and again where they play a uh... of a mushroom

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
or whatever these kind of had a little long

325
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,320
people who have a cover coji man

326
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,240
to appeal which i i thought

327
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,680
on but at least those guys seemed

328
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,080
of respect i mean that everybody likes those two

329
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,120
right it in that you met him a kind of a lot of these fucking nerds watching

330
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
this they've never seen a movie

331
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,920
they've never they don't know what they are not familiar with it

332
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,480
eight-mile they're not familiar with lincoln lawyer

333
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,440
they don't know who these two guys are

334
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,000
you know and now they're clear wasting their time

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,080
and they're saying i all we could have five-hour uh... interview with the uh...

336
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,660
davy reardon

337
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,500
you know that would have been better for them

338
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,240
i think the issue is that a real war two doesn't have

339
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,420
trailers for movies that come out next year

340
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,260
that is true that is such an amazing point

341
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,600
yeah you don't get that very much you'd like to know how the

342
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,500
how to the oscars work that just keep

343
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,540
Oh, they have a bunch of jokes in the middle, but then it just ends.

344
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,540
Yeah, the Oscars.

345
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:43,300
They have an actual comedian, although admittedly not usually a funny one, be a host.

346
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,460
I mean, Jimmy Kimmel.

347
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Jimmy Kimmel?

348
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Jimmy Kimmel is not that funny.

349
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,980
My favorite comedian, man.

350
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,500
You are lying.

351
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,700
And that's fine.

352
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,180
This is a podcast, you're allowed to lie, but it's fine.

353
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Kilov, you're funny.

354
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
He's not funny.

355
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,180
I'm fucked up, man.

356
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,180
Look at your face.

357
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
You look like a baby.

358
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,180
You look like a baby.

359
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,180
You're redder than normal.

360
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,180
It's the Shizuji man.

361
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,180
Dude, I love having this picture of us under my monitor.

362
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,180
Because Kelo's face is so small and so red.

363
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
I'm so red in that photo.

364
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,180
It's like the sickest I've ever been.

365
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:26,180
And I'm just like, at Margaritaville, twisted off of two completely translucent...

366
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
Oh my god.

367
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,540
I translucent. Neon drinks. I had a blue drink and an orange drink.

368
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,660
And I was fucked. I was so fucked up in that photo.

369
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,940
And then I went and had an amazing meal.

370
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,420
It is true. We need... there needs to be a

371
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,300
happy medium between like all you can eat and really good food

372
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,340
that's not a million dollars. Dude, oh my god.

373
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,380
I have three things to say to you.

374
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,740
Which is

375
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,900
Fogo de chow. Yes, we need to do that is literally what exactly what you described

376
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,840
Why didn't we go to focus show by the way? I'm so sad. I

377
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,660
Went with Patrick a couple weeks ago, man. I

378
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,260
Was the town and you didn't take me

379
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,900
Fuck you

380
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,460
That's why you've already been you think I'm gonna take your bitch-ass again. I want to go again. Honestly. Yes come to New York

381
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,320
Let me take all of us to Pogo de Chow. We'll do a live

382
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
Three hours

383
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,380
Kanye we ate can we tell you try to book that that one big?

384
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,060
Yes, Oh the conference room conference room that all those Japanese men were having a a big lunch

385
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,100
that was amazing when we went there was a full luncheon of of

386
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,820
Japanese businessmen and they had like people there who were like Trent like really beautiful women there and dressed in suits

387
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,020
Translating for to the waiters. That's all sir. Like what they wanted. It was really cool

388
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,220
But it was the thing is it's not like a Fogo de Chao in Manhattan. It's like in the middle of flushing, right?

389
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,740
It's like it's like in a mall

390
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,460
It seemed like such a weird place for a bunch of Japanese guys to go on a business trip

391
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,300
I will say two things to say about this one is that after you guys stubbed me for Fogo de Chao

392
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I came back to Long Beach and I

393
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:21,880
Went to get pizza and like right next to the pizza store was like a non Fogo de Chao Brazilian steakhouse

394
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,620
Okay, and like going to one of those when you don't expect it is like such a weird experience

395
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:34,200
Because if you know ahead of time you're going to an all-you-can-eat thing, it's like you prepare, you know

396
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,660
You don't eat the whole day. You drink a lot of liquids you think about it

397
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,260
This is the sad thing that's happened to me both times

398
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,200
I've gone to Fogo de Chão is that I've eaten two hours before every single time because it's been impromptu and it's a wrong move

399
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,480
It's the wrong move and it's like, you know, it's 60 bucks

400
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:59,480
So it's like it's not the worst amount of money to waste, you know, you could have really got that $60 worth. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

401
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,320
Did you end up going to that non Brazil or non Fogo Brazilian?

402
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,240
Yes, and I ate the fuck out of it, dude

403
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,680
Here's here's the rules of Fogo de Chão man

404
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,320
and I think that there should be somebody outside who should be like honestly you could probably make money at that place by

405
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,460
Selling a like guide like a game FAQ

406
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
for like

407
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,800
How to beat Fogo to chow, yes, here are the things

408
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,840
The the salad bar you a lot of people say no. No, no, no. No, listen to me

409
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
I'm an expert man

410
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,280
A lot of people would say never go to the salad bar and that's if that's one way to do it

411
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,100
But there's some delicious stuff on the salad bar, but the key is don't go to the salad bar

412
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,520
first

413
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,980
Go to the salad bar later in the evening because here's that they trick you they give you the plate and they say

414
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,160
The salad bar is over there will

415
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,740
Turn your cart over when you're ready and we'll have some people come over

416
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,760
But it always takes five or ten minutes and you want to eat right then you've been saving all day to eat this food

417
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,560
So you run to the salad bar and then come back and flip over your thing, but there's amazing things up there

418
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:15,560
You don't want to miss out on that. You don't want to overdo it, but you definitely don't want it to take over meat real estate

419
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Okay, you need some roughage

420
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:27,180
They have a great Caesar salad, there's nothing wrong with the Caesar salad, yes, okay, so that's number one number two is

421
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:34,120
Get that chicken out of my fucking face. That's right chicken out of my face

422
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,240
I should be

423
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,140
Bucks I should be able to slap that out of your hands when you bring that fucking skewer over to me and you say would

424
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,160
You like it's a piece of chicken

425
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,240
I should be able to take the skewer and put you on the skewer

426
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,160
They should walk around with you as a waiter and say do you want any Craig? That's what they should do. Okay?

427
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,800
For even offering me a piece of chicken. Was that the one thing that we rejected? I remember you

428
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:04,240
Meat, I say no to chicken and guys I learned this as well. I say no to anything that is bacon wrapped

429
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,040
The bacon stuff is too heavy

430
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:16,920
Fatty salty get that shit away from me. Give me the steak. We didn't have chicken hearts. They were good. Yeah chicken hearts are awesome

431
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,960
We had chicken. Yeah, we did. They're really tiny. They're like, I remember that

432
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,640
Yeah

433
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,080
It was funny coming coming out of tofago de chao and

434
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,020
Someone else like I said like oh, do you have the like this cut and I was I don't remember a single one

435
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,360
So I just like yeah, it was good

436
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I like that.

437
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,000
That was my favorite actually.

438
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,600
And a lot of people say, "Go and have the picanha.

439
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,040
Wait for the picanha to come.

440
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,440
The picanha is the best one."

441
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,680
Picanha is good.

442
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,000
There's nothing wrong with it.

443
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,400
But the best one is the top sirloin, guys.

444
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,760
Trust me on this.

445
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
It's the most well-marbled one.

446
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,680
The picanha is a very lean cut with a fat cap on top, which can be hit or miss.

447
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,840
It's inconsistent depending on how big of a fat cap they give you.

448
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,800
The motherfucking top sirloin hits every single time.

449
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I like the Jack's cut.

450
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I feel like that's a pretty normal Brazilian steakhouse.

451
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
It's a very small...

452
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Yeah. The Kanya is really good and obviously it's like one of those things you can only get at a Brazilian steakhouse.

453
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
So you should get it while you're there.

454
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
But every cut of meat...

455
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
The only thing I don't like is the one I went to served sausage.

456
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I'm sure.

457
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,800
But yeah, you gotta say no to the sausage because that's like, you can get that anywhere.

458
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Exactly. It's fuckin' sausage.

459
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,800
It's not like a bratwurst at least?

460
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I mean it's like a cheddar something sausage. It's not remarkable in any way.

461
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,800
It's not like specifically a Brazilian barbecue thing.

462
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Yeah, it's definitely like a pork sausage. It's above average.

463
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,400
It's good sausage, but you're giving up steak real estate for sausage.

464
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,320
That's like a $5 meat versus like a $30 meat.

465
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,920
And the whole thing, the entire experience is about maximizing steak.

466
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,840
That's really, if you keep those two simple rules in your head, maximize steak and salad

467
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,400
bar after, then you will have a great time.

468
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,920
You should be eating things you don't normally eat.

469
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,920
You shouldn't have to go out there and be gorging yourself on chicken.

470
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Stay adventurous.

471
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,280
Yeah, because how many times a week are you really eating three and a half pounds of beef?

472
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,720
Right. Zero.

473
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
But how many days are you eating half a pound of chicken?

474
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,080
Almost every day. Almost every day do I eat a half pound of chicken.

475
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Right.

476
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,280
I'm kind of scared of chicken.

477
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
You eat chicken every day?

478
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,880
Pretty much. What is the major protein you would eat?

479
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,280
I would say...

480
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,480
I want to say chicken.

481
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Yeah.

482
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
Everyone eats chicken.

483
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
That's why we all have...

484
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Chicken is just a staple meat.

485
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,880
That's why people are balding.

486
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:11,440
the

487
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
the only time I don't eat chicken

488
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
you're going crazy

489
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,440
the only time I don't eat chicken is when I get the mix

490
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
I am fucked up, I am insanely fucked up on this one

491
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
you mix platter, oh, oh, like um

492
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
yeah

493
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
from like a waffle

494
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
yeah, lamb and chicken

495
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
yeah, lamb is the only other meat other than chicken

496
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,440
lamb is, how do you guys feel about like veal and lamb

497
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
these baby meats

498
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
veal, well

499
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
I don't think lamb is a baby meat, is it?

500
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:48,240
is it? Lamb is a young version of a sheep. I guess that's true, yeah. Veal is bad. Lamb

501
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:56,160
is kind of whatever. Bad in what way? Well veal is like evil, you know. They break a

502
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,560
cow's legs and then they fatten it up to get it as fat as possible. Yeah, that's like foie

503
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,000
gras. Yeah, but something about that is like, foie gras, that's duck, right? That's duck

504
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Yeah, so I don't really care about a duck

505
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:18,300
Really at all a duck doesn't a duck doesn't that like there's not a cute maybe a duckling is kind of cute

506
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:24,960
Yeah, but I would also never remember a duck's name a cow I could see myself having a relationship with I could see myself

507
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,320
Grabbing a duck by its neck and just swirling around like this and just not care. Yeah, exactly

508
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,840
Ducks are mean - yeah, they are mean

509
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,000
Really? Yes. How have you never brought this up before? That's awesome. Is that new? No, it's years.

510
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,400
Years? Yeah, it's probably... Is it giant? No, it's...

511
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,480
So it's supposed to be one of those like little teacup pigs. Those don't exist. Yeah, it's a boar.

512
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,200
It grows tusks.

513
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
They have to like shade it's toes.

514
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Holy fuck. Is it Arizona?

515
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's got like a really bristly like mohawk on its back.

516
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
How have we never talked about that?

517
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
What the fuck? Wait.

518
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,200
inside

519
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,240
now you may have a lot of

520
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,640
this is a good

521
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,920
this is not a big deal

522
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
okay

523
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,000
it's been

524
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it is a frankein short

525
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,680
uh...

526
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
does it shit all over the place?

527
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
no no it's actually, it's housebroken

528
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
it goes outside of the house

529
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
yeah it eats cheerios

530
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
and fruit

531
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
your dad has a pet pig for years

532
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
he didn't want it

533
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
and I was like, you should allow your

534
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
girlfriend to get the pig

535
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
that's an amazing pet

536
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
I don't think it's an amazing pet

537
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I think it's a cool pet in half

538
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
here's the thing, the pig loves him

539
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
hates the girlfriend

540
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Whoa.

541
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,160
And it like, it'll, like he'll sit on the couch, watch TV for 10 hours straight, and it will

542
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,680
curl up next to him under a blanket like a little pine.

543
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Oh my god.

544
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
That's so cute.

545
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Does he eat pork?

546
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,040
Yeah, of course.

547
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
He does?

548
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Yeah.

549
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,520
Buzz, he has two reasons to not eat pork, man.

550
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,680
I know, and none of them stick.

551
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,520
But you know, he loves that pig.

552
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,280
To be Jewish and own a pet pig and that's your only pet and to still eat pork is so...

553
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,480
- I have two dogs.

554
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,680
- Oh, okay.

555
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,400
But it's the one that likes him the most?

556
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,240
That's crazy.

557
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,160
(laughing)

558
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,280
- How does it get along with the dogs?

559
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,320
Are they just chill?

560
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,080
- Yeah, it's pretty chill.

561
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,320
- They probably think he's a dog.

562
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,160
That's usually how it goes.

563
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,000
- Yeah.

564
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,840
- Wait, the sea pig, is he still a dog?

565
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,680
- No, but the youngest dog will sometimes corner the pig

566
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,160
and then they'll scream at each other.

567
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,600
And a pig's scream is really loud.

568
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
- They have a word for it, a squeal.

569
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,440
- Yeah.

570
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,920
So you have to take a Dremel to their hooves to like...

571
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,080
'Cause they grow like a dog's nails.

572
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,580
Yeah.

573
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,840
And you can't take that to like PetSmart and have them do that.

574
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,760
So you need to take a Dremel to it.

575
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,000
And the thing is you like flip it on its back and hold its legs and like...

576
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,840
Dremel... It doesn't hurt the pig at all.

577
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,800
But it screams so loud that you literally have to wear like earplugs.

578
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,400
Because it's like... It's deafening.

579
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,640
I was there once. I like helped.

580
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,080
and I didn't have the earplugs and my ears like I had worse tinnitus than I've ever had the next day.

581
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:38,680
From a pig squeal. Yeah it's it literally it's like you're murdering it and it feels nothing.

582
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:45,560
It does not feel what's like because it's like fingernails yeah. Well that is some of the most

583
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:51,320
amazing new information I've gotten in weeks. That you you have a pet pig which by the way

584
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,560
If both of them died, you would probably be the inheritor of this pig.

585
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,360
I would not.

586
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,680
You would. And then you would have a pig in New York City and we could make a whole documentary about you.

587
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,480
Oh my god.

588
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,400
I would take it for a walk, yeah.

589
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,720
The thing about it too, because of the way its hooves are, they've got really like...

590
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,160
Like a dog, when it walks, the paws are kind of soft, right?

591
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,800
Uh-huh.

592
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,480
The bottom of a dog paw is soft.

593
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,560
But a hoof is really hard.

594
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:25,000
So it has like dick-seeking hooves in the sense that it crawls over you.

595
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,920
It always puts its entire weight on your dick when it steps.

596
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,680
It hurts so bad.

597
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
It's not like a paw.

598
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
There's no softness to it.

599
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
No, there's no softness.

600
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
It's straight up pain.

601
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,960
It's like a Yeti water bottle hitting your balls.

602
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Do you have a picture, Frank, that we can see?

603
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,040
Let me see if I have one.

604
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,360
I'd have to go back pretty far.

605
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
Have you ever seen one?

606
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
My brother had a pig.

607
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Josh had a pig.

608
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,080
I don't know if you know that.

609
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,600
He had a pig, they named him Pabst.

610
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Hilarious.

611
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Beer.

612
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Beer.

613
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Named after beer.

614
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Beer pig.

615
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,120
And it was the same thing where it was sold to him as a teacup pig and then it became

616
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
like a hundred pounds.

617
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Right.

618
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,080
And they, the way that it, the reason, they got rid of him eventually.

619
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,240
But they really liked him but he was, because pigs are so smart, he would do stuff like he

620
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,120
would take a sh- he would move- he wasn't allowed to shit inside but he would move

621
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,600
furniture and move the the the rug and then take a shit under the rug and then

622
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:34,820
move the rug back and put the furniture back. Yeah, and they would- so they'd be like

623
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,060
walk around they'd be like why is this why does this fucking room smell like shit and

624
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,480
then they'd find under a piece of under a chair and under the rug they would find a

625
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,220
A pig shit that had been like squished down.

626
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,680
- They were very smart.

627
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,640
- It was insane.

628
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,680
Yeah, that's an animal,

629
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,480
I really don't eat much pork at all.

630
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,640
- Back when I was living with my dad.

631
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,560
- It tastes amazing.

632
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,920
- I would go on these walks every morning

633
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,200
and sometimes if I went early enough,

634
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,800
I would go walk to this park,

635
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,000
I would see this neighbor that just had a pig

636
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,020
and it was always, she like took it outside

637
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,640
to like walk it I guess,

638
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,600
but he was always so big and so fat

639
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,120
and was always just laying on the ground.

640
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,440
So I think he was just getting some air or some shit

641
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,640
because I never saw that pig walk once.

642
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,840
- They mostly lounge.

643
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,120
That's the nice thing about a pig.

644
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,880
It's not like a dog wants to run all the time.

645
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,360
I just had to take Phil to the park

646
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,840
and there's a subway that goes right next to the park

647
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,480
and he's developed this awful habit

648
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,720
of we're playing in the park with his ball

649
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,440
and then the subway comes and he chases the subway

650
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,640
for like six hundred feet

651
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,680
down the the park to like the fence

652
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,000
to see what's right and a little boy

653
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,520
now he's off leashed

654
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,660
i'm breaking the law

655
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,040
i'm not going to start only you off leisure dog

656
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,280
at the park yet some of the problem really

657
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,120
and the thing is when it's his time to go it's his time to go if you're in

658
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
school

659
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,960
you're right

660
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,840
do you know that he's just doesn't show up again

661
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,000
tonight a little bit when he started running towards the train i was like

662
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Fuck this dog, I hope he just keeps running.

663
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh wait, that's Frankie?

664
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He's ador- wait, that's his bed?

665
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He has a child's bed?

666
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
He has a human's bed.

667
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That is so adorable, oh my god.

668
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
He's not that big either.

669
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Nah, he's like 30 pounds, 40 pounds.

670
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's a nice small pig.

671
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He's probably like 5 years old at this point.

672
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
How old can pigs get?

673
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
They can get pretty old.

674
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah, I think they're similar lifespan

675
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
to dogs, I would guess.

676
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the

677
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
fed

678
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
fed

679
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
fed

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
fed

681
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
fed

682
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
fed

683
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
fed

684
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
fed

685
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
fed

686
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
fed

687
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
fed

688
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
fed

689
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
fed

690
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:21,080
a

691
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:28,960
turn two and I'm like I have to do this shit for nine more years and then he gets cancer

692
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,120
in his entire body and he explodes.

693
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,600
That's the thing I've probably said this before but it's so funny that the only place dogs

694
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:44,840
ever get cancer is their entire body and then you go to somebody's house and the dog walks

695
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,400
up to you and they're like oh by the way don't touch the dog he has cancer in his entire body

696
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,020
If you pet him, he is it's the worst most unimaginable pain of all time. Yeah

697
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,460
I've been uh, ever since I got I got got our dog

698
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,160
I keep getting like dog tic-tocs like

699
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,180
For weeks now and I've gotten a couple recently where it's a family with like a really old dog

700
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,440
And it's like well

701
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,800
This is our our dogs last meal and they feed him like a like like a chocolate bar or some shit

702
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,080
Have you ever thought about what your last meal for Philwood would be?

703
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:26,020
I honestly, truly it would probably be a giant, like three jars of peanut butter in a bowl.

704
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:30,480
And it wouldn't be because that would be his favorite meal, it would be because it would

705
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,200
take him a really long time to eat it, and so he could be not annoying me for like his

706
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,200
last two hours, and I would maybe have a good memory of him.

707
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,960
I'm gonna, so I, a couple years ago I like took care of a dog that was on its last legs,

708
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:54,800
He was diabetic, blind, incontinent, so he wore diapers.

709
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,560
He looked like the Silent Hill dog.

710
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,880
He was straight up just like a skeleton.

711
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
With grey eyes.

712
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,720
That's rare for an old sick dog, they usually get fat.

713
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Yeah.

714
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,200
No, he couldn't hold anything down.

715
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,120
But he couldn't see anything, he'd run into shit all the time, but he knew when you were

716
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:20,680
about to stab him with his insulin which made it very annoying to give it to him

717
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,240
which I had I had to like put his food down and then just stab him and then like

718
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,080
add water to the food because he would eat it so fast he would throw it up it

719
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,360
just yeah and throw it up and I was like when this dog dies I'm not gonna care

720
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:42,080
because I had him for like a year and I felt horrible when he died I was like so

721
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:57,080
the

722
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:05,000
dog that Joe was watching for a summer. His name was Mr. Dangle. Um, and I stayed over

723
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,860
there for a while. I was living in my car when I first moved to LA, because I had nothing

724
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,720
lined up at all. And then he was like, "Hey, do you want to come stay with me? I have,

725
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm like dog-sitting this dog." And I was like, "Yeah, sure." And then he would work and I

726
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,820
would take care of the dog. And I fucking hated this dog. I had to put the insulin in him.

727
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:27,380
was blind and he would like snot all over me all the time and he was a pug and he

728
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,820
was I think 14 years old and when he would he would walk up to the couch and

729
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,100
he would just bark at the couch because he wanted to be on the couch but he

730
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,740
couldn't jump up himself so then I had to come pick him up while I'm watching

731
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:45,060
fucking succession and then he died like the summer after I took care of him the

732
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,940
entire summer and I literally it was like a it was like a good same dopamine rush

733
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,180
you get from smoking a cigarette. It was that exact same. I was like, "Oh my God. Oh my

734
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:03,540
God. Thank God that thing is not on earth anymore." That is an amazing feeling. I hated that dog.

735
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:09,300
I don't think you're very much of a dog person. I like Phil. He's my best friend, man. He's

736
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,180
the only thing I talk to all day. That is true.

737
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,140
I'll be sad when he dies, but the thing is people, and I'm not going to say what kind

738
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:24,740
of people, white people, okay? White people get it in their heads that a dog is anything,

739
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,660
a dog is just a dog at the end of the day, right? If you have to leave it in its crate

740
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:35,300
for three days, if you forget to feed it, it's not great. But at the end of the day,

741
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:41,820
it is a dog. This is not a baby, this is not a human. The dog has no, the dog can't feel

742
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,460
anything, it doesn't even exist basically. So who cares?

743
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:51,580
The moment you put it in your apartment, close that door, lock it up, it stops existing.

744
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,100
Yeah, it's gone.

745
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
It's gone.

746
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,100
He has no object permanence.

747
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,800
He doesn't know that I exist when I'm not there.

748
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,460
One day, here's how stupid a dog is, one day to them is supposedly seven days.

749
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
Right.

750
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
Wow.

751
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
So, who cares?

752
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
Because of the years.

753
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,180
So you can waste their time all you want.

754
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,860
I do, something that I do think every single day is I wish there was a dog prison because

755
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,860
I want to send my dog to dog prison.

756
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,860
But your dog is being dog juvie.

757
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,860
I guess so.

758
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,860
Yeah, you do have a puppy.

759
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
You can't hold a dog liable for anything they do before they're 2 years old.

760
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,860
Yeah.

761
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,860
Well, if they're hurting me, I will do it.

762
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,860
If a dog hurts you, that is your fault.

763
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,860
I'm sorry.

764
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,860
I agree.

765
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,860
One time I looked up, Phil like snapped at me one time

766
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
when I stepped on his foot.

767
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,860
And I looked up like an idiot.

768
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,860
I looked up like dog tried to bite me

769
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,240
when I stepped on its foot and it was like a,

770
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,780
like a Cora or something,

771
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,380
somebody asking the exact same question.

772
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,880
And the top answer with like a thousand million likes

773
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,000
was like, yeah, if you stepped on my fucking foot,

774
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,200
I'd try to bite you too.

775
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,420
(laughing)

776
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,980
I was like, oh yeah, I guess they,

777
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,420
I guess they feel pain and they have reactions.

778
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,700
I guess that's true.

779
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,140
- No, that's bullshit.

780
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,020
- A different time after the last dog,

781
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,940
I was taking care of a former bait dog

782
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,260
that I found on the street

783
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,940
I was trying to find like a place for it. A bait dog? Yeah like a like a Rottweiler that had its

784
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:22,980
teeth like ground down um so you know it was all bit up and shit and uh I was living with someone

785
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:29,380
that had a husky at the time and like they were fighting over a bone and like the the dog that I

786
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:35,860
was taking care of like took the bone and was kind of over it and I was like I fucking I got this this

787
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:41,700
dog so fucking stupid and old and I just got over the top of it and reached under

788
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,420
its mouth and just like knocked the bone away with my hand and it fucking just

789
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:53,460
bit me so hard. Of course. Yeah, my roommate was like, "Are you okay? Like you are bleeding. Like are you fine?"

790
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:00,740
I'm good. No, it's awesome. It's not a problem. It is awesome. Yeah.

791
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:16,180
it's a

792
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:23,520
Speaking of next week, speaking of next week, yes I am, speaking of next week, guys, say

793
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,900
goodbye to this disgusting space.

794
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,140
Are you moving next week?

795
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,740
I'm moving, not next week, I'm moving tomorrow.

796
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,360
Really?

797
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:39,220
Tomorrow is gonna be, tomorrow is literally like D-Day for fucking everything.

798
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:45,420
Tomorrow I'm moving, tomorrow I'm paying my deposit, tomorrow I'm signing the papers, tomorrow

799
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:51,500
the internet people come in to install the internet which is not a service that I

800
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:58,340
wanted but I'll take it but yeah tomorrow I'm fully moving out of here

801
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,020
which I'm so excited because my I think I've talked about about this before on

802
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,100
the stream on the somewhere I know but I've lost all contact with my my landlord

803
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:14,260
the lady yeah so right now our only like smoke signal to her right now is the

804
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,100
the fact that today's like the day to pay,

805
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,220
do pay rents due today and we're not gonna pay it

806
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,940
and we're hoping that she shows up at some point

807
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,340
either tomorrow or over the weekend.

808
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,540
- And sees that you're not there.

809
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,820
- Yeah, and she either sees that we're not there

810
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,060
or something happens and she gets in contact with me.

811
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,340
I'll be like, here are your keys, we are gone.

812
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,860
I'm not, you can try to charge me anything.

813
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,700
I won't give you any money.

814
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm outta here.

815
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,300
- It's kinda awesome that like credit scores

816
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,900
don't exist in Mexico.

817
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,740
- That is cool.

818
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,240
- There's just violence.

819
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,800
they do. No they don't. You guys have a chili pepper scale out of 10. No they exist in some

820
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,560
capacity but not in the way that she would be able to influence it in any way I don't

821
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,920
think. Your landlord couldn't influence your credit score? Then you don't have credit scores.

822
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,760
There is a credit score yeah. I've been told that I've got credit by people before. That's

823
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,760
That's how it works.

824
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,760
There's a, you can get it.

825
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Someone just knows you.

826
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
You have good credit, you have bad credit.

827
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Yeah, Quan Credit just called him up, he texted.

828
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,760
You can get it now.

829
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
You can get it checked.

830
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,760
I don't know what the process is.

831
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,760
I never really checked it myself.

832
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
They check it when you're trying to buy a car, which I've done twice.

833
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
That's awesome, man.

834
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,760
I'm so happy for you.

835
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:36,640
Somehow I have really good, I used to have like a 480 credit score at one point, and

836
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,440
I have had overdue credit cards, maxed out credit cards for years, never paid them.

837
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,720
And then I got another credit card and for some reason just getting another credit card

838
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,640
made me have pretty decent credit now.

839
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,640
It's like 690 or something.

840
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,760
So having, from what I've heard, having multiple credit cards is really good for your credit

841
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
score.

842
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,200
What's really bad is cancelling a credit card.

843
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,680
Yeah, you're not allowed to cancel a credit card.

844
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,680
Yeah.

845
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,720
My credit score is 754.

846
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
That's really good.

847
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
You can do anything.

848
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,760
My favorite part, my favorite thing, I think I've talked about this a lot, but my favorite

849
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,400
thing about Rex's and his credit is the fact that he had a baby credit card for like years

850
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,240
and he couldn't do anything with his life when he got money because he just had such

851
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,520
a stupid credit card that all he wanted was to give him like a thousand bucks.

852
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Oh yeah, you had like a thousand dollar limit.

853
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,520
Yeah, I would call them and they'd be like, you basically just have to lie to them because

854
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,480
they can't check how much money you actually make.

855
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,360
So you have to call them and be like, "Yeah, I'm expecting to make $3 billion next year.

856
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,560
Can I get a $10,000 credit limit?"

857
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,160
Wait, I should do that.

858
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah, you can just do that.

859
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,620
You can just lie.

860
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,320
You can lie, but it took you a while.

861
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
I think-

862
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,320
It did.

863
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,320
It did take me years.

864
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,040
I remember this because it was like for an entire year, like half a year, that I would-

865
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,720
One of my main talking points was where I was like, "Do you still have a baby credit

866
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
card?"

867
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,720
And he was like, "Yeah."

868
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
And I would just-

869
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:09,600
One time we were in the Airbnb and like the entire week of Airbnb took up my entire credit card

870
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,560
So I called my my company and I was like, hey

871
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,760
can I get like maybe a higher limit because I have to pay this card like every two weeks and

872
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,000
They were like no

873
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,720
Just no, let's check no

874
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,600
- Yeah, and then I called like a year later

875
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,760
and I was like, yeah, can I get a higher credit limit?

876
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,880
And they're like, sure, do you want four times

877
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,840
what the old limit was?

878
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,400
And I was like, sure, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.

879
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,040
- The limit was like one or 2,000 bucks.

880
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,600
- You should have tried maybe a British accent or something.

881
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,520
- Yeah, well, I ended up getting like an Indian guy

882
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,920
at the time it worked and I had a woman

883
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,000
at the time it didn't work.

884
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,880
So maybe she thought my voice was too unmasculine

885
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,280
wimpy and I didn't make enough money but an Indian man recognized my supreme

886
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:13,920
autism and knew that I make money. I think they want you to make a lot of

887
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,440
money. I think that they like stealing from you. The thing is broke

888
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,360
people don't, I mean as somebody who's been broke most of my life, broke

889
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,920
people do not pay credit cards. Right. You just don't you just don't pay it. Yeah.

890
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,240
Because there's nothing they're not gonna do anything what it goes to collections who cares

891
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,320
Yeah, it impacts my credit score. I'm not gonna buy a house for seven years. Anyway, I'm not gonna buy anything

892
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:46,240
I'll rent a car. I'll or just not have a car which is cool way cooler. I'll rent my house and

893
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:53,560
I'll order uber eats every day on a visa platinum card and then just fucking ignore it as soon as it hits the limit

894
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,920
yeah, I have a

895
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,080
The thing about credit is like you're only supposed to use like 30% of your credit limit

896
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,100
So if you spend like three thousand dollars a month, which is a lot of money

897
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,860
You should have like a fifteen thousand dollar credit

898
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,320
Is that true? You're supposed to have low credit utilization?

899
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,980
Under 30% if you go over 30% it's like it's a it's a negative against you

900
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,080
I think this is this is one of those unwritten rules that you don't really have to abide by

901
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,720
No, it's literally like it shows me on my thing. It has like a dotted line

902
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:34,440
It's like this is like and it's like a 30% and it says don't go over this. Yeah, it's like when I'm you know

903
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,600
What they say that they say that so they don't lose any money lending to you. Fuck it do it

904
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,160
Yeah, go over it buy a car on your just let that shit fly man. Just

905
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,900
Credit card let that shit fly by a big-ass TV

906
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,720
Well, my favorite thing about credit cards too is if you rack up too much credit card debt

907
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,120
You can open another credit card and then just move it over. I've done that. Yeah, I've done that with the same with

908
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,280
The same capital one. I did that with two different cards

909
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,120
I had a maxed out credit card that I had and they gave me a different credit card

910
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:15,640
Because I applied for it and then I just moved like half of it over to that. Yeah, I was like, all right, I'm good. I

911
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,840
I really love Dave Ramsey because he's like, "Do not ever take out any debt."

912
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,840
But the thing is, and they don't tell you this, debt is free money.

913
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,840
True.

914
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:32,840
It's how they invent money. It's free. It literally doesn't give it to you for free.

915
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,840
1%. He doesn't want you to know these kinds of tricks.

916
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,840
He's trying to keep people down by saying, "Pay your car bill. Pay your credit card."

917
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,340
"Pay your mortgage."

918
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,840
None of that shit matters, man.

919
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,160
Yes, take out more debt. It's free.

920
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,160
I love it.

921
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,000
Dude, I took out a crazy amount of money for my student loans. Like an amount that I would

922
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,680
be embarrassed if I had to... an amount that is so large that I don't even know what it

923
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,760
is because I don't want to open the website and look at the number.

924
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
Right.

925
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,720
Okay? But I just had to start paying my student loans back and they sent me the first bill

926
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,240
and it was like $170.

927
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
Yeah.

928
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,740
Yeah.

929
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:19,680
And I thought it would take me probably three lifetimes to pay it off at that rate.

930
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,180
Yeah.

931
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,680
So I'm like, "Ah, who gives a fuck?"

932
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,280
The only people that pay off their student loans are like lawyers and doctors.

933
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:27,920
Exactly.

934
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,200
I went to school for fucking...

935
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,840
I don't even know what I went to school for.

936
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,160
Yeah, you went to school for fucking comedy.

937
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,560
For fun.

938
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,440
Yeah, basically.

939
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,640
Yeah, I went to school for fun.

940
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,320
And I only went for two years too.

941
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:45,520
So they, it really is, who could possibly expect me to pay that back?

942
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,440
The fact that they were able to stop payments and nothing happened.

943
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,560
Yeah.

944
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,840
Just like stop charging interest, stop payments, do whatever.

945
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,440
That tells you it's completely fake.

946
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,360
They just don't expect anyone to pay it back.

947
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,760
I think we're getting on a dangerous territory here.

948
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,240
We're about to say that banks don't matter and the US is a fake country.

949
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,280
Let's move on to a more pure topic.

950
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:14,720
Nobody is more, nobody is more, um, okay here, beer talk. Sorry. The Kirin Ichiban compared to

951
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:22,800
the acai in the soju bomb is completely identical y'all. Cannot taste a single difference. It tastes

952
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,680
exactly the same. It tastes a little more soju-y because I think I put a little more soju in this,

953
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,080
but that's the only difference. I'm not going to chalk that up to the beer. I am so, so jealous

954
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,800
of you right now in an insane way.

955
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,800
You look really sad honestly.

956
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
You would probably hate the soju.

957
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,800
Me?

958
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
I've had soju before.

959
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,800
No, he would like soju.

960
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
I like soju.

961
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
It's sweet.

962
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
It's sweet and candy-ish.

963
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,800
It's sweet and delicious.

964
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
And he's the candy man.

965
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
He's Mr. Nintendo.

966
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,200
Wait, I think you're going to hate that.

967
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,280
Don't call me that by the way.

968
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,280
That's not me.

969
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,280
We never talked about this.

970
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
Remember this Rex?

971
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,280
He's Mr. Nintendo.

972
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,280
Nope.

973
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,280
He is Mr. Nintendo.

974
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,720
Okay, so this is something that none of you, neither of you were involved in at all.

975
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,280
This is a Brian and Alex thing.

976
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,800
I'm involved because I called you this.

977
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,040
You were not involved because you were not in the apartment there when this happened.

978
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:15,880
I will let Brian or Alex explain it, but it's such a stupid thing and I was just deemed this

979
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,960
by the entire group for no reason just because Brian said it and because I wanted to go to

980
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,960
the Nintendo store.

981
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,600
Well, it was because you wanted to go to the Nintendo store but also you were dominating

982
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,240
every Nintendo game, which is not a wrong thing to be doing.

983
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,440
Ah, there he is.

984
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,000
Look at him, he's in the chat, he's just listening, he's just spying on me.

985
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,400
Brian is my worst enemy.

986
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:43,320
What he's saying, I gotta go check in on Mr. Nintendo, see if he's getting power ups and

987
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,320
eating mushrooms.

988
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,000
I do like mushrooms on pizza.

989
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Me too.

990
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,040
I kinda wanna get one of these mushrooms, they call it the chicken of the woods.

991
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,560
Have you seen this mushroom?

992
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
No.

993
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,680
It's extremely large.

994
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,720
And it apparently tastes like chicken.

995
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,220
you cook it with amino acids.

996
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,920
Does she know what the name of the mushroom is?

997
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Chicken of the woods?

998
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,920
I don't think that's what it's called.

999
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
It's a colloquial term.

1000
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,120
I want to look up chicken of the woods.

1001
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,120
It'll come up.

1002
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,120
Oh my god.

1003
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,120
Jibyo did get so mad when I called him Mr. Nintendo.

1004
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,000
It's a whole ass mushroom in your right.

1005
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,320
I'm right about everything man.

1006
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,240
Why is it called that?

1007
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,640
It doesn't look like any of my moves.

1008
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,800
Because of its taste and its texture.

1009
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,920
I'm so smart.

1010
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,760
- I'm so smart.

1011
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,080
- Do you walk out into the woods

1012
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,720
and just see a mushroom and eat it?

1013
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,880
- Do foraging?

1014
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,500
I don't know, I'm really scared of that

1015
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,600
because every mushroom that you can eat

1016
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,460
has a twin sister that kills you instantly.

1017
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,480
- Yeah. - That is true.

1018
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,960
- Isn't that also true for berries

1019
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,320
and pretty much anything else in the woods?

1020
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,640
- Yeah, every berry looks like a blueberry

1021
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,280
but the blueberry's the only one that you can actually eat.

1022
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,280
- There's a mushroom called beefstick fungus.

1023
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,080
Okay, just two things.

1024
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,400
There's one called beefstick fungus

1025
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,280
It's really funny and it looks like a beef steak.

1026
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,840
The chicken of the woods looks like pancakes.

1027
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,920
So--

1028
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,760
- It does.

1029
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,040
- They should call it-- - It doesn't taste like pancakes.

1030
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,600
- They should call it the pancakes of the mushroom.

1031
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,200
- I got so jealous today when Noah sent a picture

1032
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,840
of his pancakes.

1033
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,200
Made me want pancakes so bad.

1034
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,820
I'm not really, are you guys sweet breakfast people?

1035
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,680
- I do like a sweet breakfast, but very rarely.

1036
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,200
- I don't, I like eggs.

1037
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,000
- It'll make me go right back to sleep.

1038
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,840
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1039
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,680
- If I have a sweet breakfast.

1040
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,880
I think a sweet breakfast is a Saturday thing.

1041
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,880
I don't have anything to say.

1042
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,880
Okay, like a weekend thing.

1043
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,880
I can see what you're saying.

1044
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,880
I don't know about Saturday.

1045
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,880
I feel like Sunday.

1046
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,880
I'm fine with what you just said,

1047
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,880
which is surprising because it was so outlandish.

1048
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,880
But a sweet breakfast

1049
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,880
being a Saturday thing.

1050
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,880
Who's weird on sweet versus savory?

1051
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,880
Oh yeah, wait. What is your rule?

1052
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,880
What is your... Sorry.

1053
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,880
I just remembered this.

1054
00:55:53,880 --> 00:56:02,080
dinner rule? You'll look it up? I forgot what it was. I think it's sweet, salty, and then

1055
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:08,320
either or for dinner. So you believe in a sweet dinner. You believe a sweet dinner is possible?

1056
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:17,700
Yes, I think so. What is a sweet dinner? I'm looking up Jibyu3 sweet on, here we go. It's,

1057
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,700
This is from August 24, 2021.

1058
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,420
It's two years old.

1059
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,620
Breakfast is sweet, lunch is salty, and dinner can be either.

1060
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,620
Yeah.

1061
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,740
That is a terrible take.

1062
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,180
Yeah, it's so stupid.

1063
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,180
That is a fucking atrocious take.

1064
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,780
Name one sweet dinner.

1065
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,580
Name one sweet dinner.

1066
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,580
Pancakes.

1067
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:44,460
That's a breakfast, you fucking asshole.

1068
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,460
Cake.

1069
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,460
Chicken and waffles.

1070
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:53,460
I don't eat chicken waffles for breakfast.

1071
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,460
Yes you do.

1072
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,460
I don't.

1073
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,460
At brunch?

1074
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,460
No.

1075
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,460
I guess that has been on a...

1076
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,460
That's a brunch menu.

1077
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,180
I eat chilaquiles for brunch.

1078
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,460
And that is sweet?

1079
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,900
No.

1080
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,660
Mole has chocolate in it.

1081
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,660
That's sweet.

1082
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,660
That's why you think that.

1083
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,660
That's why you think that.

1084
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,660
Because mole has chocolate in it.

1085
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,620
I haven't had mole in so long.

1086
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,460
- It's always delicious, man.

1087
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,620
You need to get back on that.

1088
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,740
- Well, the thing is, it's really funny, actually.

1089
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,140
It's kind of like in the same vein of Mexican stuff

1090
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,660
that we're talking about when we're into that one bar.

1091
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,100
But mole can be, you can just buy it at the store

1092
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,300
in this little jar, and it's really just commercialized,

1093
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,580
and it's not, it's just like,

1094
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,260
it's not autentico is what some would say.

1095
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,620
And my girlfriend is really,

1096
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,780
She feels really strongly about this.

1097
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,620
She will not eat the store-bought mole.

1098
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,220
So we haven't had mole a single time in this apartment.

1099
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,500
- Well, that's 'cause it takes like 50 ingredients to make it.

1100
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,140
- Yeah, real mole, it's a long process.

1101
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,740
It takes a lot of ingredients to make.

1102
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,300
It's not something that's made up here on the North.

1103
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,860
It's more of like a center of the country type of thing.

1104
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,580
So it's not something that I can easily acquire here,

1105
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,920
which I'm kind of fine with.

1106
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,580
I don't really care much about mole.

1107
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,580
- I had it one week ago, man, and it was fucking delicious.

1108
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,500
- Yeah?

1109
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,020
- Yeah, Ridgewood Taco Factory.

1110
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,500
- Was it authentico?

1111
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,420
- It was very authentico, and it was delicious.

1112
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,580
It was nice and spicy.

1113
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,100
It was almost too spicy for me.

1114
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,020
- Oh, dude, a good mole that blows out

1115
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,660
your nostrils is amazing.

1116
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,740
- It was amazing, too.

1117
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,460
- I fully think, I said that when we were hanging out

1118
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,700
at that really bad Mexican bar, but you guys--

1119
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,540
- What bad Mexican?

1120
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,360
I don't remember this.

1121
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,700
we went to the pulqueria and it was not great.

1122
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,880
- Oh yeah, that place sucked.

1123
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,240
- Yeah, Noah ordered pulque and--

1124
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,320
- They gave him vodka.

1125
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,600
- They gave him vodka and then I made a scene about it

1126
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,040
because I was texting my girlfriend about it

1127
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,000
and I could hear the two guys speaking Spanish like,

1128
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,840
did you give him pulque?

1129
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
He was like, no, I didn't.

1130
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,840
So the guy like quietly went back to Noah like,

1131
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,080
oh wait, what did you want actually?

1132
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,480
And Noah was like, oh, I wanted pulque actually.

1133
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,360
So they gave him pulque and it wasn't good

1134
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,200
and Noah said like, yeah, this is not good.

1135
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,160
and my girlfriend was really adamant that that's not real pulque, that the real pulque is like

1136
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,160
down in like Guadalajara or like some shit.

1137
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,880
He told me that pulque, is it pulque where they make it with a raw chicken hanging over

1138
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
it?

1139
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,000
I don't know.

1140
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,560
So some spirit he was talking about is made with a, they make like just normal tequila

1141
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,480
and then while it's aging they hang a raw chicken over it?

1142
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,480
Oh my god.

1143
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,600
Which seems so disgusting.

1144
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
That is nasty.

1145
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:47,880
I don't know how it's made, but that day I realized that all my five or six friends that

1146
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,120
I was hanging out with, they would love to do a fully Gringo Loco type of trip to any

1147
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,640
one of my spots.

1148
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,120
I want to go to Tequila.

1149
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,000
I want to go there, I want to drink the tequila with a ladle out of the barrels.

1150
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
They won't let you do that.

1151
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Or the clay pots.

1152
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Fuck you, bitch.

1153
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I paid for it.

1154
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:13,000
During the tour they'll let you have really high alcohol content tequila, like it's really

1155
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
clear, and you'll taste it and it'll just burn.

1156
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,680
But look, this is like 80%.

1157
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,680
I don't want to drink that.

1158
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,680
That doesn't sound good.

1159
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,680
That might burn tequila for me.

1160
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,800
They're not going to let you drink it, they're going to let you take a taste.

1161
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:33,120
But then at the end of the tour they do a tequila tasting and they give you several tequilas

1162
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,120
us and it's really yummy.

1163
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,120
All right, I'll go.

1164
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,120
I'm going to book the trip.

1165
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:41,440
I'm getting my passport next month.

1166
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,440
I've just decided.

1167
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
I have to go to Tampa, Florida.

1168
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
This has been going on for seven months.

1169
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,440
Nope, I'm going to get it.

1170
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,480
Tampa, Florida is in the US.
