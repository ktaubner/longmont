1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Here's everything I do in a day as an author.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,360
My alarm went off at 11.55am so you know what time it was.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,360
Coffee!

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,640
Then I sat down and started writing.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,600
At 12pm I wrote a book called The Dander, a science fiction book about intelligent cat

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
and dog dander.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Then at 1pm I wrote a historical fiction novel called Hip Hip Hooray about the power of celebration.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,720
At 2pm I wrote a young adult action novel called The Adventures of Computertron.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,820
I think my nephew's gonna love this one.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,980
I took a quick break for lunch, but while I was eating, inspiration struck.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,580
So I went back to my computer, and at 3pm I wrote a recipe book called "Peanut Butter

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,580
Upon Toast."

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,820
At 4pm I kept working hard and wrote a book called "The Lawsuit" which was set in the

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,500
Harry Potter universe.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,060
To lighten things up, at 5pm I wrote a children's book called "The Happy Smiler."

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,720
And then at 6pm I wrote a book that was NOT for children called "The Wet Bedroom."

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,620
And then at 8pm I wrote a memoir called "The 8pm Blues."

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,740
At 9pm I wrote a horror book for dogs called "Owl Owl Owl".

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,260
Then it was time for a quick bathroom break, and while I was in there I found myself inspired,

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,740
and at 10pm I wrote a short story collection called "Tales from the Bathroom".

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,620
At 11pm I finished up a script for a podcast I've been writing for, and that was all the

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,380
work I did that day.

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,180
Around midnight I sat down on the couch and watched my favorite TV show "The Real Housewives

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,580
of Durban" until 6am.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,020
Then I went to bed, and the cycle starts again.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,020
that's what it's like to be an author. Bye y'all.

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:40,020
[Music]

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,020
Grogless January.

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,020
Grogless January round two.

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Doing grogless January again.

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Man, 30 days no grog.

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Well I started two weeks in.

33
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,020
Yeah. This time.

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
We're going Chinese calendar.

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,140
Okay, that's a good point.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,180
Chinese New Year just happened.

37
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,980
The last time I did Grog was January.

38
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,380
I was sober for six months.

39
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,940
So, let's see what happens.

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
That's just January.

41
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,460
That's true.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,420
I had six months of January.

43
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,500
Six months of January.

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Yeah, my year didn't start until June.

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm trying to cut down on swill for the most part.

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,780
Too much swill?

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,600
Too much swill.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,660
I'm trying to cut down on twill.

49
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,380
I got too many clothes in my apartment.

50
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,420
I had a little too much grog over the weekend.

51
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,260
Oh.

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,100
Doing piano bar.

53
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,940
Wow.

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,060
the dueling piano bar. How, yeah, talk about how was Rosemont.

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,980
They played that? And they said GD. Yeah. And first of all,

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,800
I was groggless enough that I, or I was grogged up enough that I sang

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
along with the GD. Okay, now here's a joke that I would say if I

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,460
was roasting you right now. Okay. I would be like, the dueling piano bar,

59
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,940
Caleb looks more like he would be at home in the dueling banjo scene

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,540
in Deliverance, but I wouldn't say that if we were in a roast situation.

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,020
And I wouldn't high five you. Compared to the rest of... They don't high

62
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
I have enough at roasts.

63
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Yeah, that's true.

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Compared to the...

65
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,940
Hey, somebody gets a good roast in, nobody walks over and just goes...

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
They need to, man.

67
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
They do, yeah.

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,860
Compared to the rest of the duels in that movie, though, not as good as the rest of

69
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,860
the duels, I would say.

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
No.

71
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,860
The violence-wise.

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,860
No, yeah.

73
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,860
They're really not as violent as the other duels.

74
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,660
Well, I mean, I guess a duel is one-on-one, mano-y-mano.

75
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,860
Yeah, I would say the others are kind of sneak attacks.

76
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Yeah, I get you.

77
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,860
There's a lot of...

78
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,260
There's some ambushes and some flanking

79
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,300
that goes on in that movie.

80
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,140
- Oh yeah.

81
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,960
Who's in that?

82
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,260
It's John Voight, Burt Reynolds.

83
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,580
- Fucked up little baby boy.

84
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,420
- Yeah.

85
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,260
(imitates baby)

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,100
- He's ugly, man.

87
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,920
- Yeah.

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
- What else did that actor do?

89
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,900
- Gummo.

90
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,300
- I think that guy was also in Toy Story.

91
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,140
- Yeah.

92
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,960
- He was Mr. Potato Head.

93
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
- No, he played that spider.

94
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,640
- He was the baby spider.

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,740
- Mr. Potato Head when he loses one.

96
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,260
- He played that spider with the eye.

97
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,100
- Yeah.

98
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,940
- That's gonna be so awesome.

99
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,980
- Oh, he was Mad-Eye Moody.

100
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,820
When he grew up in Harry Potter.

101
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,780
- That has to be so awesome being an ugly actor

102
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,940
who's looking for that kind of thing.

103
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,260
- There's that like,

104
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,780
the thing that like boomers like to share on Facebook

105
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,820
where it's just a picture of Steve Buscemi smiling

106
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,620
and it's like in black and white and it says,

107
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,460
Steve Buscemi didn't know he was ugly

108
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,940
until people started saying it.

109
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,300
- I don't think Steve Buscemi's ugly.

110
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,180
- Steve Buscemi's not ugly at all.

111
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,740
Dude, have you seen young Steve Buscemi?

112
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,060
- I'm fuckin'. - Yeah, I knew him.

113
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,900
- Yeah? - I knew him

114
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,180
in middle high school. - For real?

115
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,900
- Yeah, middle and high school.

116
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,140
- Yeah, we went to a combination both.

117
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,100
- Wow. - Middle high.

118
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Is it Buscemi?

119
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
It's called Middle High.

120
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
It's called Middle High.

121
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
Is it Buscemi?

122
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,340
Because it's one C. Or is it Buscemi?

123
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,900
Are you trying to re...

124
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Is it Buscemi?

125
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,540
Your name is Steve Buscemi.

126
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,860
What if it's like a thing where it's like Rihanna, where Rihanna pronounces it Rihanna?

127
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,860
She's Jamaican though.

128
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
She's not Jamaican.

129
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
She's Jamaican.

130
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
She's Asian.

131
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
She's Jamaican, but she moves those hips.

132
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,860
No, she's from Barbados.

133
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
Rihanna from Barbados.

134
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,860
Barbados, Jamaica.

135
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
That's a whole bit in detail.

136
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,860
I thought she was from Prescribia.

137
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
I want her Aidos.

138
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,260
- Her A, her A-dose.

139
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,460
(laughing)

140
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,300
Yeah.

141
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
- All right.

142
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,380
- I wish, oh she's from Haiti?

143
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,220
Really?

144
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,040
- I think so.

145
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,300
- She's gonna be hating my pants.

146
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,520
- I did hear that she was from Disturbia though.

147
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,440
- Yeah.

148
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
- Yep.

149
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,100
- It's a fire ass movie, it's just a rear window rip off.

150
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,140
- I wanna be disturbing her.

151
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,040
- Is it a remake? - Re-window.

152
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,580
- Is it a remake of Rear Window?

153
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,420
- Rear make?

154
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,140
- I wanna look into her rear window.

155
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,980
Her butthole.

156
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,800
- Rear.

157
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
(laughing)

158
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm gonna look into it, call somebody on the phone

159
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
"My God"

160
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
"You need to see this!"

161
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
"Something has happened in Rihanna's butt!"

162
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,640
"I'm looking to the rear window right now"

163
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Why is it, why are we doing that?

164
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,640
My all red hitchcock

165
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,640
My hitchcock's going bloody insane looking into the rear window

166
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
It's giving me vertigo!

167
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,640
This bird is giving me vertigo!

168
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,040
My bed's looking in a rear window, making my bed get better go.

169
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,540
Looking in that rear window, oh.

170
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
And it's my hour.

171
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,280
Oh, I'm turning into a complete psycho path.

172
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Or a psycho, a normal psycho.

173
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Psycho, just a psycho actually.

174
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Just a psycho.

175
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Not a path, but I'm looking up.

176
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,000
What other movies did he make?

177
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
Dial M for Murder.

178
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm gonna do that.

179
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm gonna dial M for murder still.

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
- Notorious.

181
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,760
- I'm gonna be notoriously on the run

182
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,600
from looking at her butthole.

183
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,200
- It's making my north go north.

184
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
Bye north.

185
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,800
- To catch a thief, I'm gonna catch a queef.

186
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
(laughing)

187
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
- Man.

188
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
- Yeah, that's what Albert Hitchcock would say

189
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,160
if he was alive.

190
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,980
- Hitchcock.

191
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,080
- Yeah, Albert Hitchcock.

192
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
- And then we could make his video

193
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,520
where we're looking at her butthole

194
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,360
and it would be a perfect Kuleshov effect.

195
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,040
- Alfred Crombie and Fitchcock.

196
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
- We could look at her butthole and go,

197
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
Alfred Crombie and Fitchcock do that for--

198
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,920
- Shut up.

199
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,740
- No.

200
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,580
- Do that.

201
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,420
- And it's a shirt.

202
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,240
- No, no, no.

203
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
- And it's a shirt.

204
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,560
- We could look at her butt and in one video,

205
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,080
we could be like, and in one video we could be like.

206
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,160
- Oh yeah, so they're actually making the same face.

207
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,560
- That would determine whether or not--

208
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,400
- Yeah.

209
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,220
- Her butthole's making the same face.

210
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,060
- Well, so the thing is--

211
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,640
- Coola Shavafeh, that is a cool name.

212
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,680
Coola Pull, man.

213
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
- Coola Shavafeh?

214
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,340
- Yeah.

215
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,180
- Everyone knows that, man.

216
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,000
- They're putting our degrees to work.

217
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,480
- If you've seen a YouTube video, you know that shit.

218
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,200
You see a movie, right, and it's a woman and she's wearing a dress and you're like,

219
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,160
"Okay, that's nothing." But suspense is when you put the camera under the dress.

220
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,960
You show what's under there. Everyone knows what's under there. People go, "Ahh!"

221
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
Yeah. Oh my God. Then it gets tense.

222
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
It's your bloody rear window.

223
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,560
Yeah.

224
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
And my bloody rear window.

225
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
That's just too fun. It's too fun to do, man. I love doing--

226
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,240
Rope.

227
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,640
I've gotten to the point--

228
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,440
Shooting a rope.

229
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
What's rope?

230
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,360
Rope.

231
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,080
Hitchcock movie?

232
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
Did he make a movie called Rope?

233
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,840
Rope.

234
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,380
Why'd you not get you I just thought of it chest row I did I said oh say it like that

235
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,600
There we go

236
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,820
Shooting a rope white rope

237
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,760
Row he didn't make a movie called white rope

238
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,080
No, I'm gonna make a white rope in the

239
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:05,280
Diana's rear window mm-hmm. That's what that's the through line here Alfred Hitchcock probably is the best names for sex

240
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,140
Yeah, or sex names for movies. What's that?

241
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:22,200
Huh the train goes into this it's supposed to the train goes into the hole oh come on

242
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,840
Oh, that's um fucking is that sex movie God. What movie is that sex fucker is it that's that?

243
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Yeah, that's North by Northwest. Yeah, yeah speaking of

244
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Things like that

245
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I watched uh, no, I just watched that Bloodhound Gang music video for Foxtrot

246
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,760
I showed my girlfriend this week. I've never seen that one. Foxtrot uniform Charlie Kilo where Bam is in a banana car

247
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,440
I've never seen that one. Oh, yeah, Bam is in a banana car

248
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,620
He drives around Westchester PA and he keeps seeing hot women construction workers

249
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,080
But at the end of the music video he gives his banana to a gay man at the end of the tunnel

250
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,240
And it's fun.

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
- Were they a purely funny album or song maker?

252
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,920
- Yeah. - Artist?

253
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,720
- They were like if a family guy was rap.

254
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
- Yeah, put your hands in my pants

255
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
and I bet you'll feel nuts.

256
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,400
- Yeah, they have, I defend them all the time.

257
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,960
They have bars.

258
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,160
- I thought that was euphemistic.

259
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,960
- Mighty tighty whitey and I'm smuggling plums.

260
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
- Some are nuts.

261
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,720
- That's a lyric from the Mope.

262
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,680
- Mighty tighty whitey and I'm smuggling plums.

263
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,520
I don't get that at all.

264
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,120
- It's fun to say.

265
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,920
- So it's more of a MF Doom kind of like nonsense.

266
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,440
- They say that. - It's about food.

267
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,980
- If you say that enough times,

268
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,860
the Pac-Man will show up and smoke crack with you.

269
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,360
- Are you, what is wrong with you?

270
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,840
- That's from the, that's the music video.

271
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,880
It would make a lot of sense if you saw the music video.

272
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,800
- What are the Pac-Men?

273
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,560
- Pac-Man shows up and smokes crack with them.

274
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,160
- Oh, I thought you said the Pac-Man, right?

275
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,200
Am I crazy?

276
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
You said the Pac-Man show up.

277
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,240
- I processed Pac-Man.

278
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,440
- Oh, I heard the Pac-Man.

279
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,920
I was like, what's that?

280
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
- The Bloodhound Gang mope music video.

281
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,080
This is why I think their family guy was a rap.

282
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,200
out of nowhere, Pac-Man shows up and smokes crack with them.

283
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
- That is funny.

284
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,760
- They had that music video where it was like

285
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,680
the Why You Know guy and the Forever Alone guy

286
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,760
and the-- - They did that?

287
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,360
- And the Trollolol guy.

288
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,800
- They did a Weezer. - It was called the meme medley.

289
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,680
- You're thinking of Weezer.

290
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,520
- No, I'm thinking of the Porthouse Gang.

291
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,860
- They also did that song,

292
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,360
♪ What are the locks, baby ♪

293
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,200
- Yeah, they did that.

294
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,520
♪ Chackie, chackie, chackie, my old one ♪

295
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,960
- My house at my-- - My roommate loves that band.

296
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,120
- I was visiting my aunt and uncle

297
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,080
and they have a little cousin who's like three years old,

298
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,980
three or four. And he got his grandmother, got him a little

299
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,000
tricycle, a little toy tricycle. And it has a speaker in it that

300
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,080
whenever you ride the tricycle, it plays What Does the Fox Say?

301
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
And he got it like this year.

302
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I would fucking, if my mom came and did that, oh my god, she'd be going home.

303
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
She would not be coming to Christmas ever again.

304
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,080
He kept getting on it and started pedaling. It was just like, it was to the point where,

305
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,280
So long I didn't even wreck. I just heard the music of it. I was like what is that?

306
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:10,000
It's like what why do I know this and then I'd be shooting the tires off that thing crazy

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,020
I'd be setting IEDs all around my house. They have a funny toy to exist off. You'll this had that song, Massachusetts

308
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,560
My roommate loves to used to love to show us that video all the time. Yeah

309
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,620
Yeah, yeah, it's on he likes Yilvas. I like that song that song's funny you like funny music

310
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:38,440
Have you heard of have you heard of these guys Pete and Baz they're like old UK drill rappers, that's not funny music

311
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,360
That's not that funny, but that video where it's not them

312
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
It's the other guys where the it's the bald guy the other guys has is a funny movie Norman Payne

313
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480

What does he fucking say?

315
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
I gotta take a piss in a shit and a wank in a tree?

316
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
That's not funny as hell.

317
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
The bald guy?

318
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I think you're confusing though, like that's not

319
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I mean like you sit around listening to the Lonely Island.

320
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
No. Yes you do.

321
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
You love the Lonely Island.

322
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Not this weekend, it was Bloodhound Gang this weekend.

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Incredibad was last weekend.

324
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Next week, Rucka Rucka Rooka.

325
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Throw it on the ground.

326
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
That's my ringtone.

327
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I throw it on the ground.

328
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
- That's a good cut.

329
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,880
That's an old school one,

330
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
one of those old school ones

331
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,840
where the concept was not very strong.

332
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,680
- Yeah.

333
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,500
(laughing)

334
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,440
- Yeah, it's clear that they just like can't--

335
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,560
- It's clear that they made them do a song a week

336
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,400
for a fucking year.

337
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,240
- Yeah.

338
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
(laughing)

339
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,480
- They probably wrote that at four in the morning.

340
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
- Yeah, I remember--

341
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,720
- They were like, this is gonna be so funny.

342
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,020
- I feel like I never listened to the full songs

343
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,720
of any of those, and I would just hear a hundred people

344
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,120
at my middle school or whatever just go,

345
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,320
"Jizz in my pants."

346
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
And I'd be like, "Whoa, that sounds funny."

347
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,000
(laughing)

348
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
You know what it was?

349
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,560
- Jizz in my Pants had a grip on the culture.

350
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,400
- Yeah, for real. - Dude.

351
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
- Like a boss. - Like a boss.

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
- It was Jizz in my Pants like a boss

353
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,280
and threw it on the ground.

354
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,560
Those were the big three I feel like

355
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,600
where I just heard the,

356
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,160
for me I heard those three.

357
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,420
- Lazy Sunday.

358
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,680
- I'm on a boat. - No, because those are.

359
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
- I'm on a boat. - I'm on a boat,

360
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,340
that's true. - I'm on a boat

361
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,180
is bigger than threw it on the ground.

362
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,020
- No, Lazy Sunday was probably

363
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,120
of those, the smallest in that.

364
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
- But in terms of-- - What are you talking about?

365
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,400
That was the biggest YouTube video ever.

366
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,720
- In terms of people just saying the one line.

367
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
Not like the song being popular, but just of somebody like, "I threw it on the ground!"

368
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,440
You know what I really love to do is look up parodies of Lonely Island songs that people make.

369
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
Those are good. We were looking at that for a while.

370
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,080
Yeah.

371
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
The "I'm on a Boat" ones where it's like...

372
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,520
The "I'm on a Boat" with the guys... It's like the guys doing... It's like an office and they're

373
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,160
having their Christmas party or their... Some kind of party and they made a whole thing called

374
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,960
"I Gotta Moe" and it's for Movember.

375
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,000
- It's almost always either an office thing

376
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,560
or like a guy's getting married and his buddy's like,

377
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
"You know what we need to make, dude?"

378
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,600
- Yeah, we're gonna walk out to this.

379
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,920
- "I threw it on the cake."

380
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,240
- Yeah, no, no, you remember the one--

381
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,520
- "I threw it on her finger."

382
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,360
- There's the one--

383
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
- "We are a part of the system."

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,840
- "I'm on a boat" parody.

385
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,000
There's the "I'm on a boat" parody

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,600
that was for a wedding reception.

387
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,080
- "We are a part of the system."

388
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,240
"I threw it on her finger."

389
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
I have a new brother and sister.

390
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,600
In-law.

391
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,080
There's a there's an I'm on a boat parody that was made for a wedding reception.

392
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,240
We are missus and mister.

393
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,280
The chorus of the song is instead of I'm on a boat, it's we're so in love.

394
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,640
I heard that one too.

395
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah. We're so in love.

396
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,000
We're so in love. Everybody look at us because we are so in love.

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,400
Yeah, that is a good fucking song.

398
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:34,960
I love that song.

399
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,160
I love I just love parodies of parodies because it's like

400
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,560
It's already like, the song's already funny.

401
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
What are you gonna do?

402
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
How are you gonna tweak it to make it better?

403
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Well, because you gotta personalize it,

404
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
'cause I've definitely heard songs where I was like,

405
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,920
"This is some funny shit. I wish my name was in it."

406
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
Yeah.

407
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
You know? Tribute.

408
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,560
"This is just for Caleb."

409
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
That could be Tribute by Shane Shazam.

410
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
"You gotta believe me, and he don't have no hair."

411
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,560
"A long-ass fucking time ago in a town called Caleb's house."

412
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,560
"Lived there a guy named Caleb, he was quiet as a mouse."

413
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
That could be another lyric.

414
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
That would be a lie though.

415
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
And though he...

416
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
It could be about how you got loud as fuck.

417
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Yep, that's when I learned to access my voice.

418
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
You are loud as fuck.

419
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Yep, that's true.

420
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Can't take you to the movies.

421
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
I get that though. I think I did a lot of stuff like that.

422
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
We used to just one for one recreate digital shorts.

423
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Yeah.

424
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,560
We used to take a flip video thing and we did the one where he punches him in the face.

425
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
That was on my YouTube for a very long time.

426
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,520
long time. I wish... It still is I think. I think there's still a video of me

427
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,320
punching my brother called "Punched into Face" on YouTube on his... I wish I still

428
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,520
had mine. His Pivot YouTube channel. Jimbo the office worker. It's gone.

429
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,680
It's been scrubbed completely from the internet. Pivot was awesome dude. Pivot was so sick.

430
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,920
The sketch that I wrote with my cousin. No we can't find it. There might be

431
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,880
some compromising personal information in that video. Yeah. Yeah might have

432
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,120
I have a picture or video of my little tiny--

433
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,640
I can't even find Jimbo the office.

434
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,400
My doodle.

435
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,920
Your doodle?

436
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,320
Your doodle was not on YouTube.

437
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
I think I put my doodle on YouTube.

438
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
You doodled on YouTube.

439
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,880
On YouTube, yeah.

440
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,200
You did not doodle on YouTube.

441
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,360
I put my doodle on YouTube.

442
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
You didn't, bro.

443
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,840
Yeah, I did.

444
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,780
I know that you didn't.

445
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,600
Well, he's already found you.

446
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,880
Jubio's already found you here.

447
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,560
Oh, you're right.

448
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,880
I live in Irvine, California.

449
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,120
Yeah, it's got your middle name right there, Caleb Undefined--

450
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,440
Caleb Undefined Pits.

451
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,680
Caleb X Pits.

452
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,800
29, 20--

453
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,720
That's such a cool nickname or middle name there, Undefined.

454
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,140
That is fucking awesome.

455
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,100
That's kind of what a nerd would name their kid, though.

456
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,600
That's true.

457
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,180
Undefined.

458
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,100
Did you guys make sketch comedy when you were children?

459
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,600
Oh, yeah.

460
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,940
I was just talking about it.

461
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,900
When I was 10 years old, I wrote a sketch with my cousin.

462
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,620
What was it?

463
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,140
Where a guy is at an office, and he

464
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,860
keeps getting asked the same question,

465
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,060
and then he shoots his boss.

466
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,140
But then he finds--

467
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,900
he keeps getting asked where the TPS reports are.

468
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,380
Really?

469
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,140
And then he finds-- and then he goes, oh, they're right here.

470
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,820
And then the credits roll, and I think it's like Kevin Rudolph

471
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,340
or something.

472
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
That's sick.

473
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,540
I wish I had that fucking video.

474
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,780
We definitely made a bunch of stupid YouTube sketches.

475
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,620
The one that I remember that's completely lost the time that I wish I could watch again

476
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,220
was like when I was too young to understand.

477
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,700
It was probably like elementary school, maybe like third grade.

478
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,220
My friend made Animal Wars.

479
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Whoa.

480
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
That is sick.

481
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
What's Animal Wars?

482
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
It's about stuffed animals.

483
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,540
I made some stuffed animal shit.

484
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,700
You remember the ugly dolls?

485
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
We made a video.

486
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,540
I've talked about this with Pierce at least, maybe not on the podcast.

487
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,100
we used to make, we made a web series called Retardamon.

488
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,940
- Yeah, I remember it.

489
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,760
- Yeah.

490
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,600
- You've talked about this a bunch of times.

491
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,820
- I've got Retardamon, sorry, yeah.

492
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,500
But I don't think I mentioned that it was ugly dolls

493
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,860
were the Pokemon.

494
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,700
- Yeah.

495
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,520
- I can say it if I want to.

496
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,180
- My little brother got really into Lego stop motion.

497
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,580
- Uh-huh, oh, that was fun too.

498
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,220
- But he didn't like, I mean, he wasn't good at it.

499
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,060
- That's too hard, man.

500
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,880
- But he would like--

501
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,720
- The people who do that are fun.

502
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,560
- Yeah, no, no, he never--

503
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,580
- Those people are all rich now.

504
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,140
The kids who were doing that shit.

505
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,980
- Yeah, he didn't fucking stick with it.

506
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,820
- Like with it. - Yeah.

507
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,280
- Yeah. - I don't know what he done.

508
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,660
- Animal Wars was very,

509
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,080
Animal Wars was very,

510
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,500
had a kind of a geopolitical focus.

511
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,340
- Tell us. - You know what I did though?

512
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,180
- There was stuff,

513
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,140
but there was, they had,

514
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,180
all the animals were from different countries.

515
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,020
- Was kind of cool. - Some of them were.

516
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,400
- Wait. - Sorry, I'm on my own

517
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,240
train of thought.

518
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,060
- Yeah, I can-- - I'm thinking out loud,

519
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,900
I'm sorry.

520
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,100
- Would you get the animals

521
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,740
and have them fight on camera?

522
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,220
Were you the one who uploaded all the videos?

523
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,060
It was like,

524
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,880
Mongoose versus Cobra. - They were,

525
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
that's the thing,

526
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,560
they literally weren't even,

527
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,380
we never even uploaded them anywhere.

528
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,980
we didn't even know how to get the video from the video camera to the computer.

529
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,080
So we would watch it on the video camera and be like, "Look, this is Animal Wars,"

530
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,680
and watch it on the little display thing on the side.

531
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,780
I made a full hour-long movie when I was a kid.

532
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,180
Really?

533
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,580
Yeah, it was a horror movie called Revenge of the Tiki,

534
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:51,780
and it had a 15-minute scene that was basically just what I thought was a one-to-one recreation

535
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,480
of the Dumb and Dumber toilet chocolate scene.

536
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,020
You just, yeah, I forgot, I also,

537
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,380
I made, me and my friends made a movie at the media center

538
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,760
called The Disappearing Boy.

539
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,840
No!

540
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,680
What happened to him?

541
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,500
He disappeared.

542
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,880
Fucked me, really?

543
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
That is bloody terrifying.

544
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
And then he met the inventor.

545
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
The inventor of what?

546
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,000
The inventor, he said, I'm the inventor.

547
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,240
Holy crap, was it like God?

548
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,360
And you could tell he was the inventor

549
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,000
'cause he had, he had a piece of bark on his arm

550
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,320
that we said was like an invention.

551
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,540
- Wow. - And the invention was a piece of wood

552
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,440
on his arm? - He walked around like this

553
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,640
with a piece of parka. (laughing)

554
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,840
- Kids are so stupid, man.

555
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,800
- We're genius.

556
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,240
- The one cool thing that my brother did do

557
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,000
with his Lego thing, I helped him out with it,

558
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,280
but he took his Indiana Jones that he had

559
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,120
and then we painted the face to look like Rorschach

560
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,800
from Watchmen. - Whoa.

561
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,000
- Rorschach Jones. - Uh-huh.

562
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,880
It looked cool. - Indiana Shack.

563
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,520
- Damn. - He replaced the hands

564
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,400
with like, we like made like a little Rorschach Lego.

565
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,060
'Cause we were like, I was 11, so he was probably nine.

566
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,680
And then we saw Watchmen and we were like,

567
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,960
his mask is cool, nothing else about him.

568
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,680
I don't know anything else.

569
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,160
I don't know anything else about him.

570
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,320
I just think he looks cool.

571
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,160
- The mask was cool, dude.

572
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,120
- The mask was so cool.

573
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,920
- I remember the first, I remember when somebody

574
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,760
brought in Watchmen, this kid, Paul Winder,

575
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,840
he brought in Watchmen and he was like,

576
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,440
Caleb, you wanna see a penis?

577
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,200
And I was like, hell no!

578
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,680
- Patrick Wilson's dong, right?

579
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,080
- And I went, shit.

580
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,280
I might be gay.

581
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I've said it before.

582
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,280
You know how Watchmen made me know I was gay?

583
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,600
As I read Watchmen, in my takeaway, I was like, "Damn, Rorschach's mask, it represents black

584
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
and white morality."

585
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
Holy fucking shit.

586
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
That's crazy.

587
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,560
Damn, you were a different kind of gay.

588
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
I was looking at the cock.

589
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
I was a child.

590
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,640
I've talked about it up and down.

591
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
It's its uncompromising worldview.

592
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,640
And I was saying, "It's his uncut cock."

593
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Look at that thing.

594
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
That thing is uncut.

595
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,960
There needs to be more blue wieners in that movie.

596
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,460
I what do you think?

597
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:54,960
They did it.

598
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,760
I didn't even see it.

599
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I never saw the movie.

600
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,460
Oh, you never saw it?

601
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,120
No, he didn't bring the movie into it

602
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,080
and show me the DVD and say, look at the cock on the DVD.

603
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
You scan it with your eye.

604
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,080
Oh, yeah, I can tell that there's cocks in this movie.

605
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,360
There's a big blue wiener in that movie.

606
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
I was watching the fucking--

607
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,960
I think he shows his--

608
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,640
I was looking at the comic book.

609
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
I think he shows his penis in the TV show.

610
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,640
Oh, you're talking about the comic book.

611
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,120
I was talking about the movie.

612
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,760
The TV show.

613
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,200
The sequel TV show.

614
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,880
Yeah, that guy apparently has a big one.

615
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,080
Yeah, I've seen the show.

616
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,920
He's got a big one.

617
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,440
He shows it in the show. It's the only reason I really watched Watchmen was

618
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,360
Me for their cocks, would you get man? Would you guys show your balls and your dick in a movie?

619
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,480
Yeah, I think about that. I'm getting paid enough

620
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,600
I don't think but last night I think it depends on I don't care if I get Terrence depends on the context

621
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:34,840
Yeah

622
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,980
So last night I was watching hateful 8 and there's a part in the movie

623
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:44,880
Where there's a character in his entire part of the movie is he walks around in the cold with his dong all shriveled up and

624
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,880
his balls hanging and then he sucks Michael Jackson's cock.

625
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,880
He sucks Samuel Jackson's cock and then he dies.

626
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
That scene is so sick.

627
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
It's a great scene.

628
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
I don't remember that movie at all.

629
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,480
I remember seeing that in theaters and being like, "Oh my fucking God."

630
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,760
I saw that in theaters.

631
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,920
I remember I had a flashback to when I saw it in theaters and thinking then, "I wouldn't

632
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
do that."

633
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,240
I was like, "You couldn't pay me enough to be that fucking guy in this movie."

634
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,520
I saw that in the theaters but that was back in the days when I was smoking weed and I fell

635
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,960
asleep through that the whole movie long movie yeah I fell asleep and I woke up

636
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,760
and it was like the end of the movie what's the extended version last night

637
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,960
didn't need to extend that movie yeah enough there was like parts of the movie

638
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,960
where nothing fucking happens for 20 minutes right it's just like footage of

639
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,040

640
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,680

642
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,220
you're saying nothing right now.

643
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,860
- Kurt Russell broke an antique guitar on the set by accident.

644
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
- Yep.

645
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,520
(laughing)

646
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,360
- That's what I was trying to remember.

647
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,180
- He breaks a guitar.

648
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,020
- Go on.

649
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,080
- Why'd you remember that out loud to yourself

650
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
looking at the ground?

651
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,120
- I don't know.

652
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,920
- You're like, "Kurt Russell breaks a guitar."

653
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,580
- It was a fun piece of trivia.

654
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,420
It's a fun piece of trivia.

655
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,840
- Antique guitar.

656
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,740
- It's a guitar from the 1800s that he broke.

657
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,920
- Who gives a motherfucking shit?

658
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,080
- The Martin Guitar Company.

659
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,800
- Remember seeing that movie in theaters

660
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,080
and you come back after the intermission,

661
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,320
you hear the narrator's voice,

662
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,520
you turn to your friend, you're like,

663
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I know who that is.

664
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,440
(laughing)

665
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,320
I don't know if you know who's talking right now,

666
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,160
I know who that is.

667
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,980
- Who's talking?

668
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,820
- It's Quentin Tarantino.

669
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,660
- Oh my God.

670
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,480
- That's his voice?

671
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,320
- That's his voice.

672
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,160
- I don't think in the extended version.

673
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,880
- And so they're in the cabin now.

674
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,920
- They definitely used a different person

675
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,760
for the extended version.

676
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,580
- Really?

677
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,840
- Yeah, it's like a whole different voice.

678
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
- Bruce Byrne?

679
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,760
- No, it's just in the movie.

680
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,520
- And their domergue has a little bit of a secret.

681
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,680
It's like a weird, like, audible voice.

682
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,520
Anyway, it's probably his voice. Would you show your balls? Yeah. If in cock,

683
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
if they were like, it's going to be 10 degrees,

684
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,800
it's going to be 10 degrees and the whole world's are going to know forever.

685
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,880
The side of your car. I'd rather keep it a secret dude. Straight female.

686
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,040
You can also get like a, uh, uh,

687
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,760
you could get a VFX artist to make your, I would say yes.

688
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,520
On camera. That's the only way to win is you tell them I'll only do it.

689
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,160
If you give me a prosthetic tiny cock, because then it's like,

690
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,840
Hollywood rumor, they had to use a prosthetic, his cock was too big.

691
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,180
They had to make it look like a pinto bean.

692
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,400
I would say yes, I would take the money, I would get to the shoot, I would start the

693
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
scene, I would start peeing.

694
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
And they would do, "Okay, can we take it again?

695
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Don't pee this time."

696
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,280
I'd pee again.

697
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,560
I'd do it every time until we ran out of daylight.

698
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
To cover you up.

699
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah.

700
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,840
I was like, "I'm sorry, I'm just so nervous."

701
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,840
- Until they draw you naked on the back of your body

702
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,280
and add a little cock at the bottom.

703
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,120
- And then I poop.

704
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,100
- Yeah, you're backwards and you have like rubber underwear

705
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,280
that has a dick.

706
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,480
- Yeah.

707
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,320
- And a mask of your face.

708
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,480
- It's right on your butt.

709
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,120
- Yeah, and you're wearing a diaper, yeah.

710
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,440
- If you work in VFX, you need to make this right now.

711
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,760
We're creating a crazy character for you.

712
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,600
Now that I think--

713
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
- I wanna see this by next week.

714
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
- Now that I think about this, if I was offered this

715
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,080
and some famous director was making a movie

716
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,920
and was like, okay, I want you--

717
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,480
I want you so brother I want you either Russo brothers are like we want you in

718
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,240
our movie but there's gonna be a scene where you're walking through the snow

719
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,400
completely naked and then you have to suck Samuel L Jackson's cock I would be

720
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,000
like didn't hateful a tardy do that you're right I don't think you need that

721
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,680
in your movie right I guess that's a bad hypothetical that's bad yeah yeah but

722
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,440
would you do one where would you do a movie where the entire movie is not even

723
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,600
the scene just the entire movie is like a bunch of hot girls pointing at your tiny

724
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,720
cock going you got a small cock you got your dick is small. Would you guys do that movie?

725
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:43,240
Yeah how much am I getting paid? $40? Yeah. Make it 60. Okay then you do it? Make it 60

726
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,720
and I'm in. That's okay that's okay. Is this the guy whose cock was in the movie?

727
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,860
I think it is him I remember Craig Stark? Whoa. Must be related to Tony Stark. Yeah.

728
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,580
short yeah I'll say play Henry short played long-haired freak and licorice

729
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,740
pizza hey that's everyone in the goddamn movie see but I think this is what you

730
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,220
end up doing if you just show your cock in a movie you turn you also play

731
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:14,060
robber and robber and Emily the criminal he got robbed of his fucking manhood in

732
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,460
that movie I'll tell you that much by Samuel L Jackson did so he's a honey boy

733
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,940
this Shia LaBeouf mmm Shia LaBeouf Shia LaBeouf me used to be the funny boy when

734
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,340
he was on Transformers.

735
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,740
Transformers, he was pretty funny.

736
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,840
He was so funny in Transformers.

737
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,040
I would say Bumblebee is the comedic relief of that movie, though.

738
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,240
No, it's actually Skids.

739
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,040
Yeah, Skids and then Jazz and Bebop.

740
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,840
That's in the second one, though.

741
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,740
Yeah, I think one of them is named Mudflap.

742
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,240
Jazz and Mudflap.

743
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Bebop is Ninja Turtles.

744
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,340
I mean, are you thinking of the very racist twin?

745
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,540
Yeah, I think one of them's name is Mudflap.

746
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:50,740
Yeah.

747
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,640
I can't remember what the other one is.

748
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,280
jazz and or bebop it's be about my rocks and that's a pig and a rhino yeah what

749
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:16,240
I know it's a it's a it's a it's a boar and a rhino yeah like a yeah it's got

750
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Optimus Primal, he's got the Predacons, he's got G-Tor,

751
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Beetle Borgs, you know what I wish they would make a movie for?

752
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
They stopped making that because they ran out of footage in Japan.

753
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,240
I want them to make a movie about Zoids.

754
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Yes dude, fucking Zoids!

755
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Zoids is the perfect knockoff, like Transformers, like Gundam type thing.

756
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,680
thing because like it's only it's other all dogs yeah all the robots are just

757
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,600
giant dogs there's no they're not oh yeah now I remember these they all look

758
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,760
exactly the same. Zoids was a Toonami like that was the number one Toonami. I had Zoids

759
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,680
Gameboy Advance game. I had a game called Zoids Legacy. No I'm thinking of

760
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,720
Spectrobes. Look how few types of Zoids they are they all look literally exactly the same.

761
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,000
Spectrobes, Spectrobes was like Disney's RPG for the DS that like was

762
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,320
essentially all of it looked like this right? You know what they should

763
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,920
bring back? What? Pokemon. Yeah. Whatever happened to Pokemon? Buddy, hey I've got

764
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,960
big news. What's the news? Scarlet and Violet takes place in España. I'd like

765
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,160
to see Scarlett Johansson capture her in a pokeball. And Violet. Yeah. And get Violet with her.

766
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,840
her. Attack her. Don't attack her. Rip her arms and her legs off. Put her in a pokeball,

767
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,640
rip her head off. AHHHHH! Kill you, Scar Jo. Don't do that to Scar Jo. I'm just kidding.

768
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,160
Scar Jost. She's gonna be soon. Yeah. When she's wed to Jost. I'm happy for them. Jost

769
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:51,560
wedding. Yeah. Yeah, imagine the roast Jost at that wedding. My god, imagine the toast

770
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,920
The Joest wedding. The Joest jokes.

771
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,240
The Joest jokes. The Roast jokes.

772
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
The Roast jokes. Imagine Scar Joes jokes.

773
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,280
Scar Joes Joes jokes. They're gonna be badly scarred from those Joest jokes.

774
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,800
Those Joes jokes.

775
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,000
The Roast jokes when Joests elopes with Scar Joes.

776
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,680
Meanwhile they're doing a weeding update.

777
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,560
Yep. Yep. With Michael Cheba.

778
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,520
What the fuck is wrong with us man? We have actually some kind of fucking virus.

779
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,440
I found out today that people get carbon monoxide poisoning and they don't even die.

780
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
They just get really fucking stupid.

781
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,080
What do you think happened to us?

782
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
I don't know, but I think it that. I think it that.

783
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,560
I saw... I think it that. I don't know, but I think it that.

784
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,080
While I was doing the research for today's episode, we'll get to that later,

785
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,760
but while I was doing the research, I found this thing that was like...

786
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,640
Somebody went on Reddit and was like,

787
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,680
"I think that somebody's sneaking into my house and...

788
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,840
like breaking into my house and writing post-it notes to me about things that I have to do

789
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,760
for the day and like I think I have to go to the police, like this is getting really, really

790
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
scary.

791
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Oh, I saw this.

792
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,680
Yeah, and then somebody was like, "I think you might have carbon monoxide poisoning,"

793
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,280
and they went and they had like a hundred parts per million of carbon monoxide.

794
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
That shit was crazy.

796
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
But I thought that carbon monoxide just killed you.

797
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,600
I didn't realize that it could just make you crazy.

798
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,280
Well, it depends on how bad it is because it's how weird Al's parents passed away.

799
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
They passed.

800
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
They passed.

801
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
They passed away.

802
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
Oh, they passed.

803
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm trying to be respectful.

804
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm trying to be respectful to the weirdo.

805
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,000
That's how they passed on.

806
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,560
That's how we lost them.

807
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,320
I hate when people say pass away.

808
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,200
Yeah, I definitely have,

809
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,440
'cause hanging out at your house when you had the gas leak,

810
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,120
I, maybe it's just getting older and realizing,

811
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,580
yes, I am very stupid,

812
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,160
but I've totally gotten stupider from that.

813
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,000
I don't think it was that.

814
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,240
I think your house was Jupiter.

815
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,080
You would only come to my house--

816
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,040
And I'm going to get more stupid.

817
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,320
Every once in a while, first of all.

818
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,880
Also, natural gas leaks are not,

819
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,200
it's not neurotoxic.

820
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,040
It just makes less oxygen in the air, basically.

821
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,880
- Well.

822
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,720
- But it's definitely not good for you.

823
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,400
- To each his own.

824
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,520
- Yes, if something happened to you, I'm not gonna.

825
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,360
- Yeah.

826
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,800
- No, you've always been pretty stupid.

827
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,640
- I don't know.

828
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,920
I don't know if I've been this stupid.

829
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,760
- You used to be stupider, actually.

830
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,160
- I think you used to be stupider, yeah.

831
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,520
- Because you were fat.

832
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,560
(laughing)

833
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,600
So you had like, you were making poorer choices, too.

834
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,440
- I don't know, I feel like--

835
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,480
- I don't think I was stupid, I think I was just--

836
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,320
- You were definitely dumb.

837
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,160
- I think I was just very sad.

838
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,600
I think you used to be stupider.

839
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,400
I think about it, you definitely used to be really stupid.

840
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,760
I think you used to say some stuff where I was like...

841
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,360
You used to be way stupider.

842
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,480
Never mind, you're still so stupid.

843
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,560
Yeah, I'm still pretty fucking dumb.

844
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,080
Yeah.

845
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,120
I got a new couch.

846
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,880
Is it comfy?

847
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,160
It's comfy.

848
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,480
Moving on.

849
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,080
Very comfy.

850
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,720
Next.

851
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,920
I'd like to move on to the couch.

852
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,880
Next.

853
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,320
I'm jealous.

854
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,400
Can I come spend the night?

855
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,320
You can.

856
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,160
Just sleep on the couch.

857
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,040
It's so fucking comfy.

858
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
And I slept on the couch.

859
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,880
You slept on my couch.

860
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,680
- He slept over my house one time.

861
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,520
- I did.

862
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
- 'Cause there wasn't any--

863
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,360
- I slept over.

864
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,200
- All my wife's family was in town.

865
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,040
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

866
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,860
- So he slept over.

867
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,700
- I remember that.

868
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,600
- I, yeah, convinced all my roommates that I got,

869
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,040
that we were getting, that we were gonna break up.

870
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,880
And so I came in--

871
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,000
- Did I tell you that?

872
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,680
- Yeah, yeah, and so I came in and I was like.

873
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,720
(laughing)

874
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,000
And Neil was like, "Hey, buddy, hey."

875
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,640
Like, everybody's being so nice to me.

876
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Neil and Alex were like, "Oh, oh, Caleb, oh."

877
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,480
- Oh, that's funny!

878
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,320
- You wanna play X-Box?

879
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,140
(laughing)

880
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,320
- Everyone is saying, the first thing that everyone said

881
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,980
when they saw you was, "Hey, buddy."

882
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,040
(laughing)

883
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,020
- They talked to me like I was a dog.

884
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,860
(laughing)

885
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,680
- It's awesome.

886
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
- You were like a make a wish kid.

887
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,360
- Yeah, "Hey, buddy."

888
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,160
- And then your last wish was coming over to my house

889
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,400
and playing Mario Kart.

890
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,240
- Yeah.

891
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,060
- That'd be my last wish.

892
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,080
- Everybody's letting me win Mario Kart shit.

893
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,600
Like, damn, dude.

894
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,960
They have blue shells, they're not throwing 'em.

895
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
It was awesome.

896
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,620
(laughing)

897
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,460
- Yeah.

898
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,280
- It was a really good time.

899
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
- That sounds like a good experience.

900
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,640
your house. You guys have sat on my old couch and it's uncomfortable.

901
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,480
You remember how uncomfortable it was? It was an uncomfortable couch.

902
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,120
It's nice of you that you never said it. I mean I knew it all along.

903
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,520
I didn't want to embarrass you. But this new one, it's bigger, fit more people, it's

904
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,040
more comfortable, it's longer, it is uncut, it hasn't been cut apart at all.

905
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,400
- Oh, that's good. - It's completely,

906
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,640
and it retains, the sensation is completely intact.

907
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,840
- So when we do succession nights,

908
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,400
when that comes back on-- - Yes, and it has arms.

909
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,240
- It's gonna be at your house.

910
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
- It has arms.

911
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,040
- You remember my old couch, the fainting couch?

912
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,880
- Yes, I do remember the fainting couch.

913
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,320
- The which couch? - Is it like that?

914
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,160
- The which couch?

915
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,380
- The fainting couch that I had.

916
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,240
- What does that mean?

917
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,020
Remember he had that shitty weird couch?

918
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,320
- That was not that shitty.

919
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,160
- Mine is not shitty, so that--

920
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,800
- No, it's not like that at all, it's like a nice couch.

921
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,640
- That couch was actually comfortable as hell.

922
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,360
- I slept on it a couple times, too short.

923
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
- Yeah, it was just too short.

924
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
- Yeah, this new one, three cushion couch.

925
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,440
- Holy fuck.

926
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,880
- Remember how I was in my apartment for a fucking year?

927
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,720
- Yeah, I do.

928
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,360
- I had two couches at my apartment for so long.

929
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,860
- Which you're thinking, wait,

930
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,240
every guy's biggest fucking dream is his couch.

931
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,080
- But no.

932
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,920
- My dad has two couches right now.

933
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,240
- There was a couch behind the couch.

934
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,320
You can see it in the prank ass video.

935
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,540
There's another couch in my apartment

936
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,880
because it was my old roommate Joe's old couch

937
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,280
and he did not want to move it and I don't blame him

938
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
because getting that into the apartment

939
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,260
almost killed the boat. You shouldn't have to move a couch. I agree. No, that's what

940
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,580
people are for. You should get to cut it up and shred it. Definitely. And still get the

941
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,460
money from selling it. Yeah. You know what I hate to move? A piano. Ohhhh. Look at that

942
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,260
one over there. We've never even... why don't we plug that in right now? Start playing.

943
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,740
Because we gotta start the rest of the show. You're talking babbling nonsense like a baby.

944
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,620
Babylon nonsense. Okay. Well what's the breast of the show? The breast of the show? That's

945
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,660
you I didn't say breast but you are the breast you are the base of the bread I

946
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,780

947
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:50,140

948
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,540
likes to look at me sure I like to suck on you you're full of milk because I

949
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,900
like to say I'll take your jiggle your chock full I'll take it you're chock

950
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,980
full of milk and you should be bigger.

951
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,120
- So we brought in something exciting today.

952
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,560
- What was the prize of that?

953
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,380
- It is a magic book.

954
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,640
- Holy fuck.

955
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,260
- Oh, that was way too loud.

956
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,100
- What?

957
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,620
- That was way too loud in my fucking,

958
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,440
in the, or sorry, there's a Bible on the thing,

959
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,500
in my effin' normal ears.

960
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,940
- It's not a Bible, it's just a magic book.

961
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,300
- A Bible. - No, it's a Bible.

962
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,380
- And it's what we call a magic book,

963
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,060
because this book, let me tell you,

964
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,140
Quite literally, quite literally,

965
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,220
this book has every story ever told.

966
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,140
- Wow, it tells. - Or every story

967
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,580
that ever needs to be told.

968
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,420
- Every story you ever need.

969
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,940
A lot of people say, oh, I like my favorite author's

970
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,220
John Green and shit.

971
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,620
They're fucking faulting our stars

972
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,420
based on a series out of this book.

973
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,780
- If we're reading out of this book,

974
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,140
why don't we play the piano? - Israel hath sinned.

975
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,860
That's what I'm seeing here.

976
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,140
- Where?

977
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,260
- Joshua 7, 11.

978
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,220
- Oh, they let a seven-year-old read that?

979
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,380
- Israel hath sinned.

980
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,980
- Holy shit. - Who's Israel?

981
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,500
Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turn their

982
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,340
backs before their enemies.

983
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
That's in the Bible?

984
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,660
That's the top thing in the Bible?

985
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,460
The top thing is top right.

986
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,660
Well you heard it here first.

987
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
So go ahead and tell the people what we're doing today then Cameron.

988
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
It's story time.

989
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,300
It's story time, straight out of the Bible man.

990
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,700
Straight from the word of the Lord himself.

991
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,380
And I actually have to grab my reading glasses.

992
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Call me motherfucking Bible man.

993
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,420
If somebody wants to read a story first, I have to you have reading glasses

994
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,260
I won't grab my reading glasses go ahead. I have a story I could maybe read

995
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:37,820
You know what are the odds that I flip to the exact right page pretty high it seems

996
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:47,560
Pretty high pretty good all right go ahead tell us I need I might need somebody to hold my microphone. I got you

997
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,180
This is a passage from the Bible called what desire will make foolish fanboys do oh

998
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,860
Oh, I remember this verse from when I was going to church.

999
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,500
"Bam always waits for Villa in his dressing room

1000
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,060
after a show."

1001
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,140
Shit, I'm just doing this.

1002
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,500
"Well, it's not just Villa's dressing room,

1003
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,900
technically speaking.

1004
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,260
It's the whole band's.

1005
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,100
But the other guys, they're not jackasses.

1006
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,940
No, that's him.

1007
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,180
They know what goes on here after the show,

1008
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,540
and they have the decency to stay the hell away.

1009
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,580
Bam's running late."

1010
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,980
Sorry, really quickly, what book of the Bible is this?

1011
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,540
This is in the book of Jazia.

1012
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,420
Jazia.

1013
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,020
Jazia.

1014
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,520
Jazia.

1015
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,020
Jazia.

1016
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,900
Jazia.

1017
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,620
Jazia.

1018
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,260
OK, continue.

1019
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,460
Bam's running late.

1020
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,580
He got caught up recording some promo for some DVD

1021
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,060
that he doesn't even remember agreeing to.

1022
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,140
He tried his hardest to move things along

1023
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,940
so he could at least catch some of the set.

1024
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,180
And as unabashed as he is, even he's

1025
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,140
not sure if he could look at an MTV producer in the face

1026
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,220
and say that he's late for his Finnish rock star

1027
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,980
dick sucking appointment.

1028
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,340
So late it is.

1029
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,380
I just wanna note also, my glasses broke this weekend.

1030
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,500
- So you could be getting some of the details wrong.

1031
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,220
- Yeah, but the words could be, some of the words could be.

1032
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,540
- So late it is.

1033
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,940
When he does arrive to the venue, he wastes no time

1034
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,300
and hightails it right to him's designated backstage area,

1035
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,420
following the directions that a flabbergasted

1036
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,060
and starstruck security officer gives him.

1037
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,240
The room he arrives to is pretty bare bones and small,

1038
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,360
paling in comparison to the fanfare the band typically gets

1039
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,000
when they play shows in Europe.

1040
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,440
But for the purpose that they need it for, it'll work fine.

1041
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,080
Throwing himself on the couch, Bam reaches for the pack

1042
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,200
of cigarettes on the coffee table and lights one.

1043
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,600
He doesn't normally smoke cigarettes, but he swears

1044
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,000
he's somehow getting secondhand nicotine addiction

1045
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,080
from Villa.

1046
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,040
Or it could be the taste of cigarettes on Villa's lips

1047
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,680
that he's addicted to.

1048
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,880
He takes a drag and taps his foot along to the sound

1049
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,320
the last few seconds of the kiss of dawn hoping to god there are no plans for an

1050
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,040
encore song tonight patience unsurprisingly never was BAM strong

1051
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:06,760
suit was that was that really so beautiful he's holy ghostin yeah luckily

1052
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,200
another song doesn't follow just the usual thank you we love you now get

1053
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,320
ready for my chemical romance and then the enthusiastic screams from the crowd

1054
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,720
Bam sits upright and glares at the closed door waiting.

1055
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,920
It's about 15 minutes before the door opens and Villa steps into the room with a frustrated huff.

1056
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,720
Bam exhales. You would have thought he'd been waiting for hours.

1057
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,120
"About fucking time you got here!" Bam complains, pouting.

1058
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:38,120
"I haul ass through LA traffic! I still get here before your set ends and it took a really long time for you to walk your ass down the hall!"

1059
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:44,320
Villa chuckles and smirks. "My sincerest apologies, darling," he says, sarcasm evident in his tone.

1060
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,280
Edna Mode? Got caught in a conversation with the singer from Mike Hem,

1061
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,520
Gerald I think his name is? He shakes his head, no no, Gerard that's it. He was

1062
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,080
telling me about how much he liked our set. It was sweet of him to watch it all

1063
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,480
but to say it too? How cute! Kind of slipping into Cosby a little bit.

1064
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,200
No, no. What do you mean? He did a little Cosby. He's not a Bill Cosby. Keep going.

1065
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,760
Bam Scott says he takes another drag from his cigarette. Yeah well you like

1066
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,200
him so much why don't you go and fuck him then well he's performing right now so I

1067
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,480
can't exactly do that Villa says as if on cue the sound of another singer

1068
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,900
screaming San Bernardo he can be heard as the band begins their set but you know

1069
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,960
so another time perhaps he is very pretty yeah right the assholes are

1070
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,320
walking Hot Topic discount bin BAM grumbles stubbornly through he though he

1071
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,080
still immediately scoots towards Villa when he comes to join him on the couch

1072
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:50,420
You can't seriously say you'd rather fuck him over me Villa raises a brow now. I never said that I did did I

1073
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,540
Be careful jealousy isn't very becoming on you

1074
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,060
Jello

1075
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,640
Jealousy

1076
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,440
Villa plucks the cigarette out of BAM's hand and takes a drag besides he exhales the smoke only moves closer his lips

1077
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,400
His lips hovering over BAM as he speaks

1078
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,180
There's only one fanboy. I'll

1079
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:18,820
True there's no way this is five pages on I can stop right now if you want no get a bag get to the good

1080
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,820
Okay, man come on

1081
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:28,600
Well, we were just about to get go. Okay, then go. I'm not I'm not a fanboy BAM mumbles like he doesn't have countless tattoos

1082
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:37,440
Over and he doesn't drop everything to come anywhere in the world just to fuck him and his body isn't trembling begging for Villa

1083
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,880
right now. It's the worst lie in the world and it's not fooling anyone.

1084
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,120
Certainly Villa who gives a dubious look before that smug smirk resurfaces as his

1085
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,720
hips his hands slip under Bam's shirt. "Would you prefer groupie instead? I'd

1086
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,440
prefer whatever gets your dick in my ass right now." It's not very often that Bam

1087
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,080
asks to be fucked especially not so outwardly but what little patience he

1088
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,600
has is gone. Villa spent another the whole time talking about how amazingly

1089
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,540
Stupid the my chemical romance guy is and BAM's not sure how much more he can fucking handle. It's

1090
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:19,640
Exasperating gripping BAM's chin delicately Villa tips his head upwards and smiles now that certainly can be arranged

1091
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,560
He crashes his lips against BAM and kisses him deeply. I don't need to read the rest of this

1092
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:32,760
He fucks BAM R. Jarrah that's in the Bible and that's in the Bible. Thank you for sparing us the every gory detail

1093
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,640
Wait, I'll skip to the I'll skip to the end

1094
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,140
Let's get dick in yeah need to know if they fucking repent at the end or so

1095
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,240
Let me see here

1096
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,500
This great village shit-eating grin morphs into a warm smile. I don't like that. I feel like maybe we

1097
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,480
That makes that a little too literal yeah

1098
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,760
That's right. He is villas number one fan. It's a title

1099
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,340
He will wear with pride something no one can ever take with him especially not some my fucking chemical romance ass clown

1100
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,380
there if you want to see me single-handedly coerce people into

1101
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:13,840
thinking that VAM thinking about VAM again in 2020 feel free to check out my

1102
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,700
okay and then it's but I think there's a printer error this must be new

1103
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,720
international version yeah I don't know this yeah Bible this might be this might

1104
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,960
be one of those Bible has hyperlinks this might be one of those teen graphic

1105
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,400
novels yeah that might be a real story oh yeah here's a Margera and Bill Cosby

1106
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Here's a page we opened to, Leviticus 27.

1107
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,400
What? What?

1108
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,400
The very thought of the Bible is so hilarious to you, you fucking atheist agnostic.

1109
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Which one is...

1110
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
What are you talking about?

1111
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,400
What is going on?

1112
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Leviticus here, this is the one. This is the book, this is the anti-gay book.

1113
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
They're all anti-gay, man. That's why we...

1114
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,240
- Hey man, that's why we're--

1115
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,080
- Yeah, this is the one that says

1116
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,800
man should not land with the, the man with the thing.

1117
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,080
- You're thinking of Invictus, the movie.

1118
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,600
- Oh, I'm thinking of Incubus.

1119
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,440
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1120
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,320
- The band. - Yeah, you are.

1121
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,640
Well, that was a wonderful Bible story, my friend.

1122
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,280
My good fellow.

1123
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,760
Perhaps it's my turn to read one, no?

1124
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,520
- Sure, yeah, you can read the story time.

1125
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,360
- Here, I'll read a couple.

1126
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,680
They're all from the same book.

1127
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,160
Yeah, the motherfucking Bible.

1128
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,000
- Yeah.

1129
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,340
- Let's see, which one do I wanna start with first?

1130
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,800
Real quick, what's y'all's favorite book

1131
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,920
- The entire Bible.

1132
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,120
- My favorite book of the Bible is Leviticus.

1133
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,700
(laughing)

1134
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,560
- I like the Adventures of Hercules.

1135
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,400
- Oh, that's a good one.

1136
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
- Adventures of Hercules are fire.

1137
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,200
- Yeah. - Okay.

1138
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
- And I'm also a big fan of Index.

1139
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,680
- Oh, I like the Book of Shur.

1140
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,520
- Yeah.

1141
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,360
- I like the book--

1142
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,280
- I like the Book of Shur.

1143
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,120
- I like the story of Michael and Toby.

1144
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,080
- Uh-huh.

1145
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,840
- I'm a big fan of the book of Women Fart Stories.

1146
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,080
(laughing)

1147
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,300
- My favorite, hold on, let me flip her open real quick.

1148
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,840
All right, this is a story called Dream GF

1149
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,560
from the book of Women Fart Stories in the Bible.

1150
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,400
Women Fart Stories 2121.

1151
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,200
I love running with my girlfriend.

1152
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,160
She and I usually run outside often.

1153
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,840
She always runs ahead because she knows

1154
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,520
I like her ass in leggings.

1155
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,540
"Hello, we cannot stop," she said.

1156
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,920
"Sure," I said.

1157
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,500
Then she and I went into the woods

1158
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,520
and she pushed me down near a tree and tied me to the tree.

1159
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,380
- Taste this, you're cock bastard.

1160
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,560
- Okay, I can tell the kind of antiquated mindsets

1161
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
that went into this and kind of,

1162
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
this is one of those things where you know,

1163
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,320
the books about like owning slaves and stuff like that.

1164
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,120
These are, we just want to say these are viewpoints

1165
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,000
that people don't hold anymore.

1166
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,080
- It's not, and we can't judge the Bible

1167
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,160
'cause of what it's in it from a different time.

1168
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,520
- It's not like you're gonna stop riding Splash Mountain.

1169
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,360
- Exactly.

1170
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,440
- Yeah, so let's, we know you keep going.

1171
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,760
- So back to the story, she said,

1172
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
taste this, you're cock bastard.

1173
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,960
And then she fez on my face so the whole face vibrated

1174
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,080
and you could feel the smell that was so frantically smelling

1175
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,400
but still good.

1176
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh damn, it smells bad.

1177
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,340
Best hell you smell it, she said.

1178
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,300
I usually pretend I do not like her farts,

1179
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,400
but I have always done so.

1180
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,720
I think if she knew I did, she would stop.

1181
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,680
I sometimes have to put my hands over my crotch

1182
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,960
because otherwise she would see my hard cock,

1183
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,720
but now she had tied my arms around a tree

1184
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,800
and I could not protect my hard penis.

1185
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,100
Hmm, that's what I think it is, she said,

1186
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,840
looking at my hard cock.

1187
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,480
Do you know what? I have always seen your cock get hard by my farts, and I actually understand you.

1188
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,080
I myself can also be ignited by my own farts.

1189
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,200
This is beautiful.

1190
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,320
It's really like, this is Song of Psalms level, like, beautiful poem.

1191
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,800
It's like spousal understanding.

1192
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,800
In that case, I actually have a little surprise for you, then.

1193
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,960
She pulled down her pints, but only so that her ass was visible,

1194
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,560
and then she opened up my fly and out flew my cock hard as cement.

1195
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,280
Hey, the last time there was a fly on pints.

1196
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,480
Oh, shit.

1197
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
True.

1198
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,520
Oh!

1199
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,720
She took my cock and slowly began to touch it on the glands.

1200
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,560
Then she takes a firm grip and starts jerking it really hard.

1201
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,280
Are you ready for another fart?

1202
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,560
I know you like them.

1203
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,720
Sounded like it came a fart, and then I came after it.

1204
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,400
Note, I Google translated this text from my language

1205
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,520
to English, so that's why some parts sound really,

1206
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,040
really weird.

1207
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,480
I don't-- I mean, it's in English.

1208
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,640
I don't know.

1209
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,000
Originally, you have to imagine it was Hebrew or something,

1210
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,500
right?

1211
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah.

1212
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,440
Yeah, that's true.

1213
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,800
That's probably what they meant.

1214
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,040
- At the end of all the Bible verses.

1215
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,000
I wrote this in my language and translated it,

1216
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,800
so please excuse any English errors.

1217
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,280
- And here's a little, just a little comment.

1218
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,960
This is in the notes.

1219
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,280
- Yeah, the annotations.

1220
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,360
- This is also in the Women Fart Stories chapter.

1221
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,840
Does anyone know any stories where the protagonist's

1222
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,640
farts are very stinky?

1223
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,940
For example, that the farts are so stinky

1224
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,640
that they are capable of withering flowers,

1225
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,880
or that the smell disgusts her.

1226
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,080
- I actually have an answer.

1227
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,920
- You do?

1228
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,400
- Larva Island.

1229
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,280
- Oh, Larva Island. - Oh, Larva Island.

1230
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,800
- I do remember Larva Island. - I don't know that.

1231
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,600
Explain what it is. - You're gonna watch it

1232
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,680
and have some fun later tonight.

1233
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,520
- Here's another-- - I'll tell you.

1234
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,840
- Okay, so this is from the next chapter over.

1235
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,640
This is from Girl Fart Stories, another one.

1236
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,800
This is no longer Women Fart Stories.

1237
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,680
This is Girl Fart Stories, one chapter over.

1238
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,180
My mom and sis is farting on me, is it normal?

1239
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,640
I'm a boy of 17 years.

1240
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,400
My mom and elder sister is making my life hell.

1241
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,240
They wants to sit on my nose every day.

1242
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,920
My mom says if I don't obey them, they're gonna tie me up

1243
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,960
and we'll do their stuffs forever.

1244
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
I have no other way to sniff their butts.

1245
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,280
(laughing)

1246
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,120
Sometimes,

1247
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,340
sometimes,

1248
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,840
sometimes my elder sister farts on me.

1249
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,640
The horrible thing is that they both make sure

1250
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,480
that my nose is touching the bear hole.

1251
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,480
Is it normal? - Oh no.

1252
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,320
No.

1253
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,120
- So that's like God, like, you know,

1254
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,760
you think like, "Counselor Nicaea,

1255
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,960
"why'd you put that in the Bible?

1256
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,320
"It seems like it should be like maybe apocryphal."

1257
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,480
but I can see how that would help some young men. For sure. Especially at that time, again,

1258
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,840
you have to take all of this as the time when it happened. Yes, yes, absolutely. And also,

1259
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,320
that's what I was going to say, you have to look at it, it is not meant to be taken literally.

1260
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:13,400
For example, the nose can represent a temple. A temple. And the bare hole could be the mouth of

1261
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,080
God releasing the word of God or a cloud of faith. It could be that. A swimming pool or a bathtub

1262
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:28,200
just bubbling with faith, Jacuzzi style. This next book also is from Girl Fart Stories. It's from

1263
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,480
the book of Appropriate Bike 4337, which is the gospel of Appropriate Bike 4337. I'm familiar.

1264
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:40,360
This is Step Sister Help Me Out. So yesterday was the best day of my life. It started on my birthday.

1265
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,440
my stepsister was angry with me for adding milk to her tea

1266
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,640
because she was lactose.

1267
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,480
- Ah. - Oh.

1268
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,680
- So she, which I didn't know they even had it back then.

1269
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,640
- Yeah. - So she was in her room

1270
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,120
dealing with it, I excited my partly to check on her

1271
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,240
and her her gas fetish.

1272
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,720
I got there and she was in her room holding her stomach.

1273
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,240
When she saw me, she got angry, grabbed and said,

1274
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,360
"Since you're the one to do this to me,

1275
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,320
"you're going to help me out of it."

1276
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,000
Then she grabbed my face, letting out a 20 fart.

1277
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,240
(laughing)

1278
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,160
(laughter)

1279
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,000
- I didn't know they got to that level back then.

1280
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,040
- Yeah, I guess they could get to a point.

1281
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,280
- I thought they only had ones or twos.

1282
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,080
- They're eating, you know, hummus and stuff.

1283
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,920
That'll make you fart.

1284
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,080
- Yeah, it's true.

1285
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,620
- Aw, that felt so good.

1286
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,640
How'd it smell?

1287
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,000
I smelled it all and pretend to be grossed out

1288
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,020
and she didn't notice.

1289
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,360
Aw, did it stink.

1290
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,800
Next time, think twice before missing with me.

1291
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,360
I let her do smelling all of it.

1292
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,240
Why can't I smell anything, she said.

1293
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,920
Then she noticed my boner.

1294
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,040
Oh, that's why you did it on purpose, didn't you?

1295
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,380
"I tried defending myself, but don't worry, I'll let you.

1296
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,600
"I shyly asked if I can taste them.

1297
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,440
"She said yes and took off her short and panties.

1298
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,080
"Then she fed them to me.

1299
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,900
"Okay, her come a big one."

1300
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,060
- Oh, that's where communion comes from.

1301
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,080
- Oh, that is, yeah.

1302
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,500
You take it off and you let them eat it.

1303
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,580
"Then she fed them to me.

1304
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,180
"Okay, her come a big one.

1305
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,060
"Then she let out a big shart.

1306
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,060
"Be both blushed, I'm embarrassed me,

1307
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,720
"because I want to it her shit."

1308
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,960
(laughing)

1309
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,760
- Because she started, "I'm my mouth, sorry I'm,

1310
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,240
"I'll be right back."

1311
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,040
She tried to get up, but I would let her.

1312
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,600
She got the hint and smiled.

1313
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,320
"Okay, fine, if you wouldn't move, I'll just use you."

1314
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,320
She used me and we agreed we would be doing this more often.

1315
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,400
- Wow.

1316
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,400
- I love, oh my god, I love that the bike--

1317
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,880
- It's appropriate bike.

1318
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,880
The Gospel of Appropriate Book of Luke.

1319
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,880
The author of this...

1320
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,880
We don't know who it is.

1321
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
It's unknown.

1322
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Put it by the pseudonym.

1323
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,880
Went into so much loving detail about

1324
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
"I'm my mouth, I'm my farts"

1325
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
this kind of thing.

1326
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
We really see the importance that they place on this.

1327
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
And then she uses him.

1328
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,880
It's like Jesus wept.

1329
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,880
It's one of the most expressive single sentences.

1330
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
She said, "I'm going to use you"

1331
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
and she used me.

1332
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,080
you and she used me. Because you know what she's using him for. Yeah. But he doesn't

1333
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:10,960
have to get explicit. He's already saying I want to it her shit. So you don't need

1334
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,000
him to say she used me like a human toilet. It's so it's a used me. You can

1335
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,240
imply it. And it's one of those. Jesus crapped. It's one of those things where

1336
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,720
yeah if you take that story literally you know like like every story in the

1337
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,960
Bible if you take it literally you're gonna you're gonna go insane and that's

1338
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,200
why it's about sharing. And that's why I find Gnosticism to be such a powerful

1339
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,560
refuge. Nauseousism is what we're reading. This is nasty-sism. So I, listen, I just have one

1340
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,480
last Bible story. Okay. A biblical tale to weave for you two. Sure. That comes from

1341
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:48,400
the next book. Uh-huh. Which is the book of shit fart hobby. This book, this book,

1342
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,480
this story is, and we all remember this, VeggieTales did one of these. Yeah.

1343
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,480
Chinese girl let out a Chinese takeout smelly fart in the bank.

1344
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,480
It's my lucky day.

1345
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,480
The most common phrase in the Bible.

1346
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,480
The bank queue, they're talking about a river bank.

1347
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
Yes, in Egypt.

1348
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,480
What faith is it, Baha'i, where they say, "Lucky day to you."

1349
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,480
I don't know, but this is...

1350
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
Lucky day, lucky day to you.

1351
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,480
You guys are all having a very lucky day in the Bible.

1352
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,480
It's my lucky day.

1353
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,320
- It was my lucky day.

1354
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,020
The young Chinese woman ahead of me in the queue in the bank

1355
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,560
let out a loud fart sounding like a prawn cracker.

1356
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,800
(laughing)

1357
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,940
And for the next few minutes,

1358
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,060
there was a smell of Chinese takeaway.

1359
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,300
- I know that what he meant by a sound of a prawn cracker,

1360
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,060
but I would love to imagine a fart that sounds like

1361
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,900
prawn cracker.

1362
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,460
- I'm sorry, excuse.

1363
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,260
She turned to me and said quietly with a shy smile,

1364
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,940
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1365
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,140
And I said, "It's okay, it's no big deal."

1366
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,500
And she said, "We have good big deals at our takeaway,

1367
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,440
and I will give you complimentary prawn crackers

1368
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,260
with your next order because of my accidental fart

1369
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,100
I just let out."

1370
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,900
(laughing)

1371
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,900
- What a coincidence.

1372
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,020
- I know, it's amazing.

1373
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,900
I said, "That's so very kind of you."

1374
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,500
And I asked the name of her takeaway,

1375
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,860
and she said, "It's the noodle bowl."

1376
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,420
And I said, "Maybe toilet bowl would be a better name

1377
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,420
after that beautiful fart you just shared."

1378
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,860
(laughing)

1379
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,660
Imagine being the woman in that story though.

1380
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,140
(laughing)

1381
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,140
- That beautiful fart you just shared with me.

1382
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:20,980
- Yeah, imagine--

1383
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,700
- After that beautiful fart you just shared with me,

1384
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,420
you should call the toilet bowl.

1385
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,580
- Imagine being the woman in that story

1386
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,820
and then she's like, "Oh man, I'm so embarrassed,

1387
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,340
"I just farted in front of this guy."

1388
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,460
- And the guy is on the ground on all fours

1389
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,420
like a bloodhound.

1390
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,220
- This one is like the screw tape letters,

1391
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,940
there's a little bit of a dialogue.

1392
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,460
Dangerous Bloke says, "Then what did she say?"

1393
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,300
And then our esteemed author says,

1394
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,260
she said, "I farted deliberately,"

1395
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,860
'cause that's what turns me on.

1396
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,060
Farting in queues when there's a man behind me.

1397
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,500
I fart in front of men whenever I can.

1398
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,300
I asked her to fart again and she laughed

1399
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,980
and let out a massive one, lasting around 10 seconds.

1400
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,740
I suddenly started to feel intoxicated

1401
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,540
and the next thing you know,

1402
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,540
I was sitting in an ambulance being asked what I ingested.

1403
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,340
How could I say?

1404
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,900
Which would be in an awkward situation,

1405
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,740
is trying to explain.

1406
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,820
I smelled a takeaway fart from a Chinese woman in a non-cracker.

1407
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,140
- I'm liking the situation of smelling a fart

1408
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,280
and becoming intoxicated by it and getting drunk off of a fart.

1409
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,540
- Yes, oh my god, I can't drive.

1410
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,700
(humming)

1411
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,460
- Oh wait, no, that's Crazy in Love, goddammit.

1412
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,380
What's Drunk in Love?

1413
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,980
Drunk in Love's the other Beyonce song.

1414
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,820
♪ Drunk in love ♪

1415
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,640
- Drunk on farts.

1416
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,480
♪ In the honor of a crazy ♪

1417
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,580
- Drunk on farts, we were talking about parodies earlier.

1418
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,460
- Yeah, man, I haven't eaten anything all day,

1419
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,620
so your fart is really, it's taking me out.

1420
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,180
(laughing)

1421
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,620
Might have to stay home.

1422
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,460
- There's definitely farts.

1423
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,420
- I need some bread.

1424
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,980
- We were pre-gaming and you farted and I had to go to bed.

1425
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,220
I do have to say this, if you're doing fasting,

1426
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,280
like intermittent fasting, I've definitely had farts

1427
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,620
where I'm like, that just broke my fast

1428
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,460
'cause I smelled that.

1429
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,860
There was too much particulate in that.

1430
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,900
- Yeah. - You know?

1431
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,980
'Cause you know you have-- - That was solid matter.

1432
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,660
- You're allowed to have black coffee,

1433
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,120
but you're not allowed to have coffee with milk.

1434
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,780
Some of those got some milk in 'em, man.

1435
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,980
- Yeah, for sure. - All right, there you go.

1436
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,300
This is all you.

1437
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,220
- That's a hanging cloud. - Yes, definitely.

1438
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,060
- Yeah, all right, well.

1439
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,980
- I love the Bible. - You guys have been reading.

1440
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,780
I do really like the Bible. - The Bible is actually lit.

1441
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,260
- You guys have been reading some,

1442
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,580
I mean, let's be real.

1443
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,100
You guys have been reading some deep cuts.

1444
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,940
- Yes.

1445
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,220
- A lot of people, they might not have heard

1446
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,820
these Bible stories before, but for me,

1447
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,480
I don't know if you can see this beautiful title page,

1448
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,760
I wanna take it just right back to the beginning.

1449
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,140
I'm like, DJ, run that shit.

1450
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,700
- Hold that picture up.

1451
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,540
- He saw the picture.

1452
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,500
- Show the folks at home how beautiful that is.

1453
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,500
- It is a fucking lovely picture.

1454
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,540
- It's gorgeous, but I'm like, DJ, run that shit back.

1455
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,860
We're taking it back to where it all began.

1456
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,260
- The beginning of the Bible.

1457
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,060
- Genesis one.

1458
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,900
- We're starting Genesis 1. - Damn, damn.

1459
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,060
- I'm just gonna go ahead and do it,

1460
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,940
'cause people, you know, they hear these deep cuts,

1461
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,180
they might fall astray.

1462
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,220
- Yeah. - They don't remember

1463
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,420
how it started.

1464
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,780
Well, folks, this is how it started, okay?

1465
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,020
- Wow. - Talk that.

1466
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,860
- Genesis 1.

1467
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,380
Oh, hi.

1468
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,980
In te beginnin, Sealing Cat mated Teskai's and de Earth's,

1469
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,620
but he did not eated dem.

1470
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:08,700
De Earth's had no shapes and had a dark face,

1471
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,740
And Ceiling Cat rode invisible bike over to waters.

1472
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:15,140
At start, no has light.

1473
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,020
- Oh God.

1474
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,460
- And Ceiling Cat says, "I can has light?"

1475
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,220
And light was.

1476
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,700
And Ceiling Cat sawed to light to sees stuffs.

1477
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,140
And splitted to light from dark,

1478
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:31,060
but tat was okay 'cause kittays can see into dark.

1479
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,940
And not trips over nethin'.

1480
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,500
And Ceiling Cat said, "Light day and dark no day."

1481
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,640
"It were first!" "One!" Exclamation points and one.

1482
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
Wow.

1483
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,500
And Ceiling Cat said, "I'm in your waters making a ceiling."

1484
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,340
But he no yet make a 'er.

1485
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:54,380
And he made it a hole into ceiling,

1486
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,860
and Ceiling Cat dood to skies with waters down

1487
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,820
and waters up. It happen.

1488
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,220
Oh my God.

1489
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,980
And Ceiling Cat said, "I can has to firmament."

1490
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,220
(laughing)

1491
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,980
- So it was Tatooth Day.

1492
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,820
- Holy shit.

1493
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,660
- It was Tatooth Day.

1494
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,480
- That was the Tooth Day.

1495
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,420
- Oh my God, I know that's why we celebrate Tooth Day.

1496
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,260
- Yeah.

1497
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,740
- And C-Link, God did all Tatooaters in your base.

1498
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,260
- Shit.

1499
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,100
For real?

1500
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,260
- For real.

1501
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,180
Yeah, and you know, I just wanted to kind of run it back

1502
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,820
and do, you know, just back to Genesis.

1503
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,660
- I like it, yeah.

1504
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:34,060
That's like, you did also like, that's like clearly hip-hop inspired.

1505
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's been, it's, I think that this was, this was

1506
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,260
written back when hip-hop was burgeoning.

1507
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,760
Yes.

1508
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,360
Kind of first appearing on the scene.

1509
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,360
But yeah, so that's Genesis and then I have some stuff to share that's a

1510
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,460
little more, you could call this apocrypha, I guess.

1511
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:49,960
Okay.

1512
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,160
But these are some things that...

1513
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,860
I call a lot of stuff apocrypha.

1514
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,060
Yeah, I do too. But people might not know this stuff is in the Bible.

1515
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,260
Because it's not, it's not just words.

1516
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,200
Believe it or not, it's not just words.

1517
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,740
And I wanna pull up a kind of a visual aid here

1518
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,340
'cause I want people to be able to see here

1519
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,860
what's going on in the Bible.

1520
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,960
And I just realized I forgot to put on my reading glasses,

1521
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,420
but I'm gonna have to squint at the screen here.

1522
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,940
So I'm gonna put on my reading glasses real quick.

1523
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,780
- Put your reading glasses on.

1524
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,600
- Can I get those on?

1525
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,780
- What the bloody hell are you on about?

1526
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,620
Put those on.

1527
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,180
- Cam's Bible thing, okay.

1528
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,260
- There you go.

1529
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,260
Cam's Bible focals, now you can see.

1530
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,220
- Wow, you look like John Lennon right now.

1531
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,240
- Who?

1532
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,220
- John Lennon.

1533
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,460
- Is that a Bible character?

1534
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,940
I don't think so. - It's a Beatles character.

1535
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,500
- So let's talk about Bible stuff.

1536
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,600
My Bible thing, I didn't write that on this slide.

1537
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,340
That's kind of a little, I think it's a little reductive

1538
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,180
and disrespectful of the Bible.

1539
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,020
- Yeah, it's a little sad.

1540
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,580
- I think our producer put this slide on there.

1541
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,180
- Yeah, some agnostic producer,

1542
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,540
some Bible thing, it's called a fucking verse, asshole.

1543
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,380
- Yeah, well this is--

1544
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,380
- Why don't you change that right now?

1545
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,700
- Let me show you one of these things.

1546
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,540
One of these things.

1547
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,860
- Yeah, show me that. - Now you got me doing it.

1548
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,140
- Great, great.

1549
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,980
- The virus is spreading, great.

1550
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,140
- But for those who don't like to read,

1551
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,140
those who like pictures, there's actually some options.

1552
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,640
Actually, some options in the Bible.

1553
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,140
Okay.

1554
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,240
So, here's this first thing.

1555
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,740
This is called Spirit Man, and this is a superhero comic that

1556
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,440
is in the Bible, the book of Spirit Man.

1557
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,540
Oh, they have a podcast.

1558
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,240
I'm familiar with...

1559
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,240
And they have a podcast called Not About Us.

1560
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:09,740
I know...

1561
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,340
You said Not About Us?

1562
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,140
Not About Us.

1563
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,440
Kind of sounds like Potabat List.

1564
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,940
It does kind of sound like that, doesn't it?

1565
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,240
Yeah.

1566
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:15,640
Yeah.

1567
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,440
Not About Us?

1568
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,040
Not About Us.

1569
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,540
That's... we should send a DMCA.

1570
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,440
Well, I think we should join their fan club.

1571
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,440
But... so this one is kind of an option.

1572
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,040
Now, this is a more advanced...

1573
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,740
there's multiple comics in the Bible as most people know. Yeah. This is one of the

1574
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:32,940
more advanced ones and this is kind of a... it's for the teens, okay? This is not for

1575
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,640
the youngins. This is for the teens. Okay. And this was created, this was written.

1576
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,940
We actually... this is actually one part of the Bible we know who made it. We know

1577
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:44,240
the author? We know the author and it's Scott Alan Snyder and Everett Paul Burris.

1578
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,140
Oh, wow. Are there any relation to Hannibal? Yes, actually. It's actually Hannibal's

1579
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,980
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.

1580
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,820
- Oh, okay.

1581
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,580
- Yeah, 'cause this was, I mean, it's in the Bible.

1582
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:56,500
It was written back in the, you know, you know,

1583
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,660
back in the day.

1584
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,620
So these are who create Spirit Man,

1585
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,060
and we'll look at some examples of why.

1586
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,780
I actually am not a huge fan of Spirit Man.

1587
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,620
- Why?

1588
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,580
- As Bible Comics go on, I'll show you why.

1589
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,420
- Oh, okay.

1590
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,180
- 'Cause I think it promotes some bad ideals.

1591
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,020
- Okay. - Oh.

1592
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,980
- For example, punching.

1593
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:12,820
- Come on.

1594
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,660
- Punching is present in Spirit Man.

1595
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,480
- That is not good to do.

1596
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,020
- And if we look at the art,

1597
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,900
some scholars have even kind of proposed that perhaps these are pictures of

1598
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,220
mentally challenged people being punched. Really? Based on the art, based on the art.

1599
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:29,740
I would have to actually agree with you. Some Bible studiers. Except maybe the bald guy on

1600
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:34,420
the right. There's no way he is mentally challenged. Yeah. He just doesn't look like that at all.

1601
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,940
And it's also, it's promoting, it's promoting sound effects like wump and pow

1602
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,060
which are a little too violent. What? Pow I've heard. Wump? Were you guys allowed to

1603
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,820
say pal growing up I wasn't I definitely was no no because of what would it's

1604
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,980
come along with you know language punch won't pal swamp but even beyond

1605
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,160
violence lap which sometimes there's violence in the Bible we all know that

1606
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,100
church yeah I wasn't allowed to say that I was I wasn't allowed to do ka-ching

1607
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:01,120
either yeah yeah rang was a separate greed we were in a no-crying household

1608
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,820
cuz we had a lot of like excess there was actually yeah I had to make do with

1609
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:11,660
yeah I could get away with the third yeah but flump flump for now yeah no no

1610
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:18,200
thwomps. Yowch. Nope. But anyway, it's not just punching, because there's

1611
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,520
violence in the Bible. We can get over that. But you know what else isn't in

1612
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,840
the Bible? What? Well, it is in the Bible, and I don't like that it's in the Bible.

1613
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,520
Okay, what's that? It's these types of outfits. Oh my god. What's that? See, I don't...

1614
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,320
There's something about the guy on the left. I like him. The guy on the left,

1615
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,320
that's a girl. Oh. Well, that's also promoting androgyny. Yeah, promoting

1616
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,400
androgyny a shirt that says gamer and a hat with a biohazard symbol on it no

1617
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,400
thanks no thank you and then we have wait oh actually I like that the hat with the

1618
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,460
biohazard that indicates this brain is atheist yeah that's true stay away put

1619
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:56,800
in this brain by Rachel Maddow stay there yeah yeah good idea actually and but

1620
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,160
then we have moody mopers I hate in the middle here and depressed this guy on

1621
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,240
the far right here kind of looks like a long-haired mogul somebody look looks

1622
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,000
like somebody maybe three weeks ago that guy definitely looks like he has a

1623
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,240
a fucked up gut microbiome.

1624
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,560
- It's not right to have hair that looks like that.

1625
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,520
- I'm gonna have to agree with you.

1626
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,480
- It's unchristian.

1627
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,320
- Unkempt.

1628
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,120
- And in addition to the outfits,

1629
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,520
we also in Spirit Man have people in high school

1630
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,360
with tattoos.

1631
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
- Jesus Christ.

1632
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,240
- Oh my God.

1633
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,080
- And HS.

1634
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,560
- These are high school students in Spirit Man.

1635
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,400
- Really?

1636
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,400
- They're completely covered.

1637
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,240
- Wow.

1638
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,240
- You can see they're standing next to lockers.

1639
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,160
- They better be temporary.

1640
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,960
- Yeah, those better just be shirt sleeves.

1641
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,720
- Also, there's rubbing up on that girl.

1642
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,560
- They're grabbing the girl.

1643
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,440
- And that guy's rubbing up on that guy.

1644
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,920
the girl has tattoos on her area.

1645
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,880
- Oh, God no.

1646
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,000
- Every student at this school is covered in tattoos.

1647
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,480
- Are you sure this isn't a college?

1648
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,040
- This is, no, it's a complete high school.

1649
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,040
I read Spirit Man and I can confirm this is a high school.

1650
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,520
- Oh my God, they have undercuts and side cuts.

1651
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,480
- Yeah, it's just not right.

1652
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,040
This shouldn't be in the Bible.

1653
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,240
So if you're looking for a good alternative,

1654
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,200
I like Captain Absolutely, Battle Against Dr. Relative.

1655
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,160
- Dr. Relative?

1656
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:05,000
- Dr. Relative is Captain Absolutely's villain.

1657
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,040
- Oh, because it's Relatives and Absolutes.

1658
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,560
- Let's see some stuff about Captain Absolutely here.

1659
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,080
- Defending truth, justice, and lots more truth.

1660
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,560
So Captain Absolutely here, here's Captain Absolutely,

1661
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,120
here's his bio, which that's a thing

1662
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,640
that I always thought the Bible should have more of,

1663
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,440
is bio boxes, info bio boxes.

1664
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,960
Mild-mannered librarian Josiah King

1665
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,320
had never heard of the Bible.

1666
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,320
(laughing)

1667
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,600
Until a massive explosion revealed a chamber

1668
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,180
full of banned books.

1669
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,000
That night, Josiah read God's truth for the first time

1670
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,040
and it, along with mysterious radioactive fumes,

1671
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,360
changed his life forever.

1672
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,200
- Wow.

1673
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,040
- World view.

1674
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,600
The Bible contains absolute truth,

1675
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,160
timeless God-given wisdom on how to live.

1676
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,800
Superpowers, strength, flight, height, six feet, one inch,

1677
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,560
eyes, pale blue, favorite sport, wrestling.

1678
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,960
- I would too if I had super strength.

1679
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,860
- Biggest problem, paper cuts.

1680
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,760
He reads a lot of books.

1681
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,200
You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.

1682
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Three.

1683
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,520
- The truth will set you free?

1684
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,360
- Three.

1685
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,200
- Wow.

1686
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,020
- Three.

1687
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:06,860
John 8, 32.

1688
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,380
And that's Captain Absolutely, but there are other characters.

1689
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,460
Oh, there's also Hannah.

1690
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,460
- Oh, hello, Hannah. - We all remember Hannah.

1691
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,060
Seeing Cap's heroics inspired Hannah Lynn

1692
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,660
to put her faith into action.

1693
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,780
Sometimes this teenage inventor's zeal for God

1694
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,900
leads her to take shortcuts,

1695
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,340
like the time she stole Bibles from the library.

1696
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,260
Naughty, naughty.

1697
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,100
However, Hannah's courage and intellect--

1698
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,140
- Wait, I thought there weren't any Bibles

1699
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,680
from the library, it was banned.

1700
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,140
Maybe after-- - Or she stole them.

1701
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,500
That's why it was banned,

1702
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,300
'cause people were stealing too much.

1703
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,380
Yeah, you're not allowed to read a stolen book.

1704
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,180
However, Hannah's courage, intellect, and heart

1705
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,540
make her a terrific sidekick.

1706
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,100
World view of the Bible changes lives.

1707
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,660
We need to share its truth with as many people as possible.

1708
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:47,180
Inventions, rocket boots, fire suit.

1709
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,700
I've invented some of these things too.

1710
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,540
Oh yeah.

1711
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,380
Yeah.

1712
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,220
Fire suit, that sounds kind of hellish.

1713
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:55,340
Five feet four, so she's green eyes, petite, slim thick.

1714
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,780
Favorite school subject, science,

1715
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,140
and biggest problem, fear chemist.

1716
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,860
I have no idea what that means.

1717
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,540
As in my research, I could not find

1718
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,140
if there's a character named fear chemist

1719
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:08,740
if the Bible just I don't sometimes the Bible it's confusing. Yeah, it can be

1720
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:13,440
weird and then there's a quote. Yeah, we don't have to read that but then we get

1721
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,580
to dr. Relative God Darren tell his evilness Darren Gray was a computer

1722
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:24,040
programmer Lord and Josiah's friend after the explosion Darren discovered

1723
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,820
relative truth the idea that everyone makes their own rules since then he's

1724
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:32,060
trying to take over metropolitan ville and then I draw a little metropolis

1725
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,060
No, that's ancient. It's in Babylon.

1726
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,060
Yeah, so it's pronounced different from how you would expect it,

1727
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,060
because it was from another language.

1728
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,060
And destroy God's truth once and for all.

1729
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:45,060
I hate when radioactive fumes allow my friend to discover relative truth.

1730
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,060
And just try to destroy God's truth.

1731
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,060
It's so relevant to today. That's the thing about the Bible.

1732
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,060
It really, it's part of your life.

1733
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:52,060
Do you mean relative to today?

1734
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,060
No, it's not relative today.

1735
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,060
It's relevant.

1736
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,060
Okay, continue.

1737
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:59,060
Worldview. Right and wrong can change, depending on what's best for me at the moment.

1738
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:06,220
at the moment. Weapons, neutralizer, laser, shackles of selfishness, and Lyris 1-6. I don't

1739
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:11,940
know what Lyris means. Height, size is just a number. So he's small. Yeah. Eyes green,

1740
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,340
favorite snack, sunflower seeds, and biggest problem, instruction manuals. Nobody tells

1741
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:21,100
Dr. Relative what to do. Not a lot of brown-eyed people in this book. No, it's mostly green

1742
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:26,780
and blue. I fucking hate you. Yeah. Alright, what else? Here's some pages from which it's

1743
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,820
It's hard to see here, so I'll just describe it.

1744
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,580
But basically, whereas in Spirit Man,

1745
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,680
Spirit Man punches and uses punching,

1746
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,980
and a sword actually,

1747
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:39,300
Captain Absolutely actually uses humane weapons

1748
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,860
like pillow fighting.

1749
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,700
- Good. - And he actually

1750
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,780
pillow fights the villains, as you can see happening

1751
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,380
in almost five panels on this two-page spread.

1752
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,540
- You know, we weren't allowed to say thwomp and thwack,

1753
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,580
but we used to hit each other's pillows

1754
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:53,420
into a bloody pulp. - See, this is perfect.

1755
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,340
Thwomp and poof.

1756
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,660
- Yeah, that's good. - And whoop, thwomp.

1757
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,220
- That's not-- - Pidge?

1758
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,060
- Yeah, I was allowed to say one.

1759
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,740
- And God sees you is another side effect

1760
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,580
that we're seeing at the bottom of the page there.

1761
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,540
- And a rainbow.

1762
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,420
- But that's Captain Absolutely.

1763
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,700
I just have one thing that's in the Bible to close out with.

1764
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,540
- Yeah, go ahead. - Okay.

1765
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,660
- That I want everybody to be aware

1766
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,660
that you can always flip to the back of the Bible.

1767
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,500
It's still on this, what are you doing?

1768
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,580
It's still on this.

1769
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,060
Stop doing that.

1770
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:17,980
Okay. - You are fail.

1771
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,100
- I was talking to God.

1772
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,100
- Don't give him that ego.

1773
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,580
- And this is something that you can always look at

1774
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:28,360
in the Bible if you're feeling like you need a little pick me up.

1775
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,580
Okay, let's see.

1776
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,160
And this is Christian Sonic art.

1777
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,180
Whoa! Oh, I love this stuff.

1778
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:35,460
From the book of Bible Bubba 20.

1779
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,900
And so go ahead and click this link here.

1780
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,460
This is, it's hosted online,

1781
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,380
but it's also in the Bible over on one of these pages.

1782
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,220
Wow.

1783
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,040
So just scroll through this

1784
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,420
and just show off what's going on here.

1785
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,060
And you can always check this out in the Bible

1786
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,220
if you need to.

1787
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,860
It's a collection by Bible Bubba 20.

1788
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,700
Oh my God.

1789
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,740
It's Christ in white Sonic?

1790
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,620
Wow.

1791
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:53,460
Just keep going.

1792
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,460
just keep just scroll through it. White Sonic reminds me of the Cherry. I love you God and Jesus, you know.

1793
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:04,340
Here's uh this is Sonic at the crucifixion. Oh my God! He was there and he did nothing? I need, I need a

1794
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:10,900
print of that. Here this one's really good. Um I really like the art in this one. It's a prayer.

1795
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:16,020
So this is at the back of the book. This one is amazing too. I need a print of this too. I want

1796
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:20,420
these in my home. Yep and we can just, okay and then that's also in the bible. There's some ads

1797
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,940
and the Bible for diabetes.

1798
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:25,100
Well, that was incredible.

1799
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,740
And here's some more.

1800
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,420
But we don't need to look at all of it.

1801
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:29,300
Just know it's there.

1802
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,740
Just know, go out and grab a Bible.

1803
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,460
Flip to the index by yourself.

1804
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,100
All right.

1805
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,900
Well--

1806
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,140
Well, that's the Bible.

1807
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:35,640
Yeah.

1808
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,300
I think that's it.

1809
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,540
What else?

1810
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,660

1811
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,160

1818
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,780
- It's gonna be a good time, man.

1819
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:02,460
I'm also in Pittsburgh with old Adam Friedland,

February 3rd and the 4th, so come out to that.

01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:08,020
And I maybe will tell some Bible stories on stage.

1822
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:08,860
- Yeah, that's exciting.

1823
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:12,780
- I am gonna be not in Pittsburgh,

1824
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,500
I'm gonna be in Brooklyn.

1825
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,980
- You're gonna be eating your own shit in Brooklyn, New York.

1826
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,500
I'm gonna be in Brooklyn playing with my toys.

1827
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,140
Tonight I'll be in the tub.

1828
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,420
And signing off.

1829
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,260
Scene.

1830
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,080
Bye.

1831
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:25,920
Bye.

1832
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,860
Amen.

1833
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,860
