okay so

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
let me get my mic into my hand

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
there we go

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
my mic arm doesn't come in till tomorrow

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
he's a genius

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
so like a week or two ago I bought Patrick a scammed

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
like stolen minecraft account for him to use

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
oh yeah

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,200
from like eBay for like two bucks and the username and password they sent didn't

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,120
work so I asked for a replacement and I got the replacement and in Patrick's new

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,480
Minecraft account the password contains the n-word. Yeah, the password for my new...

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,920
You can't change it. I can't change it at all. Say it, what is it? It's n-word and one.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,520
Like the basketball shorts?

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,120
Like the basketball shorts, exactly.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,640
Fuck, dude.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
So he has to type that in every time he wants to play Minecraft.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh my god, that's almost, that is almost worth paying another five dollars to get a new one.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,360
It was a, yeah.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
That's not just green, dude.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,760
If it was 99 cents, it'd be a no-brainer, but it being, how much is it?

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,400
I think it might have been like a dollar or two dollars.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,280
I could have just bought, I could have just bought it.

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,240
Just get a new one, dude.

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,320
You don't wanna, and from a different supplier, you don't wanna give that guy more money.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,820
Yeah.

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,320
Yeah.

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,820
[Laughter]

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,980
Yeah, that's true.

34
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,160
I think, I think I might just, I mean I got, I got a refund.

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,120
That's why, if you want, if you want one that has a password that isn't a racial slur, it costs $10.

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,620
Yeah.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,120
[Laughter]

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,620
Yeah.

39
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,120
[Laughter]

40
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,120
I, um, I did get a refund for the Microsoft one I bought.

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
So, I could just buy a new Minecraft.

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,240
When I bought one for my little brother and then I had issues with the password and so I

43
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,320
talked to the guy on eBay and I was like, "I need a new one." And his response was,

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:08,120
"I'm so sorry, me Chinese." And then he was like, "I know confusing." And then he sent me a new one.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,560
That's very nice of him.

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,600
It was pretty nice of him. "Me Chinese." I was like, "Say no more. Say no more. I've

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
I've already got my money out of you.

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,480
- I got my money's worth.

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,320
- That's fine.

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,600
- I drank a rain energy earlier.

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,160
- You drank rain water?

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,880
- You thought it was a new energy drink?

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,800
You went to the Rainforest Cafe.

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
- I did and I got the blue,

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,120
I got the strawberry lemonade from the Rainforest Cafe.

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,560
- Yeah and you drank it like a frog would drink.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,720
- Uh-huh, but I got a rain energy that it's like bang

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,720
but it's not made by, it's not, yeah, it's not made by Hitler.

60
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,920
- Is Bang Israeli, is that the problem?

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,780
- No, Bang has donated like a shit ton of money

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,400
to the Trump campaign, so it's one of those situations

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,640
where it's like a huge-- - Bang is actually,

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,480
they named it Bang-- - A huge drink bag,

65
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,400
you're Republican.

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,720
- They named it Bang after the master of rocketry

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,800
and explosive, Werner Von Braun, so.

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
- Oh, gotcha. - Yeah, that's why

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,760
people don't like it. - Oh, okay.

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,900
yeah makes sense that yeah we should know about bang

71
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,580
i drink a rain

72
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:25,580
the star blast flavor actually don't want to know what star they're blasting

73
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,280
uh...

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
as you know

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,880
has a good uh... yeah

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,620
related

77
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,120
and i i i i i that's a funny it's funny a boycott bang because of political

78
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,840
reasons and not because it's

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
actual poison. Yeah, it's like acid.

80
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
Yeah, literal.

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm boycotting drinking battery acid because the people

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
who make it are from Israel.

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Is it? Are they from Israel?

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Yeah, they're from Israel.

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
I know they have a really fucked up

86
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I know that bank has a really fucked up

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
influencer program.

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
What's fucked up about it?

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
They do, so like

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
their influencers have to pay

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
for all their products

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
and shit. It's so clear that

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
- I heard that Patrick only knows about this

94
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,360
because he was trying to become a Bang influencer

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,700
at one point.

96
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,880
- So?

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,160
- It would make perfect sense.

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,800
- He applied to the Institute of Bang Instagram posting.

99
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,240
- No, but the rules are really fucked up.

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I watched a video on it.

101
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,380
- How long was the video?

102
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,760
- It's about like 10 minutes.

103
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,160
It's a pretty good watch.

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,800
- What were the rules?

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
- Yeah, what kind of, what do you mean by fucked up?

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,800
- I don't remember.

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
Hold on, let me look it up.

108
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
- You can't have sex.

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,080
You have to remain.

110
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,880
You cannot have sex. You have to wear a bang chastity belt.

111
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,440
And the only person who has the key is the CEO of bang.

112
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,960
The bang ambassador.

113
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,600
The bang ambassador. I'm a bang ambassador. Holy shit, look at their fucking CEO, dude.

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm looking up right now. I gotta see this.

115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,040
Bang energy CEO. Is it like the Abercrombie and Fitch guy? No, do you remember?

116
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
He looks like one fucked up dentist.

117
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Oh my god.

118
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
He kinda looks like Stallone in Spy Kids 3D.

119
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
The toy maker.

121
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
So, I guess like...

122
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
God, what?

123
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Jack O'Walk.

124
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Yeah, Jack O'Walk.

125
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
That's him.

126
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Jack O'Walk.

127
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Jack O'Walk.

128
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Jack O'Walk.

129
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Jack O'Walk.

130
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,520
Jack O'Walk.

131
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,040
That sounds like a Bart Simpson prank name.

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,160
He has in his Twitter bio says "Inventor of Bang Energy."

133
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm an inventor.

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,040
I invented this energy drink.

135
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,840
I'm like a Thomas Edison style inventor.

136
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,440
I invented putting 300mg of caffeine in Sprite.

137
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm pretty smart.

138
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,080
If only if it was just Sprite with a lot of caffeine.

139
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
What is it?

140
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
I think I've only had it once or twice.

141
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,120
I've had it, I only have it if I need it.

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Bang is insane.

143
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,920
I drank Bang like two semesters ago pretty regularly and it's just like, it's crazy.

144
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
It's just, it's not.

145
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Because of your beliefs.

146
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,960
It's yeah, it was because of my beliefs at the time that I chose to drink it, but that

147
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
has changed.

148
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,280
Now I just drink it for the taste.

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,720
It's like it's very clearly just a chemical like it's not meant to be ingested.

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,220
Oh yeah.

151
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,460
Like there's no pretense of flavor.

152
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,500
It's just like we're gonna make this like caustic like

153
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,320
like chemical that just goes into your body and fucks everything up.

154
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,500
Like you can tell it's not giving like the way you know.

155
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,900
Oh yeah, you don't feel good when you drink it.

156
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,500
You can tell the like the way it's just like beating up your brain like to give you energy.

157
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,980
It's just like squeezing your fucking.

158
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,240
They didn't realize it's just a carbonated version of the slime they inject dogs with to kill them. Yeah

159
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,260
Where where as rain rain energy is made by my name is from the earth

160
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:10,380
It's from the earth's month. Oh my gosh. I'm made by monster nice so you can trust it

161
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:18,220
Yeah, I'm reading about Jack o'clock right now, and it says earlier in Jack o'clock's career. He was a high school science teacher

162
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,780
No

163
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Dude, he did like a Walter White

164
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,500
He did dude

165
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,340
Disciplines along with English health and ran internal suspension over a period of nine years

166
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,260
There was a Jesse Pinkman kid in his class who just loved caffeine

167
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:42,460
Yeah, and he recruited him and he was like, what do you want? And he just a duct tape two monsters together

168
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,540
Yeah, and he was like, what about this? Yeah, he's like, I can figure out how to make that a can

169
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,980
He just poured Monster into an empty gas tank and then siphoned it back out and that's bang.

170
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,700
That's how you make bang energy.

171
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,220
You just shake it around in a used gas can.

172
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,740
Yeah.

173
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,620
Fucking...

174
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
He Jack-a-wok.

175
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
Jack-a-wok.

176
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,620
Jack-a-wok.

177
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,620
He's actually...

178
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,860
He had a side job where he had a dance group called the Jack-a-wokies.

179
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,860
Nice.

180
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
Okay.

181
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Alright.

182
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,740
- It took me a while to get there.

183
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,700
- Yeah, no, it took a second.

184
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,780
- Wait, a little bit.

185
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,340
- I think I may have breathed over that.

186
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,580
Can we get a clean take?

187
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,420
- No.

188
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,580
- I need to read you guys this paragraph really quick

189
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,580
from Jack O'Walk's journey to become CEO, okay?

190
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,420
He was working with like proteins and stuff.

191
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,840
He was trying to create weight loss,

192
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,220
like chemicals or whatever.

193
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
Listen to this.

194
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,540
Things went from bad to worse.

195
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,180
Shortly thereafter, his best friend

196
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,860
was playing professional basketball.

197
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,000
He was highly allergic to milk protein.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,180
With all the trust in the world,

199
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,580
Jack's best friend requested he recommends the purest milk protein free

200
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,260
supplement and sends it to him.

201
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,820
Jack sent him MedSport egg protein.

202
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,460
Upon consuming this protein he asphyxiated in the shower.

203
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,820
Suffocating and near death he pounded on the shower doors. His wife rescued him

204
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,100
and immediately transported him to the hospital where the medical staff saved

205
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,180
his life.

206
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,260
What the fuck?

207
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,300
No, Jack-a-woke

208
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,460
killed his friend. Jack-a-woke almost killed his friend.

209
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,500
making bang with eggs yeah god damn yeah you don't you don't make bang without

210
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,460
cracking a few eggs we gotta we gotta write the jack o'walk

211
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,380
enraged with anger at the corruption dishonesty and utter tomfoolery in the

212
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,420
supplement industry a walk was set on an unwavering war path

213
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,700
is this on the website he's just banging on the front door of

214
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,500
fucking nos yeah this is on a website called magster

215
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:49,420
Magster. He's at GNC just like, he's outside of GNC with a molotov. With a bang. He just has a bang.

216
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,860
He has a bang. Because you can use a bang is so flammable you can use it like a molotov cocktail.

217
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,020
There's a bang flavor called nitro jack. I'm lighting my, I'm lighting up my affliction t-shirt

218
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,340
and stuffing it in my bang energy and throwing it at the White House. What is the bang revolution?

219
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,380
"The bang revolution is fueled by experiential marketing

220
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,220
"that we do to create content all around the world."

221
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,740
If you ain't banging, you ain't hanging.

222
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,460
This is a universal truth that banksters live by

223
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,500
and competitors lose sleep over.

224
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,860
- Whoa.

225
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,500
- Hell yeah.

226
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,380
- I mean, the truth is like with energy drinks,

227
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,500
it is just like, yeah,

228
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,740
if you, whatever drink has the most caffeine,

229
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,100
you're like winning, you know?

230
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,940
- Yeah.

231
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,820
- You're like the apple of energy drinks.

232
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,260
- Damn, you can get a 18 karat gold-plated

233
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,380
bang energy charm for 20 bucks.

234
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,640
- That's good, dude.

235
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,960
- And you can get a bang energy float

236
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,140
and a bang beach towel.

237
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,340
We should become bang ambassadors.

238
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,980
We should become bang ambassadors.

239
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,820
- Absolutely.

240
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,640
- I would love to be a bangster.

241
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,660
- We just spent the last 10 minutes talking about this

242
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,540
just so that you could recruit us

243
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,140
'cause that's part of the ambassador program.

244
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,140
- Yeah, it's one of the rules you didn't get to.

245
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,700
- It's like you have to get two friends.

246
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,540
- Yeah.

247
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,060
- And you have to convince them to also be bang ambassadors.

248
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,620
- It's like Scientology.

249
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,260
The special bangster box.

250
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,300
(laughing)

251
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,560
- The bangster box.

252
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,540
- The bangster box, what does it come with?

253
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,380
- The special bangster box.

254
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,900
- Oh, oh, it's a subscription box.

255
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,700
- Oh, so it's like a loot crate.

256
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,980
- Yeah, the bangster.

257
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,940
- Yeah, exactly.

258
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,660
It's like dropping Superstore and you get a bang energy.

259
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,900
- Yeah.

260
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,580
I would love a bang, I feel like there would be

261
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,660
a Bang Energy Fortnite tie-in.

262
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,900
Absolutely.

263
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,180
Yeah.

264
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,720
That makes sense.

265
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,300
I would expect that.

266
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,420
Yeah.

267
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,780
It does seem like a very dystopian energy drink.

268
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,620
Yeah.

269
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,460
No, yeah.

270
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,060
It is like an idiocracy ad.

271
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,320
Yeah.

272
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,900
It does, I mean, there's a crosshair

273
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,820
over the earth in the bee.

274
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,060
(laughing)

275
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,660
That is so funny.

276
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,060
Oh no, that's not the Earth.

277
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,060
That's just a radar.

278
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
Yeah.

279
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,060
Bang is so powerful.

280
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
It gives you the energy to destroy the world.

281
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Hey, shoot the fucking Earth.

282
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,060
Who cares?

283
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,060
Yeah, I got hyped up on Bang and I started blowing my 12 gauge at the moon.

284
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Yeah.

285
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,060
I just started just wailing.

286
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
Just wailing on my kid.

287
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,060
Wailing on my kid.

288
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
Bang is dad fuel.

289
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
fuel.

290
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
Yeah.

291
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:39,620
Yeah, bang is fuel for big daddy when the kiddies get out of line.

292
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,100
There's a whole section on the store for bang called goals.

293
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,920
Yeah.

294
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,500
So you click on goals and it's just fitness goals and then all it is is like 12 pack of

295
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,100
bang, bang keto coffee.

296
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,940
These are the, these are bangs goals.

297
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,020
These are the goals.

298
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
The goals?

299
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,060
Eradicate the Romani people.

300
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,060
Bang.

301
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,060
Bang energy.

302
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,060
This is a graham cracker supplement.

303
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,180
They have a graham cracker supplement?

304
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,820
Yeah, you're a cracker named Graham.

305
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Yeah, you are.

306
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Yeah, you are.

307
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Uh, yeah, you are.

308
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,780
You're a cracker named, you're a cracker who buys a graham, yeah, for a million dollars.

309
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,460
You buy a graham for one million dollars.

310
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
No.

311
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,300
- Jackalwok is a Gemini, guys.

312
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,580
- I'm starting to crash.

313
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,700
- You're Dr. Weedville.

314
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,540
- Oh no.

315
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,360
- You're Dr. Weedville.

316
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,200
- He seriously has, he's starting--

317
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,700
- You're Dr. Weedville and you buy a grant

318
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,860
for one billion dollars. - Jackalwok has serious

319
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,060
Gemini energy.

320
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
- Absolutely. - No, he doesn't.

321
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,900
- He has serious Gemini energy.

322
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,700
- No, you have serious Jackalwok interview.

323
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,260
- You have Jackalwok interview where you--

324
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,060
- We should interview Jackalwok.

325
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,900
- You know who he looks like?

326
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,580
- Jackalwok has serious bang energy.

327
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,660
- You know who he looks like? - We should send him an email

328
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,780
that's like, we're looking to understand

329
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,220
your billionaire mindset and we wanna change the world.

330
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,460
- We should get him and Gnome on,

331
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,620
we should host a debate with him and Gnome Jockey.

332
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,460
- That's a good idea.

333
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,780
- Yeah, we have both their emails,

334
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,620
let's just get into contact.

335
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,180
- They disagree with each other perfectly.

336
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,940
Gnome is like, "No, I know this guy, I love him."

337
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,300
- Yeah, surprisingly, Jackalock is very anti-US imperialism.

338
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,060
- Why do you think Gnome looks like that?

339
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,900
He's been drinking my fucking juice.

340
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,580
- Yeah, Jackalock's like, "Well, you can, you can,

341
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,700
our greatest misstep was creating a villain

342
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,140
out of Muammar Gaddafi."

343
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,420
And Gnome Jockey's like, "Really? Okay."

344
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,140
(laughing)

345
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,020
- All right, let me give you a sip of that, come on.

346
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,340
- Yeah, maybe I'm gonna try that shit.

347
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,140
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

348
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,340
- Man, that's so funny that being Qaddafid

349
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,860
was a whole meme from Tosh.0.

350
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,320
- What, having something in your ass?

351
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,660
- Yeah, getting a knife up your ass.

352
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,460
- I thought they put a pole in his ass.

353
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,380
- Yeah, well, I don't know, but either way,

354
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,380
Daniel Tosh showed the video on Tosh.0,

355
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,380
and then he showed the video on Tosh.0

356
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,660
and then was like, oh, so I went around my office

357
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,100
Kadophying my coworkers.

358
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,420
- God, that is.

359
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,860
- Send in your Kadophy videos.

360
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,200
- That's so awesome. - That's so awesome, dude.

361
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,900
- Yeah, that's badass.

362
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,800
- God damn it, dude. - So crazy.

363
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,300
- I misstandard, is he still doing that show?

364
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,340
- He is still doing Tosh.0, yeah.

365
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,140
So epic dude.

366
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,100
- Yeah, what kind of stuff are they watching now?

367
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,020
- They're just watching live leaks.

368
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,860
- Yeah.

369
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,820
I bet they're watching videos of people.

370
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,020
- And he's recreating them around the office.

371
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,740
- Yeah, he's like, "Watch these."

372
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,500
- We grabbed our co-worker and his son

373
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,900
and we did the Muhammad Al-Durra incident to them.

374
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,480
As they cowered behind a wall,

375
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,180
we destroyed them with gunfire.

376
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,140
- It's been on for like 10 years.

377
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,060
It's been on for longer than that, right?

378
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,460
Yeah, dude, March 17th was its 12th season.

379
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,420
Yeah, it's been on forever.

380
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,100
It's like, and it's basically the Tonight Show.

381
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,940
Yeah.

382
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,000
Daniel Tosh is the new Johnny Carson.

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
That's true.

384
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,220
Who was the new Jack Parr.

385
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,060
Mm-hmm.

386
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,460
Who was the new Abraham Lincoln.

387
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Yeah.

388
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,280
Yeah.

389
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,900
Back in the day, FDR invented the late night talk show

390
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,580
with his fireside chat. - He did, with the fireside.

391
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,700
- Yeah, and he used to do monologue jokes

392
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,980
about Sammy Davis Jr.

393
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,460
And then-- - And we can't repeat

394
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,420
any of 'em. - We definitely, no,

395
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,900
absolutely not. - We definitely cannot

396
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,620
repeat any of them. - But what we can say

397
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,720
is they were funny.

398
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,460
Just objectively, pretty funny stuff.

399
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,940
And then Jack Parr started doing it,

400
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,500
and then Johnny Carson started doing it,

401
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,740
but then Sammy Davis Jr. died,

402
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,060
and so we needed something else to make fun of.

403
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,140
Luckily a little man named George W. Bush came around.

404
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,100
- Mm-hmm.

405
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,020
- And we still lampoon that foolish monkey to this day.

406
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,140
- Yep. - Absolutely.

407
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,820
- Yep, George Bush is a great--

408
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,980
- You guys remember when he said fool me once

409
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,420
and fool me twice?

410
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,840
- Yeah, remember when that guy hit him with a shoe?

411
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,500
- That was some cool shit, honestly.

412
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,140
- Yeah, I wish someone would do that to me.

413
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,820
- Yeah, hit you with a shoe. - I would love a shoe.

414
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,660
I would love to have a shoe right now.

415
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,980
- I would love a shoe so bad.

416
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,100
George Bush was kinda ungrateful, he got a free shoe.

417
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,940
Yeah.

418
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,060
Yeah, it's also crazy 'cause it was a Jordan,

419
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,620
it was a off-white Jordan bread one,

420
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,580
it was worth almost $2,000.

421
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,620
The problem was it wasn't his size.

422
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,180
That's why he was so mad.

423
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,900
Yeah, that's why he was upset.

424
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,500
If it was his size, I think--

425
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,580
The insult there was that it was a woman's shoe.

426
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,780
Yeah, it was a woman's size shoe.

427
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,500
And I think if it wasn't a woman's shoe,

428
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,860
I think we would've established a democracy

429
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,860
over there sooner. I agree that that guy he got thrown into prison because he

430
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,100
disrespected him. He broke the Geneva Convention. You're not allowed to give a

431
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,220
man a female shoe. Yeah. It's one of the especially not a world leader. Yeah

432
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,700
especially not especially not the leader of the skull and bones. Yeah especially

433
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:11,340
not the Texas rider himself. Yeah. Yeah. The beautiful the beautiful Texas

434
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:19,080
the Texas Beast the Texas yeah the Texas Ranger the Texas Ranger himself George

435
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:32,460
HW Hitler George H Hitler George Hill Bush yeah he had a complicated family history

436
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:40,860
the bushes yeah because his uncles were fighting all the time when he was a kid

437
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:48,700
did you ever see the Josh Brolin Bush movie? No I remember seeing the

438
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,380
poster for it at the video update in my hometown I saw the TV cut of it it's

439
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,180
just so epic what was it what's it called just it's like it's like it was

440
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,380
like right when I think it was like 2008 it came I think it's just called Bush I

441
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,380
I think it was 2006. I think it was earlier than that.

442
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
Personally I think it was 1985.

443
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Yeah, it actually came out in one.

444
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
It came out year one.

445
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
It came out the same time as year one with Jack Black and Miles Cera.

446
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
Oh, it was 2008.

447
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,380
Okay, so it was...

448
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
But it's basically just like

449
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
them making like a snarky movie

450
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,380
where... I mean, yeah, it's basically

451
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
like a Will Ferrell comedy with Josh Brolin

452
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,380
and George W. Bush

453
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
and he just walks around and they're like

454
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,540
But what are you gonna do about the Middle East? And he's like, I'm gonna take a poop.

455
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:39,140
Yeah, funny. Yeah, you know, we need we need one of those right now for Donald Trump. Oh,

456
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,380
my God. So we need to make fun of this guy. We need Funny or Die to partner with Netflix

457
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,380
and make a real take down. We need a Funny or Die Raytheon partnership to come together and

458
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,300
make a scathing Donald Trump. Oh, and Michael Moore. And we need all three of them. Michael

459
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,520
more Raytheon funnier die and bang energy and bang energy yeah I was gonna say

460
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,300
that bang energy and they and Barack Obama and yep

461
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,540
Verner Barack Obama's Netflix deal Barack Obama has a cameo where he walks out of

462
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:18,220
the of the bathroom while Donald Trump is tweeting on the toilet yeah or there he

463
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,100
walks into the bathroom while Donald Trump is tweeting on the toilet and he

464
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,580
says miss me yet and the crowd cheers yeah the crowd in the movie there's an applause

465
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:36,380
break in the middle of the movie yeah and there's uh actually obama plays a lot of characters

466
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,520
obama goes norbit in the movie yeah and he plays every character that donald trump has

467
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:50,700
to has to interact with including melania yeah at the end of every line that he says

468
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,580
he pulls off whatever like prosthetic he has on and goes "miss me yet?" and there's a pause.

469
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,260
Yeah. Barack Obama plays the girls that the Wayans brothers play in White Chicks

470
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:09,820
and they are as Stormy Daniels and his mission to fuck Donald Trump.

471
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:18,780
Right? Yeah. So Donald Trump comes in he's like "I wanna be on you" and then Barack Obama as

472
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,780
the white chick is like, "This, uh, you suck."

473
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,060
You know, something like that.

474
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,860
Yeah, let me be clear.

475
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,740
I'm telling you.

476
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,380
Let me be clear.

477
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,340
You are, I'm gonna pee on you.

478
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,780
I'm gonna pee on you.

479
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,900
And I'm gonna make fun of your penis.

480
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,100
And he records it with the, uh, or the white chick, Barack Obama records it,

481
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,580
with a little Sony camcorder, right?

482
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,100
and then and then there's a like an hour-long sequence of him trying to

483
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,300
figure out how to edit the video down yeah

484
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,660
that's the rest of the movie he's on sony vegas 6

485
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,020
and he's just trying to figure out how to find the razor tool

486
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,780
and he's doing it and he's doing it in funny or die headquarters

487
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,060
okay problem you know who's looking over his shoulder point showing him how to do

488
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,660
it will ferrell oh my god and also played

489
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,940
by barack obama keeping him focused what bang energy bang energy uh-huh and the

490
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:21,300
The problem is the reason that the rest of the movie is them trying to use Sony Vegas 6 to edit the movie is

491
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,800
That the video and the audio got unlinked and they don't remember what button they pressed

492
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,240
What they pressed to link it back together and so anytime that they import it's an AVI file

493
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,940
So anytime that they import it, they're like, well, where did the video go and they're like, I don't know

494
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,380
Yeah, so and then they figure that out

495
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,960
Then there's a review in the newspaper of the movie and it's this is like in real life not in the movie

496
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,200
the reviews come out and they're like this is a stunning mind-twisting rendition of

497
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
real events combining reality with fiction in a way you can see the movie

498
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,720
being created in front of you on the screen in Sony Vegas 6 this yeah this is

499
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,320
four and a half stars out of five this is Donald Trump's Frost Nixon yeah this is

500
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,160
a worthy successor to Charlie Kaufman's adaptation mr. Farrell I need your help

501
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,980
the text that says hot I cannot get it to change the text from saying hot and now

502
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,680
there's a cool and and then and then Will Ferrell says if you ain't first you're

503
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,660
last yeah and then he leaves yeah yeah cuz it's also a NASCAR partnership yeah

504
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,860
yeah that's the other part yeah so they're in the they're in the NASCAR car

505
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,860
and they have a drive-in the whole time

506
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,940
back because it's also serves as stuber as the second stuber movie yeah it's all

507
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,060
the Carol and Barack Obama the computer is powered by the by how many RPMs the

508
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,820
car does like speed yeah so they have to go really fast yeah and John wick is

509
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,780
there John wick from speed and it's really one of the Avengers uh-huh and

510
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,780
black Adam it's really hard it's really hard because the car has to make a pit

511
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,300
stop so anytime that they have to make a pit stop the quantitized to frames button

512
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,900
shuts off and then the clips get really small he's accidentally because the car

513
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,460
is going so fast he's moving the mouse but then the clips get too small and it

514
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,940
does that like YouTube poop stuttering effect where it goes like also and then

515
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,700
they get an idea to just make a YouTube poop yeah so that they try to make a

516
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,260
YouTube poop of the Donald Trump sex tape yeah that they've made also this

517

movie is filmed over the course of 15 years like boyhood yeah yeah and in the

518
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,420

drive-thru and Barack it gets frustrated trying to take everybody's orders yeah

521
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,020
Yeah, because Donald Trump's like, "I want a black bean chalupa."

522
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,540
And then Barack is like, "I'm getting a 24-pack of beef tacos."

523
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,540
And Donald Trump is, "I recently went vegetarian and I need the black bean chalupa."

524
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:14,380
"This is the only fast food place where I can get a vegetarian option."

525
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
What about the Beyond Burger?

526
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
It's 2009, we don't have that yet.

527
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,260
Yeah, it's Donald Trump in 2009.

528
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,860
2009. Yeah, it's 2009 Donald Trump still doing The Apprentice.

529
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,780
Yeah. And he's still hanging out with Epstein. He is preparing for his

530
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,140
Comedy Central roast where he announced his presidency and he's talking to Mike

531
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,780
the Situation and he's giving him all of his material for the show.

532
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:49,340
And we recreate the Mike the Situation Donald Trump roast but instead of

533
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,740
of Mike the Situation he's played by Michael Shannon. Yeah, Mike the Shannonation.

534
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,560
Mike's the Shannonation and it's Michael Shannon being like Anthony

535
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,300
Jizzleneck I love your jokes I told them to a model when I was having sex with her

536
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:13,900
at my apartment on a stack of money. That roast is so incredible. Dude it is one of

537
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,900
the best. It's so great and then at the very end when he's like Donald Trump I

538
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
I think you should run for president.

539
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,060
Yeah, I think you should run for president, man.

540
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,060
When did the roast get bad?

541
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,900
I think it's the James Franco roast.

542
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,740
Oh, yeah.

543
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,020
'Cause, no, no, no, 'cause it was technically

544
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,940
like a funny one, but they had too many people

545
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,260
who were like alt comics and shit

546
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,660
who broke the format, and so the original format

547
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,900
is just not funny anymore.

548
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,500
Yeah, so the--

549
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,780
'Cause like Anthony-- I remember--

550
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,860
- Or fucking Sandberg did that thing that was like,

551
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,700
- Boom roasted!

552
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,820
- Yeah, yeah.

553
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,940
And it's just like, as soon as you do that

554
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,340
on the Comedy Central roast,

555
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,460
you can't go back to Liza Minnelli,

556
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,300
like being made fun of for having--

557
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,820
- Liza Minnelli?

558
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,100
- I mean, no, Liza.

559
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,700
(laughing)

560
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,540
What's her fucking name?

561
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,360
- Yeah, they're gonna make the Comedy Central--

562
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,260
- Lisa Stramboli, what's her fucking name?

563
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
- Lisa Lampanelli?

564
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,020
- Lisa Lampanelli.

565
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,780
You can't go back to just making fun of her

566
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,620
for like having sex with a black guy,

567
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,820
which is the first 30 roasts.

568
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,340
Oh yeah, every roast is just Greg Giraldo being like,

569
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,660
the limousine, that's what they call

570
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,460
Lisa Lampanelli's pussy.

571
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,740
Yeah, it's awesome dude.

572
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,100
But you can, I mean, those old ones in the 2000s

573
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,380
were so funny, but they'll never be back.

574
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,020
Dude, Aziz Ansari went up and just went like,

575
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,900
he did like a fucking woke, like,

576
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,300
yeah, I'm actually not gonna tell any jokes.

577
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,140
He did like an annet.

578
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,960
Did he?

579
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,800
I don't even remember.

580
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,700
Did you see, he annetted the roast?

581
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,540
Yeah, he annetted the roast.

582
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
He knew it was coming.

583
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,140
Do you know that roast of Bob Saget where Gilbert Gottfried goes up and just keeps saying over

584
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,140
and over, "Bob Saget raped and killed a girl in 1990"?

585
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,060
He just says that over and over.

586
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,180
That's one of the all- that's probably the all-time best I would say is Bob Saget.

587
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,980
And then the Norm one too.

588
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,860
I thought that was the one where he did the Aristocrats.

589
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,940
I don't think so.

590
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,020
I mean I don't know anything about-

591
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,740
He was on so many of them.

592
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,940
Yeah, that's true.

593
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,500
Like that, those old ones with Geraldo and Godfried.

594
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,860
- Nah, I'm just imagining Gilbert Godfried

595
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,620
trying to do it as like an alt,

596
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,300
like the new alt comic roast shit.

597
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,940
So I have anxiety.

598
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,940
I have anxiety because I was molested as a kid.

599
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,540
(laughing)

600
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,460
- That's his version of like revelation.

601
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,420
- He has an epiphany on stage.

602
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,260
(laughing)

603
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
He just stares into the camera.

604
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,300
"Oh shit!"

605
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,660
"I said too much!"

606
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,540
"I said too much!"

607
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:59,260
"I didn't realize I was gonna have a breakthrough at the roast!"

608
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Yeah, his eyes finally open.

609
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,060
He just stares directly into a mirror.

610
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,820
I can see my reflection in the lens!

611
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,540
I hate the man I've become!

612
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,700
Every morning I wake up in a malaise!

613
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:31,780
I am a coward!

614
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
I need serious...

615
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,460
You just start screaming?

616
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
I need serious help!

617
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,960
*laughter*

618
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,460
Please! Somebody help me!

619
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,460
*laughter*

620
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,460
Somebody stop me!

621
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,960
*laughter*

622
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,960
I found the mask backstage!

623
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,460
*laughter*

624
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
Gilbert Gottfried, Son of the Mask?

625
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
*laughter*

626
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Yeah, I'm thinking I'm producing that movie.

627
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,800
I put on this mask and fucked my wife!

628
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,640
Let's see what happens!

629
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,080
You know he's doing TikToks now?

630
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,960
Yeah, he's doing TikToks where he reads tweets.

631
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Wow.

632
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,440
You know, he's a very frugal man.

633
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,960
You know, he takes the megabus out.

634
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,200
This sounds like a roast joke.

635
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,920
Gilbert Gottfried is a very frugal man.

636
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,360
He wants...

637
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,360
He wants what?

638
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,880
- Come on, do it. - Oh man.

639
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,720
- Say it.

640
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,640
- It's hard to do that style without--

641
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
- Yeah, what do I do? - Without something

642
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,080
that we have to edit out.

643
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,920
- Exactly.

644
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,740

645
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,580
Exactly.

646
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,640
- No, you have to finish this.

647
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
We're not editing anything out.

648
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,680
- No, I'm gonna go 2018 roast.

649
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,000
- Okay, do it.

650
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,580

654
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
- The best part.

655
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,900
- The greatest intro to any punchline, he had the.

656
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,740

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,840
yeah that's kinda just impressive

694
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,020
yeah gilbert godfried is so frugal

695
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,960
for dinner every night he licks a gobstopper

696
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,560
and it lasts him a whole week

697
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,920
that's good dude that's really good

698
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,040
I think I should try these out.

699
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
We need to do, yeah.

700
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,640
Let's write some more roast jokes about it.

701
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
But again, we gotta keep it PG.

702
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Gilbert Godfrey.

703
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Yeah.

704
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,280
Gilbert Godfrey is so frugal and he loves candy so much that when he bought a candy

705
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:17,240
bar and it had Willy Wonka's golden ticket in it, he used the golden ticket to buy 1,000

706
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,880
more candy bars.

707
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,280
Which is way more than the golden ticket was worth.

708
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
That's true.

709
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,440
In the first place.

710
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Because of inflation.

711
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,400
of the because of how frugal he was. And then you would go from here and you would say, "Speaking

712
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,800
of inflation, uh, Lisa Lippinelli is here." I want to see Gilbert Gottfried inflated.

713
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,920
I want to see a little baby kicking around upside of him. Yeah. Speaking of inflation,

714
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,520
I want to put a Yankee candle under his ass and ride him like a hot air balloon. Speaking

715
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,000
of inflation, I'm looking out in the audience right now and I'm imagining every one of you

716
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,360
naked and puffed up like a bouncing balloon. Yeah. That's right. I'm turning the roast on

717
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
the audience this time around.

718
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,080
Speaking of inflation, I have a bee in my pocket and I'm going to give it to Bob Saget, who's

719
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,920
deathly allergic to bees.

720
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,680
Genius.

721
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680

726
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,200
Hey, Greg.

727
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,840

728
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,360
Hey, Greg, you died earlier than Patrice.

729
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,520
He died in 2009.

730

And speaking of, Warren Sapp is here from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

731
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:39,400

732
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,760
Phil Hartman's here.

Hey Phil, how's your wife?

734
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,880
Hey Phil, you died way earlier than all of them.

735
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Hey, how's your wife? Did she kill you?

Hey, Alexander the Great is here. I thought you died a really long time ago.

742
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,200
Hey Jesus Christ is here he's alive in all of us.

743
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,480

you offstage. Yeah you're not even like there's no connecting joke it's just the

748
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:55,360
segues. Speaking of dinosaurs George Burns is still alive for the purpose of this joke.

749
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,000
So now the security guards are trying to drag me offstage.

750
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,800
What is this? Speaking of security guards. What am I a terrorist?

00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:10,480

766
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Yeah.

767
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,080

Yeah, they said James L Dean and and Steve static

769
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:39,120
The comedy central roast I don't think we've gone a single episode without mentioning Stephen Paddock at least I know we have

770
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,320
Or they'll not in the past few weeks. I think we've had like a

771
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,400
Streak. Oh, yeah, we should not talk about your knowledge. No, they didn't tell they didn't even it was so late

772
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,280
They fucking they called me. I guess I got a couple mixed missed calls from the couple mixed calls from the

773
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,840
Boston Police Department and

774
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,840
And they, I answered and it was like a four minute phone call.

775
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,640
They, for one second, they were like,

776
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,720
"Do you know why we're calling you today?"

777
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,360
And I was like, "No sir, I have no idea."

778
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,840
Just smiling so slyly.

779
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,680
- Yeah.

780
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,200
- And he was like, "Did you post on Facebook?"

781
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,920
And I just said, I was like, "No."

782
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,640
(laughing)

783
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,400
And he's like, "I'm sorry, no Facebook.

784
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,120
"Twitter.com, did you post something about

785
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,120
"I'm making the United States Army military surrender to you"

786
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,120
"Kind of a... making the US Army surrender"

787
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,120
And I was like, "Yes I did, yes that was me"

788
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,120
And he was like "Okay son, you can't, I mean"

789
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,120
"I'm not gonna tell you what you can do with your life, but just be careful what you post online"

790
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,120
And I was like "Is that it?"

791
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,120
They didn't even ask me if I was serious

792
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,960
it down there just like just be careful because there's filters out there and they see something

793
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:05,200
like surrender US Army or I want to declare war on the United States military and they

794
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,080
get you know and now I got to give you a phone call and you know you're doing me a big favor

795
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,000
by just not posting stuff like that son so just be careful.

796
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,800
It's so funny how big of like a file they have of you.

797
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,600
You don't even live there anymore.

798
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,080
For like brought up same with the Secret Service guys they brought up they were like, oh the next door

799
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,120
They make posts in 2018 on an application called next door

800
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,920
And I was like, yeah

801
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,040
He's like did you post on the application next door that you were looking for people in your neighborhood to commit crimes with?

802
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,360
Yeah, and they're like did you also make a post

803
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,960
Asking if there was an if there was an old man

804
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,960
wandering around, who had gotten stuck in your apartment and was making pancakes.

805
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
I forgot about the old man.

806
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Yeah, I made two posts on the next door app.

807
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Who was that a photoshop or like a face app of?

808
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,960
It was some random face app of like this very low quality image of an old man.

809
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
And I made a post on the next door app.

810
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
Oh, I thought it was one of us.

811
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,960
I was like, this guy walked into my apartment, made himself lunch,

812
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,960
and now he's just sitting on the couch smiling like this.

813
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
(laughing)

814
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,600
And I was like, I don't wanna kick him out

815
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,680
and I don't wanna call the police,

816
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,840
but can someone come retrieve him?

817
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,440
And I had a bunch of people, they were like,

818
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,120
you need to call the police right now.

819
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,040
He could've escaped from a senior home.

820
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,000
And I was like, no, I don't think so.

821
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,320
We're playing a game now.

822
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,680
(laughing)

823
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,560
And then, yeah, and then I just had one other one,

824
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,680
'cause every single post on that app is just like,

825
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,480
especially in Boston, it's just like,

826
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:54,640
you're wearing a do-rag yeah yeah just saw a man walking his dog in his backyard

827
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,280

830
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,680
Didn't you tell the cops that it was Neal setting you up?

831
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,880
I got a call in the middle of a class, in an art class.

832
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Art class?

833
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,680
In an art class that I was taking.

834
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Finger painting?

835
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
I was finger painting.

836
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
You were taking finger painting?

837
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
I was making a turkey with my hand.

838
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,640
Intro to finger painting?

839
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,000
And the Boston Police Department called me a couple years ago and they were like, "Yeah,

840
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,560
Did you make a post saying that you were looking for people in your neighborhood to commit

841
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,800
various crimes with?"

842
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,880
And I was like, "No, I actually think that was this guy who's obsessed with me and he

843
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,960
has my number and he's always doing shit like this.

844
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
His name is Neil."

845
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,840
And then they gave him a call and he had no idea what was happening.

846
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:07,120
And then he called me and he was like, "Did you tell the police that I did a...

847
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,400
I committed a crime.

848
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,640
I was like, no, dude, they're after you, dude.

849
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,440
Oh my God.

850
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,600
Imagine he gets like pulled over one day.

851
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,800
We have a warrant for your arrest in Boston, Massachusetts.

852
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,040
I mean, it rocked it.

853
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,800
I love, I love the hanging out with the police on the phone.

854
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,680
That's why I do this is you and I just want them to call me.

855
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,080
It's because you could never join the force, but you want to join.

856
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,220

So if you wouldn't mind coming and putting an end

We're gonna have the perfect night.

00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,480
- They're way too young to be playing gay chicken.

897
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,320
- All that's missing is four or five heroes

898
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,520
to protect this country.

899
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,600

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,080

903
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,320
So if you guys could bring that over on the way.

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,760
- Hey, do you guys have any good stories

905
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,360
you can come tell to my friends?

906
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,040
I've been telling stories to my friends all night,

907
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,560
but I work in retail, so it's all really boring stories.

908
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,840
I need some really good stories.

909
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,440
Do you guys kill anybody?

910
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,960
Can you guys come kill someone at my party

911
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,800
so I can tell a story about it next week?

912
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,100
- How many, do you guys have any more heroic tales?

913
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,260
We also, we pulled enough money to get a red box, so.

914
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,100
(laughing)

915
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,500
Maybe even a Blu-ray.

916
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,780
- Me and my friends are planning to go as cops for Halloween,

917
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,980
so could we borrow some stuff from you?

918
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,420
- We got, we got Lego City on Switch,

919
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,300
and there's some cop stuff in this game

920
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,380
that we're trying to figure out, but we don't know.

921
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,560
- Yeah, can you come look at this cop stuff in Lego City

922
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,820
and tell us if it's accurate?

923
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,980
- I need to figure out if these Lego cops

924
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,500
are telling the truth.

925
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,980
- We need a fifth for pick up basketball

926
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,860
and I know you guys love being filmed doing shit like that.

927
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,560
So you wanna come down and get your ankles broken?

928
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,620
- Yeah, my little brother just ran away.

929
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,380
No, no, I don't need you to come look for him.

930
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,380
Can you just come be my little brother?

931
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,300
(laughing)

932
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,420
- You come replace him.

933
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,700
- Yeah, can I actually get a bunch of you guys?

934
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,380
- One thing my little brother loved to do is jack me off.

935
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,100
So if you're gonna be a good little brother.

936
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,820
- Yeah, you kinda have to, you know.

937
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,580
- It's kind of in your job now.

938
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,620
- Yeah, and it's actually super dry.

939
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,740
It needs something wet in it.

940
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,860
- It needs cop wet.

941
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,220
- You should put your cop juice on me.

942
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,500
- Yeah, I need some cop sweat.

943
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,220
- I actually stashed a big bag of cocaine up in my penis.

944
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,540
- Yeah, and you need to fish it out.

945
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,500
- There's a crime going on in my ass.

946
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,820
- My ass has a tiny city in it,

947
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,340
and I need you to inspect the investigation.

948
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,780
- 9/11 just happened in the tiny city in my ass,

949
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,380

- Yeah.

956
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,500
- That's what they said as soon as the plane

957
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,820
hit the second tower.

958
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,660
- Yeah.

959
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,500
- Wow, someone needs to respond to this right now.

960
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,340
- For 911, what's your emergency?

961
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,900
First of all, you need to respond now.

962
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,900
- Do you have any response for what just happened

963
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,500

964
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Oh shit!

00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,100
The Iraq War.

972
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,100

983
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,420
in Saugus, Massachusetts.

984
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,900
- I'm gonna be reenacting David Cross's first line

985
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,860
in the Dalai Lama sketch from Mr. Show season four.

986
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,540
(laughing)

00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,380
- Yeah.

00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,660
I'm gonna be performing that sketch

989
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,460
they just pulled from With Bob and David.

990
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:49,820
word yeah it's my that yeah they just pulled it oh that's so funny yeah yeah

991
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,560
it's a good sketch yeah it was a good sketch it was a very good sketch it's so

992
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,140
funny that they just like like the Tina Fey pulling the 30 rock episodes is so

993
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,060
funny oh I know like literally like I didn't make that yeah I didn't I

994
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:08,540
definitely didn't write all that yeah no what and like all of the the the stuff

995
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:15,420
in Kimmy Schmidt where Titus is in like yellow face like that. Did they call that too? No that's still

996
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,500
up. Yeah I didn't watch Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt because I'm not a girl but that just might be me.

997
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,260
I mean I don't know about you guys I guess. I watched it I think I watched the first season.

998
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,980
Yeah I watched. But then I realized that that was a girl and not like a not like a rock fan

999
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:33,420
with long hair. That's what I thought. I was like this metal head is very funny. I thought it was

1000
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,020
I thought it was Mark Wahlberg's character in Rockstar.

1001
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,780
Yeah, unfortunately.

1002
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,780
Which is why I thought she was okay with the yellow face.

1003
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,780
Yeah.

1004
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,780
Yeah.

1005
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:50,580
No, that shit, they pulled the Always Sunny episodes too, right?

1006
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,580
Really?

1007
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,580
Yeah.

1008
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,300
I think that's much funnier than the 30 Rock thing, though.

1009
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,620
Yeah, I mean that sucks.

1010
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:02,500
We're pulling all these documentaries about Hitler because Hitler, he does bad stuff in

1011
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:08,460
them so yeah it can't be on Netflix yeah yeah yeah this is like like oh you just

1012
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:14,380
can't you can't see this like yeah so dumb yeah what are we in communist China

1013
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:19,620
I can't watch someone do blackface anymore on Netflix we're in China now

1014
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:26,220
this people are so I just it it just it blows my mind all the time just how how

1015
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,740
many people are just like oh if something's on TV that means that they

1016
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:34,780
think it's good yeah that means like right it's so crazy how can you I just I

1017
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,620
don't understand anything that happens in a movie happens because people think

1018
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,700
it's good yeah in a movie every character is good there's no such thing

1019
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:48,380
as a bad character American Psycho yeah he's very good we're taking it

1020
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:54,940
as he's a job man exactly creates job fine that's fine that's why he can do

1021
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:01,140
all that shit is cuz he makes jobs. But those scumbags in Always Sunny, those leeches who

1022
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:09,460
work a job at a bar like an absolute fucking degenerates. Yeah, exactly. You can't see it

1023
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,300
but my head's shaking so hard right now. Yeah it is. My head's shaking so hard. He's gonna

1024
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:20,860
make himself dizzy. I did. I did make myself dizzy. It doesn't take much to make you dizzy.

1025
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,580
I'm very I have a lot of low amounts of blood. I'm

1026
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:32,420
I blame Disney for everything. Yeah, um, I pretty much I'm just becoming that guy. Yeah, it's true

1027
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:40,300
Yeah, just people they control everything and they have absolutely no stomach for anything did you see

1028
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:46,320
Do you see mouse actually is evil the thing that was like evil in it the NBA like

1029
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:54,980
Like oh, yeah, well, we'll see the security. Yeah, Walt Disney security is gonna be trolling the NBA like seating or whatever

1030
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:00,040
you know that they're having they're just doing the rest of the NBA season in Disney World because

1031
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:06,420
That's the because they don't want players to leave so they have to do it somewhere where the players can be entertained

1032
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,820
Yeah, and it's like they make two hundred million dollars a year

1033
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,380
I think yeah, I can like like they don't have to play golf every day. Well, they can live in the princess

1034
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:22,020
Yeah, and plus if you're doing like the rest of the NBA season, like Splash Mountain's gonna get fucking boring after a while, you know?

1035
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,220
Not anymore, no, because they're turning it into Princess and the Frog.

1036
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,220
Oh, right, Princess and the Frog Mountain.

1037
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,220
Yeah, exactly.

1038
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,220
Which, famously, that movie had a lot of mountains.

1039
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,220
That's true, yeah,

1040
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,220
the beautiful mountains of New Orleans.

1041
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,220
Beautiful mountains of New Orleans.

1042
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,220
Yeah.

1043
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,220
Take me home, country roads.

00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,220
like, IP

1046
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,420
they could think of that had like black people in it was Princess and the Frog.

1047
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,780
Disney's been woke for like eight years. Yeah it's true. Yeah when Obama got

1048
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,580
reelected they were like all right, Song of the South, we're gonna stop doing a new

1049
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:02,700
release of Song of the South every 15 weeks. Right. Disney was like oh well just

1050
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:07,420
like Walt Disney like froze his brain so that like the Jews couldn't get it and

1051
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:14,820
now it's like well we we made we made Moana now so yeah they're just good just

1052
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,340
they're they're just trying to freak him out as much as possible when they

1053
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:29,860
unthaw him yeah once they unthawed yeah we made we made splash mountain it's

1054
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,360
It's Schindler's List theme now.

1055
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,060
(laughing)

1056
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,140
What on earth?

1057
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,900
Oh my God!

1058
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,680
What happened to my idea for the

1059
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,060
Protocols of the Elders of Zion ride?

1060
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,860
Yeah, we had to scrap that, Walt.

1061
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,900
Yeah, no, people didn't like that idea.

1062
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,800
People were being super weird about it.

1063
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,180
Yeah, people were being so weird.

1064
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,640
I mean, you're alive now, you can talk to them about it.

1065
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,620
I'm sure you can convince them, but--

1066
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,060
Here, let's get you set up with a Twitter account.

1067
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:03,620
we're gonna go first all right well Walt Disney has been taken so Walt Disney

1068
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:08,220
1480 nope that's been taken too.

1069
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:19,620
yeah why is it why is your at Walt Disney 1488 well I think Disney properties

1070
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:25,780
should be as accessible to 14 year olds as 88 year olds.

1071
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,340
So that's pretty much why.

1072
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,720
Oh, okay.

1073
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,720
We believe you.

1074
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,540
Yeah, I tried every number from 1 to 1487.

1075
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,540
I swear.

1076
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,540
I'm sorry.

1077
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,820
This was just the first one that worked.

1078
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,580
What is our CEO's last name?

1079
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:47,940
He better be a scientist.

1080
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,300
Yeah. He, uh...

1081
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,420
When they saw it at Disney, it's just like me.

1082
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:59,260
He finds out about Marvel and he gets really excited when he's watching the first Captain

1083
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:05,940
America movie, and then he's like, "Oh, man. I totally misread that."

1084
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,700
They did what to the Red Skull?

1085
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,700
Yeah.

1086
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,620
How are you going to kill the protagonist in the first movie?

1087
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,860
(laughing)

1088
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:20,580
- Interesting to do an anti-hero movie.

1089
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,060
Black Panther, hmm.

1090
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,300
(laughing)

1091
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,460
- Oh, well, that's not the wasp I was thinking, but.

1092
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,700
(laughing)

1093
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:37,060
I didn't know it was gonna be so literal.

1094
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,300
- It's never a good idea to unthaw anybody.

1095
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,420
- No. - Yeah, leave 'em,

1096
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,260
leave 'em froze.

1097
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:46,300
Austin power you should have kept in the thing dude. Yeah, it's too horny

1098
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:53,740
Yeah, yeah, they're gonna cancel Austin Powers pretty soon. God. He makes - he makes women too Randy, baby

1099
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:58,940
Yeah

1100
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:04,740
Here's my story of how my ex Austin Powers actually abused me by making me too Randy all the time

1101
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,460
thread one of 60 one of 69 fuck

1102
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:17,180
See that's his fault. Yeah. Yeah, I can't stop thinking about 69. I can't stop thinking about 69 in Austin Powers. Oh

1103
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:24,100
Oh my god. Oh my god. I went to shock therapy to stop thinking about it. Yeah

1104
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,700
Yeah

1105
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,220
Walt Disney wakes up and he sees the Star Wars franchise and he sees

1106
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:38,820
He sees like just reading really slowly and he sees the last Jedi and he's like the last I like where this is going

1107
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,060
(laughter)

1108
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:50,060
- Oh, fuck.

1109
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,940
Oh, God, that was good.

1110
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,500
- We have fun.

1111
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,340
- We have fun.

1112
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,160
- We have fun.

1113
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,740
- We're talking about Walt Disney.

1114
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,980
Disney is not gonna be happy with this episode.

1115
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,340
- Yeah, that's the real reason we should keep him frozen.

1116
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,540
- Yeah.

1117
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,160
yeah we're actually getting bought out by disney

1118
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:14,700
i know it i don't see mergers next

1119
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,300
is it

1120
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,100
i've been a reality happens at the time of this record a we're getting bought out

1121
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,220
by uh... e_s_p_n_

1122
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,380
uh... we have to support

1123
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,300
here we are technically a sports show

1124
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,580
they want to see if they want us to have a little bit of a station i choose i

1125
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,820
think you're in the improv yet instead of the emperor we used to be seen as a

1126
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,620
- Stand Up, they pushed, for some reason,

1127
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,120
they're censoring us from the Stand Up charts.

1128
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,960
- Really?

1129
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,540
- Yeah, I think they listened and they were like,

1130
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,060
"This is not a Stand Up podcast."

1131
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,880
- Damn. - So they took us out of it.

1132
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,720
It's kinda fucked.

1133
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,660
- Yeah. - They moved us to improv?

1134
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,240
- No, I moved us to improv because we'd stopped

1135
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,220
charting in Stand Up.

1136
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,140
We used to always be like six or seven on Stand Up,

1137
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:51,980
but then they just kicked us off.

1138
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,200
- That's true, yeah.

1139
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,220
- It's pretty fucked up, you know.

1140
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,560
- Yeah, and now we have to--

1141
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,400
- Now we have to do improv every episode.

1142
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,220
- Put us in the rapist category, come on.

1143
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,680
(laughing)

1144
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,520
- Why'd they go and do that?

1145
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,840
- It's pretty fucked up.

1146
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,680
- Yeah.

1147
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,220
- Yeah, I don't love it.

1148
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,320
- Yeah, I'm not a fan.

1149
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:13,040
I think they should have a category called lists.

1150
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,880
- Yeah, I've been saying this for--

1151
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,320
- They should have a category called podcast about list.

1152
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,280
- Yeah, they should.

1153
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,960
- We're charting all the time.

1154
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,480
- It's okay, we're just charting the normal comedy now.

1155
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,480
We've been charting for--

1156
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,600
- Which rate us five stars.

1157
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,080
- Yeah, we do need, yeah, let's get to number,

1158
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,320
let's beat Joe Rogan.

1159
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,240
- Uh-huh.

1160
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,920
Let's beat Joe Dogan.

1161
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,920
Let's beat Joe Dogan.

1162
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
We could beat Joe Dogan.

1163
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,280
We could beat James Dogan.

1164
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,920
We could beat Shane Dogan for sure.

1165
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
We could beat Shane Hogan.

1166
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,920
Uh huh.

1167
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,920
Shane Dogan.

1168
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Yeah, well I'm not going to say his real name.

1169
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,720
We could beat up Shane Hogan.

1170
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,720
Yep.

1171
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,440
And Shane, if you're listening to this, I could beat you up, buddy.

1172
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,600
I want you to know that.

1173
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,920
You try to send me that picture.

1174
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,440
Yeah, you try to kill me with your funny gun.

1175
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,200
Yeah, nobody knows what we're talking about.

1176
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,880
Okay, there's a comedian with a funny gun in Boston.

1177
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:06,680
Yeah. We've definitely talked about it before. I think we have probably, but he has a pistol with a sniper scope on it.

1178
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:13,680
Yeah. We've used that picture for so many things. There used to be a time when you looked up podcast about list on Google images that that was one of the first.

1179
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,880
That was like the only thing that came up. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome.

1180
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:24,880
That's so good. Yeah. We should all get guns. I miss those days where we just had like... I miss Boston Comedy, dude.

1181
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,380
It's all just Facebook posts now.

1182
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,380
Yeah.

1183
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,720
It's all like, "Oh, my Zoom show."

1184
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,720
Yeah.

1185
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,600
There was this whole thing where some girl tried to do, she was like, "Yeah, I'm going

1186
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:43,240
to do a Zoom show for Black Lives Matter charity where I show my tits."

1187
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,520
And then it was like a thousand comments from guys who would definitely pay to see that,

1188
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,080
just like, "This is in very poor taste."

1189
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,080
So awesome, dude.

1190
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,080
So cool.

1191
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,420
You gotta love it, dude.

1192
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,580
You gotta love it, I miss it.

1193
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,400
I'm moving back.

1194
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,240
Well, that's the double standard.

1195
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,600
And it sucks that they didn't let you do your Zoom show.

1196
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,280
Yeah, it is pretty sad.

1197
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,180
Yeah, that's why I have to wear these tank tops now.

1198
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,760
It's as close as I can get.

1199
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,760
Yeah, they didn't let us do Caleb's Comedy Club.

1200
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,760
And let me tell you, those aren't C's.

1201
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,600
Yeah.

1202
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,060

01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,100
