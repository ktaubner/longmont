00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:38,400
(singing)

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Welcome back to another episode of Podcasts Without Lists. I'm your host Caleb Pitt.

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,120
You had potatoes and peas for lunch?

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
I had just potatoes and peas.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
It's called a combination.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
It's called beasties and...

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Potatoes and peas.

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,400
Potatoes and peas. It's a Jamaican dish called potatoes and peas combination.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
You're thinking of rice and peas. That's a Jamaican dish.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Rice and peas.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Rice and peas.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,560
Potatoes and peas is the Jamaican Irish dish.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Which is the same thing.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Which could be fucking fire.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,680
They have a lot of parallels in their culture I've heard.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Yes.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
They both live on the...

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
And they both live in Ireland. They both live on the island.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,520
When you go to County Cork, they're just daggering. Did you see a bunch of

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,920
these old... Did you see a bunch of daggering in Ireland? Most Irish women.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,640
Everybody was playing steel drums when I went. And daggering each other.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah. And there was... Shooting their butts with maximum velocity. Except it's

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,120
illegal to

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,000
play Rasta music in Ireland. Really? There's a law against it.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,400
You can't play any music that has more than one instrument and the voice

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,900
counts as an instrument. There is an interview with Morrissey from the 80s

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,960
where they asked him if rubber ring was inspired by like dub songs or whatever,

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,760
and he said that

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,800
rubber ring a condom song rubber ring is like it's the there's like I don't know

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,480
kind of sounds they're like oh it kind of sounds like a reggae song and he said

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,760
no reggae is the most black supremacist music.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,360
What is the thing with I've never understood the Morrissey love? I don't

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,020
give a fuck about his music at all. I think that most of people like Morrissey just like

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,560
that he's racist. You weren't like 15 when you first heard the Smiths or anything. Back

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,840
when you were 15 you really connect with the lyrics. Oh yeah. Well I didn't know how racist

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,680
he was until like later. But he's also gay. Yeah. And he's sad too. He's a big queen.

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,640
I guess to be a singer who's racist and is always sad is better than being really happy

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,440
about being racist. Yeah, yeah, this is a system being like more

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,880
balance. I think in that regard, more sees almost a

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,060
cautionary tale to the racist. Yeah, if you're racist, you could be a

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,640
millionaire, but maybe you'll have to be a millionaire about frowning. Yes,

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,380
you'll have to make songs about how many frown. What does his sound sound

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,720
like a million frowns? I think it was the name of one of the

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,160
What was his band that he did? The Smiths. His name is Morrissey Smith? No, his name

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,640
is Stephen Patrick Morrissey. Stephen Patrick? Irish. Irish Blood English Heart was another

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,480
one of his songs that came out in 2004. What does that mean? Irish Blood English Heart?

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,120
The song is about how he was born in Ireland, but he loves England so much. He loves England?

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,200
Yeah, he's a weird character, this guy. He's a weird freak. And he dresses in trench coats?

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
pretty much. But he also doesn't wear a shirt. He doesn't wear a shirt and then

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,200
he swings flowers around on stage. Did he used to be skinny and now he's fat or was he

52
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
always kind of fat and old? He was very, very, very thin. You're the one

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
for me fatty. That's a good song. Oh God, he has the worst kind of

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Irish body. Yeah, he looks kind of exactly like my father.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah, those like really skinny arms and just the

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
giant. My dad's, he's, you know. Look at that. The skinny arms and the

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
giant torso. Pat, I'm going to be honest, this is where you're headed.

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Yeah?

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,700
Yeah, this is a skater body.

60
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
A skater body?

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Yeah.

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
He's clearly a skater.

63
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,700
I don't think he looks terrible.

64
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,200
Why is he, he looks fucking terrible. Are you crazy?

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
He just looks fat.

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Is he milking himself in this picture?

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Yeah, he's milking himself.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,200
For what? As a statement of, is he bleeding onto his hand or is that the shadow of his

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
microphone?

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,700
He is milking himself because he's so anti-milk and he's vegan and he's so anti-milk that he

71
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,800
he'd rather have his own body be milked. He wants to be a cow milk. Yeah, that

72
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,300
sounds like a

73
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,800
man.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,300
He's jealous of the cows. He's jealous of the cows to be able to be having

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,600
milk. Yes, I do think it would feel pretty good to get milked. Yeah. Well,

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,100
look what he's doing right. I don't know. It depends on if you have milk

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,700
ready to go or if your body doesn't have milk. It's probably going to feel

78
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,500
like when you get blood drawn, you run out. Yeah, it's going to hurt pretty

79
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,200
bad where your body's kind of grasping at straws and I know that

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,880
Oh, I know that milk needs to come out, but there's none ready. So you're saying

81
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,320
it's like, oh, I'm dry. Yeah, it's like trying to force. I think that's what he's

82
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,200
saying. Milk out of him. I think he's saying I'm dry and I'm sad because I'm

83
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,960
dry. I don't have any milk to give you my adoring fans. This person on X said

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
they googled why is Morrissey fat and they came upon this horror. It's not

85
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,600
that much necessarily horror. Yeah, I don't love it. This is a horror to you

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,040
you should check out a twenty four. You should maybe try on reaster flick

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,080
yeah because what's more horrific than your own family? Yeah, your mom,

88
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,240
we should what's scarier than your own mom that every reaster movie is what if

89
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,960
your friends or your family had

90
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,240
the ability to be odd to you or what if you went on vacay or what if you went

91
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,760
on a fire ass vacay, what if your vacation took a left turn? Did you guys

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,360
you ever watch the that movies about you ever watch his point of a

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
total debut is sure.

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Something we talked about one yeah yeah, some things up with the

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,860
johnson's are not that funny man listen man. I just can't get into

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,460
that kind of stuff. It's a that's a movie about it.

97
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:08,660
Hey, if that's if that's that's the way you swing that's fine.

98
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,760
You know, I'm not the kind of I'm not going to come into your

99
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,560
house and tell you what to do, but but that type of thing. It's

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,360
which is typically not for me doesn't do it, except in the rarest of cases.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,320
That's a movie

102
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,080
keeping it's not keeping up with the johnson's something about the johnson's

103
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,680
the movie about a child molesting his own dad. Yeah, it's kind of a reverse

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,920
move. Yeah, it's kind of a fish

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,720
yeah,

106
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,620
kind of the ultimate fish out of water. It's an unlikely hero.

107
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,820
Listen, buddy,

108
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,660
what's so confusing to me about that movie? Why go for your dad? Yeah,

109
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,120
dude, mom.

110
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:02,760
It really doesn't make a lot of sense. That's not right. Well, that's what's

111
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,120
so terrifying about it. Yeah, is that this kid is, this kid is so weird.

112
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,620
Wait till you have kids. Yeah, you're in a rush.

113
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,660
trying to get all the molesting done. Come on man. Yeah, you got a nephew man.

114
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,700
This is about a

115
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:24,900
somebody who is I mean he's a mold breaker. Yeah, you know, youngest to do

116
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,060
it. Not only is he trying to molest his parents, but he picks the weirdest one.

117
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,940
He picks the weird and his dad is a weird guy in the movie, which is a

118
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,380
standard.

119
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,900
That would make you weird too. I think your dad was weird. Your son was straight

120
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,400
getting up in your stuff.

121
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,300
- Yeah, well he acts weird as hell in that movie.

122
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,500
- I'd probably be the family man and I'd handle it.

123
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,360
- How many times have we talked about this movie

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
on the show?

125
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,460
- I don't know if we ever have.

126
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,300
- Yeah?

127
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,940
- It's a bit risque and we don't typically cover that type

128
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,780
of a guy as blue.

129
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,700
- No, I mean as soon as the video started getting bluer,

130
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,200
I think our material has as well.

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,460
- Oh God.

132
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,340
- Yeah.

133
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,620
- I like the blue video.

134
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,780
- I do like the blue video,

135
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,040
but do you think we could tone it down

136
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,220
with the blue material?

137
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,220
- Do you think it, oh.

138
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,740
you're the one who no you didn't. I didn't. But you're the one who called it

139
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,860
blue. But you're the one who was talking about blueness. Yeah. Blue, we can go

140
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,580
blue-ish, but I don't think we can go. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to dive head

141
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,940
first. You want to go straight blue? I like every once in a while. You want to

142
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,900
become completely blue? Are you mad? Are you mad Cameron? Every once in a while we

143
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,500
do something really disgusting and I think that's good. It weeds out the

144
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,140
people on their toes. People who like normal stuff. It weeds out the weak.

145
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,720
we don't we don't something about us is a little. How do I say a little

146
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,180
offensive to normies? Yeah, what we haven't done a big disgust her in a

147
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,740
while, though, stinky shit, you haven't you know touched upon eating poop.

148
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,300
Well, I guess yeah, you know, now that I think about it, it's not so gross to

149
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,940
molest your dad. It's just wrong.

150
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,040
You don't think it's a little I mean it depends on the dad. I guess I was on

151
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,160
the situation of how you do it, but it's not that I mean it's just it's

152
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,700
it's maybe morally repugnant, but you know it's just sex. Well, it doesn't say

153
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,120
anything about this in the Bible,

154
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,400
but if your dad is really I'm positive, a son molested their dad in the Bible

155
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,720
yeah, it's not upon the I'm absolutely positive. The Old Testament that is an

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,820
Old Testament story and the moral is supposed to be a job molester that

157
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,040
treat your parents with

158
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,880
listen

159
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,080
clean your room and listen to your parents.

160
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,120
I think there was a boy. There was a boy,

161
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,760
the most disobedient boy in all of Jerusalem,

162
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,080
father, Jod would tell him to clean to clean the

163
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,920
to sweep the part of the house or the it's so dusty, but all I had was sand

164
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,720
floors. The whole thing's dust and he's making his kids sweep. So he's to get

165
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,260
I'm going to let them. This is not

166
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,260
testament story. This isn't right. What we're talking about isn't right. If

167
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,880
that was an old testament story, they would have done a veggie tales about it

168
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,460
with the asperius son and dad

169
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:17,880
and I could honestly see a shot for shot recreation of there's something wrong

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,360
about it. We completely they would do they would do they would like kind of do

171
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,280
the Bible for kids thing and they would make the entire story about the sun was

172
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,440
tickling his dad. Yeah, yeah, that was like stop. You're making me laugh. Yeah,

173
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,020
I'm laughing all over the place on now. Normally a dad tickles the sun yeah,

174
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,120
but here the sun is getting tickles on the is the getting he's getting points

175
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,900
on the tickle board and he has no interest in is that part of that movie

176
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,740
where the sun molest the dad and the dad's like oh my God, this is awful. My

177
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,620
son's gay

178
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,300
is that

179
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,860
I don't think so yeah it shouldn't be you know what son I'm kicking you out

180
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,100
yep, you better find your own apartment, because if you're going to be

181
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,960
okay, that's right, you're going to pay rent. You're going to be paying rent

182
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,900
buddy. You want to do that stuff. You move to New York where all the other

183
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,140
sons are molesting their dad. Dad molesters yeah, I'm sending my son to San

184
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,960
Francisco.

185
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:25,740
Movie, why did he make this movie? Don't have to talk about it all the time.

186
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,800
to be weird. You probably just want everyone to have deep conversations,

187
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,580
but how do you if you're if you were I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I

188
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,720
can tell you how I can't count how many times I've been, you know, in those

189
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
classic plastic chairs, sitting around the fire pit

190
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,280
out of the cabin with my friends. So

191
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,500
you guys ever molested your dad? Yeah, and everyone deep thoughts, everyone

192
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,240
smoking the weed, smoking weed and then like talking to your talking to your

193
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,680
I did you ever fight your dad. Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm actually kind of a weird

194
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,480
relationship with my dad right now. Yeah.

195
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,280
Yeah, after I graduated, I just started molested. I just got really sad after I

196
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
graduated and left the house.

197
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:16,980
But why would you make it right? First movie? So disgustingly make that was

198
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,980
that one of his ones he made when he was in college. I think that was just

199
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,580
like yeah, it's like a five project. This is man. You can't make a movie like

200
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,940
make that until you are a dad. That's right. Why would you make that movie as

201
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,900
a dad? You make that as you make that movie as a son. It's an admission of

202
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,860
guilt. Exactly. You make that movie as a dad. It's a cry for attention or help.

203
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,420
This is why only a girl should have been able to make this movie. That's true.

204
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,260
That is kind of completely divorced from the problem. Honestly, you know what the

205
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,500
problem is. If a girl had made that movie, it would have been erotic, steamy

206
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,900
and sexual. It would have been a firefighter. It would have been to

207
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,080
fiddle late firefighter firefighters.

208
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,680
So they literally get off on shit like that.

209
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,460
That's true.

210
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Like girls get off on the idea of a firefighter, like just tying their shoe

211
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:00,860
for them.

212
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,180
I did recently find out that girls like guys kissing video.

213
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,140
Yeah, they like gay guys against each other, girls fighting each girls, like

214
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,580
videos of guys fighting.

215
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,940
They like videos of like guys on like sixth street in Austin.

216
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,820
Just beat each other.

217
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,620
The Morgan Wallen concert fights.

218
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Oh yeah.

219
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
All that kind of stuff.

220
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
People fighting in the stands at Philly's games.

221
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,300
Yeah, that kid at the Dallas Stars game who said the N-word and then got the shit kicked

222
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
out of him.

223
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Yeah.

224
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,480
They like, they watch that stuff and they start gilling off like crazy.

225
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
They watch.

226
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,580
They're sitting on the washing machine watching that video of that guy getting shot with paintball

227
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
pellets.

228
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:46,420
Speaking of gilling off, Cameron, pray tell, what was the funny pornography video title

229
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,460
that you saw?

230
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,900
And can we find it? I don't want to find it. Okay. He's afraid nerd versus thug and there

231
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,400
was no victory. He said I didn't watch it there. Well, in a situation like that, I think

232
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,060
I would hope that both people win. Well, I would hope that the nerd, I think that it

233
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,620
was one girl who was a girl and then there was a nerd and there was a thug and and poor

234
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,900
boys. So she probably she's like, who does she was probably a nerd and a thug. She probably

235
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,600
I picked the thug, but the nerd should have won.

236
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,400
Yeah, I mean yeah, well the thug

237
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,500
the nerd would win the war. The nerd would win the war, but this battle

238
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,000
between the nerd and the thug. Well, but it was a I mean it was probably he

239
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,500
could have outsmarted the thug with his nerdly ways, but the thug knows about

240
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,000
the art of Shiatsu massage. Oh, that was that would actually work. That's

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,140
it's actually true. It's actually half. Also, no is he's also got giving a

242
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,260
massage, but the nerd has spider man, esk reflexes, though exactly and maybe

243
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,740
probably got webs of nut. Maybe maybe the nerd had a bigger member. Yeah,

244
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,460
it's always the nerds man. The nerds got

245
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,340
always an unsuspecting nerd with a large member

246
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,560
suspecting the large. That was another video title. Do you guys have a large

247
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,880
man? Do you have big members or small members? I don't even know what my

248
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,880
member. Honestly, I haven't seen it in the scale of like you says a scale in

249
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,200
the scale of like like as a rainbow fish scale, small to like large. I'm

250
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,820
probably

251
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,740
I'd say my average to small to large. That's your scale. The scale of members

252
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,980
across the world. I think that mine is nothing to write home about.

253
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,940
Okay, so you think that maybe there are some that people are writing home about.

254
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
I think that there is.

255
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,140
Dear mother and father, I've had the most exquisite experience.

256
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,500
A member I saw this evening was absolutely godzillan.

257
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,700
Oh well.

258
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,980
Europe is treating me quite well mother.

259
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,860
Martha, our daughter has seen one of the most godzillian members of the state.

260
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,180
I met the most unsuspecting nerd.

261
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,620
With the largest member.

262
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,020
whose name is Benjamin Franklin. She's having only coupled with thugs in my

263
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,140
ten year as a lover

264
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:19,820
I've found myself accustomed to the small. I'm now dabbling with the size

265
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:28,520
of the main member dinky, dinky member, a dinky member. I've I've saw a member

266
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,140
my word, our daughter is

267
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,140
moved on from the key members for member

268
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,880
She's moved on completely from dinky members.

269
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,340
There were people back in the day. She throws the window up and she leans out

270
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,660
all the people walk around the street holding clothes. I've seen the nerd

271
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,480
with the largest

272
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,340
I can't hold it in any longer.

273
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,680
When I've been with a nerd,

274
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,180
back in the day before they had phones to shoot each other, disgusting,

275
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,780
lewd images. Well, there were people who could draw real fast, but not

276
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:08,120
drawing even where people sure where people just writing like hello. Yes,

277
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,860
the war continues. My penis is as big as a bullet and I wish that I could

278
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,680
magnetize it to your mouth. They were taking daguerreotypes where you have to

279
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,220
sit still for the photo for like three minutes straight or else it blurs, so

280
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,320
they're jacking off in front of the camera and then they get the picture

281
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,920
printed on. It looks like they're the flash, their hands blurred up and down

282
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,020
on their thing completely still and their areas, like

283
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,520
which is why Japan does that.

284
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,580
What is that about man? Why do they still do that? I think it's a law over

285
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,880
there that people have to be cartoon to be in a movie. You can see well,

286
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,200
do they

287
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:54,100
different laws? No, when they blur the they blur out all the all the junk

288
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,780
yeah

289
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,840
that's a cartoon. Well, if you can show it in a cartoon, can you show a car to

290
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,000
cartoons where they show it? I've seen cartoons. You guys wouldn't believe

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,160
I've seen about cartoons in Japan is cartoons over there are for adults.

292
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,760
Doesn't make a lot of sense. No, I seen this one cartoon over there. That was

293
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,040
this kid and he's trying to collect all these Pokemon.

294
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,980
why can't I see their things in Japan to be able to search twenty things can't be

295
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,840
seen anywhere, but in Japan, well, that's why in red they have to Miffy. They have

296
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,880
stuff that you can see in a noodle brand. Pringles is a noodle. Pringles is

297
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,240
not a noodle brand stupid Google. What is considered wait? What is considered

298
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,840
disrespectful in Japan? Let's read okay, pointing in public. I just you're

299
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,280
pointing to it. We're not in public. We're not yeah, we're in private. I guess

300
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,500
you're right yeah, but at what line does what point is the line between public

301
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,420
a private blur in a podcast yeah. That's a really good point. We are

302
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,920
technically outside. What point do we do you guys think that we would fare well

303
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,060
or intensely poorly in eastern nations,

304
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,220
like eastern which ones far east far yeah? I mean I think okay, here's here's

305
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,640
my my run down. I think I would do really well in China. I think I do

306
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,040
pretty well. I don't know. Is that a party? Not sure I do so well in Korea,

307
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,680
Korea, I Korea, Korea, North Korea, they're a little buttoned up. I could

308
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,480
do North Korea, South Korea. I'm not so sure about China would definitely be my

309
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,280
most my best performance. Yeah, as a citizen, I do think you would be an

310
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,840
amazing citizen. I'd be really good. They would think Japan, I mean, I do

311
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,280
think I'm think I'm kind of quiet and demure that I could adjust to public

312
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,480
life in Japan and not and you see this a guy like this. He has an outside

313
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,880
voice and that's not looked so kindly upon in Japan. Now me, I'm more of I'm

314
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm well it depends. But also but the main problem about Japan is I can't

315
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,880
speak Japanese. The most that I've seen of Japan. It's a big barrier. Most I've

316
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,340
seen of Japan is from Jackass One. That's the most you've seen of Japan? I've

317
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,500
not seen a lot of, I've seen maybe a few videos here and there, but the most I've

318
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,720
seen of, like, people going out in public. You've never seen Lost in

319
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,160
Translation? No, I've really, I haven't seen that. I've seen Jackass One. Really

320
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,340
great movie going off of what they did in that if I go there and I start

321
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,300
shooting bottle rockets out of my ass and doing wasabi snooters and like

322
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,040
running around in a panda suit. I think that that could fare well if that's

323
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,600
what you can do. Did you guys see that video that video on x.com of the guy

324
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,580
who's from Australia or something and he goes to Japan and you know in Japan,

325
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,100
they have they have subway cars that are women only. Yeah, I can be on and he

326
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,800
goes he's like he's felt selfie filming. It's like they've got a car that's

327
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,000
women only walk and he goes into the key, walks into the car and he's just

328
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,660
videoing all the women and they're all like staring at it. It's like staring at

329
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,560
him and he's like well yeah, it looks like it's all women.

330
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,880
He just walks around it for like thirty seconds and they're all just like

331
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,500
staring him down and then he just leaves. That is awesome! It's really

332
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,520
funny. I seen a video of a dude, these two twitch like IRL stream. I saw that

333
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,860
this week, got in there, they got their jaw slid and their phones broke. They

334
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,160
knocked out. They got knocked the fuck out. But the best part about that video is as soon

335
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:21,000
as the second guy gets punched, he's filming the other guy who's already on the ground,

336
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,760
he gets a donation. He gets a text to speech. But the sound, he gets clocked and then as

337
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,100
soon as he's on the ground you hear the Mario coin. It's so good. And then the text to speech

338
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,680
is somebody who just paid $5 to write Hiroshima Nagasaki over and over and over again. So

339
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,360
The guy's like knocked out on the ground. It's like Hiroshima Nagasaki.

340
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,860
Oh my God.

341
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
Hiroshima Nagasaki.

342
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,860
It's crazy.

343
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
It's crazy.

344
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,880
Definitely. If I was over there, I would not be IRL streaming.

345
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
You would have...

346
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
That's all I would do.

347
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,600
I think that you would definitely be knocked out if you were in a public place in Japan.

348
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,080
I would be knocked out. Yeah.

349
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Why?

350
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,800
Wait, no. You're the meekest one in public. What are we talking about? You and me are

351
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
the crazies.

352
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

353
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
He's nothing.

354
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
No, because...

355
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
He's nothing.

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,800
but he's meek when he's playing a prank.

357
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,800
But if you're hanging out and you're having a good time, you're going to be skateboarding around.

358
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
You can't skateboard during... actually I do know this, you can't skateboard

359
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,800
every single skateboard clip in Japan, not every single but a good chunk of them, if you try

360
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,800
to street skate, they're very, very... They only let you do it on a hoverboard.

361
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,800
They don't want you to... yeah, basically you get five stars

362
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,800
the cops... you get your board taken away, stuff like that. Every single

363
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,800
illegal street clip is filmed at like nighttime. The one thing about Japan,

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,800
their culture that is pretty interesting is, I guess it's very customary over

365
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,600
there that normally it's frowned upon when you break the laws of Japan.

366
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Really? Yeah, where here... You're not so much supposed to do illegal things

367
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,400
that break the law. It's more than just a recommendation there. It's part of

368
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,300
their culture. Yeah, it's a cultural difference where you can actually go to

369
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,800
prison for breaking laws. Really? Yeah. Yeah. And kind of backwards country is

370
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,300
yes, I've never seen good manners are usually smiled upon. Yes, that's that

371
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,700
hell. We're here. The mild mannered are actually some of the lowest people in

372
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,260
our society. Yeah, like us yeah beaten down yeah, we're down trodden burn to a

373
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,480
crisp. We're completely down. Do they have jails in Japan? No, do they have

374
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,980
food in Japan? They do, but they don't eat that much of it, huh, and it's

375
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,800
considered respectful to

376
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,980
enjoy your food. Yeah, and you don't really house it. You're supposed to show

377
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:42,560
your respect the burp in Japan. I think it's very I can't is which I saw. I

378
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,540
always remember hearing in elementary school, you know, and and is I don't

379
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,580
remember Japan or China or what you're supposed to burp after you eat because

380
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,900
it really respect you're thinking of Shrek. Yeah, that's never never land.

381
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,740
That was one of those, but you know, you know, when you hear one of those facts

382
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,980
about an Asian country when you're in elementary school and you don't know if

383
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,660
You know, speaking of food and customs, there's a, in Germany, it's apparently very disrespectful

384
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,940
to get a to-go box because you couldn't finish your food.

385
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
Is that true?

386
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
Yeah.

387
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,420
That's what my German teacher told me in high school, is that if you ask for a to-go box,

388
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,420
they'll give it to you, but it's like, "Fucking Americans."

389
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,380
Americans that can't eat their food?

390
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,180
No, like if you don't...

391
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,620
Nobody, they don't eat giant portions of like sausage and pretzels?

392
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,620
Not that much, though.

393
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,760
I mean if you go to the if you go to the restaurant and you over eat or I guess

394
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,120
are you like over order over order that's considered very rude because

395
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,480
you come from a country where you get a burger with four stacks on it exactly

396
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,140
stuff patties and fillings, but it's also rude to tip.

397
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,940
Why did I ever under why is it rude to think about I don't I think it's I

398
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,880
think it's I think it's not right money. I think that maybe it is rude, but

399
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,940
they figured out that they tell you when you're a tourist in Europe. What they

400
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,540
say to you is they're like now it's not it's not customary to tip here, but if

401
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,800
you want to, you can that's every place they're like, but if you want to leave

402
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,900
them a little extra money, I don't understand how that could be possibly

403
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,180
now. How could that possibly be construed as rude that I'm giving you extra money?

404
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,020
Yeah, yeah, how fucking stupid are these Europeans that they think that that's

405
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,340
wrong every single European? They also if when you do leave them a tip or in

406
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Ireland. We left if we left people a tip, would you a few times? I mean, I

407
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,080
think you're supposed to tip a bartender. Maybe I can't remember, but we left

408
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,160
people to they're like, Oh, my God, thank you. It's like chill. I get the

409
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,060
fuck out of my face. Yeah,

410
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:41,540
you got danger close to my face. I can't see with these sunglasses. You got a

411
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,140
real real close. I guys are fly. I felt I felt like I felt a whiff of your

412
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,340
finger. These are fly. You got a way from my finger. He has aren't his

413
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,040
finger pit smell. You need finger deodorant.

414
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,380
Yeah, you got to get in those webs.

415
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,140
My body's been smelling really badly.

416
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,640
Yeah.

417
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,720
What's going on, man?

418
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,020
Ever since I've had it.

419
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,140
Nerd versus thug.

420
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,840
I didn't jack off to nerd versus thug.

421
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,020
No, he said earlier he thought he was ruining the mood,

422
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,560
so he couldn't do it.

423
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,600
I was too funny.

424
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,260
Yeah.

425
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,980
You don't want to...

426
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,180
That's why that ad that always comes up on porn that's like,

427
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,860
"This is not a dating website.

428
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,980
You need to fuck ugly old grannies."

429
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,440
You need to fuck an old woman.

430
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,360
Yeah. If you reject someone's...

431
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,780
What are the lyrics?

432
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,920
you need you will have to the lyrics ugly grannies. If you reject something

433
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,860
someone sexually, you will be banned from the website.

434
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,780
It's a really good ad, but if that comes up, I'm not familiar with it. I

435
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,700
thought you were joking. No, it's real and I show I talked to three people

436
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,720
about it last night who all said they had seen it too. Wow and somebody

437
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,520
actually had a screen recording of it on their phone when I brought it up

438
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,900
and I was like, yep, that's the one man. That is a funny fucking ad and

439
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,720
let me tell you what these grannies not that so many grannies are hot. These

440
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
grannies are especially ugly. They have freckles.

441
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
No, liver spots you mean.

442
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Liver spots. Old liver spots.

443
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
I can't wait to have liver spots.

444
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Morgan Freeman's got them.

445
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
I'm going to get some good ass liver spots.

446
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
He's got freckles. He's got normal freckles.

447
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I think I heard somebody say he has liver spots one time.

448
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Are people still mad at him just because he's dating his daughter?

449
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Oh my god.

450
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Something's up with the Freemans.

451
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
In the reverse way.

452
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Actually we don't know.

453
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Yeah, we don't know.

454
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,440
We don't know who started it.

455
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,680
But Morgan's finishing it, I'll tell you that much.

456
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,240
Is it like a Sun Yi thing?

457
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,280
I think it was his step-daughter, but not adopted daughter like Sun Yi.

458
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,160
Speaking of Sun Yi, on Friday I went to this party with my friend.

459
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,920
It was like this event thing.

460
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,020
It's like 3 a.m. It's like a bunch of fucking some like

461
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,880
like stupid

462
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,840
exclusive like fucking

463
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,960
stupid excuses like VIP fucking

464
00:27:51,960 --> 00:28:02,320
It was at this this like club thing where they have a pool in the middle of the room like a little like bathtub

465
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,120
and

466
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,000
We convinced this dude that Woody Allen was there

467
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,000
like two in the morning.

468
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,500
And

469
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,520
I thought this story is funny. I thought this is really funny. You can

470
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,760
convince them. We convinced him that Woody Allen was there with soon. He and

471
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,640
he was sitting by the crepe station.

472
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,200
There was a crepe. They had a crepe. They had a crepe station and it was

473
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,400
three in the morning. This guy went over and looked and then came back and was

474
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:43,680
like he's not there and we're like oh yeah no I think him and Sun Yi were really tired.

475
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,040
That's got to be one of the most incredible things I've ever heard in my life.

476
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,880
It was really funny I think you just should have seen the guy we told.

477
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,760
Well were you under the influence of alcohol?

478
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,400
I was actually under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

479
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,880
So you were a bit slap happy?

480
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
I was a little bit slap happy.

481
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,720
I think that maybe I regret telling this story now because everyone is going to make fun

482
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
of me.

483
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,320
Well now it just set you basically just the punchline was not all there I'm going to be

484
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
honest with you.

485
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,520
So it really is this story about you being a you're a socialite.

486
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,960
I was yes I was at an annoying thing for fashion week because of my friend.

487
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,040
Oh I think your fashion's week.

488
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,920
I think fascism's week and it's going to lose to us.

489
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,640
Yeah a strong socialist.

490
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,560
Yeah. Okay. I can save that by saying that there was something actually funny that happened

491
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,760
before this, which I showed you the video, but I don't know if I showed you.

492
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,360
Oh, wait. Yes, this actually does save it.

493
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Okay. So before we went there, we went to this other bar because our friend was DJing

494
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:56,840
and we were outside having a cheeky cigarette and a little boy at -- this was at midnight

495
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,840
A little boy ran up to me and my friend Rupert and screamed at us.

496
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Then held out a box of candy and went, "CASH APP!"

497
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Rupert's from Australia, he's not gonna fuck it, he can't use any of that.

498
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
What'd you buy?

499
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,840
We didn't have any cash, we were gonna pay him, but we didn't.

500
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,440
didn't. Somebody else gave him twenty dollars to scare every single person

501
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,600
that walked by.

502
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,800
So all these people were leaving this club and

503
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,520
this little boy is hiding in like the outdoor seating of a restaurant that's

504
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,640
directly next door,

505
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,320
just running up and grabbing people and going.

506
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,720
See, I watched the video that you show because you took a video of him doing

507
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,200
hit somebody and I realize that's my biggest nightmare, because I think my

508
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,800
instant react. I was my

509
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:57,080
before I even realize it's a kid yeah. I would I'm swinging there was somebody

510
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,800
there were I didn't record the other this person, but somebody went up to

511
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,880
like he jumped out at the guy that's that's a so funny yeah. We just hold the

512
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,360
sound up. Just listen to his scream when he startles him. He did this to somebody

513
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,560
and the guy went kid fuck you and

514
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,080
That's what I was doing.

515
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,580
Yeah.

516
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:27,880
See, that was the only that was the funny story.

517
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I should have told that one.

518
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,080
That kid is poor, guys.

519
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,280
That kid needs that money badly.

520
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,880
Well, he made a lot of money.

521
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,980
It's so funny to take the $20 and be like, "I guess I have to do this."

522
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,580
No, he was just run away.

523
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,080
Yeah, he was happy to do it.

524
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
He was happy to do it.

525
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,580
And also, I noticed.

526
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,180
He has a shield.

527
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,980
so you can say no, that guy paid me to do it. Yeah that too, but also I noticed he

528
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:56,060
the the as soon as he like scared me and Rupert and showed the thing he had two

529
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,520
pieces of candy left. He was doing good that night. He cleaned up. Oh my God,

530
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,440
pieces. How do you know he didn't start with two pieces? How do you know I

531
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,960
didn't eat the candy and that's why you're scaring people. He had a sugar

532
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,680
rush. That's a good point. I have a bit of a sugar rush right now because I ate

533
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,220
pineapple and had an electro lit. Yeah, that's a good. I have a little bit of a

534
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,840
- I got a sugar rush off of my coffee from this morning.

535
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,520
- That is a different kind of rush.

536
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,840
That's a black drink rush.

537
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,680
- It's a sugar rush.

538
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,680
- I did, I woke up very early 'cause my cat woke me up.

539
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,080
He bit me to feed him and I stayed up

540
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,080
and I had both a Celsius, or no, a Prime,

541
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,600
and a couple squirts of Pizzazz.

542
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,800
- I saw you spraying your drug.

543
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,320
- You squirted Pizzazz in your, yeah, that is so,

544
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,160
you know, I've been tempted sometimes when you're not here

545
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,160
when I'm at the office and I see the pizzazz thing. Oh, that's out

546
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,320
completely. I was, I was squirting the remnants of it because I knew that I

547
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,700
needed to be on my top of my game today

548
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:57,800
and, you know, and I was, I told this amazing story about a funny joke that

549
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,560
I'd, that I told. You just need to, you know what you need to do with your

550
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,400
stories, man? I need to go to a storytelling class. You gotta embellish.

551
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,120
Here, let me, let me, let me, let me, this is the version of the story you

552
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,080
should have told. Okay. So we're at this party, fashion week. It was hella dope.

553
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,760
you are a my way cooler and yes, more exclusive. We were people. We were

554
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,400
beatboxing and be boing in the corner sounds fire and this guy, this chump

555
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,040
pulls up chud, this chud pulls up and it's like is there anyone cool at the

556
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,640
party and and I'm like I Patrick, I'm like yo fam it ain't like that, but

557
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:36,280
there is one cat over there by the punch.

558
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,600
his name's Woody Allen. Maybe you heard of him. Oh, and he's here with soon.

559
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,040
You send this so fucking this guy goes over. He

560
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,640
sashays over to the bull. This person would have been was there and he was

561
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,600
fucking soon on the table. Damn wow.

562
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,160
See that's how you tell a story. See the problem is and then probably is I just

563
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,640
don't know how to tell stories. I was lying. Well, you just got to into you

564
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,560
get whenever you tell stories like this. I get too into the detail. You add too

565
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,600
details that make it sound really annoying. Yeah. Of like, "Well, I was at this

566
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,120
exclusive party at 3 a.m. at Fashion Week." I know. I said that. As soon as I said that, I

567
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,280
was like, "Who the fuck am I to say that? Why did I say that?" Yeah, you were not...

568
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,120
you were nothing. I was at a more exclusive party that night. I literally...

569
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,440
as soon as the words left my mouth, I was like, "If I... I should kill myself."

570
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,120
You don't kill yourself. You know what party I was a part of that night? You're not

571
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,620
Not beyond saving.

572
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,260
I don't think I'm beyond saving, but it could get there.

573
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,180
You think you could get to the point where you can't be saved?

574
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
I think so.

575
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,720
I think I could get there.

576
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,160
Where it's just over, there's nothing, there's only one way out.

577
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,720
Every single one of the fans of the show turns on me and you two secretly resent me and don't

578
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,840
tell me.

579
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,000
I have dreams about this.

580
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,240
I already resent you so much for going to exclusive parties.

581
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,600
Can I tell my joke about my exclusive parties?

582
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,760
I have dreams about this.

583
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,160
I'll say this and then you can tell me about that.

584
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,600
I have dreams about this because before I go to bed,

585
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,400
I watch all of the, like everyone,

586
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,720
like you guys turning on me and like everyone

587
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,040
hating me a lot.

588
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,680
I have nightmares about this because I,

589
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
but when I, before I go to bed,

590
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,960
I will watch the Too Lazy to Try Bert Kreischer.

591
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,200
(laughing)

592
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,640
And I'm like, what if I end up like that?

593
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,840
What if like every single person hates my guts?

594
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,600
like ten years down the line. Yeah, you got a while once once I write my

595
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,880
machine bro. It's

596
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,880
figure out your machine. Patrick, I love you and I appreciate you and I like the

597
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,680
fact that you are unapologetically you. I've had so many nightmares about

598
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,080
because it's it's it's boiling in my brain like

599
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm going to be Bert dude. Maybe you're going to be the machine. Maybe you're

600
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,360
just coming to you're just becoming too cool for me and camera. I think so. I

601
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,620
you one day guys. I think wait you think you're becoming too cool. Let me tell my

602
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,780
thing now yeah. I was I was part of an exclusive party that night. You know who

603
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,100
was there for people me a rogue, a cleric and a wizard. There's three all

604
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,940
night. Holy shit that is exclusive as fuck, but it's also kind of nerdy yeah,

605
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,100
maybe a little see he didn't go to your kind of like chic, chic, though

606
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:29,100
say ye she you're kind of like geek chic, though geek chic yeah that guy's that

607
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,740
guys make some bad music. You think he makes bad music? That's his favorite

608
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,140
artist.

609
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,420
Defend yourself.

610
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,380
He only listens to TikTok sounds.

611
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,020
You do listen to that shit. His favorite song is

612
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:55,140
that's why he's in such a jolly mood every morning. You know what song that...

613
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,020
He listens to this song.

614
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,420
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

615
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
I do.

616
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,980
So the Plex has your music on it and I'll accidentally, I'll go down, I'll go to watch

617
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,220
a film maybe, you know, the other night I watched Network.

618
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,220
Nice.

619
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,820
And, but I clicked on the music and I saw that all of the stuff on there was like Yeet

620
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,580
and Joey and Cemetery and stuff like that.

621
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,060
And Jubio, you're pushing 50.

622
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:29,660
I don't have any cemetery or joy in that and that's it. You're completely lying.

623
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:36,140
Yeah, we're lying, but we're watching out. You were born in 1970. You were born

624
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,540
during the Eisenhower administration. You can't be listening to the kid Leroy.

625
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:48,380
That is a wrong. It's wrong. Okay, if we just never talked about it, but like

626
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,880
do you feel it's like like really fucking

627
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,380
yeah, maybe he fakes his birth certificate like minute bowl. Maybe

628
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,300
yeah, it's possible.

629
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,420
Guys, we have been talking about exclusivity

630
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:08,540
and different parties and what is more exclusive? What is more exclusive

631
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,420
than what then I need to get abducted by an alien. I need to learn my choices

632
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,820
of words better. Play the sound getting abducted by an alien from another world.

633
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:29,020
What I think we kind of abandoned the secret alien costumes thing. What are

634
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,720
you talking about? The identity protection thing? My identity is

635
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,520
fucking protected.

636
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:40,620
That's why I've been so on one. This is the truth, guys. I'm not going to. I'm

637
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,820
I'm not I'm not going to split forks with you. We

638
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,740
could get killed for doing this episode. A hundred percent yeah. This is a lot of

639
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,180
private in let me just let me disguise your voice real quick. Please, please,

640
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,460
please

641
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,820
imagine this.

642
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:03,700
You are in your bed late at night. You're falling asleep. They're counting

643
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,820
your sheep. You're at ninety nine out of a hundred. This is normally where you

644
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,540
would fall asleep

645
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,100
as you say, one hundred, who should come and be, who should burst through your

646
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,540
closet door. He was there the whole time. Your suspicions from childhood were

647
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,980
correct. There was an alien in your closet. He uses a beam of green to put

648
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:26,260
you in a machine where he looks at your teen thing. You're teenaged? You're teen-,

649
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,260
yeah, you're a teenager and he looks at your teen thing. That makes sense.

650
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,180
The alien, the alien is looking at your teen thing? He looks at your teeny,

651
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,180
teen thing. Is it teen-, are you saying it's teeny or it's teenaged? He looks

652
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,540
at your tween thing. I'm a tween now you're back to being a tween and

653
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:45,120
you've been a buttoning up deked it by an alien and they are looking into your

654
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,840
stink and your thing is his green guys. It's an alien episode.

655
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,980
Here's some things I found. I just looked at it was honestly we were

656
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,080
talking about it was surprisingly hard to find yeah. It was actually really,

657
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,360
really hard to find the problem with the finding a UFO and alien sightings is

658
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,660
none of the people or none of the stuff is funny. Nobody ever yeah funny one and

659
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,020
When you do look this stuff up, if you look up what I was looking up about Arcturians,

660
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,020
right?

661
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,780
Obama, a famous Arcturian shapeshifter.

662
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,980
You have to click the captcha thing on Google.

663
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,980
And you don't know how to do that.

664
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,980
No.

665
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,980
No, you can't read captchas.

666
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,820
I have to have, I was waiting for you guys to come into the office because I was sitting,

667
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,700
yeah, I'm sitting there, I'm like, what's a fire hydrant?

668
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,700
That's tough.

669
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,460
Well, it's also tough because you don't know, is the little corner still a fire hydrant?

670
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,460
Exactly.

671
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
Right.

672
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,340
aliens killing people, which I've never heard this before, but I clicked it

673
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,420
because the guy's name is Am I crazy or not?

674
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:46,180
Have you heard of any stories of aliens killing people? And this guy says no, I

675
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,060
think, or he's

676
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,700
some Dr. Wu said, I know of only one instance in South America or Central

677
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,220
America, but can't recall the country. Apparently, the man had been partially

678
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,860
stripped of skin. I don't recall why they thought it was alien connected

679
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,140
regarding Beckley. He is someone they're talking about. He's known for

680
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,080
conversationalizing ufo tails blah blah blah. This guy says no. I think I

681
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,080
remember that one. Some guy in South America saw a ufo and went to get a

682
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,480
closer look, then got hit with a beam of light and his skin started falling off

683
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,520
and he died. I remember that too. This was the biggest news story ever yeah

684
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,800
and this was doctor. Doctor who the last reply on this thread is this guy say my

685
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,380
own experiences is that the reptilian slash a lizard humanoids I'm dealing with

686
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,880
seems to eat my clones when the need for them are up after a soul abduction is

687
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,820
completed. That happened in March, July, August and September this year. They

688
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,260
probably did that in June too, but I don't know, because I slash my soul, cut

689
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,620
the contact with the clone on my own and probably in early stage of the abduction.

690
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:52,080
I'm still a little baffled how I could do that, though. So long they don't eat

691
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,260
me, my main body, so I'm fine, I guess. That's my main body, my soul. Oh yeah,

692
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,500
he was curious. Yeah. Oh yeah, he's got clones. He was saying that. So this guy

693
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,400
has clones all over the world. They're being abducted by reptilians/lizard

694
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,900
humanoids, but his main body is fine. He's baffled how he's doing this. I

695
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,980
guess that's a good explanation on why nobody's like, "Whoa, why's there so

696
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,620
many of these guys? Because they eat the clones." True.

697
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:23,820
My Journey to Find Out Who or What I Am by Mark Antony. Wow, rings a bell.

698
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Maybe it's the real Marc Antony. J-Lo's ex-husband. J-Lo's ex-husband.

699
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:31,360
Hello. I had the craziest year of my life and found out I'm the biggest secret in the world.

700
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:39,360
First thing first, I was born a pieces in 1969. That makes me a Earth rooster fish, the creator.

701
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,360
Both of my grandfathers are special men. Joseph John... Wait, mine too.

702
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Yeah, of course. My special big guys. My grandfathers are pieces of shit.

703
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,520
Joseph John Rochefort. He ran the magic program for the U.S. Navy that broke the

704
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,600
Japanese codes in WW2. His nickname was Merlin, and he remembers everything he

705
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,360
see and heard, and the greatest puzzle solver in history.

706
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:02,960
- Whoa.

707
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,040
- Elf, he looks like a elf, as my father and me when I was younger, super skinny

708
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,400
head with large sticking out ears. Ray Bruce, that comes from a long line of

709
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,840
cunning folks that is famous for miracle healing. The rumor is that makes him an

710
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,980
angel alien. My mother and father both didn't get sick and can heal miracle

711
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,040
fast. Light and dark angel.

712
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,520
Whoa, wait.

713
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,440
Getting sick from what?

714
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,440
Ray Bruce. Rodney Bruce.

715
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,940
Who dat?

716
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,040
Oh my God.

717
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,240
The leader of the Illuminati.

718
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,640
The leader of the Illuminati.

719
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,140
Shit.

720
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,240
Who we contacted, the master.

721
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,840
I've been talking to him since then, actually.

722
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,340
Oh yeah?

723
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,240
Wait, actually, can you...

724
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,440
Once he's done with this, can you pull up some of those texts?

725
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Yeah, I'll give you a quick update once he's done with this.

726
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:41,940
Okay.

727
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,200
I've been making, whoops, I've been making life from day one

728
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,240
paragenesis way, or like Zeus does.

729
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,080
I just look at you and you have a baby in a couple weeks.

730
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,120
(laughing)

731
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,380
I don't die, I don't remember my dreams,

732
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,840
but when woken up in a dream, I'm lost for about 30 to 60

733
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,380
minutes because I don't know where I am or what is real.

734
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,420
The dream I was pulled out of felt real.

735
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,720
I knew about my miracle healing because it runs in my family.

736
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,800
I just found out I was being used by the reptiles

737
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,160
to make them babies and that they've been blocking my memory and controlling me.

738
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,060
This Halloween at a bar party, a drunk reptile told me what I was doing in their bar.

739
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,720
I'm an angel and they hate me, but respect me.

740
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,560
30 minutes later, I heard crazy screaming coming from the girls' bathroom.

741
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,260
A woman who kissed me started to lay eggs.

742
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,600
Before that, they was staying close to me and feeding off my life energy.

743
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,260
But all of a sudden, they distanced themselves from me.

744
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,560
And I heard whispers saying, "He is an archangel."

745
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,560
He's an archangel. He's an archangel.

746
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,820
After that, the Lord Reptile at Capo Beach Church told me I was God. He only

747
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,620
told me because I healed him of COVID in less than a week.

748
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,100
Whoa.

749
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,900
The reptile aliens are in charge of Calvary Chapel Church, Saddleback Church,

750
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,100
and Mariners, and they are brainwashing the church-going humans and taking over

751
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,180
their bodies during baptism. You have to assume, yeah.

752
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,740
Yeah.

753
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,980
Christianity is reptile religion.

754
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,480
Facts.

755
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,140
Kind of cool, kind of like some Hitchens shit. That's pretty cool.

756
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,460
Yeah.

757
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,460
It looks like the Freemasons are in charge of the reptile souls to make sure

758
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,200
they are not lost and put into a new human body. LDS Church, that happens if

759
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,160
a male at 18 decided to become an elder. His human life ends when they put the

760
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,400
snake into them. Whoa. It looks like I'm the 26,000 end of the era cycle creator

761
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,000
of aliens, animals and humans. Birds and fish go sex crazy around me.

762
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,340
That's my favorite line of this. Birds and fish go sex crazy around me, as well

763
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:42,340
as younger aliens. It looks like there is a new alien in play. Big eyes, owls. They fight

764
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,740
with their minds and they don't like it when I look straight into their eyes and they can't

765
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:52,500
touch my mind. I'm told my alien race is a shapeshifter but looks like a very tall roadrunner.

766
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,900
Rooster God the creator alien. I look different to different people. God or the best looking

767
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,840
male or female you like. My race conquer time and space. I think I'm the firstborn. Father

768
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,680
of humans and younger alien races. I need help to understand all of this because

769
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,200
they see me but I don't see them. Most of them don't know I'm the first ancient

770
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,920
born aliens. They just see me as an angel as humans do."

771
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,560
Rooster God the creator alien sounds like one of those like

772
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,400
tertiary Wu-Tang clan members.

773
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,440
That's Rooster God the creator alien.

774
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,280
And that sounds like a ghost face line. "Birds and fish go sex crazy."

775
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,600
It's like that Wu-Tang affiliated guy that like chopped off his dick and jumped off a

776
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,600
building or whatever.

777
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,600
Oh, I forgot that guy.

778
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
I don't remember his name.

779
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Is that what he did?

780
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
I don't remember what he did.

781
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,760
Did he get, did he, was he hung by his, his balls off of a six story building?

782
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,760
Was he, did...

783
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,760
I don't think that's true.

784
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
Did they smash his balls with a spike bat?

785
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,680
I think his balls got cut off in a way or something.

786
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
Did they heat up a rusty hanger?

787
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
He got castrated or some shit.

788
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
No, it didn't do that.

789
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,180
I didn't do it. I heard it went. It probably went if that happened, but it

790
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,280
didn't. Did they lay his nuts on a dresser? This is kind of the only

791
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,280
interesting thing I found. So then I just do what you do when you want to

792
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,760
find some cool stuff and you just go to go to India forums,

793
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,640
which has just got all of it's just a forum in India where you can talk about

794
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,280
TV, movies and digital and this digital yeah, which I didn't really delve into

795
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,860
the digital. They did have a one day. We will that a book just sections, but the

796
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,720
main sections was called the entertain cave where you can talk about movies and

797
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,320
tv. That's pretty cool. It's a good name too, but they have a paranormal section

798
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:38,680
alien abductions. Do you believe watch? I believe in aliens. This is monar, but

799
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,780
not sure if they abduct. I prefer to imagine them more human rather than any

800
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,760
creepy looking sloppy creature,

801
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,120
which is a pretty scary idea. It'd be working for us. Sloppy looking sloppy

802
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,480
creature, a sloppy, scary, slobbery creature is not what you want to see when

803
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,300
to open up a UFO alien ship.

804
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:02,100
Aliens could find humans to barbaric with an over fondness for wars. Pink

805
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,500
says ET was the best alient.

806
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:10,600
Weld alien. Yeah, a little Brian Jordan Alvarez type of way of talking this

807
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,000
welt. This alient

808
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,100
is seriously going to TJ Mac guys

809
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,800
last I heard.

810
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:24,400
Yeah, and is that the end? Yep. That's the end of mine guys. Wow. It's nice.

811
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,080
Thank you. Thank you so much. Pat, you want to go next?

812
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:36,560
Sure. All right. Well, this one, this is, well, guess what? I couldn't find much,

813
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,400
but I saw an alien last night. Cameron and Caleb told me to write about an alien that I saw.

814
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,520
I gave you a book report.

815
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,720
They gave me a book report.

816
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,960
Because you said, "Guys, there's no, nobody's ever said anything funny about aliens on the internet."

817
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,680
And I said, "Okay, well, then you could be the first."

818
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,600
Well, this is an alien that I saw last night.

819
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,840
I was asleep in my bed, usually sleep on my back.

820
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,720
But this night I slept on my side because I was using my phone.

821
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,440
And when I look up, I saw the strangest thing I think I've ever seen.

822
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,840
You want to click play on that?

823
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,560
You put a video in.

824
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,440
OK, so describe this video.

825
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,600
It's a one eyed green

826
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:20,760
alien that I saw this in my bedroom last night.

827
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,060
What the fuck? This is terrifying. Yeah.

828
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,060
You know, this is a slop, a sloppy alien.

829
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,860
That is a sloppy looking sloppy green.

830
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,860
I understand now.

831
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,660
Yeah, God.

832
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,460
And then I found this video.

833
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,760
It's another another video.

834
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,260
Yeah, this is the same the same video man.

835
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,560
No.

836
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,160
What the hell is this video called?

837
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,360
What I want to have sex with an alien.

838
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,060
Is that you?

839
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,760
How long is the same shirt as you?

840
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,660
How long is this video?

841
00:49:51,660 --> 00:50:00,660
Not Scorpiona

842
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:12,660
Okay

843
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:23,660
I bet you they have some wet and juicy pussy.

844
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,660
If any alien...

845
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,660
Can you turn it up a little bit Jubio?

846
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,660
On the video?

847
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,660
Please?

848
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:37,660
Please come to where I live and kidnap me.

849
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:42,660
And let's have sex in your spaceship.

850
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,340
I would love that.

851
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,420
- You don't get to hide your identity for this.

852
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,180
You need to show who's doing this.

853
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,060
- But I heard an alien,

854
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:00,220
their pussy is always drenched.

855
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,700
That thing is soaked.

856
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:11,220
So I want the wettest pussy ever.

857
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,740
Comic book guy.

858
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:23,940
I want an alien to come,

859
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:30,460
take me to your spaceship and do things to me that you have never done before.

860
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,700
I think you get the gist of it. You know, he wants an alien. It's a guy wearing a

861
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,820
real tree jacket and he's got he's got a lot of other videos where he wears a

862
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:48,060
guy like a bio shock mask, creepy doll type man. Yeah. And he's saying that

863
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:53,300
aliens have the wettest pussies in the world or in the universe, I guess. Yeah,

864
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,500
the galaxy. I'm going to say I really with the slideshow portion, but I think

865
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,860
I made up for it by finding this video was seventy seven views. Yeah, I think I

866
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,860
I think I'll be watching a lot of this. I think I'll be watching a lot of

867
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,760
scorpions videos. Yeah, scorpions good name, alien name. Maybe he's an alien

868
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,660
with a face like that. I think that he's an alien face like that. He could be

869
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,860
true. I don't think that's his real face. The camera. It looks like his real

870
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,460
face to me. I mean, it's hard to see what kind of looks like a cherub shades,

871
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:29,160
but all right, we go to the next. Let's get Cameron's line show here and let's

872
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,760
We've kind of hit off the screen and not, yeah.

873
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,560
We don't want to hear about an alien's pussy anymore.

874
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Well, clearly you did because you wanted everyone to hear about it.

875
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,760
You made us watch that.

876
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,860
I was trying to find stuff about, I was trying to find a forum of like people who are into

877
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,360
like avipositors and stuff and like exophilics.

878
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,060
I was trying to find an exophilics forum.

879
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,360
Oh, exophilic, that's a good word.

880
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,660
Or exophilia.

881
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,160
Right.

882
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,060
An exophilic is like when a mosquito or it's like a, like how many mosquitoes are there

883
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:05,060
It's like an exophilic is like an organism that lives off of like human, like eating like blood and stuff.

884
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,060
Like a parasite?

885
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:12,060
I looked up exophilics for them because I thought that would be like exophilia.

886
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,060
Exophile.

887
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,060
I should have looked up exophile.

888
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,060
I guess, yeah.

889
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,060
Damn it. Maybe I would have found something.

890
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,060
But I was looking for like people talking to and like reviews for ovipositors and stuff.

891
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,060
Yeah, yeah, sitting on it.

892
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:30,140
but all I could find all I could find for Avi positive stuff was what is an

893
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,540
fish forms what people are saying legs out of yeah snap where they're they're

894
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,780
saying their fish accidentally pro lapsed their shoes their fish pro lapsed

895
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,780
yeah I found out.

896
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:49,780
This is the worst thing ever man this is nasty on this app this one's really on

897
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,300
another level but I'm gonna bring it back to the wholesome stuff okay I love

898
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,400
wholesome ass. So this is a website I found called taken by the graze

899
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,900
abductions in close encounters of the fourth kind. This is a guy who's just

900
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,500
written about all of his experiences with alien. He's seen a lot of

901
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,200
spaceships. Okay, mostly spaceships more than aliens throughout his, but he's

902
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,500
seen some graze alien graze throughout his life and he just kind of writes

903
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:17,100
about them on his blog. So most of them are very funny. There was a technical

904
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,700
accident. I think that they're trying to shut us. They literally tried to shut

905
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:27,600
shut us down, but we have no where if we get some static added to splice those

906
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,260
two together. I think that would be appropriate. I think and I think that

907
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,560
they will add static over the entire episodes. It was on here. Probably yes,

908
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,460
this shit is definitely getting d monkey monetized. Yes, so here's what

909
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,080
this guy. So here's one of this guy's sightings of a UFO by the grace

910
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,900
taken by the grace.

911
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:50,300
Refocus the window, take another gray taken by the gray taken by the gray.

912
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,420
thank you all right.

913
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:57,660
Okay, sorry, backward C shaped object. It was August twenty-seventh two thousand

914
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,280
five at around seven thirty PM. The sky was clear and there was still much light.

915
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,660
We had just entered Manitoba after making a delivery for a friend into Ontario,

916
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,400
so we were coming back with a semi tractor empty and heading West. It was

917
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,100
then that I noticed a backwards white sea in the sky off to the north of it,

918
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,880
but not too far. It was more above the north. First of all, I'm just thinking

919
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,620
what the fuck could that be backwards of white see in the sky come. I asked my

920
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,860
buddy who was driving. Do you see that he said yes, I then asked him what do

921
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,660
you think it is he said I don't know

922
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:34,940
wait. Can you go back to this image? This image is not mine, but similar in

923
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:40,580
appearance. Oh God, what he saw was what was his name again taken by the graze

924
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,040
taken by the graze. Okay,

925
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:48,040
I was thinking that maybe he's a blood and like he saw a sea and got like

926
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:53,200
really mad. Okay, well, I guess there's yeah. I guess it could be there's no C

927
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,520
and taken by the grace, the Reds versus the Blues versus the Graves man. I think

928
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,120
that they would unite. I think that Crips and blows would come together to

929
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,940
kill this gray. Definitely Grady. I then had the opportunity to watch this object

930
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,660
for about 45 minutes. It was as white as a jet contrail and I thought well, maybe

931
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,380
that's it, but I soon realized that it was remaining in the backwards C shape

932
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,640
and not fading or changing. I know there are strong winds up there and it should

933
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,800
have dissolved away by now. It was traveling in a westerly direction, the

934
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,800
same as us. I wasn't sure, but after watching it for a little while, I

935
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,920
realized it was moving.

936
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,600
We were doing around 110 kilometers per hour, as I took note, and yet the object

937
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,120
continued to pull away from us and it was some distance up. It was not going

938
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,980
any higher up in the sky. It was gaining ground on us, though. I then noticed a

939
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,760
large jet airliner that was heading east. I watched the two, wondering what would

940
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,140
what happened when the two came closer together, the object seemed to actually

941
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,640
pass right by the jet. I thought to myself wow. I wonder if they saw it.

942
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,640
They must have for some time. I was racking my brain as I watched it

943
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,060
continue to get further away heading west, so let's let's let's run through

944
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,800
our evidence for what this is so far. We see a white shape in the sky yeah

945
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,340
backwards. See it's up high in the sky above it's moving through the sky

946
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,900
looks a little bit like a jet con trail and it's able to pass right by a plane

947
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,120
without them noticing even a little or maybe they did notice, but we don't know,

948
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,980
but it was able to pass right by a plane. So here's this guy's theory on what

949
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:26,160
this white shaped object in the sky could be okay. It couldn't be the moon,

950
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,200
not even close to the right place in the sky. It didn't look like any moon. I

951
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,300
have ever seen my buddy asked could it be Venus. I said no, it was way too big

952
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,560
and Venus is a bright object, certainly not a C shaped object. That is as large

953
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,340
as this was. I continued to watch it until it finally was too far west and

954
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:47,000
went out of sight and then he adds this picture. This was recorded in South

955
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,700
Korea. Fucking shit, I think this be a white object in the sky. What was it

956
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,880
well? It's a UFO man. It's the only explanation right fucking. I mean if it

957
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,520
looks like that it is a UFO look it even has like it's clear that it's like

958
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,880
It's not misty. It has a little reflective part where the sun is bouncing off of it like

959
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,880
an apple.

960
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,960
And it says YouTube in the corner. Look, someone was skywriting.

961
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,000
True. Oh, and they put that little YouTube there.

962
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,960
And that's maybe supposed to be a copyright symbol for YouTube.

963
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,960
Oh, okay.

964
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
But they made it too big and backwards.

965
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,960
Some bad YouTube.

966
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,960
Circle.

967
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,960
This is a silver play button, guys.

968
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,320
Yeah. So then here's my other part. That's my sighting I have to show you guys. But then

969
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,160
the other thing, I just want to talk about the news.

970
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
Okay.

971
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
Okay.

972
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,000
website that I get all my news from, and this is the reason they're going to

973
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,300
shut us down is because I am plugging this website right now, but I got to

974
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,800
listen. I got to make a note. Everybody should be getting their news from this

975
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,000
website. This is where you're going to find the real news ancient files. Whoa

976
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,240
okay, holy fuck look at the front page of ancient files. Today, French woman

977
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,400
reveals she is a human alien hybrid video. Our history book teach us the

978
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,280
ancient civilizations were not technologically advanced, but here's the

979
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:59,240
evidence video. So this is a new this is the news website that's telling you

980
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,620
what you need to know. This is what's really going on okay. Is there about us

981
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:05,960
page ancient files is a website dedicated to ancient history, ancient

982
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,940
aliens and ancient UFOs. We will try to provide daily interesting content about

983
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,300
ancient aliens. So this is the hard hitting journalism that they're covering

984
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,320
up in the mainstream. So here's some stories that they got on ancient files

985
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,720
okay.

986
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,200
Emily finds baby alien creature with six arms in Texas.

987
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,560
That could be, okay, no.

988
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,920
This is definitely people who make Skingoo.

989
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,600
That could be a caterpillar.

990
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,440
That could be a caterpillar.

991
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,280
It could be a caterpillar.

992
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,800
That's just a regular ass caterpillar.

993
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,640
I would recognize this photography style anyway,

994
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,080
this anywhere, this is the Etsy shop that sells baby Skingoo.

995
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,360
Why would it say baby alien if it was a toy?

996
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,600
It's literally called baby,

997
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,920
you're called baby alien.

998
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,360
It's a creature.

999
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,160
Today's episode is about the truth,

1000
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,120
and you are sitting here and you are trying to say

1001
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,840
that this is Skingoo?

1002
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,180
What's wrong with you, man? You're covering... And this happened...

1003
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,140
You were covering up on your own. You're completely covering it up. Okay,

1004
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:59,120
if we believe everything, though, we're... You have to be a skeptic.

1005
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,700
You have to be a skeptic to... You're being skeptic. You have all the...

1006
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,640
I am being a skeptic of all the stuff that I don't believe in.

1007
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,740
And that's fair. That's a caterpillar. That's really fair, actually. Okay,

1008
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,920
this could be a caterpillar. And this took place on January 12th,

1009
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,640
2023 is when this was found. A caterpillar type alien. Wait, that's the...

1010
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,800
Wait, hold on. It took place in January and it has six arms.

1011
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,700
now don't even don't even get I there's going to be something interesting about

1012
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,180
the a distraction. All I'm saying dog a distraction. That's all it was a

1013
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,420
distraction January six was January six from this or yes yeah, they honestly

1014
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,220
were both distracting from each other. There's two distracting objects. Here's

1015
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:40,500
another news story. Strange floating spoon has been found on Mars. What is it

1016
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,300
exactly? January fourteenth, twenty twenty three, take a look at this giant

1017
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,780
floating spoon and discover for yourself how bizarre the world really is that it

1018
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:53,320
let's say the Mars. I guess that could be anything that's a spoon man. What do

1019
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,100
you mean it could look at the red circle around it? That could be I mean

1020
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:00,720
anything like yeah, that could be like a Martian rover, but why would that hover

1021
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,340
guys a hoover? Why would somebody put a spoon on the ground like this? They're

1022
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,620
done with their sats, that's the real strange thing about it. It's not on the

1023
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:12,760
ground. Why would they it's above the ground rock? It's floating. I mean this

1024
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,000
just is no scientist looked at the spoon. They said it can't be a fixed to

1025
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,480
the rock. It must be floating based on the physics of but it's put it's

1026
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:24,120
attached at that at the end. No attached to what in the red energy field around

1027
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:29,340
yeah look it's got a red ball that's photo shot. No circle. They don't have

1028
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,700
photoshop on Mars. They don't have computers.

1029
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:36,040
I guess you're they can't do anything to create an image like this. Whatever

1030
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,140
here's another story. Inter dimensional entities in form of fallen angels have

1031
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,580
returned. Roussian scientists claim and this happened on January thirteenth

1032
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,820
2023 and the russian we all remember this from happening in 2023 in January.

1033
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:54,520
Yeah, the russians are like a race of alien that has commingled with society.

1034
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,540
Mm hmm. The fallen angels have been defeated more than 5000 years ago during

1035
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,620
the great revolution that destroyed the city state known as atlantis and has

1036
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:05,140
been recorded in the stories and religion as the great flood. President

1037
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:10,220
Vladimir Putin classified as a national threat. Any news related to a series of

1038
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,080
mysterious craters erupting in Siberia. At the same time, remember that

1039
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,100
Chelyabinsk meteor from twenty thirteen, which exploded with thirty times more

1040
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:22,840
energy than an atomic bomb. Finally, it seems that the US, together with Europe,

1041
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:28,100
is trying to demonize Putin and entangle Russia into a war in order to invade

1042
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,640
Siberia and get hold of an ancient defense system designed to protect our

1043
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,780
planet from these so called fallen angels. That's cut and dry. What

1044
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,460
mainstream mainstream news they're talking about the war? They talk about

1045
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,880
every damn day. When have they talk once about the fallen angels or the

1046
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,560
chelyabinsk meteor? They don't talk about it man. I think two hundred people

1047
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,440
got injured from that. Oh really, but I don't talk about it anymore. Wow yeah,

1048
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,660
why is nobody still talking about this? The chelyabinsk meteor? I mean it's

1049
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,520
kind of crazy. There was a meteor that hit somewhere in Russia, like kind of a

1050
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,260
small town and I don't think anyone died, but a bunch of people got really

1051
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,600
badly hurt. Yeah damn,

1052
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,440
I don't know. Another story from January twelve, twenty, twenty three, this had

1053
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,360
now this happened on January twelve, twenty twenty three,

1054
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,580
archaeologists were shocked to discover an ancient three thousand year old

1055
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,000
statue that looks like Michael Jackson. I'm a rock like Michael Jack, the

1056
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,800
theory being that Jackson went back in time to various eras and was

1057
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,960
immortalized by the ancient Egyptians and later by the painter, like maybe he

1058
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,920
got a painter, the painter, maybe he got a

1059
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:33,120
some kind of time disease and right or maybe he was going. That's why he that's

1060
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,120
why he was always trying to have sex with children, because to them,

1061
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,600
because he didn't understand time, he kind of he could show all of time laid

1062
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,240
out before a four dimensional busting ninety eight year old man. He had no

1063
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,460
it's just a nobody there's no time right there's no age. He lives in the

1064
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,860
fifth dimension. That's an actually really good point yeah and people they

1065
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,780
that they won't you won't hear about this on mainstream news. Here's another

1066
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:56,660
one ancient submerged pyramid was recently discovered in China. It was

1067
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,760
failed before the ice age, and this was discovered on January twelfth,

1068
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,900
twenty, twenty three, according to a is the guy who discovered it yep, and he

1069
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:10,440
also has a tv show. I think he has a long upwards hair. Yes, here's another

1070
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,040
story for a down facing beard. Interesting, that's interesting yep, oh

1071
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,440
my God, up and down hands,

1072
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,820
weird iceberg spotted in Antarctica, and this weird iceberg was spotted in you

1073
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:26,640
guessed it January twelfth, holy, holy wow,

1074
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,540
I don't know if you guys remember all this stuff happening that day. I

1075
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,240
remember it because I read ancient files. This is just one day of news.

1076
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,540
Katy Perry collapses on stage when MK ultra mind control goes wrong and

1077
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,240
this I forgot to put the date here, but this was also on January 12th.

1078
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,840
I don't know if you remember this happening, but you know what that

1079
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,540
MK stands for Michael Kors.

1080
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:48,940
She's a woman and they be shopping. I put the date on this slide here

1081
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:53,240
while performing on stage the beautiful singer Katy Perry started acting

1082
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,240
weird with unexplained behavior.

1083
01:04:55,340 --> 01:05:00,500
She even said to the public that she is feeling weird and she started to talk without a hint.

1084
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,220
Sources claim that it's not news the fact that Katy Perry is under the mind control

1085
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,140
process by MKUltra.

1086
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,300
This incident seems to take place due to an error in this process.

1087
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,300
Wow.

1088
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,300
Yep.

1089
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:18,660
Do you think that could be the concert where Russell Brand told her that she needs to fall

1090
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,660
over?

1091
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,900
He wants a divorce from her minutes before she went on stage?

1092
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,980
I think that this is probably a different one, okay, because she was really common

1093
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:33,060
collected during that. Did her boobs flop out? Apparently the Mk the reason they

1094
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:37,700
targeted her for Mk Ultra is because of the size of her boobs. Really flop like

1095
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:42,180
a beagle's ear. Apparently they put electrodes on them to scan on them. Yeah,

1096
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:47,340
they're doing the science like a like a blood hound, yeah, like the lips of a

1097
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,020
blood hound, yeah, because when I think of boobs, I think

1098
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,620
think of a dog's lips,

1099
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,420
sides of boobs.

1100
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,980
Summoning a dark force is the worst thing you could ever do and who's that

1101
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:06,020
very twelve twenty twenty three. That is the devil. He's not the devil.

1102
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:10,160
That's a new story from January twelve twenty twenty three strange little

1103
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:10,600
being

1104
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:17,540
live during a soccer match January twelve, twenty twenty three. Holy

1105
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:22,100
fucking shit. This is all happening in January. Guys, open your eyes. That's a

1106
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,660
little stick man. That's a strange little be. That's an XK CD character that

1107
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,700
escaped and started doing science on a soccer field. He has a pointed hat.

1108
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:34,720
Yeah, that could be a gnome. Strange case. Ancient pyramids around the world

1109
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,920
suddenly beaming energy to the sky. January 12,

1110
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:44,220
23. It was all the ancient pyramids. They made some experiments proving astral

1111
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:49,720
the projection is actually real January twelve twenty twenty three a

1112
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:54,760
teleported person caught on video is causing an accident in China still

1113
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:00,760
January twelve twenty twenty three a strange fish with human face was

1114
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,220
filmed by a tour. I do remember that China me January twelve twenty twenty

1115
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:10,320
three millions of giants will awaken on earth January twelve twenty twenty

1116
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,320
three. So these are some of the stories that are going on on the ancient

1117

1120
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:32,500

1123
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:41,960
they were covering it up with. What massive stories were being used to

1124
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,540
eclipsed the actual news, because you need you need to be reading these

1125
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,900
alternative news sites to see what's really going on instead of this bullshit

1126
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,560
smoke screens that are probably made up stories. You know what I call you see

1127
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:58,120

1186
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:19,060
shit guys. There is nobody worse than lawyers. Lawyers and blondes are at the

1187
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:24,160
very, very bottom of my pyramid. Yep. He's not really blonde. He's got like a

1188
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,960
dirty blonde. I'm not blonde at all. You guys only think I'm blonde because I

1189
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:37,960
I think of you as a beautiful blonde.

1190
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,960
I think of you as a beautiful blonde with big breasts.

1191
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,960
My eyebrow was turning blonde.

1192
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,960
That you should go to the doctor for.

1193
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,960
That's vitiligo. You got it late in life.

1194
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,960
Here's my problem with lawyers.

1195
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,960
That's vitiligo, man.

1196
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,960
You might actually have late in life vitiligo.

1197
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,960
What happens when you're...

1198
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,240
Vidaligo you might have.

1199
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,480
- Yeah, adult onset.

1200
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,240
- I googled blondness and eyebrow and there's no results.

1201
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,080
- I'm telling you.

1202
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,900
- It says you're a Frank Ocean.

1203
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:03,740
- Yeah.

1204
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,400
- I'm not gonna get blonde splotches on my skin?

1205
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,240
- You could.

1206
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,080
- I don't wanna be blonde skinned.

1207
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,900
- Yeah.

1208
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,080
- You have blonde, Vidaligo would not show up on your body.

1209
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,920
- Not yours.

1210
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,280
- You have whiteness.

1211
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,280
- You, I don't think you have Vidaligo at all.

1212
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,520
Now that I'm thinking about it.

1213
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,040
- The thing with lawyers, okay,

1214
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,880
is that they have invented--

1215
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,520
- Have you been dealing with one lately?

1216
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,360
What's going on?

1217
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:43,800
know

1218
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:50,800
know

1219
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,720
It's very upsetting. It is very crazy.

1220
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,200
But here's a lobster roll.

1221
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,640
And it was expensive, I bet. Market price.

1222
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,240
Yeah, I bet it was close to $24.

1223
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,360
My mom's treat.

1224
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,400
Whoa. Apparently.

1225
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,480
Mother's treat.

1226
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,240
Mother's treat. Mother's treat.

1227
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,480
Wow.

1228
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,520
Oh my God.

1229
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,240
Lobster roll, mother's treat.

1230
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,200
Mother-ter-eet-za.

1231
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,040
Okay.

1232
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,880
Mother treats.

1233
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,720
Mother treats.

1234
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,560
Mother is treats ya.

1235
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,560
Mother treats ya. Poorly.

1236
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,400
Treats ya.

1237
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,560
Mother treats ya. That was easy.

1238
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,160
Mother treats a kid poorly, does not buy him any snacks.

1239
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:34,240
