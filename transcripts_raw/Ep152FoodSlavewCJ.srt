00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to the Monster Conf Lists.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[Music]

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're a crap monster.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
[Explosion]

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And now we're at it.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But yeah, dude, this bed is, this bed is, I have a bunch of old shit, dude.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, let's start, let's not get back into that.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's not do that.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's already brought up too much pain for you.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That is true, man.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It does hurt me when you guys make fun of my cool old shit.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have a very special guest today.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
CJ! Hey buddy, how are you?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hey guys, thanks for having me on.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We finally turned CJ into our food slave.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh my god.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What's up with that? Why are you guys always threatening to enslave me and shit?

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Not enslave you, you would sign a contract.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, right.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But like, you would be a food slave for me after.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You would become a slave, but we wouldn't enslave you.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Like, the verb enslave is not in play here.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
here. Maybe if you don't want to be a food slave, stop making so much fucking food, man.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,880
Okay. There's an idea. Yeah, no, I mean when you say it like that, I never realized that

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,320
was an option. I could just stop making food. Just take a break from making all of this

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
delicious... McDonald's is down the street. Yeah. Just knock it off. Yeah, like I don't...

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,560
You keep showing me all this fucking amazing stuff with truffles in it and shit. Buddy,

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm gonna find you and make you my slave. See, there it is right there. Make me... You

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,360
said make or make you agree to be my slave okay I'm I'm not saying it's like a

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,840
hard no I'm just saying like right now you're not pitching it very well okay

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,640

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,120

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,800
getting you pretty close to you come on look at that giggle okay do you have one

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
of those those fucking beds for me to sleep in too?

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
*laughter*

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah, that is the type of bed that only comes with a hundred of them side by side.

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
*laughter*

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
You cannot get that bed alone.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
*laughter*

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah, it's a horrible bed, I'm gonna be honest with you guys, man.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
It's not, I don't like this bed.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I want one of these fucking, I want like an IKEA bed made out of fucking, like, cardboard that I can replace every year.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I don't want this fucking shit.

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,200
I heard little orphan Annie actually did sleep on that exact bed frame in the movie.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,700
So...

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
No, you didn't hear... who would you hear that from?

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,200
I heard that from Carol Burnett in an interview.

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,700
You are so stupid about my bed, dude.

53
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,700
No. And CJ, if you came to... if... you know...

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
By the way, I'd fly you out to be my slave.

55
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
So, that's on me.

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Okay. Alright. Looking better, yeah.

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Food is gonna be on you.

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Wait, hold on. Visit the coach.

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,240

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Business or coach flight?

So, you're selling the cargo hold.

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,200

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,840
Yeah, I mean my fans are just they're ravenous

106
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,840
That's all would you say that you do it for them?

107
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I would say I do everything for them, but more importantly I do everything for me. It's like

108
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:40,240
Famous ass answer dude, you are a star already. Mm-hmm. Jesus Christ, dude. CJ. Have you ever thought about maybe coming famous? I

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,200
Thought about yeah

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,040
I thought about once but I you have to be like good at something or like you also have to be kind of psycho and

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,760
I'm not either one of those yet

112
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,120
I might I might be so I might become psycho from not being good at anything like what about enough to get famous

113
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,800
- That might work for me, what?

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
- What about singing?

115
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
- I feel like you got pipes on you, dude.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,640
You look like one of those little white guys

117
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
who comes out on American Idol

118
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,800
and sings the most amazing R&B song you've ever heard.

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,480
(laughing)

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,400
Right?

121
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,080
He has the voice of a black worship leader

122
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,720
who's like 400 pounds. - No, it's crazy.

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,680
I can sing an amazing R&B song,

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,000
where the problem is I never make it past the first round

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,820
because I'm always like,

126
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,800
"Here's an old negro spiritual I learned."

127
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,060
(laughing)

128
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,060
And then I get cut off like two seconds later.

129
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
Yeah, they definitely draw a line with that.

130
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,060
[LAUGHTER]

131
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:39,500
Do you ever know anybody who's on like American Idol or one

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,540
of those competition shows?

133
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,740
I think we went to college with a few.

134
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,540
True, yeah.

135
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,340
I guess we did.

136
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,420
We went to the American Idol reject college.

137
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,700
That makes perfect sense.

138
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,980
We went to X Factor University.

139
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,100
I knew people who just like it's funny that they like just completely like you

140
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,540
can make it pretty far and never be on TV you can make it like top a hundred and

141
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,760
you're just never on TV you weren't like you weren't weird enough yeah they

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,500
could have you like Sanjay or whatever like who's Sanjay you don't remember

143
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,340
Sanjay no oh he was like that little Indian kid from like seasoned whatever

144
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,780
and he like hit a weird haircut and like Howard Stern like rigged the votes so

145
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
so that he kept winning.

146
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,620
- What?

147
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,460
- Yeah, there was like a thing.

148
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,300
- I didn't know about that.

149
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,380
- Howard Stern rigged the votes

150
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,280
so that a little boy would win?

151
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,060
- Let me look up.

152
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,700
- How did he do, do you just mean he told people

153
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,540
to vote for him?

154
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,380
- Yeah, he was like--

155
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,900
- He has a lot of pull.

156
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,660
- Yeah, here's a votefortheworst.com,

157
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,020
support the season's underdogs.

158
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,780
This is an archive on mtv.com from 2007.

159
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,600
- Nice.

160
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,140
- So I didn't just make that up.

161
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
Wait, what show was that?

162
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
That was American Idol.

163
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Sanjay is in like a disaster movie I think.

164
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,140
I think they parody him in disaster movie.

165
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Oh, that must be cutting.

166
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,140
I don't know.

167
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
They probably take him down.

168
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,140
This guy is psychic.

169
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Neither of you fucking remembered?

170
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Yeah.

171
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
I have a strong...

172
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Now it's funny because you would watch that

173
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
just like not remembering who that guy is at all

174
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,140
and it's probably just like the most racist shit of all time.

175
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,580
And you have no idea what it's referencing.

176
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,500
You're like, "Aw, dude, these movies rule, bro."

177
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
Those things are sick, dude.

178
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,940
Whatever fucking Bizarro White Wayans Brothers have made all those fucking parody movies,

179
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,380
they're the best.

180
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,500
It's Meet the Spartan Sanjayazin.

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,140
So it's like one, it's a different, it's like a rung below disaster movie.

182
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,020
One more removed from when they started parodying specific movies.

183
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Yeah.

184
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,340
I really wish they still made those.

185
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Me too, man.

186
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,780
On a large scale.

187
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,880
I agree. They were hits, man. I remember being really scared of the Alvin and the Chipmunk

188
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,400
part of Disaster movie.

189
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Oh, yeah.

190
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,180
Yeah, I remember being like, "I have to stop watching this movie, man."

191
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,380
I've never seen that movie. What happened to Alvin?

192
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,980
They just get really big teeth in the movie.

193
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,980
That's one of the biggest disasters of all time, I would say.

194
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,580
Yeah, I was like, "We have to pause."

195
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,180
The chipmunks get big teeth.

196
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,360
It was a fucking disaster for me man. I had to go hide from the movie. Well, the rest of my friends watch it, bro

197
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,780
That was a social disaster for me, man. Yeah, 2020 was a rough year for us all

198
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:37,840
All right, she's booming me about my bed and now I'm a little kid now dude, okay, but you're also trying to enslave me like

199
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,840
here in my defense on the one hand I'm giving you some shit I'm not like trying

200
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,200
to I'm trying to spit game at you about this whole slave shit try maybe convince

201
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:58,180
you you know the pick up artists for slaves

202
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Isn't that the language they use in Pickup Artistry too?

203
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Yeah, they do.

204
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
I got mad slave last night.

205
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Dude, the thing is CJ, I just can't feed myself very well.

206
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Today I ate a half pound of Greek yogurt and a bunch of hard boiled eggs.

207
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,500
about it. And to me, I hope you know this, I don't know many chefs, so in my brain you

208
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,620
could be one of the greatest in the world or ever. You could be like really far up there.

209
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,580
So I just need some excuse to, I just need somebody to make my meals for me, man.

210
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:52,400
Yeah, well, that's really nice of you to say. I wouldn't really put myself like, I'm not

211
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,400
like a celebrity chef yet but I think I'm like one DUI away from becoming a

212
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,600
celebrity chef. Or like one domestic incident away from becoming one.

213
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,000
I feel like you you see my potential. Yeah I do. See that's how all those guys

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,720
started as food slaves you know that right? I would like to you know hire

215
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,120
you as a slave I think is how you would say it. But you know not to make me food

216
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,360
but maybe just take pictures of the food that I make. Like I think I you know I

217
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I made like a mean peanut butter and jelly sandwich today

218
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
that I think would have really benefited from maybe having like, you know,

219
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,360
some of the ingredients on the side, like of the plate,

220
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,860
and like, you know, maybe it was like cut in a cool way.

221
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,860
I think that that could be a service that you could provide for me

222
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
completely without me paying you.

223
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
PB&J and cilantro.

224
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,860
When you sprinkle it, it's garnish.

225
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,360
Yeah, that's right.

226
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Shit looks great. It looks amazing.

227
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Look at that, see, you know all your time.

228
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,860
I'm learning so much already.

229
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
Can you imagine if we were full time?

230
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Yeah, I'm thinking about it, I'm thinking about it, but now I got Cameron's offer.

231
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,360
Cameron, I'll give you one for free.

232
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,860
If you would take in that sandwich and knock on into like a bathroom that you just showered in,

233
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,360
completely dark, and then turn the flash on on your phone and take in a photo.

234
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,360
All those things. Cut those out of your next photography session, dog.

235
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,360
You gotta get rid of that shit. You gotta go like out, you know.

236
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Natural light, that kind of thing.

237
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Right. His feet should be nowhere near the food, right?

238
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Like that's not...

239
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,840
So what if it's pouring rain outside

240
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,800
and I go outside barefoot and I put the sandwich on the ground,

241
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,320
I take a picture of it like that.

242
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,760
And then he sends you that.

243
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
Is this all right, CJ?

244
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,680
[LAUGHTER]

245
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,180
Yeah.

246
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,680
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,080
I'm sorry my stomach hurt after I ate it.

248
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,120
I think I'm allergic to rain.

249
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Oh.

250
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,920
What filter should I put on this?

251
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,240
[LAUGHTER]

252
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,160
Yeah, I guess that would be better.

253
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,400
It'd be better lit, but it'd be more wet.

254
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,720
So it's kind of a wash, right?

255
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,680
No pun intended.

256
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,080
- Fucking trade-offs, dude.

257
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,360
That's what cooking's all about, right?

258
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,520
- Yeah, that's what cooking's all about, is trade-offs.

259
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,920
- I think I need a, I've been,

260
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,960
a lot of people I know have recently gotten gigs

261
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,920
as like line cooks.

262
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,200
I think I need something like that, dude.

263
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,960
I think it would help me in everything.

264
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,840
I think I need a job.

265
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,680
- Yeah, I think everybody,

266
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,480
I think like if you're ever feeling like you're kind of stuck

267
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,800
getting a job where you work like 12 hours,

268
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
you do cocaine at 8 a.m.

269
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,720
and go and hang out with all your gremlin,

270
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,640
psycho fucking line cook friends.

271
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,480
- Oh yeah, yeah.

272
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,320
- It'll get you, it'll put you in the right state of mind.

273
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
- A friend of mine was just working a line cook job

274
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,160
where they had like a new chef come in

275
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,400
and he was like, he was like,

276
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,240
listen, I'm a very serious guy,

277
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,480
no cocaine during the shifts

278
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,720
and like eight people quit immediately.

279
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,600
(laughing)

280
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,720
I was like, I am in the wrong business.

281
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,280
That's the sickest shit of all time.

282
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,580
- When I worked at Cracker Barrel,

283
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,680
I've probably talked about this before, but there was a--

284
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,520
(laughing)

285
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,280
There was some fucking country cooking old lady railing lines in the back of a cracker

286
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
barrel.

287
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
I worked at a cracker barrel.

288
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,200
I was the dishwasher at a cracker barrel for like a month and then I quit because I wanted

289
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,480
to kill myself because I was a dishwasher at a cracker barrel.

290
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,360
And there was a dude who was telling me that he would take Percocet and Adderall so he

291
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:11,280
could like not feel pain when he touched hot pans and work really fast.

292
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
It makes sense, right?

293
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Yeah.

294
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
I guess that works, yeah.

295
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
I mean, I would have...

296
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,040
And plus, you vibe super hard too while you're doing it.

297
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Oh yeah.

298
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Absolutely, yeah.

299
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,640
He was definitely trying to just buy my Adderall off of me.

300
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,520
Did you advertise that you had Adderall in the kitchen?

301
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I think I told him I have ADHD.

302
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Oh yeah.

303
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Yep, there we go.

304
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,080
Do you tell everybody you meet that you have ADHD?

305
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I think I forgot something.

306
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Of course you did.

307
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
And I was like, "Sorry, man.

308
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
I have ADHD."

309
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,840
Oh, man, I thought you were opening up to us when you told us that.

310
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I thought you were sharing something special.

311
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
You tell everybody at the Cracker Barrel.

312
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Whatever meeting I have to go in at Cracker Barrel where we like salute the flag or whatever the fuck and I'm just like,

313
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:58,840
"Before we say anything, before we say grace, I just want to say I'm neurodivergent and it affects how I work."

314
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Baby, before we take this thing any further, we've been going steady for a while now. You should know something about me.

315
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
I do have ADHD.

316
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,440
very serious I could have an attack at any point in time.

317
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Oh man.

318
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,200
Do you want to watch Rush Hour?

319
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,400
I wish I had ADHD dude I'm too good at focusing on things.

320
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
No you didn't it's a curse.

321
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,360
It's not a curse dude.

322
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
It's horrible.

323
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Albert Einstein had ADHD.

324
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Do you have ADHD too?

325
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,760
Yeah dude it's terrible.

326
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,480
I'm like the only normal one here.

327
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,960
I have to look at my phone once every ten minutes during a movie or else I'll die.

328
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,720
It's like it's basically like living with cancer yeah.

329
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Yeah, no, I know. It's worse than cancer, dude.

330
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
At least it's lungless.

331
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
At least cancer you die.

332
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Yeah, you die.

333
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,720
You can't like, just ride it out and like wait for the end.

334
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Exactly. It's not treatable either.

335
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,720
They can't like zap me with a laser beam.

336
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,720
They can't fry your brain from the age of six with methamphetamine.

337
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
It doesn't work.

338
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,720
It is funny that that became the solution at some point.

339
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
It's so fucked up, dude.

340
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
It's really fucking horrible.

341
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,680
Giving a six-year-old fucking like speed just so they don't like they don't tell you that they like this dragon they saw

342
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:19,900
Like parents have such a low limit for like how willing they are to be annoyed before they just like sit down their kid

343
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,200
It's so sick, dude

344
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,520
I can't believe the industry that prescribed housewives like Xanax and fucking speed constantly thought this is the way to treat

345
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,000
responsible than that. Oh man. There's gotta be some heroes in there. That's all I'm saying.

346
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,040
Who should have been thinking dude? I don't know. I was, I didn't, they tried to put me

347
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,000
on Adderall at school and then they were like you should go try to get prescribed something

348
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,240
and then my mom was like that is gonna, my mom thought everything caused autism when

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,680
I was a kid. Like more than just vaccines. She was like any one thing that you take every

350
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,200
day will give you autism. She thought that like this kid that we knew. Well then yeah

351
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,240
Yeah, because I mean you look at like a medication chart where you have to check it off every

352
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,480
day that starts to look like a spreadsheet, you know, one thing leads to another.

353
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah.

354
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,240
You're going to start making bar graphs of how often you take your medication.

355
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,720
Yeah, you're a finance guy.

356
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,680
You develop an interest in autism more than anything like that.

357
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,960
But yeah, I never, I evaded all that shit, man.

358
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,240
I had, we just had to wholly anoint everything in my house instead.

359
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,160
That kind of kept us safe from ADHD and the like.

360
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:34,680
prayed the gay away and no pray it away no yeah it was very unsuccessful now I

361
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,080
didn't I don't think I don't think I knew anybody who went to one of those like

362
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,120
camp things the conversion camp yeah I don't think either I think by the time I

363
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,040
was like a teenager that was kind of that was out of vogue to elect it's kind

364
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,840
of weird yeah yeah they did they just had like if anybody in my hometown that

365
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Christian be like came out as gay they would just make it would make the gay

366
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,640
kid talk like six hours a week to a guy who used to be gay they were just like

367
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,640
put them in both in a room and just be like you guys just hash all this weird

368
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,520
come back later and I don't think it ever worked if you guys can believe that

369
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:29,920
Yeah, I know somebody who who got like hypnosis in their therapy which is like I

370
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,160
didn't know that they did that at all like what I thought like no I didn't I

371
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,960
didn't think that was a joke yeah exactly I did like that's not even like

372
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,200
electroshock where I thought like oh that was like an old thing they used to do

373
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,240
like I just didn't know that that ever was a thing that's just like we're gonna

374
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,240
cast a magic spell on you well you're gonna for cigarettes - dude I'm hypnotized

375
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,440
that a cigarette. I've convinced myself like I can't be hypnotized but

376
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,480
then I like I know that if I watch like Now You See Me and there's a hypnosis

377
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,920
scene I'm gonna be like fully hypnotized by a movie. Like I just can feel it

378
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,240
coming. I have such a weak mind. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I mean like I I don't know

379
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,000
that I believe in hypnosis. I feel like hypnosis is like... You play like a lot of

380
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,960
hours of video games though, right? Yes, yes you do. And you do the Bitcoin casino too,

381
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
you like the flashing lights and colors and that. They're beautiful, what do you mean?

382
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,600
The spinning shapes. Yeah, and the beautiful fruit. And you click again and again, more and more.

383
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,920
That's not hypnosis though, that's just having a good time. Yeah, that's just being addicted to

384
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,440
something. Hypnosis is supposed to be for like, so you stop doing something bad. This is just,

385
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,920
you know. Exactly, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, you can be hypnotized into, you know,

386
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,360
like clucking like a chicken. Yeah or like spinning around or something. Yeah.

387
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,160
Yeah. So both of those sound fucking fine like fine like I'll just do that like you don't have to

388
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,280
you don't have to hypnotize me. Yeah it doesn't have to be like a whole production around it.

389
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,240
Yeah like you don't have to fucking uh dangle a stopwatch. Well yeah so if I was if I was going

390
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,720
to be like a hypnotist or a mentalist or whatever and like have like rich people hire me for their

391
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,600
like their parties I would what I would do is I would like single out a really weak-willed looking

392
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,440
person before my act and I would go up to them and I whisper in their ear, "If you don't

393
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,600
do what I say during the hypnosis, I will kill myself." And then...

394
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,200
Yeah, just let them know it's a very actionable threat.

395
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Yeah.

396
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,600
But like, what do you, like, how do they know if somebody's susceptible to hypnosis? Do

397
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
they just pick like the shortest guy in the room?

398
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
It's the person with the swirliest eyes.

399
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Did they bring a hypnotist to your high school? Or is that like a just another fucking...

400
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
- No, they did that for me too,

401
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,840
they did like when you graduated from high school,

402
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,160
there was like the sober alternative thing,

403
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,520
like we have a hypnotist,

404
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,160
they might trick you into seeing something crazy.

405
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,360
It's like, I think I'd rather go throw up

406
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,000
in someone's backyard, but that sounds--

407
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,840
- Oh, actually, no, wait,

408
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,880
they did have a hypnotist and I didn't go.

409
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,520
Yeah, okay, I think I do remember that.

410
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,760
It was $5, it was like a student council fundraiser,

411
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,240
and I went and just the whole time

412
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,560
I was just telling everyone, you're faking it.

413
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,000
(laughing)

414
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,240
just in the like the top of the bleachers just like you're faking that it's not

415
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,440
real dude i've always that hypnotist did not cry in his car after the show

416
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:22,280
i've always wanted to go to like one of those like uh comedy hypnotist shows i

417
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,840
feel like they got a [ __ ] rule dude yeah like i'm sure i mean what do you

418
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,960
like to see do you just like make people say fart or something like

419
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,720
I don't really understand.

420
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,360
Well the hypnotist is the host and he before when he's bringing the people on stage he

421
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,600
goes and I now hypnotize you to say some funny jokes.

422
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
And then they open their eyes.

423
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,360
Maybe what if he hypnotizes himself into thinking he's Robin Williams.

424
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,800
That might work right?

425
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
Or something like that.

426
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,280
I feel like that's like the only way that a comedy hypnotist would make any sense.

427
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,840
Maybe he could turn somebody else into Robin Williams.

428
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,640
he could turn somebody into a newt yeah that'd be funny yeah that might be more

429
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,400
of a witch or a warlock fuck you're right dude they should have

430
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:18,760
a warlock comedy show comedy with a warlock hey we brought this warlock to

431
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,920
your school that's yeah one of these kids into a fucking slug and that's

432
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
that's gonna keep you off the drugs.

433
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
And every single--

434
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
You're faking it!

435
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Yeah.

436
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
It's not!

437
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
You brought that noob from home!

438
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
It's not real!

439
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,440
It's so irritating when you go to the Warlock comedy show and then every single comic that

440
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,240
comes up at the top of their act, they try to do a quick joke about the smell of brimstone

441
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,680
lingering in the air and it's like, come on, the guy right before you already mentioned

442
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
that.

443
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Oh, fuck.

444
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,920
All right, we have a long ass list today.

445
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
I feel like we could hop into it.

446
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Yeah, it's long as shit, dude.

447
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,420
Ooh.

448
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,920
Ooh!

449
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,920
And it's on, I mean, it's on CJ. I mean, what, think about it. What's the one thing we know about CJ?

450
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
He's a Twitch streamer.

451
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,420
Fo-

452
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Yeah, that's a-

453
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,920
Food.

454
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,420
Food.

455
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
It's okay, you got two.

456
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,920
I bet you guys can get up to three if you really try.

457
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Uh, food.

458
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,420
Uh, no.

459
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,920
He's wearing headphones.

460
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,420
Chef.

461
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,920
There we go. Look at that.

462
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Chef. Oh, that's a new-

463
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,420
Okay.

464
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,920
Alright.

465
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,420
Yeah.

466
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,420
For having ADHD, you sure are sharp. You just immediately grab it. You weren't, you weren't like-

467
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,920
Laser focus on that one.

468
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:27,200
Yeah. This is top 10 worst foods. This is from user Bob Tech on the top tens. Bob

469
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,560
Tech, not a lot going on his profile. No. He likes keeping it low-key, which I respect.

470
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,640
The number one worst food is cow tongue, according to this. I disagree. I've had

471
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,320
cow tongue before. It's pretty good. I've had cow tongue too. Yeah, it's just like, you

472
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,440
know, all meat, I mean, I'm stupid. Like, all meat is the same to me. Yeah. There's

473
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,880
There's chicken and there's beef, and those are the only two kinds of meat that I can taste.

474
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
And there's different types, there's subclasses of chicken and there's subclasses of meat.

475
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
No, no, no.

476
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
That's it.

477
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,000
Pork is a type of chicken.

478
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Pork tastes like chicken.

479
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,160
Alligator tastes like chicken.

480
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,600
Yeah, alligator's chicken.

481
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,800
As far as beef goes, shrimp is beef.

482
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Shrimp is 100%.

483
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
No, shrimp is chicken.

484
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
No, shrimp, no.

485
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Listen, okay.

486
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,160
It's the other white meat.

487
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,800
Shrimp is chicken.

488
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,120
Shrimp is chicken, popcorn shrimp is beef.

489
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
All right, you know what he said?

490
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Popcorn shrimp is popcorn.

491
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Popcorn.

492
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Fuck, dude.

493
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,800
All right, so there's chicken, there's beef, and there's popcorn.

494
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,440
Popcorn shrimp is popcorn, but popcorn is chicken.

495
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,840
There's so many different types of popcorn, dude.

496
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,040
There is a lot of popcorn, dude.

497
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
There's a lot of popcorn.

498
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
I can't even...

499
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Well, scallops is caramel corn.

500
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,840
I might have backed myself into writing a book right now.

501
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Scallops is caramel corn?

502
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Nah, dude.

503
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Scallops is chicken, bro.

504
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120
Yeah, scallops is chicken.

505
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:59,120
this

506
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
It scares me that it's circular.

507
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,120
I've had, I had a thing of frozen scallops

508
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
when I was moving into my sister's house

509
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,120
in like 2016. I found them in the back of the fridge

510
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
and I was like, "Oh, are you guys going to use these?"

511
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
That sounds good.

512
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
It sounds delicious.

513
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,120
And I got the worst food poisoning I've ever had

514
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
in my entire life.

515
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I ate a whole thing of scallops wrapped in bacon by myself

516
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,120
and just shit and puking for two days.

517
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,160
two days. Hell yeah, dude. Awesome. That rocks, man. You see a bag of frozen scallops in the

518
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,480
back of the fridge and not one red flag goes up. In a box, yes. It's even worse, man. That

519
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,040
is worse. Yeah, that's some Trader Joe's shit. Well, you know, at the time, they tasted amazing.

520
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,160
It was honestly... They are great. Yeah. It was good to eat a whole thing of scallops

521
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:55,000
wrapped in bacon by yourself. What happened after, I wouldn't recommend. When you say a

522
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,240
whole thing how many we talking probably like thing yeah maybe like a big things

523
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,880
a things worth yeah probably it might have been like a 20 to 25 count what the

524
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,480
fuck you gave yourself like you didn't know you boys didn't like three wasn't

525
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,760
yourself you like you ate like a Roman King and then you eat 25 fucking

526
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,560
scallops when I was on a girl I eat whatever I wanted when you're on Adderall

527
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:28,560
you don't eat that's the thing with Adderall. I know that was my one meal that day. How do you manage to eat 20 to 25 like you can't eat a slice of bread on fucking Adderall.

528
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,560
That's the thing that it does you have no appetite. The scallops like hockey puck sized right?

529
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:43,560
No these were kind of small I mean you know how do you fit 25 in a box. Yeah well it's a big box I don't know most stuff comes in a box Pat.

530
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
No.

531
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Something's got to be working.

532
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
What even is this?

533
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Is this a scallop like a snake?

534
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Yeah.

535
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
No, it's a clam.

536
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
No, it's chicken.

537
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
No, wait.

538
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Oh.

539
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Yeah, we talked about this.

540
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
It's chicken.

541
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
That's why it's in a circle.

542
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
I'm not mad.

543
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Here's a comment on this.

544
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
This is a comment and a reply.

545
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
The comment is on Cow Tongue is, "I would kill anyone who ate my country's holy cow."

546
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
And then the reply is from Sammy Spore and says, "Well then, that's disturbing."

547
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
I'm not mad.

548
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
I'm not mad.

549
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
I'm not mad.

550
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
I'm not mad.

551
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I'm not mad.

552
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I'm not mad.

553
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
I'm not mad.

554
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
I'm not mad.

555
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,560
from Sammy's Spore and says, "Well then, that's disturbing."

556
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:20,700
There's a good comment under that one that says, "Don't judge a meat by what it is. Conch,

557
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,680
for example." Someone says, "Why would they invent something

558
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,920
like this?" Damn, it was the psycho that came up with

559
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,120
this. Fuck, invented cow tongue.

560
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,200
That's just wrong. That's, yeah.

561
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,160
the fuck I hiss when I see the word get that word away from me I want to go

562
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,760
cow-tipping by the way I have no idea what the heck that's a food it's like

563
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:53,240
licking a cow's tongue yes true but is it cow tongues like good right it's some

564
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,600
sort of delicacy no no they serve it in like Mexican restaurants and shit yeah

565
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,000
it's like a taco if it's served there it's not a delicacy

566
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,200
You could buy it for like $4 at a taco, it's not a delicacy.

567
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,760
But there's only one per cow.

568
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
I feel like that should be more,

569
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,280
that should be expensive.

570
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,100
There's only one meat per cow too.

571
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,120
There's a shit load of cows though.

572
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,960
There's an insane,

573
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,520
there's more cows than people on the earth, I'm pretty sure.

574
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,040
I haven't done the math on that, but yeah.

575
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,480
Mexicans eat this, bruh.

576
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,920
Best thing ever.

577
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,960
Here's a comment.

578
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,380
Pass me the bleach.

579
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,940
Well, yeah, that's just a seasoning.

580
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,780
Yeah.

581
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,200
For the cow tongue.

582
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,240
Why the hell would you have oral sex with a goddamn cow?

583
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
That's a good question.

584
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,400
That's a, you know, not even on this list.

585
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,000
That's a really strong question, I guess.

586
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,840
Yeah.

587
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,660
Would you?

588
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,660
No, today I broke the story of Mr. Hands to Jana.

589
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh, really?

590
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
She had never--

591
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,800
That's a big step.

592
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,080
Dude, this is like what girls had to deal with

593
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,200
growing up, okay?

594
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,840
I was like, she was like, "What is Mr. Hands?"

595
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,960
And I was like, "Oh, you know, like two girls, one cup,

596
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:08,480
like like shock sites and she was like oh like Charlie the unicorn I was like no you

597
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,300
fucking idiot no that's a cartoon it's supposed to be funny no I'm talking about like

598
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:21,680
videos of people kill each other and I she just like she was like horrified when

599
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,200
I told her what it was I was like I don't even that doesn't bother me at all

600
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,900
anymore I guess. Yeah I think it was a big realization for her about like what

601
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,840
like my growing up was like. Number two is Brussels sprouts. That's fucked up.

602
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,380
That's a fucked up thing. I love a Brussels sprout. Dude, they're good. I'm not off to a good start bro. I figured like he keeps a low

603
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,640
key in his bio he wants to let the post speak for itself but so far his list is

604
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,980
dog shit. Dude sometimes when I'm fucking hungry to eat some pussy I just leave

605
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,020
some brussel sprouts out at room temperature for about 30 minutes bro.

606
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,180
It's like the exact same smell dude. It's fucking beautiful.

607
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,100
Just walk around, I'm wafting it. It looks pretty much the same too.

608
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:09,540
Yeah, cut in half, put it through a color filter. That is an aphrodisiac dude.

609
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:15,460
For sure. Man, I eat it one leaf at a time.

610
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,740
First day ordering brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes, just fucking eating out of brussel sprouts in front of us.

611
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,420
So all i'm gonna leave it at this, you know, what's up?

612
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:35,860
Hey, can y'all when y'all cook the brussel sprouts, can you leave the stems at the top, you know those little ass stems?

613
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,900
Yeah, i'm about to do work on that

614
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:44,740
Uh, could you also make the stem like look like it's kind of hard to find but like i'll find it easily

615
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,460
Maybe hide it a little bit.

616
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
Could you like hide the stem in there somewhere?

617
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
I fucking know this stem's in here somewhere.

618
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Fucking god damn it.

619
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,620
They smell like feet from an old lady who has never showered in her life.

620
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,340
I don't know about that dude.

621
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,060
That's not true.

622
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,020
I like brussel sprouts.

623
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,740
Roasted brussel sprouts, they're like maple syrup.

624
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,300
Like a little bit of like bacon and shit.

625
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,820
Yeah, like maple butter.

626
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:16,180
Dude, putting like sugar and bacon on a food doesn't mean it's like a good food.

627
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,060
You don't even have to put the bacon on it, like brussel sprouts with like a...

628
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Yeah, they're just good.

629
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,740
Yeah, you just like throw some, like just squeeze a lemon over it or something.

630
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,740
Yeah.

631
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
Easy.

632
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Salt and pepper.

633
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Deep fry them with za'atar?

634
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,220
Yeah, for sure.

635
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
What the fuck is za'atar?

636
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,660
Is that like genie dust?

637
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Yeah.

638
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,020
What the fuck is that?

639
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,340
It's basically, it's basically like all the shit that falls out of like your spice bottles

640
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
in the back of the cabinet.

641
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,420
You just kind of take them all out and then you swipe that into like a drawer thing and

642
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
then you just roll your meat in it.

643
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
Yeah, you're like, "Yeah, this is the star."

644
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
Oh my god, that's beautiful, dude.

645
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,420
Cumin and brown sugar and Monterey chicken.

646
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Yeah, all spices.

647
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
And just some black.

648
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Spider eggs.

649
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
One whole clove.

650
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
Yeah, it's great.

651
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
That's beautiful.

652
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,500
I think my spice cabinet is about ready to make some za'atar, dude.

653
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,420
I opened it the other day and it like blew spice at me.

654
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Like all in my eyes and face.

655
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
It was fucking horrible.

656
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
It's a defense mechanism.

657
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
It's evolving, dude.

658
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
I know, dude.

659
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
It's fighting back.

660
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
Here's a comment.

661
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,020
comment. Oh, don't even get me started on how much I hate these little green

662
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,620
devils, laughing emoji.

663
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,620
[Laughter]

664
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,620
No, not my radish.

665
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,620
[Laughter]

666
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
It makes me fart.

667
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Here's a comment that's just in all capitals. Nasty, and that's from Stoner69.

668
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Whoa. Fuck, yeah.

669
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,620
He likes a different green sprout if you know what I'm talking about.

670
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
That's right, dude.

671
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,940
I don't really like this, but at least it's not as bad as cow tongue, lamb heart, bull

672
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,740
or buffalo penis, and a buffalo penis smoothie.

673
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,140
Oh, well there's a spoiler for the fucking list, Caleb.

674
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
Great job.

675
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
Is a buffalo penis on here?

676
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Maybe.

677
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Could be.

678
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Yeah, we don't know.

679
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
Number three.

680
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,900
There's got to be at least like five penises on here, I feel like.

681
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
Different animal penises.

682
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,020
Yeah, I'm looking at three right now.

683
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,180
Oh, oh.

684
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
Come on man, put your pants back on.

685
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
[Laughter]

686
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Sorry, I'm having trouble with my audio, but just for Patrick, I'm not going to be able to respond to anything he says.

687
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
[Laughter]

688
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
That's right, ice him out.

689
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Damn dude, when the in-laws come over for dinner, you're going to be like the best slave ever dude, just fucking taking care of them dude.

690
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180
Making them feel like shit.

691
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Yeah, that's what I like.

692
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Turning off your microphone in front of them.

693
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Yeah, because you have a microphone like a drive-thru.

694
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,100
Yeah, you see, he threw an intercom.

695
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,860
Number three is Rocky Mountain Oysters, aka Bull Testicles.

696
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,300
Damn, they don't make fear factor shit now.

697
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Yeah.

698
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,180
Is this, do you guys have a defense for this one?

699
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,940
No, I've never had them.

700
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,460
It's actually really good.

701
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,260
There's no way this is good, dude.

702
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,980
I mean, I guess there's no reason it wouldn't be good, because like, it's not like there's

703
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,460
like pee in them.

704
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,460
It's, you know, 100% if it's gonna be bad it's because of texture.

705
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,460
Because that's every bad part of like beef is like beef tendon.

706
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,460
It's because it's fucking disgusting and chewy and weird in your mouth.

707
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
Yeah.

708
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
I mean, I gotta imagine.

709
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Yeah, so what's the texture of a testicle like in your mouth?

710
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,460
Yeah, I mean one of you guys has to be able to answer this, right?

711
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,460
I mean, yeah.

712
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,460
What's it like when you're really going to town chewing on it?

713
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
I haven't reached them yet.

714
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,180
Yeah, mine haven't dropped yet, so I can't reach them either.

715
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
[laughter]

716
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
Uh, it's like-

717
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,680
This is like- yeah, are we about to read the same thing?

718
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,680
I was gonna say, it's like neutering your dog and then eating it.

719
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
This should be outlawed.

720
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,180
Wow. Oh, look at us.

721
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,180
I mean, yeah, I see dog. I gravitate to that pretty fast on one of these lists.

722
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Yeah, you know, when you take your dog in to get neutered, it's sitting in the front seat, next thing you just look at it,

723
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,180
you're like, "I'm gonna eat your fucking nuts after I take him out."

724
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,180
[laughter]

725
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,180
You better- last time, you better say goodbye to him, he's gonna be in my stomach pretty soon.

726
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,500
Are dog testicles like fucking wisdom teeth where you're gonna have to keep them?

727
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,020
Do you think they get that?

728
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,940
I need you to neuter this dog before dinner time and I want to keep them.

729
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,740
I got a stew pot going, I'm gonna put these in when I get home.

730
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,140
And this is just what they need.

731
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,340
Listen, I have the nose thing from Ratatouille, I know what every dish needs at all times.

732
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,540
This one needs dog testicles.

733
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,300
Here's a comment.

734
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,940
Or should I say rubbish from a nasty animal part.

735
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
Wow.

736
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
That's pretty polite.

737
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,620
There's a comment below that.

738
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,540
It says, "I already eat a human testicle."

739
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
Alright.

740
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:47,420
Next minute, if my girlfriend ate it, she will have a minotaur.

741
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
That's how it works.

742
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,540
You eat food, it grows in you like a baby.

743
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,380
In total drama, the contestants had to eat them.

744
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Yuck.

745
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
Isn't that a cartoon?

746
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Yeah.

747
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
Why are you like grunting stuff?

748
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,380
It's a cartoon.

749
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,060
Oh, God, I would hate to be on this show, man.

750
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,100
It's disgusting to eating a bull's bits.

751
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:11,460
You're not a British person, bro.

752
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,460
Gross.

753
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
What?

754
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,460
It has sperm in it?

755
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Oh my gosh, so disgusting.

756
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Vomiting emoji.

757
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,460
Oh, this is sperm in it nasty.

758
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,660
I would be so pissed off if they forgot to remove the sperm out of the testicle.

759
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,700
Yeah, no, that's the hardest part about getting these oysters is you have to jack the bull

760
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
off.

761
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,900
You have to jack the bull off so hard that it shoots its balls out.

762
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Yeah.

763
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,260
Okay, who the heck eats the privates of a bull?

764
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,580
That's a good question.

765
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,060
That is just wrong.

766
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,300
People in the Rocky Mountains, apparently.

767
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,620
Get this out of my face.

768
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,580
Sorry, this is something I wouldn't try.

769
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,580
I'm not going to eat a bull private part.

770
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,580
[Laughter]

771
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Fair. Drawing the line on that one.

772
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,580
Number four is lamb heart.

773
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
I've never eaten hearts. I know that they sell like...

774
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
I've eaten chicken hearts before.

775
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,580
Something about, like my local grocery store has,

776
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,580
the poultry section is like

777
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,580
ten chicken breast packages and then only chicken heads and hearts.

778
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,580
Yeah.

779
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,580
Like what is it?

780
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
What do people think of it?

781
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,020
I mean that's how you gain either the intelligence or the courage.

782
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,020
I only go into Halloween though.

783
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,300
That might be the problem.

784
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,140
That's like a skill tree type thing where whichever one you buy you either class it

785
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,940
into intelligence, like mana or HP.

786
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:38,900
What's like the nastiest, like on paper nastiest part of an animal you've eaten?

787
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:44,100
Probably all the poop and the butt and the wiener.

788
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,100
That's pretty gross, man.

789
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,100
And the throw up too.

790
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,100
And all its boogers too.

791
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,100
And the cat's armpit hair.

792
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Pretty gross.

793
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
And all its earwax.

794
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
That was nasty. I don't even know why I ate that.

795
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
That was cow-pubes nasty.

796
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
I was on one that day for real though.

797
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,100
I was on fire though.

798
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:20,680
I'm eating chicken gizzard which you I I think it's uh I don't usually trust a

799
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,700
double Z in a food but it was it's pretty fine what about pizza you fucking

800
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,220
moron lizard either one of those I don't I can't eat pizza because that's gluten

801
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,220
in it now what are other double Z's that you don't trust

802
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Wazzah!

803
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:43,020
The answer to finding a hit with that dude, you're in trouble bro, you might be in a scary

804
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
movie.

805
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,420
You might be Scream on the other end.

806
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,460
Yeah, it's true.

807
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
But I've never eaten a heart.

808
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Yeah.

809
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,580
I don't like blood tastes.

810
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,420
Like anything that has blood in it is freaky to me.

811
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,380
I don't think they have the blood still in the heart when you eat it.

812
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,900
But there used to be some blood in there.

813
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Well, there used to be blood in there.

814
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
If you're eating meat, there's blood in there.

815
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
I'm pretty sure it's in there somewhere.

816
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Yeah, hearts gotta have tons of blood in it, dude.

817
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
[laughter]

818
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
You can't get blood out of a heart.

819
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Yeah, when you kill the animal, all the blood, it's like how a spider's legs retract when you kill it.

820
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
All the blood goes directly in the heart.

821
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
Yeah, I don't want that shit, man.

822
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,900
That's nasty.

823
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
That's why you got so many veins.

824
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
I don't have that many. I'm not that veiny.

825
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
I have a big one in my head that people point out all the time,

826
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,740
on the train and then that's like the only one though so it's fine. I have a big big anime like

827
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:43,860
like three things that whenever I get stressed out. I love this it tastes like normal meat but it

828
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,180
sounds gross. I guess it would probably taste kind of normal. Yeah you know I would I would try

829
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,940
lamb heart before I tried bull testicles I will say. Yeah yeah for sure. Nah dude because if you eat

830
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,580
bull testicles like that's like a that's either like a really funny story or you just won like

831
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,200
like a million dollars. Yeah. That's like a pretty good, I feel like you're always in a

832
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,380
pretty good situation. I'm sure you can get them for two dollars. Well you live in Colorado

833
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,740
and you're just one of those fucking freaks that's just like, "Yeah, I love this." It's

834
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:14,180
like, "Do you actually love this?" Because they're all fucking potheads, man. Yeah. They

835
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,100
get the munchies, they'll fucking... "Oh, I'm so hungry. Oh, my pantry doesn't have any

836
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,740
chips in it. I guess I'll eat my fucking bull's testicles." That was the first guy that came

837
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:32,620
up with that. Yeah. You know one comment just says vomits. That's short. That's to the point.

838
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:41,920
Someone says sounds disgusting shrimpies. Number five is frog's legs. Frog legs I guess taste

839
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,680
like chicken. So I guess frog is another type of chicken. Alright we got another win for

840
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,660
chicken right now. But it's because they fry it like chicken. It's like if you eat them

841
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,220
without, it's like because they're dressed up like fried chicken. So your brain goes oh

842
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,020
- Yeah, it's chicken, but it's like,

843
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,260
yeah, nevermind.

844
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,660
I was gonna say, the only other,

845
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,480
usually most people, the only other time

846
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,180
you run into a dead frog is either

847
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
on the side of the road or when you have to dissect it.

848
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,500
It smells like shit 'cause it's full of formaldehyde.

849
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,300
Nobody really knows what a frog tastes like.

850
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,520
It's like, oh, it's battered and fried and salted.

851
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,740
Everything tastes the same when you do that.

852
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,140
- I know what a toad tastes like, but not a frog.

853
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,380
(laughing)

854
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,460
But yeah, I guess that makes sense.

855
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
it's like your brain's tricking you into thinking it's chicken.

856
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,460
I guess it's the same thing for gator tail too,

857
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,460
'cause I've had fried gator tail and it's just like,

858
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
"Oh yeah, it's chicken."

859
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,460
I had gator that was like, it was cooked like in the oven.

860
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,460
And it just had like dry rub on it and shit.

861
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
It was solid, man.

862
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Gator is an underrated meat.

863
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,460
The problem to me is that it is much easier to kill a chicken than an alligator.

864
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
Yeah.

865
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Maybe you do.

866
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,460
But I think a gator is more of a reward when you kill it,

867
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,460
'cause it's like you killed a dinosaur.

868
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,500
We should be eating more reptiles in general, I think.

869
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,700
I think that's, uh...

870
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,100
What is your opinion on eating bugs?

871
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,040
Who?

872
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,540
Uh...

873
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,900
Just the panel.

874
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,540
Oh yeah, haven't people been eating cicadas and shit lately?

875
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,460
'Cause they're everywhere?

876
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,100
I mean, if it's around, you know.

877
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,220
Yeah, might as well eat it.

878
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,100
I will say, if I see one crawling up my wall, I'm gonna grab it.

879
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,900
It's easier than getting up to find a Clif Bar in the pantry.

880
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,700
[laughter]

881
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,660
Last night, I fought a fly that was like...

882
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,420
[laughter]

883
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,220
Not because I'm super small.

884
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,220
And I didn't use it too thick as a spear.

885
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,220
No.

886
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
I didn't do that.

887
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,220
No, I'm not really small.

888
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,220
Are you sailing in your sink on a bottle cap?

889
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,220
No, dude.

890
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
Why would I square up to a fly?

891
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,220
No, I was in fly combat.

892
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
I was chasing it all night, dude.

893
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,220
Like the Breaking Bad episode.

894
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,220
You were chasing it across your kitchen counter.

895
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
No, I was not.

896
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,220
I did not capture him and say, "Oh, we will feast for a week on this fly."

897
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
You know, you're far away from us.

898
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,220
I was chasing it all night, dude.

899
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Like the Breaking Bad episode.

900
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,220
You were chasing it across your kitchen counter.

901
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,220
No, I was not.

902
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,220
I did not capture him and say, "Oh, we will feast for a week on this fly."

903
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
No, I was not.

904
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:48,580
I did not capture him and say, "Ah, we will feast for a week on this fly."

905
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:54,180
Dude, did you do a really cool move where you swung on your window shades cord across and

906
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,100
you did like a Pirates of the Caribbean thing and you stabbed the fly with a toothpick?

907
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,320
Or a thumbtack, actually?

908
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,740
I don't even want to tell my fly story anymore, actually.

909
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,300
I want to hear your fly story.

910
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,580
Caleb, let's hear your fly story.

911
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,580
I just saw a big fly.

912
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,220
I think you're a regular sized man.

913
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,620
That's a regular sized bed behind you and a normal sized bed.

914
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,620
That's right.

915
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,620
Yeah, what about my bedroom?

916
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:20,540
room looks like I'm in a dollhouse right now. Almost nothing, right? I fought a fly and I

917
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,620
just looked at it and I was like I think if I ate you you'd fill me up about as

918
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:38,900
much as a grape. I hit him out of the sky and because I'm so big that it's the sky

919
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:45,440
at the top of my apartment I hit him out of the sky and he flew into my sink and

920
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,440
I was like you know I'm gonna do the dishes tomorrow I'll pick the fly out of

921
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,400
that thing later but this fucking fly had so much fucking gumption and gusto that

922
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,280
he I found him today next to my TV he crawled all the way out of the sink what

923
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,280
if that's a different fly I was gonna say the same thing unmistakably large fly

924
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,640
yeah Caleb small enough he could see the flies haircut he could tell the

925
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:17,880
difference are you fucking serious right now keep it going me being really really

926
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,720
little all right I'm not little dude I don't fight dust bunnies it's not true

927
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,200
you don't you ride them

928
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:35,600
your oscillating fan is blowing them across the room and you go and you tie a

929
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,320
piece of floss to them and you get dragged behind. If you even insinuate for a second

930
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,600
that I have to jump on a light switch with my entire weight of my body to make

931
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,280
it go on or off. No of course not you could never reach to the light switch.

932
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,800
What if I had a bunch of dental floss that I climbed up like a cable? Did you

933
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,640
even fucking consider that dude? No. And no I don't use a post-it note as a

934
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,840
paraglider. What is wrong with you people dude? I'm fucking done talking about this shit

935
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:10,680
dude any good comments on fried legs frogs legs legs top one here is frogs are

936
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,440
natural for me but try to eat it it's tasty if you are an adult you surely get

937
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,040
beat by a kid because my cousins only eight and nine but they already eat

938
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,800
frogs oh and my first time eating this is what I am 11 years old

939
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,800
If you are an adult, you're gonna be beat by a kid.

940
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,800
You'll surely get beat by a kid.

941
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,800
So stupid.

942
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,800
There's a comment here also that says, "This is actually considered a delicacy in some countries."

943
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Which I like that they went to that much effort just to not to write France.

944
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,800
They just didn't want that dirty name.

945
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Yeah, they didn't want to pay it the respect of naming it.

946
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Good for them.

947
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,320
number six is sure strumming

948
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,520
of the sort of running fish that is the uh... yes it is a

949
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,240
sounds canadian back

950
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,040
is this a yet this is a look at everybody everybody is getting the eat some

951
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,840
fucking food is gotten all with a slash through it and we're like white slurry

952
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,900
it's the uh... but the every will not be held

953
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,800
the reason i do that they are from the you know

954
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,720
the first i would bet it's getting a view of food he wandered into like a uh...

955
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,160
toxic waste dumping ground and he saw the big the big circle with the line through

956
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,760
it like do not go here and he was like oh this must be food and that's why that

957
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,960
owes everything now.

958
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,840
Yeah that's uh what is this exactly? It's like rotting fish. Yeah in a can.

959
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,920
Rotting fish? I remember there was a there was a point where like a bunch of

960
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,920
people on YouTube would like like be like I tried to eat this and it would just be

961
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,640
them opening the can and then immediately vomiting because of how it

962
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,040
smelled or something like that.

963
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,080
Lightly salted fermented Baltic sea herring traditional.

964
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,320
Yeah.

965
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,800
Swedish.

966
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,880
Of course it's Swedish.

967
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,200
Fuck.

968
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,680
They love that kind of disgusting shit.

969
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,960
And then they, they eat a disgusting can of fish and then they go on vacation for

970
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,480
four months.

971
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,800
It's like, yeah, I have to go swimming for four months.

972
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,800
I guess I would want to vacation every, you know, every month of work.

973
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,320
If I had to eat that shit all the time.

974
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,360
I mean, it's super sick.

975
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,200
If like, that's all you had to do to like get out of work for that long.

976
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,680
Yeah.

977
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You eat that shit.

978
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,800
You eat a box of scallops and some fried chicken for two days.

979
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,200
You eat surstromming, you get so sick, you get like, it opens up your third eye and you

980
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
invent like Legos.

981
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
Like, that's like.

982
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
Yeah, exactly.

983
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
That's how it works over there.

984
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
Yeah.

985
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
I guess you're right.

986
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,200
Yeah.

987
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,200
It's the fumes.

988
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:44,120
You eat like a can of like gross fish and then you elect a bisexual as president of your country.

989
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,600
That's how much your third eye gets opened.

990
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
Yeah.

991
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:53,600
Or it drives you so insane that you kill somebody and then go to prison for 30 days.

992
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,600
In what perfect country, dude?

993
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Yeah, you knock someone's head off with a flail.

994
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
"Um, 30 days?"

995
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,600
"Probably about 30."

996
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,600
"I have to go to defensive driving class."

997
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
"Probably around 30 days."

998
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,600
"Wiz Game Cube!"

999
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Oh, yeah, you have Luigi's Mansion, yeah, we give you...

1000
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
We give you much!

1001
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,600
We give you much!

1002
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,600
We give you much!

1003
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,600
You get 30 hours of community service of cleaning up Luigi's Mansion.

1004
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Yeah, what a perfect country, dude.

1005
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Yeah, they got it all figured out there.

1006
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Number 7's hard-boiled eggs.

1007
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Dude, I ate fucking tons of these today.

1008
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
I'm not a big fan of hard-boiled eggs.

1009
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,600
hard boiled eggs.

1010
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,480
Are you serious right now?

1011
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,920
That's like, I'm not, I try not to be a super opinionated food guy because I think that shit's

1012
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,440
annoying but that's like the one food I just can't, like super hard boiled eggs, it just

1013
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,760
tastes like fireworks to me.

1014
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,760
It's like sulfur.

1015
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,760
Fireworks?

1016
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,440
No, I'm with CJ on this.

1017
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,640
I think a hard boiled egg on its own.

1018
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,200
People usually act like I'm crazy when I say that.

1019
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,200
You are crazy.

1020
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
See, see, see?

1021
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,480
You better get used to making hard boiled eggs but I'll tell you that much.

1022
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:13,760
It is nice that it's like a food that just smells horrible.

1023
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,000
Just a terrible, terrible smelling food.

1024
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,320
It's just nice to have a food that smells like that.

1025
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,820
Because most foods just, you know, they don't smell like that bad.

1026
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,160
It's one of those foods that people for some reason when they make it, like all food safety

1027
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,280
ideas they would have with anything else just go out of the window.

1028
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,440
Where someone will keep a hard boiled egg in a bag for four days in a backpack and then

1029
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,580
you'll be like, "Oh, it's fucking fine, dude.

1030
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,500
"I'll eat this right now."

1031
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,200
- There was a restaurant I worked at

1032
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,600
that had a hard-boiled egg and eggplant sandwich,

1033
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,080
and I thought that was one of the grossest

1034
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,200
combinations of foods.

1035
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,880
- That's fucking disgusting.

1036
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,720
That's so gross.

1037
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,640
- Yeah, eggplant sucks.

1038
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,520
I hate eggplant.

1039
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,240
I hate hard-boiled eggs.

1040
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,600
- I like them. - Put it together.

1041
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,440
Nah.

1042
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,520
- I just find it hard to believe that

1043
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,120
this is the one animal product

1044
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,800
that doesn't get improved when you boil it.

1045
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,880
It's crazy.

1046
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,800
Everything else is like, you boil a steak

1047
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,020
and it comes out so good.

1048
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,020
Yeah, perfect.

1049
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,020
Boiled steak, boiled.

1050
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,020
It doesn't have all that annoying crust it gets in your guts and shit.

1051
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,020
Yeah, oh man.

1052
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,020
What if I hurt myself?

1053
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,620
And then all the blood from the steak goes into the water.

1054
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,620
Keep that, you gotta fucking eat it raw.

1055
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,860
Makes a nice gray foam on the top of the pot.

1056
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,580
That's basically beer.

1057
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,580
Yeah.

1058
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,580
True.

1059
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,700
Number eight is casu marzu.

1060
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,620
That looks like a fucking bread bowl.

1061
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,620
Yeah, that's cheese.

1062
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,620
I don't know what this is.

1063
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,500
It translates to rotten cheese.

1064
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,500
It's even illegal.

1065
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
Italian friend ate this and he said it was disgusting.

1066
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
That's the top comment.

1067
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
You know, we all got that one Italian friend who eats...

1068
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
He's always eating rotten cheese.

1069
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Of course, like,

1070
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Italians got so addicted

1071
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,500
to such a, like, disgusting food

1072
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
they had to make it illegal.

1073
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Like, this is a threat.

1074
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
It contains live maggots.

1075
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Oh. Oh, wait, I've seen

1076
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
this shit! Yeah.

1077
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
This was on the Andrew Zimmer

1078
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
show.

1079
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
He ate that shit.

1080
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,500
It is freaking infected in maggots. What the heck Italy?

1081
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,500
He said it looked pretty good actually and it tasted alright too.

1082
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Hey Italy, you gotta knock it off with the maggot food and you gotta knock it off with converting to fascism alright?

1083
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
The more of that shit. Knock it off.

1084
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
I think this might be why.

1085
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Yeah they eat so much bad cheese they're like, "Hmm what if we gave like a weird bald guy power?"

1086
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,500
What do the maggots do for the cheese dude?

1087
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:33,860
dude they eat the cheese it's like a scope it's a scope just it's like a scope

1088
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:39,440
it's like a you know like you know the kombucha you know it's you know like

1089
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,140
when you go to like you go out and the hibachi chef does some crazy shit with

1090
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,660
your food that's basically what the maggots are doing yeah they're doing like

1091
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:52,340
they're just like playing around in there doing flips and stuff to you

1092
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,980
cashew Martz who is considered by Sardinian aficionados to be unsafe to

1093
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,980
eat when the maggots and the cheese have died.

1094
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,740
It's only when they're alive.

1095
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,900
What the fuck dude?

1096
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,420
I'm looking at pictures of it, there's maggots like straight up in it.

1097
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,100
Dude this is fucked.

1098
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,860
Yeah, I feel like this is one of the few where it's just right on the money.

1099
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,900
I mean, I can see that hard boiled eggs it's like, well it's just not for me, but this

1100
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:26,220
is, apparently this is for, it's not for me and it's not for anybody who lives in Italy.

1101
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:44,140
by

1102
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,660
a whole wheel of cheese and just be like, "Yeah, I have to leave this in your car for like three

1103
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,660
weeks."

1104
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,700
Yeah, nice try, but I don't have a car, so that's not going to work.

1105
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,700
Okay.

1106
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,500
Well, maybe you can spring for a slave car, right?

1107
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Yeah.

1108
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
Okay, yeah, fine.

1109
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,300
It's a sidecar and a lime scooter.

1110
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,980
Yeah.

1111
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,980
Yeah.

1112
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:09,660
Number nine, this made me laugh when I found this list, number nine is just salmon.

1113
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,920
(laughter)

1114
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,460
- Which is very funny after all those.

1115
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,140
- Yeah, salmon.

1116
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,300
- You know, salmon's all right.

1117
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,380
I like white fish more than salmon, honestly.

1118
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,380
I know that it makes me poor,

1119
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,380
but I like catfish and tilapia and shit way more.

1120
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,340
- I do, tilapia was my favorite fish growing up.

1121
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,200
- I ate tilapia almost every day.

1122
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,040
- Yeah, I ate that so much.

1123
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,860
- I adored it.

1124
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:33,700
- It's a lie, you're a liar about that.

1125
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,460
- No, any time I make dinner, I'm making tilapia

1126
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,580
and fucking something that makes my pee stink so bad.

1127
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:44,300
When I was a boy, I'd run home from the wharf and I would say, "Mama, we need tilapia for dinner."

1128
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:57,980
And she said, "No, no, no, we have no money for tilapia. Not yet. Go, sell a goat in town. Buy a pound of tilapia."

1129
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:03,980
But yeah, I'm a big tilapia fan. Salmon is just like, I don't know, it's pink.

1130
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,780
Salmon poached in like a white wine sauce with like lemon and asparagus.

1131
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,780
Oh, white wine.

1132
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,780
Oh, yeah.

1133
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Mmm, okay.

1134
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,780
Damn.

1135
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Alright.

1136
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,780
Yeah.

1137
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,780
Salmon, like, cooked real good and really tasty.

1138
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,780
Could be really good.

1139
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,780
The best salmon in the world would be amazing.

1140
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,700
The best salmon in the world could be amazing if done right.

1141
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,540
I hate that you guys got me there.

1142
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,540
Fuck.

1143
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,740
That would actually be so delicious.

1144
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,860
Human dead body's better than salmon.

1145
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,020
Here's another one.

1146
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,540
Salmon is fabulous and it's good for you too.

1147
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,440
Oh, this is the worst fish.

1148
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,440
It is so weird and smelly.

1149
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,760
Gross, I prefer cod.

1150
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,600
Hey, we're not talking about video games here, bud.

1151
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,680
Come on now.

1152
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
So gooey.

1153
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,680
Gooey?

1154
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,680
What?

1155
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,680
Gooey?

1156
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,680
Gooey salmon?

1157
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,680
Yeah.

1158
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,800
I think you need to send that back, dude.

1159
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:00,040
I think my favorite one on here is "I love salmon, S-A-M-O-N, take it off by Elmo World

1160
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:15,840
rocks. That is good. Number 10 is century eggs. There's only one comment on it. What the fuck

1161
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,960
is that? Century eggs are fucked up. It's an egg that's cooked for one century. That's

1162
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:29,160
not true. It's not good. Century eggs, there's one comment here from the Bruh Boy 0098. It

1163
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,680
and says, "Is this a insult to China?

1164
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,080
I have porridge with this egg

1165
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,820
and there's nothing wrong with it."

1166
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,120
So I guess, I guess you put it in porridge.

1167
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,260
- I can't figure out what the century egg is,

1168
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,620
but it says that when they're making it,

1169
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,880
they have to wear gloves to protect against chemical burns.

1170
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,640
- But you know what?

1171
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,400
Let's put it in my mouth right now.

1172
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,160
- Yeah, I think that this is kind of like,

1173
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,480
if you don't like hard boiled eggs, try the century egg.

1174
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,160
maybe that'll do it for you.

1175
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,440
- This might be the one.

1176
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,760
- Yeah, this might be the thing that,

1177
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,160
like maybe the problem that Patrick and I have

1178
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,000
is that it hasn't been fucked up enough

1179
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,600
to the point where it's black and gray.

1180
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,760
- I want it to kill me.

1181
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,520
Look, I eat scallops, I have to pack the freezer.

1182
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,480
I'll fucking, I'll eat anything that kills me once.

1183
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,960
- It's like when you have a gray steak, you know,

1184
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,840
it's like not raw, but it's not cooked enough.

1185
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,680
Like you just haven't taken it far enough.

1186
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,240
- You just gotta take it to the limit, dude.

1187
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,480
- Yeah, take it to the limit.

1188
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,280
- A century egg looks crazy.

1189
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,760
Like it looks like where they find the DNA.

1190
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,920
like a DNA in Jurassic Park. Yeah it's like it does look like it's suspended in

1191
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,200
amber. Yeah it's like it's like a mystical gem. Hey can you give me can you

1192
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,880
give me some shit that like the big white buff guy from Prometheus would eat

1193
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,920
and then fall into a river after?

1194
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,840
Just give me that yeah whatever it is. Even the name Century Egg that is that's a Ridley Scott

1195
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:54,840
name right there yeah. Honestly dude I'd eat this shit. Yeah you would?

1196
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:01,840
I like old stuff. I like old shit. I like old shit with chemicals in it.

1197
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,840
Caleb and I are gonna go find a place that has century eggs. I'm gonna make him watch me eat it.

1198
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,840
I mean I'll say I would probably eat anything on this list. You know if I did if

1199
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,840
You would eat the fucked up cheese?

1200
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,840
I would you know maybe not the fuck that's maybe the only thing.

1201
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
That's a little too far.

1202
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,840
You would eat this before you ate the cheese?

1203
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,840
Yeah it's an egg.

1204
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,120
Dude, I'd eat it. I could fucking pick maggots out of my shit.

1205
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,720
I'm not fucking eating a black egg.

1206
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,560
If you pick out the maggots, it's not the... it's just cheese.

1207
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,320
You don't eat the maggots, do you?

1208
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,520
I don't think so.

1209
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,000
You could, maybe they taste good.

1210
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,520
I think you eat the maggots.

1211
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,280
It's like a miscall worm.

1212
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,760
Maggots kind of get in everything.

1213
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,000
It's not like, "Oh, we'll just scrape this layer off."

1214
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,240
They're like, they've already done their shit.

1215
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,640
They're like, I don't know.

1216
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,520
I could be wrong.

1217
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,440
Me, dude, give me some fucking chopsticks in 30 seconds.

1218
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,440
These maggots are gonna...

1219
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,800
You'll have cheese and maggots.

1220
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,940
Those will be the two things that we have.

1221
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,780
Yeah.

1222
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,480
Number, oh no, this is a newcomer.

1223
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,300
Yeah, the new, this is an insult to my culture.

1224
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,080
This is good that this is not actually on the list.

1225
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,640
Shepherd's pie, what a beautiful dish, dude.

1226
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,480
Oh man, shepherd's pie.

1227
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,320
What the fuck?

1228
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,360
Fucking so gorgeous.

1229
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,280
So good.

1230
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,080
That's probably like top 10 food for me.

1231
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:08,920
I fucking love shepherd's pie.

1232
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,080
Okay, all right, but he said like,

1233
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,000
I just had this and I liked it at first bite,

1234
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,880
but then I took a big bite and it had this weird,

1235
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,480
gooey, unsatisfying texture.

1236
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,960
This is, this man has never had mashed potatoes before.

1237
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,220
(laughter)

1238
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,780
- You said there was gonna be potatoes in this,

1239
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,620
I thought it was gonna be like raw.

1240
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,380
- There's some fucking creamy, salty, buttery bullshit

1241
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,240
in this dude, this sucks.

1242
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,160
- This brown shit and orange shit, so weird.

1243
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,680
- Well actually, number 14 is mashed potatoes.

1244
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,920
(laughter)

1245
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,760
- Come on man.

1246
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,080
- There's two comments that says, "Why are these here?"

1247
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,460
and the other one says, "It tastes like crap, that's why."

1248
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,120
- I also, I wanna just jump around here

1249
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,920
so we get to some of the good ones. Number 12 is mayonnaise, which the comments on

1250
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,540
here, the top comment is, "Every single time I eat this, I get sick. When I refuse to

1251
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,960
eat a sandwich with mayo on it, my friend forced me to eat it. I ended up throwing

1252
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:07,360
it away. Bleh." Which is it? Did your friend, were you forced to eat it or did you throw it away?

1253
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:14,040
Exactly. This is a liar here. There's also a comment here that says, "Tastes bad when

1254
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,040
mixed with cheese in a sandwich and grilled together.

1255
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Oh, I hate it. I hate that.

1256
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,040
Oh, when you put mayonnaise on the outside of the bread and you

1257
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,040
fucking fry it. It tastes horrible in a sandwich with lettuce and bacon and tomato.

1258
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,040
Oh my god. I will say a lot of people from the south don't like mayonnaise

1259
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,040
because they grew up eating something called mayonnaise sandwiches, which is just

1260
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,040
mayonnaise and like white bread. And it just made me, I'm a fucking freak

1261
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,620
for mayonnaise. I'll do anything for it. I love mayo.

1262
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:47,580
It's very, it's mayonnaise is great, but yeah, it is very, it's easy to understand

1263
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,660
why someone would be grossed out by it, I think.

1264
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,500
I think like oil. I mean, yeah.

1265
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,140
I was going to say, I think like people get grossed out by it because they don't know

1266
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,860
actually like, it's like three things you can just make like immediately.

1267
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,540
Yeah. Well, I think it's just like the experience

1268
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:07,820
of like, like putting it, like dipping a knife into like a Hellman's jar. Like it's just

1269
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,580
a gross looking thing, you know?

1270
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,860
People see it and they're like,

1271
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,220
"Oh, this doesn't taste like pudding like it look like."

1272
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,740
(laughing)

1273
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,580
They get mad.

1274
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,260
- I'll concede this, mayonnaise should be vanilla.

1275
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,220
Just based on how it looks.

1276
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,740
There should be a vanilla flavor, but there is not.

1277
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,260
15 anchovies, I don't fuck with anchovies, man.

1278
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,180
- Never really, I don't think I've really had 'em.

1279
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,020
- Really?

1280
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,660
You're not, don't fuck with anchovies.

1281
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,500
- That's just, I don't, they smell funny.

1282
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,500
- I mean, I don't eat 'em like out of the tin or whatever.

1283
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,540
They fucking rock to add to shit.

1284
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,660
I just said I don't.

1285
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,660
You'd love him out of the ten, dude.

1286
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,660
If I'm gonna be enslaved by you, you have to listen to me.

1287
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,660
There has to be a two-way, there has to be a dialogue.

1288
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,660
Yeah, there has to be good communication there.

1289
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,660
The only time you're gonna listen to me is when you make something really good

1290
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,660
and I say, "Mm, my compliments to the slave."

1291
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,660
[laughter]

1292
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,660
That. That'll be it, dude.

1293
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:59,660
Number 29's chicken liver. Here's the top comment.

1294
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,660
"I tasted a little piece of liver one day.

1295
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,660
It had a rubbery, powdery, grainy texture

1296
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,660
and a bloody, metallic, heavy aftertaste.

1297
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:10,340
taste I felt sleepy in an instant that I needed mom and dad to massage me and I

1298
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:14,460
ate everything else on my plate afterward it felt like snow white biting into that

1299
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,660
poisoned apple and it smells like the vapor of blood and pee. This sounds like

1300
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:27,620
those guys that like post about colognes and shit. Jeremy Fragrance? I had to get

1301
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:39,020
massaged by mom and dad is Vegemite in breaks and break comments do not insult

1302
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:50,020
the heaven of a Aussie. I don't like that shit dude. Vegemite and Marmite.

1303
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:54,060
Vegemite's fucked up. It's crazy to me that your like whole like cultural identity

1304
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:58,660
revolves around around this thing that like looks like just shit on toilet

1305
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:09,480
paper when you do not fucking talk about that is heaven for a Aussie yeah turtle

1306
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,780
soup that sounds fine jelly deals mmm jelly that's just a British thing

1307
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,740
grits do grits feel like the most fucking incredible thing in the world

1308
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,740
You're from the south, you can't...

1309
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,740
Dude, it's amazing.

1310
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,740
We got charred meat.

1311
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,740
I put, dude...

1312
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:27,740
I worked at a cracker barrel. I can't eat grits ever.

1313
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,740
I'll make you some damn grits.

1314
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:34,740
I fuckin', I saw, I had to scoop ketchup and grits out of bowls and throw them into a trash can.

1315
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,740
I can never eat that shit.

1316
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,740
That ain't my problem.

1317
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,740
It's a meat, yeah, it's a meat problem, just sayin'.

1318
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,740
Bread, pepperoni, pickles...

1319
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,740
Cow brain...

1320
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,740
Barbecue sauce...

1321
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:45,740
And then bacon.

1322
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:46,740
What?

1323
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:52,740
Cheeseburgers. Number 108 cheeseburgers.

1324
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,740
Oh, fuck that shit.

1325
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,740
Oh, fucking cheeseburgers, dude.

1326
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,740
That shit is disgusting.

1327
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:03,740
Um, caviar. I had caviar for like the first time recently. It was terrible.

1328
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,740
Oh, yeah, me too.

1329
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,740
It was fucking awful.

1330
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,740
Well, it was probably because it was warm.

1331
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,740
I mean, I don't...

1332
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,740
Was it warm?

1333
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,740
We were eating it at a public park.

1334

01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,140
This is from Japan. Japan is a really cool place.

1345
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,140
Except for this food.

1346
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,140
That's just sad.

01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,140

1348
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,140

01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,140
The last one is "fuh".

1350
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,140

01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,140
"What is dat garbage?"

Thank you so much CJ.

1354
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,580
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

1355
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,580
Where should people find you?

1356
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,580
What's the deal?

1357
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,980
Where should people look for you?

1358
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:18,980
Plug your shit.

1359
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:25,260
Oh yeah, hey, if you want to watch three men in their 30s watch reality TV shows, men for

1360
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:31,860
women in their late teens and 20s, then feel free to go to Eat Chain, twitch.tv/eatchain

1361
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,860
and you can watch.

1362
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,860
We love Eat Chain.

1363
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,860
Oh man.

1364
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:35,860
Oh yeah, we've got to have you guys on.

1365
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,860
90 day streams.

1366
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:41,420
Oh yeah, I'd love to come back on. I can't find the good episodes. No, you know what it is,

1367
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,180
is the first time I ever watched it, I watched it with you and then I tried to watch it alone

1368
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:50,940
and it wasn't the same. It's really bad. Yeah, I haven't watched it since we all watched it

1369
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:56,300
together. Yeah, it's fucked up. We're watching that one where it's about those two blonde,

1370
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:00,780
those pumpkin-headed twins, Darcy and Stacy, but it's a whole show about them. So normally they're

1371
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:06,700
only on there for like eight minutes, but now it's a whole 40-minute episode and it's so fucking

1372
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:11,980
and bad. It's the worst shit in the world. I hate it. I'm not gonna make you guys do it.

1373
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:17,020
No, it sounded like, "Oh, this can't be that bad." And it's so horrible. It's like I regret

1374
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:22,340
doing it. Damn. I think all reality TV is good. Yeah. It's beautiful. Yeah, normally

1375
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:28,940
they're really entertaining and cool and well produced. This one's bad. All right, so I-Chen,

1376
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,940
check it out. Bye, everybody. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
