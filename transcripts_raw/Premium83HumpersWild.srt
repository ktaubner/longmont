[Distorted sound]

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,300
Okay, so what were you saying before?

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,000
Pat doesn't like diners because, this is what he said,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,300
he can make the food at home.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
[Laughter]

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,600
That's why he doesn't like them.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
I don't like diners where it's clear.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,200
You can make any food at home, Pat.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,000
You can't.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,960
You go to a restaurant so you don't have to make any food.

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,240
You are waiting on it.

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,000
I got chicken and waffles and the wings were frozen.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,400
Patrick, how many days a week do you buy a sandwich?

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,240
Probably every other day.

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,440
I mean, there you go.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,440
That just proves that your opinion is completely...

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,560
It's different.

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,840
It's completely different.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,440
Why is that different?

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,640
Also, if you go to the diner...

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,720
A sandwich is literally the easiest food to make in the world.

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,720
That's the first thing you teach a child how to make.

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,400
Not true.

28
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,400
First thing you teach a child how to make is a birthday cake.

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,400
You don't teach a kid how to make a birthday cake.

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Birthday cake is a multi-step process.

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
You let your child put the frosting on and you let them lick the spoon.

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
That's not making a birthday cake.

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
That's part of the process.

34
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
That's frosting something.

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Speaking of, did I ever tell you guys about...

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
He does not want to talk about the diner opinion.

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
He's embarrassed.

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
You're scared of what's going to come out.

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,900
- Someone's gonna get mad at me for that opinion.

40
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,520
It's gonna be annoying.

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,960
- An old Greek lady is gonna get so mad at you

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,800
about the diners.

43
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
- There's some diners where it's like,

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,640
if they have a special menu item,

45
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,600
it's like you gotta go to this diner to get this thing.

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,480
- Diners have 200 things on the menu.

47
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
You need to be discerning about what you order.

48
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,200
You can't go into a diner and order spaghetti

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,620
or chicken and waffles.

50
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,080
Get a fucking Reuben.

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,980
- The waffle was good, but the wings weren't good.

52
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,700
get a Reuben or get a BLT.

53
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,540
- Yeah.

54
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,360
- That's what you get at a diner,

55
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,900
and you get fries, and it's six bucks.

56
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,900
That is why you go to a diner.

57
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,140
You don't get a fucking

58
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,540
gazpacho at a diner.

59
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,580
- Why not?

60
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,420
- 'Cause it's gonna be hot.

61
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,660
- Yeah, that's true.

62
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,300
I don't know, I think a lot of

63
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,780
diners need to step their game up.

64
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,620
- Yeah.

65
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,460
- Yeah.

66
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,940
- Talking big shit on diners, man.

67
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,380
My mom worked at a diner for like most of my middle school.

68
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,620
My dad was in the military.

69
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
Fuck you dude.

70
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
My dad wasn't in the military.

71
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,340
You're talking like you was.

72
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,340
No.

73
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,740
About these damn diners you fucking pussy.

74
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,220
My dad works at...

75
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,900
Just say the whole name.

76
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,260
I've definitely said my mom's place of employment on this show and that is a huge...

77
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,980
Probably when we had like zero listeners.

78
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,780
I was just like, like when it was just a conversation between us and we recorded it.

79
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,860
She works at a jail pressing license plates.

80
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,580
Yeah, my mom's a jailbird, my dad is the warden.

81
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,580
And I was...

82
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,580
It's a beautiful romance.

83
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,580
Oh, it's so gorgeous, dude.

84
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Oh, yeah.

85
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,700
Did I ever tell you about our first date?

86
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,100
I probably shouldn't.

87
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,140
It's like every, every like romance novel before like Twilight existed was something like that.

88
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
Yeah.

89
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:21,780
every like romance novel from like the 30s. The Warden's Mistress. Yeah, or like this guy and his slave fell in so much love.

90
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,760
I found a, I found like old, I went to like an antique store with my mom when I was in New Hampshire last week,

91
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,220
and I found, my dad actually found it. My dad showed me it. We found like old

92
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,340
erotic novels there, and one of them was called Humpers Wild.

93
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,940
Is that the author's name or is that the no no that was the title of the book it was called humpers wild

94
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,500
It was a big yellow

95
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,540
Book did you literally figure out what did you read it?

96
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,300
Did you my dad started my dad started reading it to me in the middle of the store is pretty fun

97
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,060
You're here it is. Yeah, they got it on Amazon. You can order. It's currently unavailable

98
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,140
Picture for it either damn. It was published in 1968. Yeah, I should have picked up

99
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:11,060
Dyke yeah, my favorite thing is like look going to like an antique store, and they'll have like a porno mag section

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,820
and you look through them and it's like,

101
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,820
like they were showing like butthole in the 70s,

102
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,940
you know, in print.

103
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,980
They don't have the guts to do that anymore, dude.

104
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,100
- They do, they still do that.

105
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,420
- No, they don't do that shit, no.

106
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,320
- They do it on the computer.

107
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,540
- Yeah, not in print though.

108
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,820
Print is beautiful, beautiful,

109
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Maxim, gorgeous, gorgeous Maxim bikini model.

110
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,380
You can't see a butthole for 90 cents anymore.

111
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,060
- That's so funny, I mean, it's so funny,

112
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,740
Maxim magazine was like such a middle school thing,

113
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,660
like, "Yo, my brother got Maxim."

114
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,100
You know, like something like that.

115
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,020
I remember when I was like nine years old,

116
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,180
my uncle Kevin was like, we had like this pool,

117
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,500
like this public pool in our condo complex,

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,060
and my uncle Kevin was down there reading Maxim's

119
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,140
and he was showing my brother and my cousin Brian,

120
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,600
but he wouldn't let me look at them

121
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,780
'cause he thought I would snitch to my mom.

122
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,660
It's just like, looking back at that,

123
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,820
it's so funny 'cause it's just like,

124
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,140
wait, it's fucking Maxim.

125
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,740
There's like articles about like,

126
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,460

127
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,980

What's the best legs to guard?

129
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,420
- There was a friend of mine in middle school,

130
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,740
his dad collected Sports Illustrated.

131
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,840
Of course he had the swimsuit edition,

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,540
but he hid the swimsuit edition from my friend.

133
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,100
So my friend collected, he stole all the body issues

134
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,680
from his dad, which are the ones that are focused

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,820
on athletes' bodies, and he's like,

136
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,640
"This is the hottest shit ever."

137
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,480
And he showed it to me, but it's all--

138
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,740
- Like half of it's guys, yeah.

139
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,640

But is it written by Cyril van Dyke?

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,780
Yeah

147
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,200

148
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Hear it. Yeah

149
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:30,880
This is how the book opens Bob's success with Josie had rekindled his tired flame for hump activities

150
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,480
His taste of fucking with someone other than his wife had opened new fields of development to him

151
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,560
Given him a new outlook a new awareness and a new interest in physical charms of female bodies

152
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,800
He now found himself turning to let his eyes follow the progress of slender legs his hands sweating slightly

153
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,500
When firmly rounded breasts were near and his mind was wandering into daydreams when he caught a whiff of perfume or saw a nicely molded

154
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,320
Pair of ass cheeks. Oh my god, dude. What?

155
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,180
Yeah, people use words his hands sweating slightly when firmly

156
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,840
breasts or near

157
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,480
Erotica is the the grossest shit of all time. It's horrible like it's definitely a visual medium

158
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,760
Like I don't think like being it being really good at describing sex. It's just disgusting

159
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,120
I need to get off the top

160
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,880
They have a sidebar on this website for the bestsellers the top bestseller is a book called sex secrets of a children's doctor

161
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:43,320
what yeah I feel like I like them like I would never think to add all these

162
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:50,760
adjectives to describing sex right you know my shit would be like yay a fucked

163
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:59,720
her butt. It was crazy. There's multiple chapters where it's like big buildup and then it's like

164
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,680
a huge buildup like they went upstairs blah blah blah and then he fucked her butt. Chapter two.

165
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:13,240
The mailman's devilish grin was so enticing to Samantha so she invited him in

166
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,120
and then he fucked her butt. You know what? You know what? We should actually

167
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,280
totally right. We should do one like just like the whole pay every chapter is just

168
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,760
build up and then it just ends the same and then he fucked her butt.

169
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:39,240
Yeah and then he fucked her damn butt. It's called back towards secret.

170
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,200

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,040
mailman it's like a delivery driver like okay I don't like it like ice cream man

184

00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,900
Oh, yeah, they don't have sex they just great. Yeah. Yeah. Oh wait. Yeah, we can make Mormon erotic novels

191
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,960
No

192
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,020
Cuz I don't want to do anything for them. No, I don't they don't they don't need our help, dude

193
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,480
They have a pretty good thing going on. I don't have have you seen the Mormon

194
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,120
It's like the BYU sketch troupe and they have like money as they have they have like an SNL style show that they film it

195
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,280
like I think it's BYU, but it's like a Mormon like SNL and

196
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,720
and I only saw one thing from it,

197
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,320
'cause it was called,

198
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,280
like it showed up in my YouTube recommended,

199
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,080
and it was a white guy with like a sideways baseball cap,

200
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,920
and it said, "Urban Spelling Bee."

201
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,160
(laughing)

202
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,840
- It's just exactly like the Derek comedy sketch.

203
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,560
- Yeah, it's the same thing.

204
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,720
Well, that's what I'm thinking.

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,200
Maybe they saw that and they were like,

206
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
"Okay, I feel bad for laughing at this.

207
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Maybe there's a way we could feel good

208
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,420
I'm seriously going to heck for this one for laughing at this crap. Well Mormons love racism. Yeah, that's a good

209
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,640
Yeah, they didn't let black people into the church. They had there's a thing in their book

210
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:48,680
I think that says that black people are were reincarnated after being bad. Yeah, I've we talked about Mormons on here already

211
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,740
I think we probably yeah, cuz I think there was there's like Mormon

212
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,280
fucking

213
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:01,580
Like like there was a video I saw of like a Mormon like PSA thing where it was like a video like an old like slide

214
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,560
Projector thing and then like a white or black person turns white

215
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:16,240
Yeah, oh fuck just getting baptized and coming up white

216
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,140
Do you know we fucking totally talked about this but there's like

217
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,540
the more... ah fuck I don't want to just like talk about this if we've already

218
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,500
talked about it but like Mormons like baptize like people living people now

219
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,620
for like people who weren't able to be baptized for the church. Oh yeah I've heard about that.

220
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,540
Yeah and they got in trouble because they like baptized somebody for Anne

221
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:47,700
Frank. It's insane. Just baptizing you against your will. I like the idea that Anne Frank was like in

222
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,700
heaven and then they baptized you and you go straight to hell.

223
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,700
What am I doing on this planet?

224
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Where the fuck am I dude?

225
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,700
I'm on fucking mercury.

226
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,340
If you think about it dude, I mean you can sin as much as you want if you just say the

227
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,180
sin is for somebody that's already dead.

228
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
I mean.

229
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Yeah that's true.

230
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,340
You know, you stay pure, you drag them down to hell and then when you die you're still

231
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,300
pure you go to heaven, all the people you wronged are in hell so you don't even have

232
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,980
to like see them, they won't be mad at you or anything.

233
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
It's true.

234
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,300
go to heaven so bad. Yeah, well that's the thing. It's probably fun as hell up there. The thing about

235
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,860
like you know repenting for your sins, becoming born again, if you go to heaven

236
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,320
and like somebody died before you that you just like fucked over really bad

237
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,500
don't you think they'd be pissed off that you were there? You know? Yeah.

238
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,020
You're like, "Oh, they let this fucker in? That guy owes me like $600!" I think pissed

239
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,180
off is probably not many people in heaven are getting pissed off. Yeah.

240
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,180
Yeah, you're getting that fucking double blowjob.

241
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,180
But what if you see, you get into heaven, you get into heaven you see somebody you just fucking hate.

242
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
Just somebody you just like, you can't hang with.

243
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
I mean that's not really heaven then is it?

244
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
Yeah, true.

245
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
I think you're describing just a different thing.

246
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Well, they get into heaven too, cause they fucking, I mean you follow, you follow Christ's word your whole life.

247
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,180
I think you need to read the bible buddy.

248
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,180
Yeah, I think you're doing the thing where people are like, oh you know, dog heaven is cat hell, you know that type of thing.

249
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
I mean it's, I think it's.

250
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
I'm not doing that.

251
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,900
I'm trying to use science to explain away the love of Christ.

252
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Yeah, something that's more about blessings and grace.

253
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,460
I don't much care for that.

254
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,620
Yeah, I prefer we kind of take it at the Lord's word.

255
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,740
Yeah, like I'm gonna take it at face value because I know that it came from above.

256
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Mm-hmm.

257
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,740
Yeah.

258
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
It came from my favorite book, so.

259
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,740
Yeah.

260
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,740
My favorite book is the Bible.

261
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
Don't get me wrong, I love the Bible.

262
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,980
I mean, I don't go in for all that Christianity crap, but the Bible's a great read.

263
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,980
I will say, people do say that like, anytime like Penn Jillette is interviewed and somebody's

264
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,240
like so what's your favorite book he'll be like the Bible the Bible a favorite

265
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,760
book the atheists love to say that they're like it's actually a fascinating

266
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,880

270
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,920
the Piper. What Piper? You still haven't read the Bible. There's no Piper in the Bible.

271
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,020
I thought there was a Pied Piper. There's no Pied Piper. Yeah I thought he's one of like the bad

272
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,400
guys in the in the Bible. Literally, here's how you get into heaven. You can do anything you want. You can

273
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,400
fucking murder, you can have sex with your dog, but at the end you just have to be like "I'm sorry"

274
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,920
and you get to go into heaven and it's the easiest thing in the world. Yeah. I don't know why nobody

275
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,600
would do it you know I don't think hell exists yeah okay want to talk about that

276
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,920
why do you not think hell exists what get into this yeah I'm gonna talk about

277
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,480
about the I think I think hell probably exists so why do you say you thought it

278
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,800
did it cuz that's that's like one of those stupid like you know like like guys

279
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,560
say that like like oh Christ died for my sins so hell doesn't exist or whatever

280
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,160
like that's like a right people's I think the Bible doesn't exist I believe in

281
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,440
heaven and hell and God and all that shit books not real never seen I never

282
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,240
seen one my what I open it up and there's always a gun in there I can't

283
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,800
read it some I think some fucking potheads turn this into a stash book

284
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,360
god yeah I need to find a book that I can do that with yeah I need to do that

285
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,520
shit do you should make a stash book out of if you give a mouse a cookie yeah and

286
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,400
you can that'd be so small well I could I could only hide like a little crumbs in

287
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,560
there that you like to carry around over your head that's a very good point I

288
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,320
could keep my crumbs or a tortilla maybe yeah just keep one tortilla I found this

289
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,880
on the side of the road what is it give it to you to make a stash book I think it

290
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,000
it might be a little bit too thin.

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Woodworking school.

292
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,200
- You know, I was thinking of making a stash book

293
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,080
out of this, I think this could work pretty well.

294
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,840
- I mean, I have an, oh, that'd be pretty good.

295
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,320
- I think of Altoids, I think, yeah, I think I could maybe,

296
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,720
I mean, I could hollow it out, get rid of these in here.

297
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,040
- I don't think I can give this up, I mean, look at this.

298
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,360
- So my dad always had this tin of Altoids

299
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,560
on his like wardrobe when I was growing up,

300
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,320
like on his drawers, and I would always be like,

301
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,280
"Hey, can I have an Altoid?"

302
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,120
And he'd say, "No."

303
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,500
He'd be like, "No, I never touch those.

304
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,680
"Those are mine, don't touch it."

305
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,240
So I got it in my head, I was like,

306
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,780
he has to be hiding something in there, right?

307
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,060
It makes no sense for him to just like,

308
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,440
not let me have these Altoids.

309
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,280
I've never seen him take one out and eat one in front of me.

310
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
Like, there's gotta be something in it.

311
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
So one time when he was at work,

312
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,080
I went into his room and I opened it up

313
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,400
and it was just Altoids.

314
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,000
(laughing)

315
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,080
He's just like being a dick about giving me an Altoid.

316
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,920
(laughing)

317
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
Which made way more sense.

318
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,800
And then under that he had like a drawer full of money.

319
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,040
(laughing)

320
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Yeah, I got fucking owned.

321
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,720
Just let your boy take a damn mint, you fucker.

322
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,440
Got roasted by your dad.

323
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,960
Dude, Altoids are so strong.

324
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,800
I always forget.

325
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,640
They're great.

326
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,760
I take an Altoid whenever I feel nauseous.

327
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,000
I take an Altoid.

328
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,840
I take an Altoid.

329
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,680
It's like medicine for me.

330
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,600
It is a medicinal.

331
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,040
It's that border between medicine and candy.

332
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,760
- Yeah, I would never take one.

333
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
I would just chew, if my breath smells bad

334
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
or my mouth tastes weird, I would just chew gum.

335
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,040
- Or you can brush your teeth, dude.

336
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,120
- They gotta bring back the-- - Yeah, that's true.

337
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,080
Yeah, well, I mean, like if I'm on the go.

338
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,280
- You don't bring a Wisp with you?

339
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,480
- A what? - A Colgate Wisp?

340
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,320
- A Colgate Wisp?

341
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,160
- I don't know what that is. - Yeah, you don't

342
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,980
bring the Wisp?

343
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,360
- It's that little toothbrush with a clip in the middle

344
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,840
that tastes like Listerine.

345
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,640
- I've never, I don't know what that is.

346
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,960
- Oh, you remember, Caleb, I still have those,

347
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,240
the Listerine dissolve tablets.

348
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,560
- Those things are awful, bro.

349
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Yeah, those are the worst.

350
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,040
Yeah, the ones that you take like a tab of acid.

351
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Yeah, those are crazy.

352
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
No, no, not those.

353
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,720
The ones that when we were staying for the live show, I had them because I was like,

354
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,600
"Well, I'm not going to be able to brush my teeth here."

355
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Oh, those things that you chew and then spit out.

356
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,280
Yeah, you chew, you let it pour into mouthwash.

357
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
It just turns into mouthwash.

358
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
It's powdered mouthwash, basically.

359
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,880
And then you have to just rinse it.

360
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
It's horrible.

361
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
It makes no sense.

362
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Oh, yeah.

363
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Those are the worst.

364
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Why not just bring a toothbrush?

365
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
I did.

366
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:34,360
was

367
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,080
And you brought the Listerine mouthwash.

368
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,160
You guys can't fucking question how I operate, alright?

369
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,040
I don't understand it either.

370
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm sorry, buddy.

371
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,920
Those Listerine tabs, though, those things will send you to fucking hell.

372
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Oh yeah.

373
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:58,200
I remember there was a kid in high school who had them and everyone would always ask him

374
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,120
for one, not because they wanted it, but just because, yeah, it hurts.

375
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:09,640
Yeah, it was funny. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no those things will fucking like like have that and then like eat some ice cream

376
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,800
Yeah, that's a

377
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,960
Chocolate chip ice cream. I mean, yeah, I'm a big bowl of ice eat a banana split

378
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,080
I mean, I never been right tried using one of those not eating like a bunch of needles. I mean, that's yeah

379
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,280
It's not gonna feel good. No, no, not at all. Yeah, I kind of want to invest in like some

380
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,440
I haven't been to the dentist in probably like 10 years.

381
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,040
I kind of want to get some like high-end numbing cream and just like have my mouth beaten up

382
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
most of the day.

383
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
And just suck a dick.

384

Yeah, no, I want to get some like Novocaine, some numbing cream and I just want to go to

385
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
town on some random guy.

386
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Just go to town on some random guy.

387
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Maybe go to like a glory hole or something.

388
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,920
It's like it doesn't even happen if I can't feel it in my mouth.

389
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,040
Oh man, I would love to, I mean I would love to just get a dental dam too.

390
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,920
(laughing)

391
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
- That'd be so awesome.

392
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,040
- Just to teach my dentist a thing or two.

393
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,880
- Yeah.

394
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,720
- Teach him a lesson.

395
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,000
- I just think it'd be funny to walk around

396
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,820
with a numb mouth all day. - I just don't want you

397
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,280
in my mouth, pal.

398
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,440
That would be funny, yeah.

399
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,040
- Yeah, I numb my mouth with Novocaine

400
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,320
and suck someone else's dick,

401
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,160
so it feels like someone's sucking mine.

402
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,560
(laughing)

403
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,640
- Yeah, you know if you suck another person's penis,

404
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,840
it feels like your own penis is getting sucked.

405
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,680
- Yeah.

406
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,520
- Pretty awesome.

407
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,340
Kind of a life hack for you.

408
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,180
- Yeah.

409
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,560
You guys wanna suck my dick?

410
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,800
(laughing)

411
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,600
- Nah, dude, I don't like getting my dick sucked.

412
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,040
I don't like having a wet penis.

413
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,680
I like to, I want it as dry as possible.

418
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,840

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,960
- Yeah, I have the two-- - And I let it dry out.

420
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,080
- The two dentist tools where you like squirt water

421
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,160
and then you suck it up so it gets extra dry.

422
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,680
- I think I just wanna become a dentist

423
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,920
'cause I want that too.

424
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,360
I want the big light and I want an x-ray machine.

425
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,200
- I want the big chair.

426
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,000

427
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,800

- Yeah, I mean, you could just buy,

429
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,040

430
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,840
and then just teach yourself on YouTube.

431
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,480
- Okay, so a dentist chair is like $2,000.

432
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,320
- That's not gonna make it.

433
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,160
- That's not bad.

434
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
- Actually, no, that's the most expensive one.

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,120

and it says, "How Dental Saliva Ejectors

457
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
"Put Your Health at Risks."

This is a, this is, this like,

463
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,020
this is a set of dental equipment

00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,660
that comes in like a suitcase,

465
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,680

Like it's like built in. - Whoa.

467
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
- Wait, one second.

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,760
- Dude, we'll never have to go to the dentist again.

00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,440
can bring this wherever you go.

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
- What the fuck?

472
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,720
- Imagine like bringing this on a plane.

473
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,080
Just like carrying that around the airport.

474
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,920
- No, you don't understand, it's a bomb.

475
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,080
No, I mean, don't you get this crap.

476
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
- Listen, this is what it has in it.

477
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Built-in air compressor, saliva ejector,

478
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,640
three-way air water syringe,

479
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,960
high-speed air turbine handpiece tube,

480
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,240
low-speed air turbine handpiece tube,

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,000
a foot pedal, clean water bottle,

482
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,240
syringe bottle, and a waste water bottle.

483
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,200
Dude, it's like you don't even need to go to the dentist.

484
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
This is making me think.

485
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I wouldn't need to go ever again.

486
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,560
Dude, we should buy this.

487
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,240
This is a pink package and I was thinking that the easiest way to sneak a bomb onto a plane

488
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,040
is put it in something pink.

489
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Because no self-respecting man is going to want to touch that little thing.

490
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,840
I don't think you can talk about that.

491
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
I can talk about it.

492
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
I'm not going to.

493
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
I mean, I'm not going to do it.

494
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,400
Because I don't know what bombs are made out of.

495
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Yeah, let's not talk about that.

496
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
What's in bombs?

497
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Is it...

498
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Let's figure this out.

499
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
No.

- There, no.

502
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,380

next live show here's one that looks exactly like a copy right yeah no we

641
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,820

643
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,140

00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,660
I think we should get this and bring this to the next live show and let everyone use it.

646
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:44,020
This is another machine that looks exactly like a copy machine, and it's called the California

00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:49,100
Microneedle Diode Laser Hair Remover Pernanent Hair Reduce Beauty Machine.

I don't need a hair reduction, dude.

649
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,260
For only $15,000.

650
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,460
And imagine if we could sell tickets to a live show and say every ticket comes with free

651
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
laser hair removal.

652
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,460
That's pretty good.

653
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,180
Yeah, and the tickets are a thousand dollars each.

654
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,620
We might actually make a profit.

655
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,540
People might want that.

656
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,340
Do it yourself laser hair removal.

657
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,140
And we could learn how to do it too.

658
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,500
We could also just use the laser for something more nefarious.

659
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,180
Oh wait, check this out.

660
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,340
Oh fuck, we could totally buy this.

662
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,900
If we pool our money together.

663
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
What is it?

664
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:33,220
Hold on, let me do the math here.

665
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Type again.

666
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10.

667
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
10 plus 10 plus 10.

668
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,220
Okay, okay, okay.

669
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

670
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,260
30 dollars, we can afford it.

671
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,980
Okay, would you guys be willing to shell out 466 dollars and 66 cents?

672
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
For what?

673
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
For, you gotta tell me what it is, dude.

674
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,140
- Pick a portable, full digital laptop, ultrasound machine.

675
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,780
- I do not have a baby, so for that reason I'm out.

676
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,620
- Not yet.

677
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,280
Not yet, but now you can check whenever

678
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,120
and we can share this.

679
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,620
- Okay, but here's an ultrasound 4D machine for $25,000.

680
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,460
- 4D?

681
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,280
You can like, does it like shoot?

682
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,120
- Four dimensional.

683
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,500
- It shoots cold air at your feet

684
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,920
in the middle of the ultrasound?

685
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,760
- Yo, yo, wait, wait.

686
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,600
- So do you guys want to,

687
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,400
would you guys be willing to go in for $8,333

688
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,780
instead for the four dimensional one?

689
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,720
- Way less money, way less money,

690
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,720
probably a lot more fun, probably a better investment altogether.

691
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,000
Aquasonic ultrasound gel, 5 liters, 26 bucks.

692
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,880
I want to talk about the 4D ultrasound machine.

693
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,840
Like they show you a picture of the baby and it like, you know, it makes, it squirts red

694
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
juice in your face.

695
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,600
Yeah, the baby sneezes, there's a big comical sneeze, you get hit with it, you know?

696
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Or you hear bats and you get killed on the back of your neck.

697
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,240
It's also 3D, so if the baby reaches, it goes towards your face.

698
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,200
Yeah, that might be the most incredible invention of all time.

699
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
The coolest ultrasound machine.

700
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
All right, wait, hold here.

701
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,960
So, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, I'm going to need you to put on these sunglasses.

702
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,360
Yeah.

703
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,960
And make sure to stay in the seats the entirety of the ultrasound.

704
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,360
Yeah, the person, the receptionist, asking if you want to spend an extra $1,000 to see

705
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,880
your baby's ultrasound in 4D.

706
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,040
Are either of you or do either of you have any allergies, heart conditions, or are you pregnant?

707
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,320
Well, I guess you are pregnant. Okay, can't be a part of this ride.

708
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,560
Yeah, they put amps under your seat so when the baby like, like it goes like,

709
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,160
oh, it like shakes your seat.

710
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,320

737
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,520
I never sat in any lines or anything like that

738
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,040

It's so funny

741
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,960
The last time I sat in a line was to see a bunch of baby animals at a farm

742
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,520
And then I pretended to shoot them with my finger, and I made my girlfriend angry

The girlfriend you gotta be worried about these animals now

744
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,680
They might have taken that as an actionable threat. They were a little you they were asleep

745
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,220
Oh, they were pretending to be asleep, dude

749
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,920

00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,940
Whatever happened in just your damn hand?

831
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,940
Yeah.

832
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,940
Right?

833
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
Your damn right hand or maybe a really...

834
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,460
What if this thing explodes on your thing?

835
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,580
Maybe a blanket and some rubber bands.

836
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,740
This one looks like a bluetooth speaker.

837
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,140
It has like volume knob on it or like volume buttons.

838
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,180
Yeah dude, so you can blast the weekend while you fuck the car.

839
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,180
Yeah you can play I Hear the Secrets that you Keep, that song.

840
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,900
Nah, dude, you playing fucking, fucking Wicked games super, super loud.

841
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,460
Oh, yeah.

842
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,140
As you're going to town on this fucking vibrating six toy.

843
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,520
Fuck.

844
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,500
Fuck, man.

845
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:10,980
I want to see-

846
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,780
Angelica Wig.

847
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,860
No.

848
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,260
That's a toast to London name.

849
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,940
Yeah, it is a toast to London name.

850
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,820
This is crazy.

851
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,900
Every page they have like a new insane way that one of these can look

852
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,860
that I didn't think would be possible.

853
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,860
They have a lot of beer shaped ones.

854
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,860
I have to say.

855
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,060
Yeah, well, because that's like every man, that's like the male fantasy, right?

856
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,060
That's like a...

857
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,060
Yeah, you can fuck a bottle of beer.

858
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,280
Dude, I've always wanted to fuck beer so bad, dude.

859
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,380
Not the opening either, from the bottom of it.

860
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,620
From the back.

861
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,460
I'm trying to hit this stuff from the back, dude.

862
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,420
That's just what it is, man.

863
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,980
I can't control it.

864
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,100
I mean, who wouldn't want to fucking be six deep in a bottle of beer?

865
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
Yeah.

866
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
Fuck.

867
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,780
- Is that an official like?

868
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,980
- No, the beer says--

869
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,160
- Is that a real beer company?

870
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,420
- No, it says premium quality and then under that

871
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,460
it says realistic product.

872
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,300
- Yeah, this is the most realistic beer.

873
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,680
This one has like a picture of like an insanely

874
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,840
veiny thing going into it.

875
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,900
Ugh, this is fucked up.

876
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,800
That is like a mutant thingy in the side of the crop.

877
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,220
You can't put that on Amazon.

878
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,820
- What is up with people having so many veins

879
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,660
in their penises?

880
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,240
got a penis pump for men enlargement here.

881
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,840
Ooh, they got several of them.

882
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:38,180
I think I probably have one vein in my penis and it's probably like the size of a pencil

883
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,180
lead.

884
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,180
Yeah, mine looks like a vein.

885
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,980
Yeah, I think my penis is a vein.

886
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,300
How do these guys have multiple veins on their penises?

887
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,300
It's fucking incredible.

888
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,460
Also, how do you get a vascular penis?

889
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,860
Are you just like, do you have to like curl with it?

890
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,540
Just you know, do push-ups.

891
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,620
This picture- I don't think that works.

892
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,260
This picture of one has a, it looks, the hole looks like a mouth and it has black slime dripping

893
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,260
out of the mouth.

894
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,080
Do you guys know anybody who's ever had like a fleshlight or something like that?

895
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,080
Not to my knowledge.

896
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
That they've admitted to?

897
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
No.

898
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,260
I just don't get it man.

899
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:18,100
Like just, I mean you could fuck like, like there's so many fruits that I've fucked before

900
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,140
I've fucked a thing that was plastic.

901
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,820
You know, there was a kid that my brother,

902
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,980
like one of my younger brother's friends,

903
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,540
who told me he made a fleshlight

904
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,580
out of two sponges and a rubber glove.

905
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,420
- Well, that's different, 'cause yeah, like kids--

906
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,140
- But these are like expensive, though.

907
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,980
That's the--

908
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,100
- Every kid who made a waterfall bong in high school

909
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,300
also made a fleshlight.

910
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,180
- The thing is, like, people will buy a fleshlight,

911
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,580
but then also be like, oh, I don't wanna use

912
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,980
a gas station charger on my phone, it could mess it up.

913
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,420
know what I mean? Like, I don't think you should be putting any machine...

914
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,660
Well, how much is an original fleshlight?

915
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,380
Probably like ten thousand dollars for something that incredible.

916
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,380
Original, like one of the old, like an old mahogany fleshlight.

917
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,940
It still has a, it's like a dusty bust in it.

918
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,140
That's what you want? Some, some fucking...

919
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,260
It's seventy dollars.

920
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,700
That's more expensive than I would have thought.

921
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,100
That is less expensive than psycho lifelike masturbation, stroke or electric blowjob,

922
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,540
men deep throat oral vibrate masturbate or cup masturbators cup man also let's

923
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,620
top it I will say they nailed one thing that is the best about having sex with a

924
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:34,160
woman which is the vibration yeah they just nailed difference the different

925
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,460
settings it's always been my problem with a fleshlight is that it doesn't

926
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:44,820
vibrate like a real woman and I can't play music from her either yeah yeah so I

927
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,820
I guess it is better.

928
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,820
Yeah, I wish she looked like a blue yeti.

929
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,820
That's my only thing.

930
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,820
Oh, fuck, only dude.

931
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,820
Um...

932
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,820
I'm just still scrolling through these.

933
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,820
There's so many.

934
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,820
I'm just looking at them all.

935
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,820
I'm gonna buy all of them.

936
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,820
This one looks like Boba Fett's mask.

937
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,820
[laughs]

938
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,820
It's for the nerds in the audience, dude.

939
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,820
Yeah.

940
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:13,820
Uh, I've just been thinking, like, we talked last night about Marina Abramovich.

941
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,820
Oh yeah.

942
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,820
We talked about her.

943
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,820
Yeah, with Sridhar.

944
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,820
Shout out to Sridhar.

945
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,860
Yeah, and I was just, I remembered this thing that my grandpa said, which I already told

946
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,100
Patrick but it's just been making me laugh every time I think about it.

947
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,220
Cam, you know who that is, right?

948
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,220
Marina Abramovic.

949
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,220
She did spirit cooking.

951
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:37,340
Yeah, so like, so she did that, when she was doing that like the artist is present thing,

952
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:43,700
it was like on Fox News and I was like watching it with my grandpa when I was a kid and they

953
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,540
say like yeah artist Marina Abramovich you know this whole thing where you can do

954
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,840
whatever you want in the room with her and she just like can't move or whatever

955
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:59,140
and my grandpa goes huh world's oldest profession a just completely like just a

956
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,300
genius misread of that situation he's like he was just like yeah dude you

957
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:12,220
fucking pay so fucking funny we should do we should do an exhibit like that our

958
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,060
Our next live show should be--

959
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,140
We should just have an art exhibit in general, I think.

960
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,980
Yes, dude, we need to be--

961
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,100
We would do a really good art exhibit.

962
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,340
Yeah, I mean, we'd be, I mean, we have to be

963
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,980
some of the, secretly, some of the best artists

964
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,100
in the world, right?

965
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,500
No, no secret for me.

966
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,060
Everybody knows how good my art is.

967
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:26,880
Here's what I would do.

968
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,720
I make beautiful art in my mind.

969
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,100
We would need to make, I'm into making statements,

970
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,820
you know, 'cause I'm a very political and smart person.

971
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,900
So I would need to do something insane,

972
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,540
like an upside-down American flag,

973
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,580
or maybe like a, maybe like a Cheeto bag.

974
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:47,780
here and it says it says fat fat so here's a here's an idea or it's like an

975
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:53,140
American flag yeah instead of stars it's all upside down crosses that's been done

976
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,740
now that's been done okay what about this done what about out what about I put

977
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:03,700
it right side up cross whoa fuck well we need to like what about it what about

978
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,660
what about a bald eagle with a girl what about it's a plus sign you walk it you

979
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,620
look at it from a different angle it's a multiplication sign oh it's kind of a

980
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,140
commentary on mathematics yeah well that's the other thing is that a lot of

981
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,500
these artists they make the mistake of making commentary about like gender or

982
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,860
race or politics how about make commentary about like video games or

983
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,700
something yeah what about it's like like it's a french fry but you look at it

984
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,740
from the other side it's a potato makes you realize they were just a sign like a

985
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:41,500
neon sign that says French fries should be free what that's a statement is

986
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,700
everybody's gonna be everybody's gonna see I'd be like yeah they should be free

987
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:54,300
yeah or what about this like you it's a Banksy style like vandalism horrible

988
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:01,500
horrible horrible thing he does vandalism yeah you you make neon signs

989
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,420
you learn how to build neon signs,

990
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,060
and you go up to restaurants, maybe like McDonald's,

991
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,740
or maybe like Burger King, something like that,

992
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,620
and you put that sign that says,

993
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,860
"Free French fries" in the window.

994
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,820
- Yeah. - Yeah.

995
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,020
- And then you fuck up. - And then you fuck up.

996
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,820
- You fuck up McDonald's, 'cause they don't know how to say no.

997
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,380
- You fuck up some cashier's day.

998
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,820
- Yeah, that'd be awesome. - Yeah.

999
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,460
You stick it to who really fucking runs the show,

1000
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,580
these cashiers. - We could do,

1001
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,980
we could make a lot of different statements about fast food.

1002
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,620
- Okay, wait, here's another Banksy one, right?

1003
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,380
Okay. So this would be like, you know, we would, we would be doing like our kind of

1004
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,340
like Banksy imitation thing. Everybody would walk up to this piece would think

1005
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,220
it's Banksy at first. Okay. Cause they'd see, they go up, it's a $100 bill. Yeah.

1006
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:49,420
But instead of, um, you know, Mr. President in the middle, it's Ronald McDonald. Okay.

1007
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,460
And everyone looks at that and think, oh, this is Banksy. But then you look closer,

1008
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,380
there's a speech bubble. It says, you shouldn't have to pay this much money for fries.

1009
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,580
That is so genius.

1010
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,100
Wait, how about this, okay.

1011
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,660
So, you know, there's been like exhibits

1012
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,820
where somebody will like stack a million dollars, right?

1013
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,900
A million dollars in a room

1014
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,260
so that people can see what a million dollars is like.

1015
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,740
So I was thinking about, what if you walk in

1016
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,380
and there's a million dollars stacked up in a square, right?

1017
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,160
And there's a tiny sign, like really, really small print,

1018
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,860
like on a business card in front of it.

1019
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,900
And it says, almost feels like this is

1020
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,660
how much fries cost these days.

1021
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,900
(laughing)

1022
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,100
- What do you think?

1023
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,940
- What about, okay.

1024
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,760
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

1025
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,600
- I got an idea.

1026
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,180
So it's like a, so this is like a piece

1027
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,180
that you do in some kind of store.

1028
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,500
- Oh, yeah, these are all pieces, by the way.

1029
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,320
- Yeah.

1030
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,160
- They're nuts, yeah.

1031
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,020
- This is a piece that you put in,

1032
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,300
maybe you rent out a bodega for a day, right?

1033
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,220
And you put all these Lay's bags,

1034
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,140
like bags of Lay's chips,

1035
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,780
and then when somebody opens the bag,

1036
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,180
there's two potatoes in it,

1037
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,620
and there's a note that says, "Make it yourself."

1038
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,020
- Wow. - Wow.

1039
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,860
- Uh-huh.

1040
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,820
- What about one of those piracy ads,

1041
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,220
but it says, "You would eat a free fry."

1042
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,780
(laughing)

1043
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,620
- This one's kind of a thinker, okay?

1044
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,460
It's one of those things where it's like a commentary--

1045
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,940
- I mean, these are all thinkers, let's be clear.

1046
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,660
- Of course, yeah, this one's a thinker, thinker, okay?

1047
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,160
It's like one of those things where it's commentary

1048
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,020
on like, "Make America Great Again," okay?

1049
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,700
And then it's, and they show, it's like,

1050
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,120
so it says, "Make America Great Again,"

1051
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,900
and it shows an old picture of the dollar menu,

1052
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,580
where fries only cost $1.

1053
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,420
- Yes. - Okay.

1054
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,460
But then, but then, there's a thing under it,

1055
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,300
or you walk into the next room,

1056
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,740
and there's a part two of the painting,

1057
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,020
or the piece, I mean, sorry.

1058
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,860
- Yeah, come on.

1059
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,940
- Say, you have to say piece.

1060
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,300
- Yeah, the piece, the work, I should say, actually.

1061
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,280
- The body of work.

1062
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,380
- The body, yeah, well, it's all a body of work,

1063
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,540
but, and it says, "But was it ever really great?"

1064
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,260
They show the receipt of the $1 fries, 109 tax.

1065
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,020
- Whoa. - Oh my God, dude.

1066
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,340
- Holy shit.

1067
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,060
What about Lady Gaga in a french fry dress?

1068
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,060
*laughter*

1069
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,320
And she wears it to the free Grammys.

1070
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320

1071
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
For free stuff.

Yeah, okay. That could be good.

She says, yeah it's about free french fries.

1075
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,640
Okay, what about this? So it's like an American flag.

1076
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,000
It's got a picture of french fries and at the bottom it says,

1077
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,200
"Freedom fries, yeah I wish they were free."

1078
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,200
Oh shit.

1081
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,880

1129
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,580

1130
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:33,500
Campbell's soup but the soup says free fries on it. True and we could do a

1131
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,740
Jackson Pollock thing where we throw a bunch of fries at something. Yeah and but it cut

1132

00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,800
or easy to make.

1135
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,440
Anything that is easy to make should be free.

1136
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,240
- Maybe like a t-shirt, maybe like,

1137
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,840
I remember when Lil Wayne went to jail, free fries.

1138
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,960
And it's a picture of Lil Wayne eating french fries.

1139
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,940
- Free fries 'til it's backwards.

1140
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,780
- Uh-huh.

1141
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,880
- Yeah, 'til it's fries free.

1142
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,100
- Yep.

1143
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,940
- Yep.

1144
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,880
- I think that we need to,

1145
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,320
I think this is getting bigger than art.

1146
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,360
I think we're stepping into the world of politics again.

1147
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,200
- Yeah, well I think--

1148
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,960
- I think I might need to run for New York City Mayor.

1149
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,800
- Yeah.

1150
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,440
Free is a political statement in itself I think. Yeah we could have like we could

1151
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,260
also I mean if we're gonna go political we could take out we could we could draw

1152
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:33,360
a cartoon for the New Yorker okay. Where it's two old men on a bench.

1153
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,720
They they look like fucking shit horrible art I mean the artist didn't even bother

1154
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,600
to finish drawing. They don't even try. Gaps everywhere in the lines no detail no

1155
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,640
color just absolutely appalling you know this artist should be fired and mulched

1156
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:51,640
immediately. It's like shit. Just utter shit. The thing is it's not even, it's not the magazine's

1157
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,320
fault either. It's definitely, it's the artist. You know, I don't think they should be receiving

1158
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,160
any compensation for this type of thing. How many bad artists in a row can these fuckers at

1159
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,760
the New Yorker hire? It's disgusting. It's really disgusting. Anyway, the caption says,

1160
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,640
"I heard fries are free now." Wow. Because you know, they like that. Wait, wait, wait. They

1161
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,280
like dry type of humor. No, no, no. It has to be even drier. One guy says, "I hear fries are free

1162
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:18,840
now the other guy says no they're not and that's kind of a statement okay there's

1163
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:23,320
not any free what okay it's two guys you know they might as well be stick figures

1164
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,280
look like they look like a one-year-old drew them after getting his hands

1165
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,920
mangled it's just like what the fuck is this New Yorker shit about dude this is yeah I mean it's like

1166
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,080
it's appalling. I want to see pointillism. I want to see like a very realistic picture of a person.

1167
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,080
What happened to the Mona Lisa?

1168
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,080
It's like if you... yeah.

1169
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,080
It's like a blind man holding a pencil with his foot.

1170
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,080
Is like what this looks like.

1171
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,080
And it's one guy holding a lot of fries.

1172
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,080
A lot of fries.

1173
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,080
And it says "Guess the price."

1174
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,080
And it says...

1175
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,080
Okay, that's good.

1176
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,080
It's a caption contest.

1177
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,080
And here are the three best captions they've selected.

1178
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
Number one, "Guess the price."

1179
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:04,080
Number two, "I guess that explains those free fries signs I saw."

1180
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,080
Pretty good, right?

1181
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,920
- Uh-huh. - Yeah.

1182
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,800
- Caption number three,

1183
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,280
"And I don't even have any money."

1184
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,200
- Wow.

1185
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,040
- All right, so what about-- - That's a big,

1186
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,800
'cause we need to convince McDonald's,

1187
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,400
like, you guys don't realize,

1188
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,360
do you know how many more fries you'd be selling

1189
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,520
if they were completely free?

1190
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,800
- That's true, that's a really good point.

1191
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,400
- You guys would be selling millions of fries.

1192
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,920
- Lines out of the doors.

1193
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
- People would be lining up day and night

1194
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,880
for these fries. - I mean, remember how much

1195
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,100
fun your cashiers had with the Rick and Morty sauce?

1196
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,360
We could be doubling this every single day.

1197
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,200
- Exactly. - So you know,

1198
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,560
You know, you're familiar with the price is right.

1199
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,320
So what if it's the price is right, Loger,

1200
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,560
and it says the price is fries

1201
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,120
and there's a big zero next to it.

1202
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,320
Yeah. Wow, the fries are free.

1203
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,340
Yeah. Yeah.

1204
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,180
That's good.

1205
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,800
How about, instead of Jeopardy, it's fries are free.

1206
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:55,080
And they go, yep, I'll take fries for $0, Alex.
