1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
- Last time on Raw Dogenyu, the Softlossifer Stone,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,840
we reunited with Raw Dogenyu at the Beriberi Academy,

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,080
where he met two new best friends, Woody, the Druid Satyr,

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,920
and Andre Behavoir, the Goth Warlock Goliath.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,480
- Hello.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
- Together, they were sorted into house giants,

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,620
and then even went to classes together.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,040
They managed to do well in at least one class,

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,980
gifting them a free spell slot to use.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,980
In this case, gifting Woody a free spell slot.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,040
- Oh yeah, man.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,960
- That's going to come in handy right now

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,880
since in attacking class,

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,740
they were attacked by something

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,540
that wasn't planned by the professor.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,160
- Winged serpents. - In attacking class.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,720
They were attacked.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,120
- Winged serpents exploding from the surrounding sea.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
Exploding?

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,240
Erupting?

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,440
- There we go.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,920
- From the surrounding sea. - I like that one.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,760
- With the force of 10,000 dragons.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,200
- Okay, well, you know, I didn't--

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,320
- I remember that.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,720
- Yep. - I just remember that.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,720
- I didn't remember until you said the word erupting,

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,800
'cause I think the last time--

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,000
- That was fire, though. - I think you said

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,840
erupting with the force of 10,000 dragons.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,960
- I think everybody erupted-- - I like that.

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,720
- With the force of 10,000 dragons?

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,280
10,000 snakes?

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,920
- Erupted with-- - Yeah, I guess you could say--

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,260
- With the force of 10-- - Oh, here's the word

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,720
you're looking at, slithered.

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,880
- Slithered with the force of 10,000 serpents.

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,880
- With the speed-- - The speed--

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,320
- Of the snake.

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,120
- Combined with a bird. - Holy crap,

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,160
roll for initiative.

42
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,340
- Oh, snap.

43
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,520
- Did we already roll at the end of last one or not?

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,760
- Yeah, didn't we? - No.

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,100
- Oh, okay. - Or not.

46
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,940
- Well, I got-- - A 19.

47
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,740
I got an 11.

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,580
Okay.

49
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,400
An 11.

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,240
Oh God, I got a five.

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,180
Oh God, a five.

52
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,260
Charlie Brown vibe.

53
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,980
I got a five.

54
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,160
It takes every time that I roll any number at all,

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,140
I wanna say the Charlie Brown line.

56
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,020
Every time.

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,580
Say I got a something.

58
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,020
He goes, ah poo poo.

59
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,860
I always want to.

60
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,740
He goes, ah poo poo.

61
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,780
Why did they do that to him?

62
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,620
I don't know.

63
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,300
- He was suffering back in the day.

64
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,860
I hope he's good now.

65
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,100
- Every single kid is dressed like a ghost, including him.

66
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,220
How did they know it was Charlie Brown?

67
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,280
- 'Cause he fucked up his costume.

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,900
- Yeah. - But, all right.

69
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,340
- Not so bad that you need a rock for him.

70
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,740
- So, first is gonna be Woody.

71
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,380
So, just to give you guys the lay of the land.

72
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,140
So, if you remember from the map from before, right,

73
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,140
there's that, this takes place sort of on the left wing

74
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,980
of the Academy.

75
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,820
- Oh, geez.

76
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,660
- And there's--

77
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,780
(laughing)

78
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,060
And there's this sort of a fenced-in area

79
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,740
where this is taking place, and to the shore,

80
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,060
there's a shore that it's kind of up against,

81
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,220
and that's where the winged serpents came from.

82
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,880
The professor, in this case, Professor Aquaman,

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,780
he took the kids out, and he said he's gonna come back

84
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,620
after he takes the kids and gets them to safety.

85
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,820
It's a lot of first-years who aren't skilled

86
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,460
at attacking magic, but he was impressed

87
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,460
with you guys, so he hopes you can hold them off.

88
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,420
Now, so they are just sort of like,

89
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,800
there's about seven or so of these winged serpents,

90
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,980
and they're spread out, kind of in like,

91
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,260
kind of scattered and spread out,

92
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,740
but a little bit clumped together.

93
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,060
You guys are about, you know,

94
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,300
you guys are about, I'd say like average range

95
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,720
away from them about 30 feet, 35-ish feet.

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,940
And yeah, you could see like, you know,

97
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,260
it's nighttime, so it's harder to see them.

98
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,540
You see the lights of the academy in the background.

99
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,500
You hear them like hissing and flapping their wings.

100
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,720
Just set the scene and Woody, yeah,

101
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,620
there's a few right in front of you.

102
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,920
What do you wanna do here?

103
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,100
- This to me really feels like a teacher's job.

104
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm not sure why I'm doing any of this.

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,740
Or is there not security guards?

106
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,980
Every high school in America has security guards

107
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,340
to make sure kids don't bring in wrenches,

108
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,100
but we don't have a security guard at the magic school?

109
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,020
- Look man.

110
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,140
- That's a good question.

111
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,500
- People ask JK Rowling that same question.

112
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,300
- Did they? - They did?

113
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,460
- No, I don't think they did.

114
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,660
I mean, they did. - I guess this takes place

115
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,500
a long, long time before-- - They had security guards.

116
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,180
They had Dementors.

117
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,020
- They did have Dementors, but there still was--

118
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,060
- This takes place even before that.

119
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,900
- There was a troll in the school.

120
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,020
- Dementors was the original reason you had,

121
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,220
Dementors was before Columbine--

122
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,980
- They still had to fight a troll in the school.

123
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,580
- But we're even before, we're pre that, man.

124
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,340
- Okay, well.

125
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,480
- Also, Hogwarts literally had an entire,

126
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,100
part of their whole, one of the houses was for evils.

127
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,580
- I will literally, it was for ambition.

128
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,580
- Am I close to, am I close to Dogen or Big One?

129
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,960
- Dogen and Andre are nearby you, yes.

130
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,920
- Okay, I would like to go up to Andre

131
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,780
and I would like to cast Bark Skin on Andre.

132
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,200
- Nice, scribe. - Oh, you're gonna make me

133
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,100
into a tree.

134
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,360
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch

135
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,020
gains the ability to move up, down,

136
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,620
and across vertical surfaces

137
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,080
and upside down along ceilings.

138
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,980
Why could I do this?

139
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,220
Oh wait, no, that's spider climb.

140
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,480
(laughing)

141
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,840
- It's like, everybody was like,

142
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
that's not what I read.

143
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,580
- And then you, it's like, and then your skin gets weird.

144
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,280
You touch a willing creature until the spell ends,

145
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,260
the target's skin has a rough, bark-like appearance,

146
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,460
and the target's AC can't be less than 16

147
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,560
regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,560
so it is a bit of a defensive style buff for my big friend.

149
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,500
- That is a very good move

150
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,420
because Andre does have very low AC.

151
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,000
So Andre-- - Bring her in, bring it in.

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
- Your AC will now be at 16,

153
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,320
which is gonna be useful for this battle.

154
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,520
- Oh yeah, 'cause I have an armor class of 12.

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
That's crazy for a giant. - Yeah, you have

156
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,640
a pretty low AC.

157
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960
Well, you're supposed to have higher health,

158
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,920
which you do have slightly higher health.

159
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
- Yeah, I do.

160
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm gonna use this combo this whole campaign, I think.

161
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,520
- Woody, though, make sure you spend

162
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,360
- You spent the spell for that.

163
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
- Yeah, I spent it.

164
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,560
- Okay, cool.

165
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
All right, great.

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,400
So I like that.

167
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,440
So now it is Raw Dogenyu's turn.

168
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,200
- Okay, I didn't get any new abilities or nothing.

169
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,000
- No, you're still the same level five paladin.

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,800
- All right, I'm just gonna go,

171
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
well, actually, you know what?

172
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
I'm gonna try and--

173
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,080
- You have some good items, though.

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,480
- I have items?

175
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,500
Oh, I'm gonna use my item.

176
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm gonna use the big ore wave

177
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,620
to try and push these big serpents back in.

178
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,200
They came out of the water, right?

179
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,560
- They did, they did, yes.

180
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,720
- So maybe by using the wave,

181
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,600
it will kind of just naturally put them back in the water,

182
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,440
using water.

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,160
- Well, that's very possible.

184
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
- Nice.

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
- So I just will go ahead.

186
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,400
- If they got, my problem with that would be

187
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,780
that they got out of the water once.

188
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,640
It's quite possible they could do it again.

189
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,360
- They probably tried to get out of the water,

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
so they don't like the water, like water must be.

191
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,160
Why else would you be like,

192
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,960
I have to erupt out of this water.

193
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
- I guess you're right.

194
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,800
- So let me roll--

195
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,640
- If you wanted to be in there, you wouldn't explode out of it.

196
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,520
- With the force of 10,000 dragons,

197
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
I must get out of this water right now.

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,080
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

199
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,520
And so I'm gonna start rolling for them.

200
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,120
Okay, saved, saved.

201
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,760
- Ah, shit. - Ah, Cameron.

202
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,560
- Saved.

203
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,920
- L. - Saved.

204
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,980
- How many of them are there?

205
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,360
Oh my God. - A seven.

206
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
- Saved. - Seven?

207
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,720
- Seven. - Yeah.

208
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
- What?

209
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,600
I thought there was two. - These are animals?

210
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,440
- Just by my own thinking.

211
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
- What are these?

212
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,160
- These are the animals. - They're animals up top.

213
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,480
- They're human snakes.

214
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,800
- They're human snakes, but they're snakes.

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,440
- They're winged snakes, winged snakes.

216
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,760
They're like serpents with wings.

217
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,040
- Serpents, not snakes, serpents.

218
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
- Yeah, serpents, sorry.

219
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,160
- Winged.

220
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,320
- And winged, not winged. - So they're winged serpents.

221
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,240
So they have sort of like a fishy kind of tail too

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,440
that allows them to swim, and then like wings.

223
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,560
They all saved, they rolled really, really well.

224
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
- They all saved?

225
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,220
- Yeah, 'cause your spell save is 14, I think,

226
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,860
So double tap.

227
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,620
- God damn. - All rolled over 14.

228
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
- Yeah. - That's crazy.

229
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,580
- But on a failure, they still take one half the damage.

230
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,620
So roll for damage still. - Nice.

231
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,580
- What is the damage?

232
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,180
2D8, so should I just roll 2D8 and divide it?

233
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,780
- Yeah, yes, exactly. - Or should I roll 1D8?

234
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,000
- Yes, 2D8, divide it, yes.

235
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
- Okay.

236
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,680
- We're rounding up these days.

237
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,700
- Cool.

238
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,940
I like rounding up.

239
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,460
All right, that's three.

240
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,140
- Okay, so yeah, I mean, they all take three damage.

241
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,320
so they don't get pushed back.

242
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,780
I mean, I think there's a way--

243
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,620
- Can I also--

244
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,980
- They have a sort of resistance to it, you know?

245
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,420
- They have a resistance to it?

246
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,340
What languages do I speak?

247
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,780
Do I speak any weird languages?

248
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,700
I can't find it on my character sheet.

249
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,780
- I think usually-- - Serpentine?

250
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,300
- Oh, here it is, common, goblin, and minotaur.

251
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Okay, well.

252
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,300
I was gonna try and see if I could talk to them, but.

253
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,820
Well, I guess, just say something.

254
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,620
- In Minotaur, I'll just yell out, "Hey, everybody!"

255
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,260
in Minotaur to see if anyone--

256
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,100
- Maybe there's a Minotaur around that might help.

257
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,140
- Yeah, who could help us.

258
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,060
- That's a pretty good idea. - I'll say, "Help, help!"

259
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,700
- In Minotaur. - Guys, I have a spell--

260
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,620
- A Minotaur like a thousand miles away is like,

261
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,540
"I'm coming!"

262
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,980
And starts barreling through.

263
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,540
- Yeah. - You have a loud-ass voice, man.

264
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,620
- Yeah, well, I used Thaumaturgy to make my voice--

265
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,660
- Thaumaturgy. - Ah.

266
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,100
- But I guess that's my turn.

267
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,140
- Yep.

268
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,540
I mean like unless you have that's your action

269
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,940
For bonus action that's kind of really it. I mean you've nimble escape, but there's no reason for you to really disengage

270
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,140
Yeah, I don't have I don't have anything I could do a hide action. I mean there's not too much stuff to hide behind here

271
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,820
I'm not afraid of anything

272
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:08,020
Okay, well not afraid of seven giant snakes. No wings well. They're not cuz I know where

273
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,660
They're not quite giant. Oh, I thought they were that's why I thought there was only two of them because I thought

274
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,300
No, they're seven scared of these fucking snakes, yeah, I mean either now they're normal human size

275
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,880
It is their turn now, so there's seven of them six of them

276
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,360
Form into a circle or you know a hexagon right one of them

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,920
Ends up in the center of that wait. They can't bend their bodies

278
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,080
No, I mean they just like position themselves in this way

279
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Oh, okay.

280
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,460
Yeah, and then one of them ends up in the middle.

281
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:53,440
That one in the middle looks to the sky and hisses, and I need you all to roll a dexterity

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
saving throw.

283
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,880
I knew some shit like this was going to happen.

284
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,920
I got a 20.

285
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Very good.

286
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
19.

287
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I got an 18.

288
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,840
Okay, wow.

289
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,480
Dirty 20, Pat?

290
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,040
Yeah, dirty 20.

291
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,880
- Very good.

292
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,200
You all only take 12 damage.

293
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,480
- What, I got a 20.

294
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,000
- Yeah, you take half damage in this case.

295
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
As lightning comes from the sky and crashes down upon you.

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,520
Somehow the snakes together were able

297
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,720
to cast this kind of spell.

298
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
- Wait, I have a question. - The snakes are covered

299
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,800
in water from my ore wave, by the way,

300
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,400
so the lightning would probably be more striking

301
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,440
towards them, just based on the mechanics of lightning.

302
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,760
- I don't think, I don't think if, no.

303
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
I mean, I could--

304
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,240
- Based on how lightning scientifically works,

305
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,440
which I'm thinking of right now,

306
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,280
it just usually strikes you when it's first.

307
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,720
- This is fantasy, not science fiction.

308
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,440
- I have a question, Patches.

309
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,000
I have a question about this version of D&D,

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,320
I'm not sure how familiar you are

311
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,160
with the mechanics of the game Baldur's Gate 3,

312
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,160
but is there a throwing option in this game?

313
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,800
- Yeah, there's always a throwing option in D&D as well.

314
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,840
- Yeah.

315
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,680
- In both Baldur's Gate 3 and regular.

316
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,440
- Okay, Cameron, I think you know what to do.

317
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,280
- And regular.

318
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,100
- Yeah.

319
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,940
- So that's--

320
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,240
- Oh, I don't know, it's not my turn.

321
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,300
I think, well, I know there's one guy on our team

322
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,140
who's the number one thrower, I can tell just by his stat.

323
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,720
- This guy's a great thrower, for sure.

324
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,580
- And it is his term, Andre Behavoir.

325
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,460
- So I'm gonna use speak with animals.

326
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,600
- Nice.

327
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,400
- Yeah, you can cast it at will, right?

328
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,440
- Oh, that's why you asked if they were animals, okay.

329
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,280
- Yeah.

330
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,320
- Yes, they are beasts.

331
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,740
- Technically, yes.

332
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,660
- Ah, fuck!

333
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,280
- Well, no, I mean you could--

334
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,120
- Fuck everything!

335
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,520
- That's an animal, that's an animal.

336
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,040
- Beasts are animals?

337
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,880
- Yeah.

338
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,280
- I just think it's silly to make that distinction.

339
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,960
- Well, I just thought you were turning him down

340
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,800
just then and kind of--

341
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
- Oh, no, I wasn't, I wasn't.

342
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,480
- It's in everything a fucking animal.

343
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,300
- Laissez kind of way.

344
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,640
Like, yeah, well, they're beasts, so.

345
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,480
- Yeah, well, actually they're beasts.

346
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
- That's what I thought.

347
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,320
- No, no, no, no.

348
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
- That's what I thought, too.

349
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,120
- No, you can talk with them.

350
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,760
Sorry, I wasn't trying to do that.

351
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,760
You don't need to cast a spell to speak with a beast, just dial my number, man.

352
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
So...

353
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Damn!

354
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Hit my Skype.

355
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Ooh!

356
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Snap!

357
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Okay, Cameron.

358
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
You popped off with that.

359
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Alright, okay.

360
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Or an animal, either, now that I think about it.

361
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I don't even want to do my turn now.

362
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Say that shit again, man.

363
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Cameron was too sane again.

364
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Oh my God.

365
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

366
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
So, I turn to the...

367
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm going to do my turn.

368
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
I'm going to do my turn.

369
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
I'm going to do my turn.

370
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm going to do my turn.

371
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
I'm going to do my turn.

372
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm going to do my turn.

373
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
I'm going to do my turn.

374
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
I'm going to do my turn.

375
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
- Nice and generous, probably, right?

376
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,420
- So I turn to the, I walk over, and I'm a big tree now.

377
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,440
- That's not so, it's more like you're covered in bark.

378
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,280
- Well, I walk-- - It's more like

379
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,700
you're wearing bark face.

380
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,380
- Well, I walk up to all of them.

381
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:50,000
I walk up and I say, "Hello, what are you guys doing here?"

382
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,420
- We're here on behalf of the Serpent King.

383
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,760
- Oh, okay.

384
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
*laughs*

385
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Guys, they're here on behalf of the Serpent King.

386
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Tell them to stop attacking or something.

387
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Ask them why they're- like what does the Serpent King want with us?

388
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Are you attacking for any reason or is um...

389
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,760
The Serpent King commands us to attack.

390
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,040
Okay, well can we maybe come to an agreement, right?

391
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,960
Or like, cuz look, the rest of us here, no one wants an attack.

392
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,840
>> [LAUGH] >> He's right.

393
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,520
>> That's great.

394
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,120
>> It's a good point.

395
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,280
>> Most of us here don't want an attack, but-

396
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,360
>> Say all of, nobody wants an attack

397
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
here. >> That's right.

398
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,720
>> Nobody.

399
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,280
>> Most of us.

400
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,000
>> Don't say most of us.

401
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,600
>> Nobody in the building wants an attack.

402
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,080
- Or outside of it. - We're outside of the building.

403
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,960
We're outside of the building.

404
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,400
- Okay, well we're outside. - Ain't nobody here.

405
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
- Yeah, the snakes hear that, they immediately go,

406
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
"Oh, well, okay, we won't go inside,

407
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,440
but we'll still attack you here."

408
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,640
- Well, okay, well nobody in your immediate vicinity

409
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,120
wants an attack done on them.

410
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,480
So maybe we could work out a deal

411
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,020
or something where you don't attack us.

412
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,920
And maybe we can just talk this out,

413
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
'cause I'm talking to you now.

414
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,440
It's crazy that I'm able to talk to you in it.

415
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,440
- I mean, roll persuasion with disadvantage.

416
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,360
- Disadvantage?

417
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,200
- For real?

418
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,480
They're commanded by the Serpent King.

419
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,320
Eight and four.

420
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
- Eight and four, yeah, that ain't gonna happen, man.

421
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,640
Why are my rolls so terrible?

422
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,320
What the hell?

423
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,400
- They go, "You try to trick us, leg walker."

424
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,120
I'm not trying to trick or anything. I'm trying to I don't I don't like

425
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,320
What's the word

426
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,380
Conflict that my horn flakes

427
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:07,520
Corn flakes flakes. Did you say corn flakes? Do you guys like corn?

428
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,400
I hate corn flakes. I hate him too. He doesn't like me. They just said I hate him

429
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I hate cornflakes. I hate cornflakes. I hate them too. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's march all the way to the cornflake factory as a group. Yeah, let's go attack the cornflake factory together.

430
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,560
- I don't like it either now that I think about it.

431
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,400
- One of the snakes goes--

432
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,080
- It's a way better idea.

433
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,760
- Well, I like cornflakes.

434
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,840
Shut up!

435
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,680
- Get him!

436
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,500
- Oh, what the hell?

437
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,340
- Get the heck!

438
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,240
- Let's get this guy.

439
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,280
Let's get this guy done.

440
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,000
- Yeah, one of the snakes sort of sheepishly

441
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,760
retreats back into the water.

442
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,520
I'll give you that for this.

443
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,240
(laughing)

444
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,960
But the other snakes are still out there

445
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,520
and they're like, "We hate cornflakes and you."

446
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,720
- Why do you hate me?

447
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,080
- Yeah, I'll hate me too!

448
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Let's get me!

449
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,700
Yeah, I mean you're not gonna convince them but um

450
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,120
Okay, why are you attacking us? Can I at least know that?

451
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,360
Serpent King commands us to

452
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,280
Why is the Serpent King saying this? Did he have a reason?

453
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,900
To bring us the Great One

454
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,240
Who's that?

455
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,500
The Great One

456
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,780
Alright, I'll go! I'll go if I have to

457
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
We could find him

458
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,800
We can find him and bring him to you and you know

459
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,680
Then we could all be done with this

460
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,520
All right

461
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,960
You got some information out of it. It's pretty funny. We killed one of them. Yeah, what are they get rid of one of them?

462
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,160
Yeah, I'll give you that. I'll give you that. I'll give you one of those a session

463
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
All right, you're up. You're up Caleb. Woody. Oh

464
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,500
- Wait, can I just do one thing before?

465
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,340
- Yeah.

466
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,100
- Guys, I don't think they like me talking to them.

467
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,100
So I'm gonna just stand here and be a tree still.

468
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,660
- We need you to attack.

469
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,500
- That was what you-- - Okay.

470
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,900
- We really need you to be blocking.

471
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,860
- Wait, can I attack?

472
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,860
- No, that was your action.

473
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,700
- That was my action?

474
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,520
- Yeah, that's an action.

475
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,340
- Okay, I'm going to use,

476
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,900
I'm gonna use Call Lightning on these serpents.

477
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,980
- But they already like lightning.

478
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,820
- Wait, they like it? - Yeah, they like lightning.

479
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,300
- Do they have a defense? - They used it already.

480
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,100
- I'm not against this.

481
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,940
- 'Cause I don't know.

482
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,020
- This is the only fucking damaging ability I have.

483
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,660
- Yeah, it's not Pokemon, so it might still hurt them.

484
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,780
- Okay, then I cast it.

485
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,060
- They are flying in water.

486
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,420
- He's saying that 'cause he knows that,

487
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,300
oh, well that didn't seem to matter before, did it?

488
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,500
- When they used lightning, Gyarados can use lightning.

489
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,460
He's flying in water.

490
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,260
- I thought this wasn't Pokemon.

491
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,100
- Oh, shit. - Stop it.

492
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,340
You can't do that.

493
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,140
That was too, that was good shit.

494
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,980
Okay.

495
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,860
- Damn it, all right, let me roll for saves for them.

496
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,180
- 14.

497
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,300
- 14's your spell save DC?

498
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,220
- Or hit DC, yeah.

499
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,620
- Okay, cool.

500
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,780
All right, so far, okay.

501
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,740
- Where does it say spell save DC on the sheet?

502
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,300
- For me, it's on the spell.

503
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,500
- Really?

504
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,340
- All right, cool.

505
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,900
Two of them failed, one of them--

506
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,820
- Oh, I see it.

507
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,660
- Two of them failed, four of them succeeded,

508
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,620
so roll for damage.

509
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,460
Are you casting it at--

510
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,300
- God damn it.

511
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,260
- Level three. - What level are you casting?

512
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,100
Level three, okay.

513
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,940
- Zero!

514
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,900
- Whoa, 24 damage?

515
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,740
- 24.

516
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,580
- Nice, cool, so two of them take 24.

517
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,300
- You said zero?

518
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,380
- It's a zero on the die. - Oh, zero!

519
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,220
- Oh, zero!

520
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,060
- I was like, what?

521
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,780
- Oh, zero!

522
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,060
- I think the ones we, the D10s we have at the--

523
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,140
- Oh no, zero!

524
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,420
- The D10s we have at the office have a 10 on them.

525
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,100
- Yeah, not a zero.

526
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,940
- Yeah.

527
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,500
- Oh, zero!

528
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,740
- All right, cool, that was good, yeah.

529
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,080
You did a healthy amount of damage with them.

530
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,260
They're all kind of close enough

531
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,160
because they did that formation before.

532
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,900
Yeah, so you are now up, Rod Doge and you.

533
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,740
- Okay.

534
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,780
I guess, do I-- - I like that sound.

535
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,620
- Huh?

536
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,700
- Bro just went.

537
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,460
- Bro just did that.

538
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,020
He just did that.

539
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,300
- Okay, I guess our command works on only one thing.

540
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,120
I don't, it doesn't seem like I have much that can go,

541
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,380
- That can go.

542
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,500
- That can go AOE, I'm trying to see,

543
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,300
'cause there's so damn many of them.

544
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,500
Sorry, I'm just looking through my stuff.

545
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,380
- We'll go shopping later, you can maybe get some scrolls.

546
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,940
(gasps)

547
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,780
For real though?

548
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,720
- We're really gonna go shopping?

549
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,680
- I mean if we make it to the end part.

550
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,680
- Okay, I guess I will cast

551
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,480
Hellish Rebuke.

552
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,360
Just like prepare it as a react,

553
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
or do I not even have to do that?

554
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,680
Is it just my reaction?

555
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,160
- It's just your reaction, yeah.

556
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,480
- Okay, then I won't do that after all.

557
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,800
And instead, I'm gonna stack the buffs on Andre Behavoir.

558
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,640
Or no, you know what?

559
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,400
Bless is up to three people,

560
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,040
so I'm gonna bless all three of us.

561
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,540
Oh yeah, bitch.

562
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,260
Very nice.

563
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,340
So OK, so now now whenever you get a plus

564
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,540
three or four, yeah, they're going to get a plus D4

565
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,000
on any attack roll they do, as well as a saving throw.

566
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,880
So that's going to be useful.

567
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,960
So now the snakes turn.

568
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,800
So, yeah, two of them are are are right bloodied

569
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,600
and four of them are doing OK, but they got hurt by that call lightning.

570
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
So they're going to go after

571
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,240
Two of them are gonna go after you, behave wah.

572
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,180
- Who's saying-- - Oh!

573
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,980
- So, we're gonna roll-- - But I'm built like a tree now.

574
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,180
Yeah, you are, which will be helpful.

575
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,980
You're not built like a tree.

576
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,940
- You're skinned like one. - Just let him think his stuff.

577
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,340
- Bark, you have barked skin. - Bark, you have barked tree.

578
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,500
Okay.

579
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,940
One of them does hit you.

580
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,820
- Oh, bro. - Oh, brother.

581
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,980
And it does...

582
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,500
26 damage.

583
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
No, it does 10 damage to you.

584
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Jesus Christ.

585
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,500
The other four are going to roll up on, they're going to go split-siege, so it's going to be two for each of you.

586
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,500
And they're running up, what they're doing is they're running up, you see them like, running up, they're flying up,

587
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,500
and sort of like coming in, like diagonal to like try to take a chunk out of you.

588
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Alright, this is on Dogen. One of them got a crit 20.

589
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Uh-oh!

590
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,500
So that does 19 damage.

591
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,340
- 19?

592
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,180
- Yeah.

593
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,140
- Is someone else coming after me too?

594
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,980
- No.

595
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,420
- Anyway, I want a hellish rebuke.

596
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,580
- Okay, nice, yeah.

597
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,860
- And I'll cast that at second level.

598
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,380
- Nice.

599
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,620
- Who's barking?

600
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,460
- What's the damage?

601
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,280
- My dog, hold on.

602
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,980
- Wife's coming home right now.

603
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,820
- What's the damage you got there?

604
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,660
- Barking, I saw me barking.

605
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,900
Who's barking, he asks.

606
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,340
- I thought you were barking, man.

607
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,180
- Your wife's barking.

608
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,340
- What did you ask me?

609
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,180
- You gotta-- - You better not be barking

610
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,980
on the side. - My nipples are barking.

611
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,100
- What'd you get on the damage for the house of Luke?

612
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,140
- You ever hear that?

613
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,000
- Let's roll it right now.

614
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,060
I got 20.

615
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,140
- Wow, nice.

616
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,740
So you get bit by this one,

617
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,060
and then you incinerate it right after.

618
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,580
- Oh snap. - Nice.

619
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
- Yeah.

620
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,080
So that was very cool.

621
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,260
It bit you, did a huge amount of damage,

622
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,500
but then you incinerated it.

623
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Unfortunately for you, Woody, both of them hit you.

624
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,820
- I shimmy.

625
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,460
- And one of them crit.

626
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,420
So one of them does another 19.

627
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,060
- Did you hear what I said?

628
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,980
- I think so.

629
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,740
- He said, "I guess I'm too spicy."

630
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,300
And then I shimmied.

631
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,760
Can you show us what the shimmy would look like?

632
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,220
Can you get up?

633
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,100
Can you get up and do a shimmy?

634
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,660
- I'm not gonna get up, man.

635
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,500
- So you take--

636
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,420
- Do one of these across the room.

637
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,660
I did, I just did it like three times.

638
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,500
Stand up and pop and lock right now.

639
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,660
Not across my room, no, I'm not standing up, man.

640
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm playing my PJs.

641
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,340
Stand up.

642
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,160
Oh, is Woody gone?

643
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh my God.

644
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm not looking at my thing.

645
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,140
He's here, he just is.

646
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,340
I'm here, sorry, one second.

647
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,620
No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine, yeah, do your thing.

648
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,860
He's sitting right in front of you.

649
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,740
I think he's, I have no, I'm jumping between tabs.

650
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,580
He's doing something.

651
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,180
That would actually be a good move is to put like a,

652
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,020
put a cardboard cover.

653
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,640
An OBS, put like a frozen photo.

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,100

You're not dead

I've won. We're all gonna die HP

And now, you're up, Woody.

00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
You're back, back to you.

Okay.

678
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,300
So there's two, just two on either side of you right now.

679
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Do I have a healer type of thing?

680
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
You probably do, I bet.

681
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Oh, I bet you have Goodberry.

682
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
That one is funny.

683
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
In my inventory?

684
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,460
- No, that's a spell.

685
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,820
- I do not have that spell.

686
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,580
(screaming)

687
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,300
- Did you not add spells?

688
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,060
It doesn't look like it.

689
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,900
- Uh oh.

690
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,720
(laughing)

691
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,560
- Let's add some spells.

692
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,400
- I think that he failed.

693
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,740
- I'll take the one I have.

694
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,780
- Well, I'm already gonna, after this, okay?

695
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,260
- Okay, fine, I thought you would add them.

696
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,540
- Why don't you add them right now?

697
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,940
- I'm gonna use spider climb and I'm gonna run up the wall.

698
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,820
- There's no wall, man, we're outside.

699
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,660
- There's a wall of the castle.

700
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,500
- So there's a wall.

701
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,700
- You only have spider climb.

702
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,380
- So there's a wall of the building nearby,

703
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,860
but you would have to move out of range of them,

704
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,860
which would provoke an attack of opportunity.

705
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,380
- Not if I'm on a wall.

706
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,220
- So if you move a tree--

707
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,620
- Wait a minute, I'm calling the lightning again.

708
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,060
- Oh, you know what I should have done?

709
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,340
Actually, do you mind rolling a D20?

710
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,020
Sorry, I should have done a constitution saving throw

711
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,420
for you, 'cause you might not have to cast a spell,

712
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,140
or use a spell slot for this.

713
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,660
- 11.

714
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,800
- Okay, cool, so you pass that.

715
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
So this wouldn't even cost a spell slot to call lightning again.

716
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
If you call it on the two guys near you,

717
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,800
you do the thing you do in CRPGs where you circle just outside of where you are,

718
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,800
and just where they are, you just perfectly shape it.

719
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,800
So I'm going to roll for them, see how they do.

720
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Okay, one of them saved, one of them didn't.

721
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Roll damage.

722
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:13,980
12. Not as good. It was 12? Okay. Half is good. In fact, so one is... Half is good. One

723
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,420
took 6 then and one took 12? Okay. Alright, one of them is not looking good. The other

724
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,680
one is also not looking good, but it's looking a little better than that. So, but they're

725
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,840
- How many's left? - They're both pretty low.

726
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,000
- Two, one more? - There's four left,

727
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,280
one by, they're all pretty low.

728
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,280
One by Behave-Wa, one by you, Dogen,

729
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,240
and two by your bark friend here, Woody.

730
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,040
- It's my turn? - Yes, it is.

731
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,840
- Okay, I'm just gonna melee attack.

732
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,240
Also, I guess my oar, because I'm not a pirate anymore,

733
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
my oar is now a big pencil.

734
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,560
- 'Cause you're a nerd. - Okay.

735
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,720
- 'Cause I'm a student.

736
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,280
- Yes. - Not a nerd, hey.

737
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,000
- No, not a nerd, a student.

738
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,480
- A student of the educational persuasion.

739
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,760
- Yeah, okay. - That is a 13.

740
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,320
- 13 does not hit, so you whiffed.

741
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,820
- Okay, attack again. - Yeah.

742
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,520
- That is an 18. - That definitely hits.

743
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,880
- Okay, that is nine damage.

744
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,400
- Nice, you also have smites too.

745
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,320
True, I always forget about these things.

746
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,160
They're great.

747
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,000
That's a huge part about being a paladin.

748
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,760
How many smites do I get?

749
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,740
Are they, they're not part of my spells.

750
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,580
Yes they are.

751
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,340
Oh no, they are, they're spell slot.

752
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,300
Okay, yeah, I'll do a smite, why not?

753
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,140
Nice, do a level one.

754
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,540
I'll do a level one smite, so 2d8.

755
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,380
Nice.

756
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,500
That is 13 extra damage.

757
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,160
Nice, yeah, they, this one,

758
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,720
you just sort of like whack it with the eraser side

759
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,280
of the pencil and it just erases.

760
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,320
- I guess my first attack,

761
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
I should have added the blessed dice,

762
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,880
is what I have been within range,

763
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,000
would plus four, a possible plus four

764
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,280
would have made me hit on a 17 hit?

765
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,920
- A 17, it would have hit, it would have hit.

766
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,480
- Okay. - Okay, so let's count that.

767
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,300
- Yeah, yeah. - Can I roll it?

768
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,920
Well, can I just roll a D4 and if I get a four,

769
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,200
then I hit my first attack, I guess.

770
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,560
- Yeah, we should have, yeah.

771
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,600
No, no, no, I should have thought of that too.

772
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
It's part of my job, so.

773
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,900
- Okay, I got a three, so it doesn't even matter.

774
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,820
- Okay, cool, either way, they're gone.

775
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,420
That snake is done, done skis.

776
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,380
Bye bye.

777
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,980
And now it is the other three snakes' turn.

778
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,420
- I have to go open this beer over the sink

779
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,140
because it's going to explode.

780
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,980
- Epic.

781
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,800
- Okay.

782
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,980
- So one of them is gonna go after you, Behavoir.

783
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,220
- Wait, if he's leaving, I'm gonna grab a beer.

784
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,060
- Okay.

785
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,700
I guess nobody's gonna do anything.

786
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,820
- Mark it, 30, 45, we have a complete catastrophic failure.

787
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,600
- Just failure.

788
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,760
- Ju-bio.

789
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,800
- Making complete sense.

790
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Making, oh, if he's gonna leave,

791
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,080
then I'm gonna leave so nobody's on the podcast.

792
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,920
That was the logic.

793
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,400
- Yeah, I like that logic.

794
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,360
- I thought we were taking a break.

795
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,360
- No, you decided you had to because you left.

796
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,200
(all talking over each other)

797
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,920
- I was just saying that so that everyone would know

798
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,760
I'm not just running away for no reason.

799
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,580
- And then Frederick said, "If Cameron's leaving,

800
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,040
"I'm gonna leave now, too."

801
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,880
(laughing)

802
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,280
- He said that?

803
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
- Pretty much, yeah.

804
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,040
- Yeah, he was like, "Okay, so while Cam's gone,

805
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,400
"I'm gonna go, too."

806
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,240
And we're like, "Oh, okay."

807
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,760
- I didn't think it was my turn.

808
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,480
- No, no, it's not your turn,

809
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,280
but you are about to receive,

810
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,960
stuff's gonna happen at you.

811
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,880
- Okay.

812
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
- So, no, I'm sorry, you're right,

813
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,400
I should be nicer to you.

814
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,080
So this--

815
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,480
- Don't let him win, Patches.

816
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,480
- So this guy is going to-- - Cam, what are you drinking?

817
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,480
- Roll a dexterity saving throw. - Old ass beer from the back of the fridge.

818
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,480
- That puffed up with force. - What did he do?

819
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,480
- Oh, puffed up with force. - Behave-wa, roll a dexterity saving throw.

820
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,480
- Alright. - What the hell is he drinking?

821
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,140
- I'm gonna make a jar of poop water.

822
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,920
(laughing)

823
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,180
- It's the fucking widest jar I've ever seen anyone drink.

824
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,640
That's a candle.

825
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,280
- Usually I have, usually.

826
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,120
(laughing)

827
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,040
- Hold that up, bro.

828
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,240
What the fuck was that?

829
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,360
- Is that root beer?

830
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,720
- Usually I have water, but I was really tired today

831
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,960
'cause I was working all day and then I had dinner

832
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,600
and I was like, I wanna be ready to record.

833
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,440
I need a little bit of caffeine.

834
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,000
And so now I got a poop jar.

835
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,840
I'm sorry.

836
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,660
- Nice.

837
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,940
- He definitely deserves mocking.

838
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,660
I'm so glad you called that out.

839
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,960
- That's an old Mayo joke.

840
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,220
(laughing)

841
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,700
I'm in a shape of that, man, I recognize that.

842
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,540
- I live in the hipster--

843
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,300
- It looks like a full poop type thing to me.

844
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,660
- So, what'd you get on the deck, Sam?

845
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,660
- Hipster's always drinking out of the Hellman's chair.

846
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,740
- 21.

847
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,800
- 21, okay, nice.

848
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,600
So this thing tries to grapple you,

849
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,820
and as it tries to grapple you,

850
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,300
you see like lightning starts to coil around its body,

851
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,340
but you're able to bust out of it before it does that.

852
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,060
- Because it sees my tree, it gets scared of my tree skin.

853
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,180
- It was like, ah, his tree skin!

854
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,220
And it just sort of--

855
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,140
- That's right, I'm a tree right now.

856
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,420
- You were right as fuck.

857
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,940
- Now the other two snakes,

858
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,260
they're going to try to attack you, Woody.

859
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,100
So let's see how they do.

860
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,220
- I'm gonna lay it on hands, I have the healing, I guess.

861
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,420
- Let me just--

862
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,260
- Forgot about that.

863
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,100
- I'll just, here, wait, I have an idea.

864
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,620
I'll die, 'cause I have one fucking HP.

865
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,220
- Yeah, people will be able to heal you.

866
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,540
This is what's gonna start happening.

867
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,380
We're at level five.

868
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,020
- Okay, so we just live in a fantasy world

869
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,860
- No, no, no.

870
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,680
- You can die.

871
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,520
- We don't die.

872
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,860
- You gotta work to failure, bro.

873
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,260
You gotta work to failure.

874
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,100
- That's right.

875
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,620
- I like that attitude.

876
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,700
- You gotta put your all into it.

877
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,520
- Yeah, you wouldn't fucking know.

878
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,860
- You gotta give yourself a zero HP.

879
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,380
- You wouldn't fucking know.

880
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,220
- No, this happened to me recently.

881
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,540
- Put me at zero.

882
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,300
Put me at zero.

883
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,700
- Cam, what did you say recently

884
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,520
where you were just like,

885
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,420
"I'm sorry, man, you aged out of this."

886
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,540
It was about nicotine patches.

887
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,180
- Oh, he asked what Zins were.

888
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,020
(laughing)

889
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,700
I said, "I'm sorry, buddy, you're old."

890
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,960
(laughing)

891
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,740
- I was like, how, how, how would zen?

892
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
What do you mean?

893
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,220
I didn't know at all.

894
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,260
- It was even worse.

895
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,300
We were playing a video game and someone had the username

896
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,000
like zen enjoyer or something and Patches was like,

897
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,500
zine enjoyer?

898
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,700
(laughing)

899
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,540
- These bitch.

900
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,620
- Oh my god.

901
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:30,500
- I haven't smoked since I was a mere babe.

902
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,420
- You don't smoke these you fucking moron.

903
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,620
- Well aren't they like a fucking,

904
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,260
are they like a patch, what are they?

905
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,020
- I showed you these, I popped them at your

906
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,620
Friendsgiving thing.

907
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,460
- Did you?

908
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,340
- Yeah.

909
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,700
- When did you do that, did you show me

910
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,180
or did you show somebody who was also old

911
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,020
and looked like me?

912
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,840
- I was showing you.

913
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,680
- No, no, no.

914
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,520
- You put it up there.

915
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,660
- Oh, it's like dip.

916
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,860
- It was, yeah.

917
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,220
- Yeah, but it's in a little pouch.

918
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,060
- But it's a pouch.

919
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,900
- That would have been way better than dip.

920
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,580
- Maybe I showed your brother.

921
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,120
- Might have shown my brother.

922
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,360
My brother loves dip.

923
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,100
Anyway, this guy did hurt you.

924
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,940
He has a dip, like salsa.

925
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,020
- Buffalo dip.

926
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,860
- Yeah.

927
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,740
- Yeah.

928
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,580
- That's true.

929
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,420
- Oh, that's what you're saying.

930
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,240
- Oh.

931
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,900
- Um, yeah, you're knocked out though, Caleb, by the way.

932
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,040
- Okay.

933
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,000
- Is that all right?

934
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,260
- That's right, bro, you work to failure.

935
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,100
Great fail.

936
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,380
- You work 'til you're knocked out.

937
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,980
You do reps until you get knocked out.

938
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,820
- Okay.

939
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,140
- Should I roll a death to the throat or no?

940
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,400
- You should now, yes.

941
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,500
- Oh, fuck, he's gonna die.

942
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,340
- He's gonna get it.

943
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,460
He's gonna get one. - 15, that's a success.

944
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,300
- All right, there we go.

945
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,660
- That's a failure, actually.

946
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,500
- Really?

947
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,340
Okay, then I failed.

948
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,740
- No, no, no, no, it's a success.

949
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,460
I like Woody.

950
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,560
He's a good character.

951
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,880
All right, okay.

952
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,080
Dogen, it's your turn.

953
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,700
So right now you have-- - Me?

954
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,100
- Yeah, you have Behave-Wa,

955
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,860
who's got a very weak, bloodied snake.

956
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,980
And then you got the two other ones

957
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,340
who are hovering over...

958
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,700
Woody's body.

959
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Can I do something really quick?

960
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,700
It's Baldur's Gate where if I heal him he just is back up?

961
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

962
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Okay, I'm gonna use my action, Lay on Hands, and I'm gonna heal 15 HP.

963
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Nice. Behave well, you get your 15 HP.

964
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
So now I'm at 15?

965
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Yeah, yeah. What did you see when you were towards the other side, Woody?

966
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
I saw my mom.

967
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
You saw your mom? She was dead too?

968
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,020
No, it was basically the exact same scene from the first episode.

969
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,220
Yeah, right, but just...

970
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,420
Love ya, mom!

971
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
Love you too!

972
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,980
So nice to see you again, mom.

973
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
You gotta get up!

974
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,200
I didn't see ya again, mom!

975
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,940
You gotta keep fighting, son!

976
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
I love you too!

977
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,740
Nah, I think I'll stay here right with you, mom.

978
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,740
Alright.

979
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Oh, what's that?

980
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
Oh!

981
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
No!

982
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
A healing touch.

983
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
Damn, put me back in, vibe.

984
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Put me back in, vibe!

985
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
What's that?

986
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
Oh, the Matrix.

987
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
I was gonna say, is that from The Matrix?

988
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,580
- Oh, the Matrix.

989
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,220
What's, I was gonna say, is that from the Matrix?

990
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,700
Who says put me back in?

991
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,780
- I think Neo does in the Matrix.

992
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,020
- Anyways, all right. - I think so.

993
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,180
- Anyway, you, the serpents are now up.

994
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,380
They're going after you, Dogen.

995
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,180
They've identified you as a problem.

996
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,820
- Oh, they're about to kill me for certain.

997
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,580
- Roll a dexterity saving throw.

998
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,460
- Okay.

999
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,100
That is a 15.

1000
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,260
- 15, okay. - That's a good roll.

1001
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,220
- Nice, yeah.

1002
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,100
Let me...

1003
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,060
Yep, yeah, you saved that.

1004
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,580
So you avoided them.

1005
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,140
One of them tried to do the grip thing that you--

1006
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,980
- Wow. - That you tried to do

1007
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,500
to Behave.Wa.

1008
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,140
And now another one's just gonna try to straight up

1009
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,060
attack you.

1010
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,620
And yeah, also missed.

1011
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,100
So-- - Nice.

1012
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
- So yeah, you managed to do that all right.

1013
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,820
And then Behave.Wa, this one's gonna try to attack you now.

1014
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,940
And it missed.

1015
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,320
Okay, you guys are back in this.

1016
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,580
- Guys, we're goaded.

1017
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh my God.

1018
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,680
- You're up.

1019
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,340
- So before I do anything,

1020
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,220
before I do anything,

1021
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,860
I turn to my two new best friends

1022
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,300
and I pick up this dead snake's body

1023
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,240
and I put it on my crotch

1024
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,940
and I look at them and I say,

1025
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,780
guys, look, it looks like my wiener.

1026
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,900
- If I had known that you were this type of guy,

1027
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,340
I would not have sat with you.

1028
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,420
- Kind of inappropriate.

1029
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,020
We're in the middle of a life or death situation here.

1030
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,460
Aren't you 15 years old?

1031
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,020
You're making up some joke about your penis.

1032
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
I'm 15 years old.

1033
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,900
I don't know any better.

1034
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,700
Seems a tad immature.

1035
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,180
You should know better at 15.

1036
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,700
At 15 I was writing novels.

1037
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,340
Are you a teenager too?

1038
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,140
I'm lying to him.

1039
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,820
I'm lying.

1040
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,340
I rolled deception to see if he believes me.

1041
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,740
I had antlers.

1042
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,780
Okay, I've just rolled...

1043
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,900
Trying to boost morale.

1044
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,060
I rolled a 12 on deception to try to lie to Andre the Papaw

1045
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,700
that I'm an author and that I wrote novels when I was 15.

1046
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,240
- Roll insight behavior.

1047
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,440
- I got an eight.

1048
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,040
- Okay, you think he's an author.

1049
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,300
- That's amazing.

1050
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,140
- You need to carry yourself with more self-respect.

1051
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,820
- I thought that I was gonna make you laugh,

1052
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,420
but what I did was actually make myself laugh.

1053
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,880
- All you've done is bought yourself a role

1054
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,060
as a laughing stock in my next book,

1055
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,880
"The Strange Teen."

1056
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,460
(laughing)

1057
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,340
- Oh, that makes me feel so weird.

1058
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,940
Oh no!

1059
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,660
and I do Eldritch Blast and it gets 10.

1060
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,500
- Okay, cool.

1061
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,700
- And it gets 10.

1062
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,660
- Okay, 10 is a miss. - Do I roll for damage or no?

1063
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,780
- No, 10 is a miss. - 10 is a miss.

1064
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,340
- But you should have-- - It really was not that cool.

1065
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,700
- You have multiple Eldritch Blasts though at level five.

1066
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,340
So I think you should have--

1067
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,020
- Eldritch Blast is so fire.

1068
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,040
Can I roll another one?

1069
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,700
- It's an incredible spell, yes.

1070
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,220
- I can roll another one right now?

1071
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,660
- I think all spells are incredible.

1072
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,500
- Oh my God, okay.

1073
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,980
- No, Eldritch Blast is really something else.

1074
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,980
- And I'm so embarrassed.

1075
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,320
I'm so embarrassed that the Eldritch Blast didn't work.

1076
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,900
- Number one spell in Baldur's Gate.

1077
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,400
- So I tried it again and it got an eight.

1078
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,100
- Okay, yeah, that also misses.

1079
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Warlocks kind of are like video game characters

1080
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
'cause they have like a shoot button

1081
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,220
that like never runs out of ammo.

1082
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
And then they have these new abilities.

1083
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,560
They're very like fun to play.

1084
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,400
No, you can only do two right now.

1085
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,460
- You can just use Eldritch Blast every turn.

1086
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,420
Like it doesn't take up a spell slot.

1087
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,500
- Yeah, and it takes two.

1088
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,060
Right now you have two, as you level up

1089
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,620
in the Warlock class, if you stay with that,

1090
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,900
you'll gain more Eldritch Blast.

1091
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,100
- You get five by level 12 or something.

1092
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,980
- Yeah, you get like-- - It's fire.

1093
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,520
- Yeah, you get three, I think, by level 12.

1094
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,120
Maybe more. - Five, I think.

1095
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,540
Just making it up.

1096
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,900
- No, yeah, you're gonna get three.

1097
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,020
I just checked again.

1098
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,440
- It's five. - So, interesting.

1099
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,280
You're up, Woody.

1100
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,940
- I am going to use Call Lightning again, I guess, man.

1101
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,380
Do I need to use a spell spell?

1102
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,680
- We'll add some spells for you after this.

1103
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,340
- Okay, should I use the spells for it?

1104
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,420
- Oh yeah, you're gonna need to

1105
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,220
because you definitely lost concentration,

1106
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,780
you know, 'cause you were knocked out.

1107
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,940
- From dying.

1108
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,380
- Yeah, dying will stop that.

1109
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,580
- Okay, I casted it.

1110
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,420
- Okay, they're gonna need to roll.

1111
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,540
- Will you roll for them?

1112
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,620
- Oh, I will, I am right now.

1113
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,900
- Thank you, bro.

1114
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,580
- Okay, one of them did save, the other one didn't,

1115
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,840
so roll for damage.

1116
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,820
The one that didn't though was the one with higher HP.

1117
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,420
13 nice they both just fucking explode

1118
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,420
All right, and now there's only one left

1119
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,420
Sight and it's by Andre behave wah you're up Dogan

1120
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:41,220
Okay, I'll just run over and hit it and also I'd like to issue an apology it is three

1121
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,260
It's not five. It's it's honestly cool as fuck that you manned up like that. I'm sorry

1122
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:53,460
I don't that's right not to make mistakes, but when I do I mean patches being correct. Yeah, right. I know so you still won

1123
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,780
You did so I got a am I still blessed

1124
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,860
I'm blessed

1125
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:07,180
Regardless you cast I cast blessed. Yeah, I cast a bless on everybody and you didn't get any take any damage yet, right?

1126
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
Like you have not

1127
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,460
No, I'm actually I did I think so. I'm not blessed anymore. No, I just should have I should have just I keep forgetting to do

1128
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:21,340
concentration because we're playing real D&D now. Just roll a d20 to see if you maintain

1129
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:28,100
concentration from before. Okay. Just con saving throw. A con saving throw? Okay, it's

1130
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,760
a four. Okay, yeah, so you didn't. I'm willing to bet I'm. Okay. Now my second attack, I

1131
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,900
roll a 13, so I don't think I'm hitting anything this turn. My bonus action, I'll shove. Nice,

1132
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,260
shove him, like in the video game. Yeah, I'm just going to be playing video game style from

1133
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:51,260
now on? Yeah, hasn't stopped you guys from throwing. Okay, my shove wasn't 8, plus 2,

1134
00:42:51,260 --> 00:43:00,100
10. Yeah, it doesn't shove him. It does the thing where it makes a shove sound but then

1135
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,220
they don't move. Yeah, they don't do anything. You do the animation and it goes "Oh!" Yeah,

1136
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,460
it sucks. But now this guy is going to try to attack you. He's going to play it simple.

1137
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,300
- He's pretty scared at this point.

1138
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,780
- Me?

1139
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,620
- Yeah, he misses.

1140
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,860
He's kind of like, he knows it's the end.

1141
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,900
You're up, Behave-Oi.

1142
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,980
- Okay, then I guess I am going to just--

1143
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,180
- Yeah, and I'll say Behave-Oi,

1144
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,460
from you talking with them,

1145
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,480
you can tell that this creature,

1146
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,260
while mindlessly devoted to the Serpent King,

1147
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,100
and whatever the Great One is,

1148
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,500
is shivering in its proverbial boots.

1149
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,340
- Yeah.

1150
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,600
- Yes, it is, yeah.

1151
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,440
There's one right next to me?

1152
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,280
Shake it.

1153
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,400
Okay, I grab it by the neck.

1154
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,680
Roll an attack roll.

1155
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,360
Like it'll be like a grapple.

1156
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,340
Okay, so strength?

1157
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,920
19.

1158
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,760
Yeah, you grab it by the neck.

1159
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,040
It's like Homer Bart style.

1160
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,720
It's like (imitates grunting)

1161
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,560
Homer Bart.

1162
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,880
Who do you work for?

1163
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,720
Roll intimidation with advantage.

1164
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,320
22, don't need to.

1165
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,160
Nice.

1166
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,400
You should roll again though.

1167
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,200
See if you crit or something.

1168
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,020
Nope.

1169
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,860
Okay.

1170
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,700
Dirty 22.

1171
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,200
Who do you work for?

1172
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Says, it says--

1173
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,160
I mean, wait, you already said that.

1174
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,640
The Sappid King.

1175
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,760
You said that earlier.

1176
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,560
(laughing)

1177
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,400
I'll let you get one more question in.

1178
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,140
Why do you work for him,

1179
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,780
And is there any reason why you're mad at us?

1180
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,860
It's a two part question.

1181
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,860
- Okay, I'm trying to think of how this guy

1182
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,700
would respond to that.

1183
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,240
- Wait a minute, why is the Serpent King mad at us?

1184
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,260
Oh wait, no, you said earlier

1185
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,460
'cause you're trying to find the one.

1186
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,140
Okay, then who's the one?

1187
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,320
- The boy who lived.

1188
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,420
- Says, he said, okay, yeah, I think with 22,

1189
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,260
let's see what he goes.

1190
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,100
- Wait, is it Dogon?

1191
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Wait, I already knew that. Okay.

1192
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Um...

1193
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,100
Uhhhh...

1194
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,100
Wait a minute!

1195
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,100
He says, Lurks...

1196
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,100
I don't have much time to answer my question!

1197
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,100
He says, Lurks...

1198
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,100
He says, Lurks...

1199
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
Uhhhh...

1200
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
You're just sputtering in beast speech.

1201
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
You're just sputtering in beast speech.

1202
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,100
Like you're hissing at another...

1203
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
Hissing at a snake, all upset.

1204
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
That's what it looks like.

1205
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,360
(laughter)

1206
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,200
- Yeah.

1207
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,340
- When it's translated.

1208
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,060
- It's like goth kid freaks out.

1209
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:40,900
Like, um.

1210
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,460
- Yeah, when it's translated, it's just like,

1211
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,460
wait, wait, I forgot, I forgot the question.

1212
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,820
- But yeah, he says,

1213
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,260
the one that lurks below the earth.

1214
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,960
And then, um, that's all it seems to know.

1215
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,120
(silence)

1216
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,760
- The one that lurks below the earth.

1217
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,720
- Wait, the what?

1218
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,280
If he's talking about the chosen one,

1219
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,360
he might be talking about me.

1220
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,760
I've always thought I was the chosen one,

1221
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,200
ever since I noticed this lightning bolt scar.

1222
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,040
- Is he the chosen one?

1223
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,520
- And I pulled down my tunic a little bit

1224
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,760
and showed the trunk of my dick

1225
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,040
and there's a lightning bolt scar right on it.

1226
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,700
- Does the snake react to this?

1227
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,720
- Like it's just barely the trunk,

1228
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,560
you know what I mean?

1229
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,680
Like an Instagram type pic.

1230
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,520
- Pete Wentz style right there.

1231
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,720
- And the bald head's still allowed online.

1232
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,560
- Yeah.

1233
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,380
- Yeah.

1234
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,220
- And I'm baldly shaven.

1235
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,960
- Yeah, you see the snake's--

1236
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,320
- Nice chop job downstairs.

1237
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,640
- And you can tell that it's shaved,

1238
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,960
and you can tell that it's shaved

1239
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,100
and that I'm not just bald there

1240
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,000
because there's a lot of hair surrounding it.

1241
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,840
- A lot of ingrown hairs.

1242
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,040
- And you can clearly see a circle when it's shaved.

1243
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,280
(laughing)

1244
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,320
- The snake's eyes widen when it sees the trunk of your dick.

1245
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,980
- Ew.

1246
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,760
- Okay, out of context, that sounds fucking crazy.

1247
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,300
- The snake's eyes widen when he sees the trunk of your dick?

1248
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,140
(laughing)

1249
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,480
- Maybe he thinks it's another damn snake due to its size.

1250
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,620
- True, damn.

1251
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,460
- Jeez.

1252
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,560
- Yeah, he says, "Big brother!"

1253
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,520
Is what it says.

1254
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,360
- Big brother?

1255
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,320
- Whoa!

1256
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,160
- Nice, daddy!

1257
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,000
- Damn!

1258
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,200
- Very nice!

1259
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,440
(laughing)

1260
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,880
- You're literally goblin-sized,

1261
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,680
so that thing's the size of a human.

1262
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,320
You're just riding a fucking dune-ass worm.

1263
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,000
- No, no, no, no, no.

1264
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,860
The snake is, the snake's eyes do widen.

1265
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,760
And--

1266
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,820
- Like what you see, snake.

1267
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,660
- And--

1268
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,480
- Ew.

1269
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,760
- And he says, he says,

1270
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,760
"You will help us bring him back."

1271
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,000
- Wait, who, me?

1272
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,960
- No. - Him?

1273
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,560
- You fucking, no.

1274
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,680
Like, it's just like--

1275
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,520
- Huh?

1276
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Yeah and he just starts smothering and spitting and then...

1277
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
Oh my bad!

1278
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,520
He's just choking him.

1279
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,520
Oh did you just snap his neck?

1280
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Yeah.

1281
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Okay cool.

1282
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
Sorry.

1283
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:25,520
And after that happens, the water rumbles more and you see five more come out of the water.

1284
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
I ain't doing this shit, man.

1285
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,520
And, but right on cue, who returns, the professor Quammen,

1286
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:40,820
who comes back and he goes like,

1287
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,240
(yells)

1288
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,200
and out from his hand comes like a chain lightning

1289
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,840
that connects to all the snakes

1290
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,540
and they all just like fucking pop.

1291
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,960
Wow.

1292
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,040
And he turns to you all and he says,

1293
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,600
you did good work there, gang.

1294
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,000
Thank you.

1295
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,920
- Yay, we did good work.

1296
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,760
- I...

1297
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,640
Seems like, and then I, about 15 seconds after that,

1298
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,480
I pull my pants back up.

1299
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,680
- Well, we have another class to give to you, so.

1300
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,520
- No, I'm not.

1301
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,280
- See ya, catch you on the flip side.

1302
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,540
- Hold on, hold on.

1303
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,460
That damn Serpent King is a problem.

1304
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,200
Did the headmaster eat your pussy up,

1305
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,760
tell you guys about it at all?

1306
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,400
- Did the headmaster eat my pussy up?

1307
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,760
- What the hell are you on about?

1308
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,840
What kind of a question is that to ask a student?

1309
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,440
Maybe you forgot I'm not a teacher anymore.

1310
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,640
You can't say stuff to me like that anymore.

1311
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,640
- You said stuff like that to everybody, Dogen.

1312
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,640
- Okay, part of my class, first of all.

1313
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,420
And second of all, it was, no, I didn't.

1314
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:54,740
- And yeah, you see one of the largest crystal

1315
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,900
that floats above the De Ministrone, the main building,

1316
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,420
is glowing and all of you hear telepathically in your heads,

1317
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,340
similar to how I described for Marlon Reese

1318
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,180
in the beginning.

1319
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,900
- Telepathically in our heads, okay.

1320
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,740
- Okay.

1321
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,520
You talk, you talk!

1322
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,540
You try talking.

1323
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,620
- No, I was just double checking.

1324
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,560
Telepathically, check.

1325
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,940
Oh, in our heads, okay.

1326
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,180
All right, go ahead.

1327
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,700
- And you hear, oh,

1328
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,500
- We hear, oh, we hear it, wait, we hear it now?

1329
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,420
- Wait, so we hear it in our ears?

1330
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:31,140
- Did you know that eyes are part of the brain?

1331
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,540
- I figured that out on my own.

1332
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,380
- It's the ocular--

1333
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,660
- That was the person who said that first.

1334
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,500
- Getting upset?

1335
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,700
- Really?

1336
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,980
- Okay, so we hear it--

1337
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,620
- My new tactic is to cry when you guys bully me.

1338
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,460
See what happens.

1339
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,380
(laughing)

1340
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,460
- That was fun.

1341
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,300
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

1342
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,580
But no, yeah, you hear the headmaster eat your pussy up say,

1343
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,420
- All students. - Do we hear the headmaster

1344
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,140
eat our pussy up?

1345
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,660
- Do you even mean yourself?

1346
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,640
- We wish we could hear what you're saying right now.

1347
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,100
- Please return to the De Ministrone

1348
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,220
for an emergency assembly.

1349
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,340
- Okay. - Okay.

1350
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,580
- And you guys ready to play the penis game at the assembly?

1351
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,140
- Professor Kwaman, and he goes,

1352
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,980
"About damn time." - Penis.

1353
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,540
- All right, let's go.

1354
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,060
And yeah, you guys can go there.

1355
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,660
- You do go there maybe?

1356
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,820
It's up to you.

1357
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,340
You guys can skip.

1358
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,180
But yeah.

1359
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,340
- Oh yeah, I guess I'll go.

1360
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,900
- So you see there, and from when you first went there,

1361
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,480
you had all the students there,

1362
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,100
but they were all sitting amongst the tables.

1363
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,720
Now they're kind of just all gathered in ad hoc.

1364
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,340
And Mr. Eat Your Pussy Up,

1365
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,220
or Headmaster Eat Your Pussy Up says,

1366
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,420
thank you all for attending this emergency assembly.

1367
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:51,800
The safety of the students who pay such a handsome tuition

1368
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,840
is of utmost importance to me.

1369
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,640
It's true that the Serpent King

1370
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,680
has been attacking us for some time.

1371
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,360
- Okay.

1372
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,040
- Well, that's interesting, isn't it?

1373
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,880
- Sounds good.

1374
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,480
- I lost my place.

1375
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,480
- Penis!

1376
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,000
- With his abominable winged serp--

1377
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,200
- Penis!

1378
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,320
- It has been-- - Penis!

1379
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,520
- Penis!

1380
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,360
- Penis!

1381
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,200
- Who's playing the penis game?

1382
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,360
- His thaumaturgy, and I say penis so loud

1383
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,660
that it's chandeliers start dropping from the ceiling.

1384
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,980
- You see his students start to laugh.

1385
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,580
- We're battling in thaumaturgy penis game

1386
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,820
because I also, I realize just now,

1387
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,420
I also have thaumaturgy.

1388
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,820
- Just not how you play the, just say it louder.

1389
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,660
- Penis.

1390
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,460
- What do you mean, that's how you play it,

1391
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,740
you say it louder.

1392
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,180
- I'm saying it in the lowest vibrational--

1393
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,840
- What kind of penis, oh, maybe you played

1394
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,660
some kind of weird penis game with your friends

1395
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,500
back in the--

1396
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,340
- Say it louder.

1397
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,180
- When you were in school.

1398
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,020
(laughing)

1399
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:46,860
- Fuck off.

1400
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,180
- Penis game for him was something completely different.

1401
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,180
hot you know you know it's a leap over

1402
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,220
uh...

1403
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,820
the government of the first thing with my pet without a way to get you guys

1404
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,940

1405
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,660

1406
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,780
so i i i am a blue

1407
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,420

1408
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:11,500
did you guys figure pet rocks so that would be a good uh...

1409
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500

1410
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,220
now i mean a bit if it's too

1411
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,580
i'm not explain i know the pocket it is game

1412
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,060
- Oh, I'm so flustered!

1413
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,540
(laughing)

1414
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,900
- That's how it's done, y'all.

1415
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,740
Crying once there.

1416
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,940
- Now we get, we get five points.

1417
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,540
- Yeah, yeah, you guys get five points.

1418
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,260
- Five points to House Giant.

1419
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,140
- Five points for House Giant, that's huge.

1420
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,460
- Wait, does this campaign have a point system

1421
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,740
for the houses?

1422
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,760
- Yeah, that's part of what the classes are.

1423
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,660
You guys drive around the classes.

1424
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,540
- But like, you know when they say

1425
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,540
five points to Gryffindor?

1426
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,380
- Yeah.

1427
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,220
- I can add that.

1428
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,060
- Can you add that?

1429
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,620
I just really want that right now, I really do.

1430
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,460
- Yeah.

1431
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,620
- The more we play this, I'm realizing

1432
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,180
I just literally want to be exactly in Harry Potter,

1433
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,220
just completely one to one.

1434
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,060
- All right, I could try to add that.

1435
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,180
- Me too, I love Harry Potter.

1436
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,740
- There's certain things I'm trying to add over time,

1437
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,700
so I will add that.

1438
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,460
- Just whatever house at the end gets the most points

1439
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,660
gets a pizza party, maybe.

1440
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,900
- Yes!

1441
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,980
- Pizza party would be so good.

1442
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,820
- In real life.

1443
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,900
- It has been rather unpleasurable.

1444
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,580
Just give it to just me, if any of the other houses win.

1445
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,020
(laughing)

1446
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:22,260
It has been rather unpleasurable to say the least, but our best minds are working to solve

1447
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,260
the case.

1448
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:29,800
We've employed the renowned Nimrod Hunters as well to assist in fighting the scourge

1449
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,080
of winged serpents, and there should be no change in schooling activity.

1450
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:41,260
As I said during the sorting ceremony, our pleasure shall not be denied.

1451
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:46,340
I would ask that all students, when crossing the De Ministrone Pond, to just be wary of

1452
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,820
the waters.

1453
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,380
This is where the Serpent King appears to reside.

1454
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,460
I'd recommend you mind your crystals, since he appears to be chasing those as well.

1455
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:01,020
We'll be stationing additional magical security via the Lord Poonhead, head pleasureman from

1456
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:06,500
Trebuchet Village, who has generously offered some of his finest pleasuremen at a discounted

1457
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,200
rate.

1458
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,960
And my dog, my attack dog too, will be helping.

1459
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
Fido.

1460
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,040
Now, please students, I'd ask that you retire to your dormitories for the day.

1461
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:24,400
Tomorrow, after all, is the weekend, and there is a tremendous amount of pleasure to be had.

1462
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Hooray, the weekend!

1463
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,280
I hear all the secrets that you keep.

1464
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,600
And um, and uh, yeah, so.

1465
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,100
♪ I'm a big, common baby ♪

1466
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,480
- You're just singing as students start to file out.

1467
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,520
And one of them, Regatta Reese,

1468
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,360
who you had seen earlier with her matadier.

1469
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,120
- Hello, Regatta Reese.

1470
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,480
- She's like a seventh year student,

1471
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,080
so she's an over student. - Hello.

1472
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,480
- And she goes up to you, Dogen,

1473
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,480
and she says, "Pardon me, Professor, well, Student Dogen."

1474
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,520
- Yeah, it's Student Dogen now.

1475
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,760
- Sorry for being so presumptuous,

1476
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,360
But I've always wanted to ask you this, since you're a dirt goblin.

1477
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,760
Um, I don't know if you know, but I was recently placed-

1478
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,260
She's gonna ask you if you're single.

1479
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,060
I was recently-

1480
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,460
You can't see my scar.

1481
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,760
Oh, I didn't even know about-

1482
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,260
You can't see it.

1483
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,760
-any scar that you had.

1484
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,760
Well, now you have to shower!

1485
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,760
He's got a scar on his worm.

1486
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,660
I just wanted to ask that I'll be working for a lord in the dirtlands after I graduate this year,

1487
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,460
and I was just hoping I could ask you some questions

1488
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,960
about your time there.

1489
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,460
(Dogan groans)

1490
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,180
So, and this is also a question for you, Dogan.

1491
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,660
So, you obviously hung out with the guys

1492
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,940
in Trebuchet Village, that's where you were.

1493
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,380
Not just 'cause you're a dirt god one,

1494
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,820
it doesn't mean you were ever from the Dirtlands,

1495
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,900
but the Dirtlands are, I would say as far as like--

1496
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,940
- Dirtlands being bad?

1497
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,380
- As far as regions that I've developed,

1498
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,860
like it's more underdeveloped,

1499
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,260
like as far as my lore goes.

1500
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,500
So like, you have a lot of say here

1501
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,340
as far as what it looks like.

1502
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,260
I kind of always saw it as sort of

1503
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,820
dune-esque sort of area, Arrakis kind of vibes.

1504
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,620
- Yeah, it's dune, but instead of sand, it's dirt.

1505
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,460
- It's dirt, yeah.

1506
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,080
That's kind of how I saw it.

1507
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,700
- And instead of just, instead of like, you know,

1508
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,340
the Fremen walking around, it's like,

1509
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,020
like instead of like mystical people

1510
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,940
in like robes and cloaks and stuff,

1511
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,140
it's just guys walking around with no shirts on.

1512
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,700
- Yeah, it's just nasty goblins in shorts.

1513
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,980
- Goblins in shorts all walking around.

1514
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,020
And it's also, there's no dunes, it's completely flat.

1515
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,060
The entire thing is completely flat,

1516
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,020
so you can see from one end to the other.

1517
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,260
You can see literally everybody who lives in the Dirtlands.

1518
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,500
You can see them at all times,

1519
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,620
'cause there's no houses or anything.

1520
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,820
So you can just look 360 degrees around you,

1521
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,980
you can count, so everybody knows

1522
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,340
whenever anything happens,

1523
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,180
because everyone can see each other.

1524
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,020
- I like that.

1525
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,340
Yeah, I think, 'cause Dogen the Dirt God

1526
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,600
is one of the major gods in the Pantheon.

1527
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:08,140
And he's major enough that he has his own

1528
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,340
sort of region devoted to him and his own,

1529
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,180
there's lords who worship him.

1530
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:16,460
And Dogen, obviously-- - Yeah, he is a god, huh?

1531
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,180
- Yeah, so, well, not him.

1532
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,460
Dogen the Dirt God, he was named after the Dirt God.

1533
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,820
- Oh, right, right, right.

1534
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,360
- But you've sort of fallen out of favor

1535
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,140
with the Dirt God now, or you're not as much of a fan--

1536
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,320
- Yeah, I rejected him.

1537
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,160
- So I don't know if you want to talk to her about this.

1538
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,660
- I broke my oath.

1539
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,160
- Because he made me eat dirt.

1540
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,420
Basically the dirt lines suck dick

1541
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,260
and they fucking suck--

1542
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,980
- Are you an Oreo guy now?

1543
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,900
- No, now I'm a student of knowledge.

1544
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,580
- What happens to Oreos now?

1545
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,420
- I was Oreos for a while.

1546
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,260
- His dirt is now books.

1547
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,160
- I went from dirt to water to Oreo and now it's pencil.

1548
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,260
I'm joking, the diploma got me.

1549
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,980
- I forgot you had an Oreo thing.

1550
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,660
- Yeah, it was a spoon, remember?

1551
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,420
- Yeah, I remember, yeah.

1552
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,260
- Anyway.

1553
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,220
- I guess I know, you know, actually I would do a thing

1554
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,740
where everyone does about their hometown

1555
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,940
where they're like, yeah, I guess like,

1556
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,060
I guess it like sucks pretty bad.

1557
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,340
I can understand, people don't like it

1558
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,100
and I can understand that, but like,

1559
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,300
being from there just has like such nostalgia for me

1560
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,940
that I just like can't like bring myself to hate it.

1561
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,100
- That's really interesting.

1562
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:22,780
Did you ever study any dirt magics while you were there?

1563
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:27,660
- Yeah, I was basically number one in the world.

1564
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,860
- Yeah, world deception.

1565
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,140
(laughing)

1566
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,000
- I was number one in the world.

1567
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,180
- Number one in the world.

1568
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,020
That's an eight.

1569
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,500
- Okay, she's gotta be real polite.

1570
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,920
Just sorta like nod.

1571
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,700
Roll insight to see if you can tell

1572
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,220
that she's now doing it using deception.

1573
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,860
- Okay, that's an 11.

1574
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,780
- Okay, let me roll deception for her.

1575
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,140
She has kinda mediocre charisma.

1576
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,980
It's a little bit better than real life Hermione.

1577
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,300
- Wow.

1578
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,560
- Real life Hermione.

1579
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,420
Yeah, you simply can't tell.

1580
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,340
- Real life Hermione.

1581
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,100
- That she's being polite.

1582
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,020
She's like, "Wow, number one in the world."

1583
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,740
- I think she's buying it, and I'm like,

1584
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,620
"Yeah, and by world, I mean universe.

1585
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,580
(laughing)

1586
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,420
Number one."

1587
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,080
I mean, number one still.

1588
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:22,940
- Well, tomorrow I know that it's the weekend,

1589
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,580
and I know you guys are first year students.

1590
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,400
I'd be happy to help take you guys around the Academy of Town

1591
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,860
and take you to some of the shops

1592
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,800
and just show you guys around,

1593
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,640
at least for the two newer friends here.

1594
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,320
- Oh yeah, you would like shopping.

1595
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,700
I mean, I like shopping, or we like shopping.

1596
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,200
No, I'm number one at shopping in the world.

1597
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,440
(laughing)

1598
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,940
- Just then, you see one of the delivery flies.

1599
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,180
So usually the students will get their mail through bugs

1600
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,740
that fly in and carry letters.

1601
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:02,740
And so one of them's carrying a letter and as customary, it collapses on the table, dies,

1602
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:12,740
and emits a message that's enchanted. It says, "Dogan, it's me, Condoleezza. Read the letter.

1603
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,740
Thanks!"

1604
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,740
That's a short ass letter.

1605
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,020
"Hello, bug."

1606
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:22,740
And then the bug is dead. The bug is dead.

1607
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:23,740
"Hello, bug."

1608
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:24,740
Okay, sure.

1609
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,740
- Can I stabilize the bug? - We're going in.

1610
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,740
- Margotta says, "Well, I'm also in the House of Giants,

1611
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,740
"so if you guys want to go tomorrow, just let me know,

1612
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,740
"and I'll see you guys there."

1613
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,740
And she waves to you, all three of you.

1614
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,740
- Not if we see you first!

1615
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,740
- And I just remembered something just now,

1616
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,740
so I'm gonna do that.

1617
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,740
I say, "Quadra Mudmarks, make a note of this

1618
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,740
"so we remember to do it."

1619
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,740
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

1620
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,740
We'll make as many notes as you need me to make.

1621
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,740
- Wait, is he a full assistant to us?

1622
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,740
- He's a seer. - Quadra--

1623
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,740
He's a serial killer.

1624
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,700
That's what Patches told me.

1625
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,700
Basically yeah.

1626
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,820
He's basically you can telepathically communicate with him anytime.

1627
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,420
Or take him around with you if you want.

1628
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,300
Quadro Mudmarks do you know anything about this...

1629
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,300
She's standing right here.

1630
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,060
Quadro Mudmarks do you know anything about this weird bitch?

1631
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,140
I actually might have written something.

1632
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:14,500
I wrote so many things for Quadro Mudmarks.

1633
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,140
This is my assistant Quadro Mudmarks.

1634
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,140
He's in your head right now.

1635
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,140
I guess you guys wouldn't know him.

1636
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,500
Quadro Mudmarks play smooth jazz.

1637
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,500
Play gothic music.

1638
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,500
Play smooth jazz.

1639
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,500
Play the smoothest jazz.

1640
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,500
I don't even know what a jazz is.

1641
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
Yeah, you're an uncultured lout. That's what you are.

1642
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
I mean you hear honk honk.

1643
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
I quite like these mud men.

1644
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
Quadro Mudmarks,

1645
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
can you play gothic music?

1646
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Maybe you can show me

1647
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
a little bit of what it sounds like first.

1648
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
I mean I could try it for myself.

1649
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
Oh boy, here we go.

1650
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,780
(laughing)

1651
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:51,620
Worth the price of admission though, I bet.

1652
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,860
- I can't think of anything.

1653
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,040
I can't think of anything right now.

1654
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:01,660
I'm nervous 'cause you want me to sing.

1655
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,100
- Look, I don't know anything about this dame,

1656
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,260
but you know, she seems nice enough, okay?

1657
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,860
- Do you have any games on you, Quadrant?

1658
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,660
- Why don't you read the letter that Condoleezza,

1659
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,500
why don't you read the letter

1660
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,060
that Condoleezza Carlos sent you?

1661
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,220
He's my master too, after all.

1662
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,580
- Do you have any games I can play on you?

1663
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,760
- Okay, I'll read the letter. - Yeah, for sure.

1664
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,400
Do you wanna read Bubble Pop?

1665
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,740
- Harpo's Honk Simulator.

1666
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,240
(laughing)

1667
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,160
- Oh, I wanna read Poppy Jump.

1668
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,080
- The letter just says,

1669
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,360
"Dogan, when you return to your dormitory,

1670
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,200
"we must speak in private,

1671
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,500
"but you can bring your new friends.

1672
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,320
"Go directly to Mud Marks."

1673
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,720
- Let's go. - Hello, Mud Marks.

1674
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,200
- All right, let's go.

1675
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,560
- Okay, so you guys climb the chutes and ladders

1676
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,040
up back to the house of giants.

1677
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,200
You see Mud Marks just standing by the fire,

1678
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,080
doing a little bit of a routine.

1679
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,480
- Don't get too close to that fire,

1680
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,840
you're gonna bake yourself dry.

1681
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,680
- That's what I tried to tell him.

1682
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,640
- Water is an important part of mud.

1683
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,960
- But I'm so cold.

1684
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,900
- You're not cold, you're barely even a living thing.

1685
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,760
You don't have nerves.

1686
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,080
- Yeah, but you got some nerve talking to me that way,

1687
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,320
I'll tell you that, pal.

1688
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,160
I got more heart.

1689
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:11,980
- Oh, you're getting an attitude,

1690
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,040
and you keep talking like that,

1691
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,880
I'm gonna take off one of your heads.

1692
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,720
- Good. - You like your brothers,

1693
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,540
don't you?

1694
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,920
You like your brothers, don't you?

1695
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,720
- I like 'em all right.

1696
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,140
- Okay, well we'll see how you feel

1697
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,800
when one of 'em's dead in a ditch.

1698
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:27,800
- Now you're kinda talking like a Mod Marks.

1699
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,240
- I do, now anytime I'm around them,

1700
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,600
I always end up like this.

1701
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,480
Say.

1702
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,240
- So one of the arms, so the four heads on there

1703
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:40,240
are Mark's, Groucho, Zeppo, Harpo, and Chico.

1704
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,880
Zeppo is just like dead, but you see one of the arms

1705
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,120
grab Zeppo's head and rattle it.

1706
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,880
And then Zeppo's head starts to rattle

1707
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,740
and his eyes turn white.

1708
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:56,740
And a like beam of light emits from his eyes at you guys.

1709
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:01,180
And you find yourselves in the tower,

1710
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:04,380
in the lighthouse of Condoleezza Carlo.

1711
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,960
The one that only Dogen would really know what this is.

1712
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,880
But in the Port Los Berry Berry town,

1713
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,080
when you guys met Condoleezza Carlo,

1714
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,180
you were in the market,

1715
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:18,420
He talked with some of his black market representatives there, and he brought you to this lighthouse

1716
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:24,220
where he watches ships crash and then has his men sit down and rob them.

1717
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:31,220
And you see him looking at a massive scale telescope towards the sky.

1718
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,220
You see Condoleezza Carlo.

1719
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:36,020
To remind you guys what he looks like, he sort of looks like, in Harry Potter terms,

1720
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,020
he's kind of like Gilderoy Lockhart.

1721
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:42,020
He's like sort of blonde, handsome.

1722
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:47,060
You see him looking at the telescope, he goes, "Yep, that's the sky alright."

1723
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,020
And he turns and faces you guys.

1724
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,300
He says, "Dogen!"

1725
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:57,020
And I believe you're Woody, right?

1726
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,320
"Aye."

1727
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,700
And that's Andre, right?

1728
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,700
"Beh-heh-wah."

1729
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,660
Oh, don't be so shy, lad.

1730
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,660
There you go.

1731
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,660
"Hello."

1732
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,300
I hope you guys have been getting along well at school.

1733
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,340
- How's school, how's it been going?

1734
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,340
- I'm new to school.

1735
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,980
- It's okay, it's okay.

1736
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,620
Hey, Andre, it's okay.

1737
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,460
- We're all new.

1738
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,700
- He's a friend, he's a friend.

1739
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,540
- We're all new.

1740
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:23,820
- Yes, yes. - Well, I'm not new.

1741
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,020
- Look, and I'm sorry, Dogen.

1742
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,780
I should have told you

1743
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,640
that there was no sexual studies course,

1744
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,980
but in my defense, you were very, very depressed

1745
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,100
after all your friends died,

1746
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,820
and I felt like it would have been wrong

1747
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,380
to say no, not to pursue it.

1748
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:37,700
You know, you just seemed so excited

1749
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,340
to teach the kids about sex,

1750
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,180
and I just didn't want to take that from you.

1751
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:44,420
Well, it's coming back. I they it's coming back. That's all I'm gonna say keep your eyes open

1752
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:49,620
Hey, if you can make that work, you let me know. I'll pull some strings as well. Okay, I hope

1753
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,840
For what

1754
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
What kind of strings are you gonna pull?

1755
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,960
What do you mean? That's that classic humor dog and I miss you man. You know, you're funny guy

1756
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:08,420
Well, anyway, I hope I

1757
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:11,340
- Hello, my name is Andre Behavoir.

1758
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,180
I am 15.

1759
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,460
- Every time he goes to a new place.

1760
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:22,380
- I am 15 feet tall and I am 15 years old.

1761
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:29,100
I am currently in school.

1762
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,740
- Oh, it looks like you updated it since last time.

1763
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,220
- He's reading the essay he wrote for his class.

1764
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,420
Just let him read it.

1765
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,260
- Okay.

1766
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,100
- He's really proud of it.

1767
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,580
- Okay. - It's a memoir.

1768
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,420
It's a memoir.

1769
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,220
- Memoir.

1770
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:45,380
Keep going, Andre.

1771
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:48,940
- Memoir is my cousin's last name.

1772
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,580
- That's a good one, Andre.

1773
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:55,300
- I have a cousin named Andre Memoir.

1774
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,500
(laughing)

1775
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,540
- That would have been pretty good too, yeah.

1776
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,580
So anything else?

1777
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,540
Or is that sort of where you're at right now with the essay?

1778
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:05,620
- Look what I can do.

1779
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,760
- What does he do?

1780
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,400
(laughing)

1781
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,680
- He rolled Eldritch Blast damage.

1782
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,840
(laughing)

1783
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,680
- Oh shit.

1784
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,920
- He rolled an attack, he did an Eldritch Blast.

1785
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,480
- I did an Eldritch, I did three Eldritch Blasts.

1786
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,320
- Okay.

1787
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,360
- And one of them's a 22.

1788
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,760
- So--

1789
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,120
- I'm not aiming at him, I'm just aiming around the room.

1790
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,920
- Yeah, no, I mean it shoots out,

1791
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,520
it shoots out and just like dissipates

1792
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,920
before it hits anything, you know.

1793
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,880
He has this place charmed out the ass.

1794
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,240
He says, "Yo, I am disappointed you fellas didn't get in the house Kaiju Manji.

1795
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,600
That was my house when I was at the academy."

1796
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,600
And you know-

1797
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,600
That house sucks dick.

1798
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,760
Well, you know, there's been some accusations, but nothing ever really came out about that.

1799
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,880
About that it sucks, that you suck dick, that's the accusation?

1800
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,960
No, not me, but activity in the house.

1801
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,320
Is everyone you ever knew?

1802
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,320
Yeah, pretty much.

1803
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,040
Everyone except you sucks dick in your house.

1804
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:09,100
So wait someone made an accusation they said everyone in the house sucks dick except this guy

1805
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:18,240
Because that kind of throws maybe more concern about you doesn't really it doesn't really seem like

1806
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:25,840
Logic of the whole scenario

1807
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:32,760
So all right, we're gonna you guys are you guys are funny. I got to give you that you're very funny and

1808
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,880
And look, I appreciate it.

1809
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,120
I just wish you were there.

1810
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,800
Gaston was a big fan of you, Dogen.

1811
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,760
He thought you had a great aptitude for the magics.

1812
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,640
But I want to--

1813
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,360
after recent events, from what I understand,

1814
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,520
I want to be clear here.

1815
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:55,440
Now, Mr. Eat Your Pussy Up, he's a very smart guy.

1816
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,200
Very smart for a pleasure man, especially.

1817
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,240
And a very inappropriate headmaster.

1818
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,440
And he's right to be concerned about the Serpent King.

1819
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,880
seen his winged serpents, you know, crop up along the Beriberi coast.

1820
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,320
Speaking of coast, uh, ah, Sherman, you guys remember Sherman?

1821
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,600
He was a little bit Condoleezza Carlos assistant who was British and had a stutter.

1822
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,760
And he says, Oh, good, good.

1823
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,800
Good to see you, Dogan.

1824
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,520
The last ship.

1825
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,120
I don't remember you.

1826
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,120
Oh, it's I'm apologize.

1827
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,400
Um, apologize.

1828
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,120
But thank you.

1829
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,520
I accept your apology.

1830
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,440
He said, sorry, a lot and stuttered a lot.

1831
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:38,440
So you cuz the last ship crashed had some gold and kind of Lisa Carla goes wonderful gifts for our friends here, okay?

1832
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:43,200
Hey guys, you're going out this weekend. How does 500 gold piece for each of you sound?

1833
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,240
Yeah

1834
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:51,280
Yeah, so he gives you guys 500 gold. So you'll add that add that to your inventory. Whoa this

1835
01:10:51,280 --> 01:11:00,720
Wait are you bribing us to do something is this a bribe? No. No, it's not a chicken mancha. We don't take coin leader bribes

1836
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,200
- We're friends, we're friends.

1837
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,880
- Chicken muncha.

1838
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,560
- What does that mean?

1839
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,400
Wait, I'm gonna start using that.

1840
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,600
- It says I have 1,015 gold pieces, do I still have that?

1841
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,440
- Yeah, add another 500.

1842
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,440
- Okay.

1843
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,720
- Where's my gold?

1844
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,560
- It's in inventory, and then there's a button for it.

1845
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,320
- Wait, I have a tattoo.

1846
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,280
- What?

1847
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,600
- Under my other possessions,

1848
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,760
it says a tattoo or other body marker.

1849
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,760
(laughing)

1850
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,320
- You have a tattoo in your inventory?

1851
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,500
- Yeah, I have a tattoo in my inventory.

1852
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,340
- What is it of?

1853
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,860
- Oh, you better decide when to use it.

1854
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,480
- I'll figure out what it is next.

1855
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,380
It'll come up next game.

1856
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,440
- I wonder if Goliaths have tattoo

1857
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,360
and the tattoos in the lore of 5e and that's why.

1858
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,200
- Yeah, I don't know.

1859
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,600
I don't know why I-- - I think they do.

1860
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,440
They do.

1861
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,260
They have-- - Oh, pretty funny.

1862
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,100
- They're all like--

1863
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,560
- To put it in your inventory too.

1864
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,920
- Yeah. - That's where you store

1865
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,760
that information. - Well, I have no gold

1866
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,580
in my inventory.

1867
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,160
- Yeah, I had 15 gold.

1868
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,660
- Now he gives you 500. - I have none.

1869
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,580
Now you've off at 500 before you go shopping.

1870
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,280
- Well you have to put it in my inventory.

1871
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,500
Oh wait, nevermind, there it is.

1872
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,800
- Look, headmaster eat your pussy up

1873
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,600
is right to be concerned about the Serpent King,

1874
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,380
but he's wrong about where the Serpent King resides.

1875
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:16,400
- The lake. - I see his reasoning

1876
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,620
for thinking so.

1877
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:21,520
He thinks it's in the sea.

1878
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,940
That's right, and it makes sense.

1879
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,600
But he's in fact very much a humanoid creature

1880
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,900
that lives amongst us.

1881
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,460
lives amongst the academy. - Voldemort.

1882
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:35,580
- Now, maybe Voldemort, but where he lives, I don't know.

1883
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,780
I've had my scouts trace much

1884
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,140
of the winged serpent activities,

1885
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,540
and all I know is that he either lives

1886
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,040
within the academy town,

1887
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,960
or at least frequents it quite often.

1888
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,780
I don't mean to put a strain on your weekend,

1889
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,860
but I'd like it if the three of you investigated

1890
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,340
the whereabouts of the Serpent King just a little bit,

1891
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,200
just to get started, nothing too obvious,

1892
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,900
you don't want to tip him off.

1893
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,820
Ask around, head to local haunts,

1894
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,340
try to gather some leads.

1895
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,300
My fear as a Serpent King is somehow connected

1896
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,780
to a growing resentment the Academy Town,

1897
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:09,260
for the Academy, inside the Academy Town.

1898
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,060
I've seen some of this in Port Los Beriberi.

1899
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,220
People are not taken kindly to magic users these days.

1900
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,840
The Pleasure Men are, well, they've risen in power

1901
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,740
and they're quite cruel.

1902
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,700
So I just wanna make sure I know what's going on.

1903
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,540
And Dogen, you've done wonderful work with me before

1904
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:29,460
and I just thought I'd be happy to ask you again

1905
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,300
for your help.

1906
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,420
And you can keep that gold whether you decide

1907
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,500
you wanna help me or not.

1908
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,060
It's all fine with me.

1909
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,900
I just hadn't seen you in a while

1910
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,300
and it felt like I could have been more of a support for you

1911
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,380
during your unceremonious firing.

1912
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:47,420
All right.

1913
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,940
- Hello, my name is--

1914
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,520
- Worldwide favorite king.

1915
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:55,300
This guy, the big one, he's good.

1916
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,240
Look, Andre--

1917
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,640
There's a new guy in the room.

1918
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,240
Oh yeah, Sherman.

1919
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,080
(laughs)

1920
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,280
Hi, hi there.

1921
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,600
Hi.

1922
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,420
Hello.

1923
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,160
Hello.

1924
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,000
Sorry, hi.

1925
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,760
Hello, hi.

1926
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,520
Oh, this is good, this is like a mirror--

1927
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,640
This is a game of wits that I see--

1928
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,840
Facing each other, yeah.

1929
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,680
Play out.

1930
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:26,520
Before me yeah, yeah, you just keep saying hi to each other

1931
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:34,080
I'll have mud marks beam you guys back if you have any questions for me though feel free to ask mud marks

1932
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,440
And he'll patch it to me all that good stuff. I try not to be so

1933
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,880
What's the word you know? I'm not trying to be so sneaky. You know hey

1934
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,960
Gay, that's fair to

1935
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,540
You're filing it that you're acting very guy

1936
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:55,140
Well I should I assume a satyr would know that for sure for certain right

1937
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:00,340
Fuck are you trying to say about my friends?

1938
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,620
You're a satyr

1939
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:09,180
Yeah, very usually very sexually expressive and exploratory creatures of course

1940
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:15,180
Roll deception

1941
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,440
(laughing)

1942
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,360
- Okay, all right, well.

1943
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,720
Hmm, 18.

1944
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,000
- That's pretty good.

1945
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,840
- You did a good job.

1946
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,680
- Yeah.

1947
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,980
- Impressive, does your mom know your gay technique

1948
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,640
from Patches there?

1949
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,380
- Yeah, that was pretty well done, but you failed.

1950
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,580
- I did fail.

1951
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,820
- He doesn't, okay, well.

1952
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:39,020
- I'm happy to--

1953
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,440
- You just successfully lied that you're not gay.

1954
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,280
(laughing)

1955
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,280
- So I'm not.

1956
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,680
(laughing)

1957
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,560
- All right, I can send you fellows on your way.

1958
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,880
You can spend the weekend in the town.

1959
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,240
Go shopping, enjoy yourself. - Yes, we want the weekend.

1960
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,080
- Okay, all right.

1961
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,920
- We're really harshing Friday right now.

1962
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,360
- I apologize, well.

1963
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,600
And-- - What's the,

1964
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,840
give us a recommendation.

1965
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,360
What's the best store in the entire town?

1966
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,480
- Wait, I know the best store in the town.

1967
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,520
- Yeah, you know what?

1968
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,720
In the world. - In the world, yeah.

1969
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,280
- In the world. - Anywhere.

1970
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:13,080
- The best store in the world.

1971
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,080
That's really tough.

1972
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:20,080
The best store in town is Casual Male XL.

1973
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,080
*laughter*

1974
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,080
What?

1975
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,080
It's the best store in the world.

1976
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,080
It's the only place I've been able to buy clothes.

1977
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,080
The best store in the world was uh,

1978
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,080
the Sullivan's General store in Trebuchet Village,

1979
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,080
but I think that's been long gone.

1980
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,080
Oh, fuck off, shut up, fuck you, fuck you.

1981
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,080
Shut up.

1982
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,080
I slap him.

1983
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,760
No, I understand. Yeah, you guys go back.

1984
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,760
Yeah.

1985
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,040
And you see a mud mark says,

1986
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,960
all right, well, off to bed with a lot of you.

1987
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,200
Tuck yourselves in.

1988
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,600
I put a gold piece

1989
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,600
on four times.

1990
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,560
I put a gold piece in Mud Marks's mouth

1991
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,160
because I'm trying to make an in-app purchase on a game.

1992
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,880
Yeah, OK, you'll be able to pop, you'll be able to honk Harpo's nose

1993
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,880
a little bit more next time.

1994
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,400
Hooray!

1995
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,960
You know, Harpo doesn't necessarily usually wear like a clown nose, but I'm open to the

1996
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:16,960
idea.

1997
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,800
Um, cool.

1998
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:24,360
And I guess the battle did take a little longer, so next time we will go on a shopping spree.

1999
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Hell yeah.

2000
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Hooray!

2001
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
Fuck yes.

2002
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,360
Yes.

2003
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,360
Alright.

2004
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,360
Hogsmeade.

2005
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,360
I'm gonna get my, I'm gonna add a zero to my gold right now, bitch.

2006
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,360
Nothing you can do about it.

2007
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,360
You're gonna forget.

2008
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,360
I will.

2009
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,240
I just gave myself a hundred million copper.

2010
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,240
Okay.

2011
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,040
So I'll change a lot of that stuff then.

2012
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,380
- No, I'm gonna add even more.

2013
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,720
- Okay, well, you're making it harder for me to change it.

2014
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,000
The more gold you add, I have to take each one away

2015
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,520
one by one.

2016
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,360
- Really?

2017
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,600
- Oh, then I'm adding so many.

2018
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,440
- Stop!

2019
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,320
Stop!

2020
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,240
- Well, I didn't add any, so I'm actually--

2021
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,400
- Oh, okay.

2022
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,140
All right, Julio, can you talk for a second?

2023
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,400
Yeah, Julio, can you talk?

2024
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,360
- What?

2025
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,560
- Can you read out the thing that I sent you?

2026
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,400
- Okay.

2027
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,000
- Just as a closing.

2028
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,260
How do I get my parents to put me back in diapers?

2029
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,060
I am really desperate, but I can't tell them.

2030
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:11,900
Please help.

2031
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,280
Any way is okay.

2032
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,340
- Okay, thanks guys.

2033
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:15,440
- Thanks everyone, bye.

2034
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:20,840
Well, here's another fast food one.

2035
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,140
Can I sue McDonald's over there being snot

2036
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,620
like substance in my drink?

2037
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,340
I don't know if intentional or not,

2038
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,300
still unacceptable during COVID.

2039
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,540
(laughing)

2040
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:34,460
Jess was getting some hot axe and hot chocolate

2041
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,660
to start of my morning.

2042
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:38,660
I've never had any problems before at any other locations till this morning.

2043
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,300
I order hot chocolate with my meal, but when I drank it,

2044
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,740
taste it like a slimy goopy.

2045
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,740
(laughter)

2046
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,740
(laughter)

2047
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,740
(laughter)

2048
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,740
(laughter)

2049
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,740
(laughter)

2050
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,740
(laughter)

2051
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,740
(laughter)

2052
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,740
(laughter)

2053
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:00,740
(laughter)

2054
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,740
(laughter)

2055
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,740
(laughter)

2056
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:10,100
amazing line to be given. This is to go to court. It tasted like a slimy

2057
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,140
gooby. Your honor, it tasted like a slimy gooby.

2058
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:16,120
The gooby, please bring out the slimy gooby. The taste was

2059
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,360
completely off and had gooey substance all over it. Really don't have words to

2060
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,860
describe texture. It was same texture like snot, used my fork and scraped up

2061
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:27,000
lots from the inside. I have photos I can provide if needed, just need place

2062
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
to send them. I'm never usually that guy, but this is my first time ever

2063
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,260
actually feeling like I have to leave a report. I'm open to being tested or

2064
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,280
ever to prove it's not my own.

2065
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,280
He kept the slimy gooby?

2066
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,280
He took a photo.

2067
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,280
He took a photo but how are you going to test it?

2068
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,280
He's keeping it man.

2069
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:49,280
I had so many of this type of thing of finding slime or gooby.

2070
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,280
This should be...

2071
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,280
Gooby? You looked up gooby?

2072
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,280
This is not a one for the...

2073
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,280
Everyone keeps it.

2074
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,280
Everyone says I still have it.

2075
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,280
I put it in my fridge.

2076
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,880
I don't think that this is a problem for the United States court system.

2077
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,760
This is a problem for Maury.

2078
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,080
This is a Maury that...

2079
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,080
It is not your gooby!

2080
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,080
It's not your gooby?

2081
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,080
Yes!

2082
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,080
It's not my fucking gooby!

2083
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,080
He does a backflip.

2084
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,080
He does a backflip, yeah.

2085
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,080
Fifty backflips in a row, not my gooby.

2086
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,080
