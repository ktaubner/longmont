00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Podcasts for the homeless.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're not being recorded.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh my god, Dan.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're in our house now, dude.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're fucking...

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Welcome to Boston, boys.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, we have all of you on in Boston.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome to fucking Boston, kid.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have them in Boston.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
and we're taking them to all the landmarks.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,480
- Yeah.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,300
- Taking them to Twin Donuts.

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,040
- This is where a bunch of guys got shot in the 1700s.

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,820
Okay, here's another place where a bunch of guys

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,180
got shot in the 1700s.

18
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,700
Here's a church.

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,000
All right, that pretty much covers it.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's go to--

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
- In this neighborhood, the white guys are really mean.

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,560
- In this one, they're really racist

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,000
against the black guys who don't live here.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,200
- They're racist, but they still voted blue, baby.

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
Let's go.

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,860
- That's right, dude.

27
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,860
This whole neighborhood has never forgiven an imaginary black guy for saying Larry Bird wasn't that good.

28
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,860
They just get mad in their head.

29
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,860
Larry Bird, greatest ever, fucking do it dude, come on.

30
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,860
Better than fucking Jordan, for sure. Better than fucking Jordan.

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,860
Better than LeBron James. I bet he's taller than Yao Ming.

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,860
Look, he fucking understood the fundamentals, alright.

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,860
Yeah, triple threat position.

34
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,360
The fundamentals, push ups, pull ups, six pack of beer every night, that's the fucking fundamentals of the game.

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
You ever look at Larry Bird's shirts? He's got a fucking cock like a summer sausage in there.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,860
That thing would bounce out, it would bruise other guys legs when they went to the block 'em, you know?

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,360
Hit 'em on the shoulder, they'd be like "What the fuck where'd this come from?"

38
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
It was his cock. It was the guy's cock.

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,860
And Larry Bird... Larry fucking Bird, he was the king of shit talking too.

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,860
He fucking, he told everybody "Hey, get out of my way." That's all he said.

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
He wasn't afraid to say the word.

42
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,900
You know what? He fucking, you know, he fucking conquered IBS. That's an achievement.

43
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,060
Yeah, I got an aunt that just looks just like him. Aunt that looks just like him.

44
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,260
He looks like a fucked up mubbet, dude. I miss him. I miss him every single day.

45
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,100
Larry Legend. Rest in peace.

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,900
Larry Legend.

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,460
Rest in peace.

48
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,700
They don't have handsome guys like that in the NBA anymore.

49
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,580
Nah, he had that kind of old school.

50
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,700
Gordon Hayward? No, he's got nothing on Larry Bird.

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,140
Oh, nah. He looks like...

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,940
Looks gross.

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,460
Bird looks like 007, dude.

54
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,140
He looked, I mean he was a fucking, he was a Casanova, stone cold killer.

55
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,340
That's why he got HIV.

56
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,860
Larry Bird, he looked like a young Bryce Dallas Howard.

57
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,100
Larry Bird was so handsome, he could have been on the OC.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
He should have been on the OC.

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,020
I don't know why he wasn't on.

60
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,740
I mean and nowadays you got guys in the NBA like Tyrell Hello, you know?

61
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,100
Oh I love Tyrell Hello.

62
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,780
Yeah, I mean he's one of the best in the game right now.

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,780
I don't know why James--he's dating that chick James Charles, see, Oakley.

64
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Aw man, James, that chick is so hot, dude.

65
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Oh my god.

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,780

They let Shane Dawson into the bubble.

73
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,780
He was foaming at the mouth.

74
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,780
He was saying, "Oh, I need pussy now!"

75
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,020
all you need to know is we all have a lot of sex

141
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,780

142
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,820
- Amen.

143
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,180
- All the time.

144
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,020
- Amen.

145
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,300
- You got her in the back of the car with that TV

146
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,060
and you're making out and stuff

147
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,860
and she's trying to show you her boobs and stuff.

148
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,500
You're like, "Yo, you play Mario Kart?"

149
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
That's what I do.

150
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,140
She's trying to show your boobs.

151
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,620
You say, "Shut the fuck up!

152
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,940
Jon Favreau's making a Cubano right now!"

153
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,380
I don't want to see those disgusting tits.

154
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
What the fuck?

155
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,940
What, you think I'm 13 years old?

156
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
I'm watching Chef, bitch!

157
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Sophia Vergara's in this.

158
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,580
She'd think I'm thinking about you.

159
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
In the backseat of Andrew's Subaru...

160
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,940
I would never use that word.

161
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,220
I would never use that word for a woman.

162
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,220
I wouldn't say that.

163
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Caleb said that, but I don't agree.

164
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,220
Vergara?

165
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,940
You don't know Spanish.

166
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,000
That's why, bitch.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,120
In the back of Andrew's Subaru Outback, he likes to time his orgasms with the point in

168
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,520
Small Soldiers where the Gorgons die.

169
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,640
Is that a thing that happens in that movie?

170
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Do you actually know that movie?

171
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,800
I think one of them dies.

172
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, Charles, listen to something.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,680
You got Archer, he's the emissary of the Gorgonites.

174
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,240
He's not the leader, he's the emissary.

175
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,640
You have Slamfist, you have Insaniac, you have Punch-It, you have--

176
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,960
Can you close your eyes so I can tell if you're reading or not?

177
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:25,760
have Frankenstein then I think there's a couple of others you have the the

178
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,400
commando elite which is major Chip Hazzard Brick Bazooka Nick Nitro butch

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,640
meat hook Kip Killigan and I think that might be it I'm sure I'm sure you got

180
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,120
Dennis Leary you got David Cross you have who's gonna you know it marks the

181
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,160
last on-screen film role of Phil Hartman who died before the film's American

182
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,240
premiere that's true yeah you have Kirsten Dunst who is the love interest of

183
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,720
the main character Alan Abernathy who is little bitch but and you know she gave

184
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,280
up because his dad had this sick his dad had the sick toy shop like toy trains and

185
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,480
everything like the sickest toys of all time he's like these toys are gay and

186
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,880
then like he discovers the toys that had accidental nuclear missile chips put in

187
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,840
them by accident so it made them alive whoo and that actually what happened in

188
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,340
(talking over each other)

189
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
- And like the big wig is Dennis Leary.

190
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
- Yeah.

191
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,560
- The king of comedy.

192
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,680
- Exactly, the king of Boston comedy.

193
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,000
- He still does comics.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
He does comics come home every single year.

195
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
- Oh yeah, TD.

196
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,920
- He fills the Boston garden, or the TD garden,

197
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,960
which fits like 30,000 people.

198
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,320
He fills about 800 people into it

199
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,080
and gets like all of his road openers

200
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
and then Wanda Sykes, who is not from Boston.

201
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,680
yeah isn't this the most amazing comedy show in the world?

202
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,280
He's still doing like coffee stuff like skinny jeans at Starbucks and manbuns

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,080
what the fuck?

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,680
Small soldiers for a movie about soldiers that had a lot of coffee material

205
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
yeah

206
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
where do you get a black coffee in?

207
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
yeah they're like going over the plans and he's drinking a coffee like

208
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,680
God you put milk and sugar in this you homo?

209
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
What the fuck is this?

210
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,580
And I had a friend go to Boston or comics calling home or coming home or whatever and he told me that all the transitions

211
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,220
Were him just like repeating like the the comics jokes and then be like wasn't that great anyway? Here's

212
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:24,920
Leary's the fucking boss. Oh, but really a boss though. He would say their punchlines before they come out

213
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,380
Yeah, true. Yeah, he's like Flava Flav. I'm sure Andrew already knows this cuz he fucking rattled off all the small soldier shit

214
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,380
but the rodeo burger at Burger King

215
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,000
Amazing the rodeo burger barbecue sauce

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,880
That fried onions. It has the fried onions rings, right?

217
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,640
That was created as a promotional item for small soldiers. They still have it. It's a still there

218
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,720
So good that they fucking have to keep it on the menu. It'd be funny if they named it like the Gorgon burger

219
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,160
and they just have to call it that forever.

220
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
- They should've just kept Small Soldiers in theaters

221
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
all these years as a promotion for the burger.

222
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
- Right.

223
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,840
- Well, I think they should have, like,

224
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,280
Dina's Villain Wave makes Small Soldiers 2.

225
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,480
I think that's the next big thing.

226
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,320
- That'd be great.

227
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,160
- Oh yeah, after Dune.

228
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
- Small Soldiers had one of the best uses of,

229
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,920
one of the classic movie songs of all time.

230
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,080
♪ Wa ♪

231
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
♪ Hoo ♪

232
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,080
♪ Yeah ♪

233
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,920
- Edwin Stoddard.

234
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,760
- Wars.

235
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,600
- Mm-hmm.

236
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
- Yeah.

237
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,920
That used to be, I would go from the Open Mic that we hosted, I would go from there to the

238
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,440
Burger King up the road and I would just get like a rodeo burger and then go home.

239
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
So funny.

240
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,000
Can I get a Small Soldier's tour with that too?

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I know you have them in the back.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,040
Can I have a Small Soldier's burger please?

243
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,400
The Burger King I haven't had in years because like everything they make, you like burp it

244
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,080
up for like two days and when you shit it smells like it too.

245
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,360
And it's just so gross.

246
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,880
And then you get hungry for more Burger King because you're smelling the Burger King in

247
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
- I've seen you eat that fucking smell twice.

248
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,880
- They butter the buns, I don't like that.

249
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,840
I don't like that at all when they butter the buns.

250
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,800
- They should do a Dennis Leary burger

251
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,520
and it's just a black coffee and a condom

252
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,720
that they hand you in a bag.

253
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
(laughing)

254
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,200
- Right now, I'm drinking this porter over here.

255
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Do you think, can I become the Dennis Leary?

256
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,080
Could I be the Dennis Leary of porters

257
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,160
where I'm like, coconut porter,

258
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,280
what happened to just a porter?

259
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,000
- Am I on fucking vacation while I drink my beer?

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,840
What the fuck?

261
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
I think Dennis Leary just hates adjectives.

262
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
I think that's just his thing.

263
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Oh, baby Yoda. What the hell happened to Yoda?

264
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Okay? Back in my day,

265
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
we were happy with an old

266
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
creepy green pig man.

267
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
[laughter]

268
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
He used to be

269
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
a little green guy.

270
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Now he's even smaller?

271
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Come on! What the fuck is this?

272
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
I don't think he's that current still. I think he's

273
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
that irrelevant where he's like,

274
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
"I saw the other day they had this fucking thing called Second Life."

275
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,940
(laughter)

276
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,560
- Yeah, that's the exact era that he's locked into,

277
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,940
is like mid 2000s.

278
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,780
- Oh yeah.

279
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,060
- Yeah.

280
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,900
- I can't wait until we're all that old

281
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,740
and we're all that watched. - Have you guys seen the show

282
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,880
called Equals Three?

283
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm trying to get a spot on Equals Three.

284
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,740
- He's still doing material on the failed NBC show,

285
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,580
The Slap.

286
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,700
Have you seen The Slap?

287
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,760
- Look, it's based off an Australian show.

288
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,480
I don't know what the fuck's going on down there.

289
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,680
Their toilets turn different.

290
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
How about your toilets turn normal?

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,400
What's a mini-series?

292
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,160
What's a mini-series?

293
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Is that like a...

294
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,800
You're watching on a Motorola Razr?

295
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,280
What the fuck kind of show is this?

296
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,120
Caleb, your audio's all fucked up.

297
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Your internet's bad.

298
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
You're freezing.

299
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
You keep freezing over and over.

300
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,560
He's got that classic New York Wi-Fi.

301
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,280
It's my spectrum Wi-Fi, dude.

302
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,560
People get mad at me because it's bad.

303
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,840
I gotta switch to FIOS.

304
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Turn off your video or something.

305
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
You better shut up.

306
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
I just switched to you.

307
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Fuck you.

308
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Yes, sir.

309
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
You guys keep talking.

310
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,160
- Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, bop, bop, bop.

311
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,240
- No, it won't, trust me.

312
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
- It will disconnect you.

313
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,920
- Trust him!

314
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,760
- Trust me.

315
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,580
- I don't trust him.

316
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,420
- I don't trust Caleb about internet.

317
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,260
- I don't trust Caleb about internet.

318
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,080
- Hey, brother, trust and believe.

319
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,520
- I'm a tech god, hold on.

320
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,280
- Yeah, see, your audio's just changed.

321
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,920
- I'm about to, I didn't even do a single thing, Patrick,

322
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
so that's how I know you're lying.

323
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,680
- Yes!

324
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,520
- It's louder in my ears.

325
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,720
- Yeah, you did get louder.

326
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
- It's better.

327
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,400
- It's just louder.

328
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,360
- Anyway, back to Dennis Leary, right?

329
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,520
- Yeah.

330
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,120
Dennis Leary is like, he's still got these fucking Survivor shows going.

331
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Remember Survivor?

332
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,960
The guy walked around naked with his cock out?

333
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Richard?

334
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Remember him?

335
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
What happened to him?

336
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Is he dead?

337
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Is he in jail?

338
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Nah, fuck it.

339
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,200
Isn't Bill Burr just Dennis Leary now?

340
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,920
Dennis Leary is Dennis Leary still, but Bill Burr is, yeah, he loves the bitch too.

341
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,200
Yeah, they just complain, right?

342
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
And I'm back, easy.

343
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Yeah, fucking easy.

344
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,680
Who's that, wait, who's that guy from Survivor, Richard Hatch?

345
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Yeah, he walked around naked.

346
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Yeah, my mom met that guy.

347
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,180
I remember being a kid and that was going around and everyone was like, "You see this guy on Survivor that walks around naked? He's so hot."

348
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,180
They all wanted to fuck him.

349
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,180
My mom got a picture, my mom has a picture with Richard Hatch.

350
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,180
And I thought it was, I'd never seen Survivor.

351
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,680
And I didn't learn who he was until I was like 16.

352
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
I don't think you were born yet. I don't think you were born yet, Patrick.

353
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,680
I was, I was like 6, maybe, maybe like 4, I don't know.

354
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
But still, like, yeah, like it's...

355
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
He was a gang guy, right?

356
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I was three.

357
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,520
And he walked around naked and he won a Subaru or something?

358
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,560
He won an Emmy for walking around naked.

359
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah.

360
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Whoa.

361
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Dream.

362
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Dream.

363
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
He walks around in public with an Emmy in front of his cock.

364
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Yeah.

365
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
So he gets arrested.

366
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
That's how he avoids public nudity laws.

367
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Right.

368
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
And anyway, yeah.

369
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Hey, what's next?

370
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Survivor Mars?

371
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
You guys want to go to Mars?

372
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Yeah, I just thought Richard Hatch was an uncle I didn't know for a long time.

373
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,560
- I was growing up, Earth was growing up for us.

374
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,420
- Everybody so familiar, it's crazy,

375
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,560
Survivor's not really around anymore, is it?

376
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,360
They still do Survivor? - It is, yeah.

377
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
- Really? - Yeah, Survivor Boston.

378
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,000
- My brother has seen every season, it's awesome.

379
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
- My mom buys the bootleg DVDs off of eBay.

380
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,560
- Survival. - That'll just have

381
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,540
Survivor seasons on them.

382
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,980
And then you'll get this sun-faded photo

383
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,120
of a low-resolution picture of the Survivor logo

384
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,200
on like four burn CDs.

385
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm like, mom, why are you paying for this?

386
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,920
What the fuck are you doing?

387
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
- It's also crazy--

388
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,600
- I should have shown you BitTorrent like 15 years ago.

389
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,840
- It's crazy that there wouldn't be

390
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,920
just like survivor seasons available

391
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,480
that she could buy anywhere but eBay.

392
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,240
- I would never bring up BitTorrent to my mother.

393
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,080
Are you kidding me?

394
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm never having that.

395
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,520
- Give me your phone number.

396
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,040
- Give me, hold on, let's get her number.

397
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,280
- I can explain anything to you.

398
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
- All right, let's get my mom on the line.

399
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,360
I'll patch her through.

400
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,480
- Yeah, here she is.

401
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,880
Hey, beautiful Mrs. Branson, how are you?

402
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,480
Hey mom, what did they used to call pussy in the old days?

403
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
They called it cooter!

404
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
[laughter]

405
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Yeah, pre-Shane Dawson, what'd they call pussy?

406
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
[laughter]

407
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Have you seen this James Charles chick?

408
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
She's hot to trot, huh ma?

409
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
God damn, she's got a horse ass, huh ma?

410
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Yeah, you can just tell!

411
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
You can look at her

412
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
and just bite your bottom lip

413
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
and go, "Ooo, I know that pussy is

414
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
so good!"

415
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
God damn, what a femme fatale.

416
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,560
Shane Dawson was actually fucking James Charles when he came up with the name

417
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,380
Pussy. Yeah he was like whatever this thing is that's Pussy for sure. If I know one thing, it's that I'm

418
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,100
fucking Pussy right now. Yeah. Do you guys want to talk about this list?

419
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
What the fuck are we doing here? No, no

420
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,820
You build our own on survivor

421
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:39,900
Bowling ball, what the fuck is this? Huh? It's got three holes in it. I put my fingers in here. I can't even there's no pins here

422
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
What the fuck? Oh

423
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,340
So I'm supposed to kill a fucking boar now, okay, I guess I'll go get a spear

424
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,260
Yeah, I'll get a spear. Sure. I'll throw it. Whatever. Oh, they got to create Alliance

425
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,920
What are they you the United Nations? Oh great. That's awesome. What is this Star Wars? We're creating alliances now. Jesus. Okay

426
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,660
I'm the fucking rebel Alliance. How about that? I got my own fucking Alliance over here, huh?

427
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,060
How about my fucking dick? I'll just stand over here being have a fucking Jar Jar Binks. How about that?

428
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Oh, yeah

429
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Me so wanna poop boo

430
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,260
Me so wanna fuck all the girls here. How about that? How about I say that?

431
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,740
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna win. I'm gonna win

432
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,060
Yeah, Jedi mind tricks don't work on me, huh? Only money.

433
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,780
I know that's Wado, I don't fucking care.

434
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,060
Hey, they should do Survivor Boston, huh? See if people can...

435
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
That's a good idea.

436
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,920
At our college, when we were in college, they did a...

437
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,380
like a...

438
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,260
Survivor, I guess Survivor has like audition series that they do.

439
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,760
at like different colleges in the United States

440
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,480
where they'll do like,

441
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,060
they'll fund a student-led version of Survivor

442
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,020
that just takes place at the college.

443
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,920
And then they will like, like a farm league,

444
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,120
they'll take kids from that

445
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,680
and put some of them in reality shows.

446
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,520
- G League Survivor.

447
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,360
- Yeah. - Exactly.

448
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,500
- G is fucking crazy.

449
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,080
So what you get is you just get like college psychos

450
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,000
who are just like, like mostly theater kids,

451
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840
at least at our school.

452
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,240
- Oh yeah, 'cause they wanna make it,

453
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,800
we gotta get their face out there.

454
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,040
- We had a couple friends on it.

455
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,720
I know that I know we had a couple of people who are 19 and want to be famous.

456
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,640
Yeah, Cameron. Yeah, Cameron was kind of the like, I was kind of like the

457
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
psychopathic bitch. Yeah, one.

458
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,920
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's crazy. It all took place in the Boston Common, too,

459
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,000
which was like, yeah, just like, you know, that's just a city park.

460
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,080
That's just tourists and homeless people. And I honestly I don't know why

461
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,000
that I mean, I understand why the cops really got these got to get these hot

462
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
dogs grilled or else

463
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,280
the night that is seriously as some of the fucking challenges are it'll be like

464
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,680
you have to do this puzzle in under an hour yeah there's nothing like fucking

465
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,840
survivor dude right you got to play ultimate frisbee for a couple hours

466
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,360
yeah we had he under a dorm room couch who just made them do useful chores

467
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,360
like you got to clean up all the leaves in this park and all the homeless people

468
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,080
out of the park all this beer and take all this Adderall dude good luck man the

469
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,440
producers were really mad when I did that for my college and I I killed a pig in

470
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,560
the middle of the park they said. I thought this was Survivor. Didn't Alex and Joe our

471
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,440
friends Alex and Joe like watch that like religiously? I guess the real appeal of that is like

472
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,080
imagine Survivor but you know every single person on it. That's true. Like

473
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,600
that's the best version of Survivor. Oh yeah that's got that's has to be fun it's

474
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,480
like I'm gonna get your ass. I like the idea of a survivor that you can betray people multiple

475
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,000
times. Yeah you can you can like triple cross somebody. Just like sociopath practice it's

476
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,880
wonderful. Oh I mean like that's okay we earlier we were talking about uh it wasn't this. Small

477
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,120
soldiers. Oh yes. Yeah no let's talk about that again. Let's keep going with that. So we're

478
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,480
talking about not on this but when we recorded the E1 we were talking about like you are

479
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,120
the weakest link is that your final answer you're fired and the other one was voting

480
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
someone off the island.

481
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
What did they say?

482
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Great shit.

483
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,960
They would just hold it up to the camera right and then like cast it silently like kind of

484
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,720
forlornly like well I have to do what I have to.

485
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Yeah.

486
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
I like this person but they got to fucking burn.

487
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
I think the line was.

488
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Fucking die.

489
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Fuck you.

490
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Get the hell off this island.

491
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Get your white ass off the side!

492
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
I think that was the exact one.

493
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
That was Richard Hatch's catchphrase.

494
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
It was zooming in and out of their face really fast, like boing-yong-yong-yong-yong-yong-yong.

495
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,720
The trap door opens underneath them and they just fall.

496
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,720
What happened to reality shows, man? Now it's all fucking Minute to Win It and whatever fucking Ellen does.

497
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Yeah, we need Rock the Love back.

498
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Have you guys heard of the reality show The Circle? It was like a new Netflix one.

499
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I watched it with my girlfriend. It's crazy.

500
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Everybody's everybody's like dating each other through a computer. It's like it's like it's like a reality show

501
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,640
That's based on like social media and so you can like other people and shit. I also have a girlfriend so I had to watch this

502
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,080
Amazing timing

503
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:25,320
Funny that like Branson manifested her

504
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Wait, Patrick, do you have a girlfriend?

505
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,560
Can we edit this out Cameron?

506
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:39,980
Anyway, I just I are gonna move in together. Yeah, I'm moving in with Andrew. We're having a bachelor pad

507
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:48,000
They're gonna share a bedroom that's a big circular bed. It's a heart-shaped bed.

508
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They're all twin beds that are pushed together.

509
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Well, here's what I want to know.

510
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Here's what I want to know.

511
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
How you getting these

512
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,840
Pardon my language, these hoes in that sweet pad.

513
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,920
I mean, what are you doing?

514
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,760
- A ladder.

515
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,580
- A catapult.

516
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,560
(laughing)

517
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,040
- A perfectly aimed catapult right into an open window.

518
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,880
Now that you're here, would you like a martini?

519
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,720
- These women are building siege weapons

520
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,200
to attack our apartment.

521
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,040
(laughing)

522
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,440
Get up in our apartment and fuck us.

523
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,280
- Yeah.

524
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,200
- And we're all like, no, no, don't do that.

525
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,560
- I'm going over to their new apartment

526
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
and I'm about to open the door and Andrew stops me.

527
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,640
says if you open that door a cauldron full of boiling pitch will fall on you

528
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,800
yeah a big bucket of lube is gonna fall on you. Bucket of lube that's not that scary

529
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
something boiling that might stop me if I'm a girl I'm worried about my skin

530
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,640
women come to the gate of our apartment. You say the gate?

531
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:51,040
Rattling the bars. It's Baldur's Gate. There's a pork colas and Patrick Eyre up there with their hoods and their

532
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,040
class will say "OI! Who's that there?"

533
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Better not be any more snatch! Better not be any more snatch down there!

534
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Have enough of that lately!

535
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,040
We have a cooter here, thank you please!

536
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,040
I hate pussy, I don't like it! I don't like it!

537
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,040
It's all red! Open a window, it smells like stooge!

538
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
You don't come in here unless you bring a lobster with ya!

539
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Oh that's right, the Lords have been enjoying quite the reverie of all that lately.

540
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
"Oh, c'mon, look, oh dude!"

541
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

542
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
That's the toady. Which one, who's that?

543
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Who's that in real life? Which one is that?

544
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
That's Igor, from Frankenstein.

545
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Oh, that's the actual Igor you guys know?

546
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah, there's gonna live in the castle.

547
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

548
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
"Look at that Larry, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

549
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
"Look at this guy's getting shamp, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

550
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

551
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
"Oh, they're getting so much clout, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

552
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Do you know what my favorite part of sex is?

553
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
It's, uh, the orgasm.

554
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,840
orgasm. Ugh. Not for me. I gotta take a leak. I'll be right back. Why's that? Not for me.

555
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,200
Hey, buddy. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. I like the end. I try to

556
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,620
actually get as fast to the end. What about the journey, though? Because I like it so--

557
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,220
Oh, no. The journey is boring. I feel like the journey is the most important part. The journey's even worse. It's like doing push-ups. It hurts. And the end is like--

558
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,920
It's like the end of doing push-ups when you feel good. Yeah. Push-ups that make you feel good.

559
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,200

All right we're about halfway through so I feel like we should. Yeah that's good enough.

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,560
strengths. Welcome to episode one this is Pot of Hot Licks. Well we maybe didn't specify earlier but we charge by the

591
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,760
amount of things on a list when we come on a different podcast. Ah shit. So I hope this is a short list for your sake.

592
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:47,440
Wait sorry. God damn it Cameron this has like. We don't get out of bed for less than five large. We get more exposure per the list.

593
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,280
This has 51. Yeah we need about a hundred exposure per each item. Shit. I know I know

594
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,760
I know you guys like to do, you do your little stories and your, your, whatever you do.

595
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
We're dreamers!

596
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,800
You little, you know what, who cares, whatever it is you guys do.

597
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,320
But I know that you guys love to do, you guys like to make silly songs.

598
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,040
You guys like to make parodies like, like, um, All the Fall Guys by Blink 182, that kind

599
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
of thing.

600
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,240
I know you guys are really into the song, silly song scene.

601
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,800
No, all our songs are serious, dude.

602
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,680
I don't know if you fucking, are you saying you thought those were funny?

603
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Yeah.

604
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,640
they were very funny and I laughed at them. This guy laughs at everything sad. Yeah, that's

605
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,520
true. That's fucked up. We were putting our heart on the line and you guys just had us

606
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:38,800
here to mock our- But doctor, I am Pagliacci, right? I remember that. So these are best

607
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,760
ideas for a song title. Yeah, this is best ideas for a song title created by user Dynastinobel.

608
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,440
It's a cool name. This is helpful because usually songwriters just can't come up with

609
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,480
the title. They have a great melody. We have the song Best Song Ever but we don't have a name.

610
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,280
They already have the lyrics but what do I call it? Look at song 2 by Blur. Yeah, they had no clue what to call that.

611
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,560
Look at how many untitles there are. They should have called it WooHoo.

612
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,280
They should have called it WooHoo. They're stupid. Scott Walker, what's he got? Track 5, Track 6, Track 7.

613
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,720
fucking what is he doing hold up also how many how many bands you see have a

614
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,240
song called intro you fucking kidding me Charles had a super exhausting bit that

615
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:30,960
he wanted to make a band named various artists mm-hmm I remember that bit well

616
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
- I'm not exhausted yet.

617
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,040
Continue.

618
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,000
- That's it.

619
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,840
- Okay, number one on this list is Filet-O-Fish.

620
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,240
- That's not true.

621
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,080
- No.

622
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,920
- No.

623
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,600
- We're not talking about that, man.

624
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,440
Come on.

625
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,260
- Wait, what is that?

626
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,100
What is the Filet-O-Fish?

627
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,940
- That's an idea I had.

628
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,760
- It's a sandwich at McDonald's.

629
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,600
We're moving on.

630
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,760
- No, it's not an idea you had.

631
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,440
- Oh, what is your idea then?

632
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,680
- Branson's been talking to me about it.

633
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
I think he talked about it first.

634
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,440
- Look, I'm not gonna talk about this yet, all right?

635
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,200
Maybe we get this at the end of the episode.

636
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,520
- All right, I'll take that deal.

637
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,880
- All right, Pat, you have until then

638
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,200
to think of what that is.

639
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
(laughing)

640
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,040
- Okay.

641
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,880
- Good luck, my friend.

642
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,520
I mean, I already told Cameron.

643
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,360
- I hope you just aren't copying my filet-o-fish idea.

644
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,200
- No.

645
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,720
You don't even have one, so.

646
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,680
- No, he wrote it on E1, that was it.

647
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,400
- I did text it to you.

648
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,720
- Yeah, I did text it to Cameron.

649
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,200
- I have it on my phone right here.

650
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,040
- Can you read it for us?

651
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
- See, it's right there.

652
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
I did see something right there.

653
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
You guys see that?

654
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Best idea for a song title, number one, "Run Away With Me."

655
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,440
I mean, is that not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?

656
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
So beautiful.

657
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
It's so romantic to like, leave a place.

658
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Or just go jogging.

659
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
Or just go jogging.

660
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
True.

661
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Did she do that?

662
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,440
She must have looked at this list.

663
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
Did she run away?

664
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
That literally is one of her song titles.

665
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
"Run Away With Me"?

666
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
Oh, well fuck this then.

667
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
She stole it.

668
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
She stole it?

669
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,480
She didn't steal it, she had the idea.

670
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
She looked to Google "best ideas for a song title"

671
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,480
So she's resourceful, she sounds like a great gal to me.

672
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Sounds like you're trying to get in her pants.

673
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Isn't she like fucking 30 by now?

674
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Yeah, what is she? She's old as shit.

675
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,480
You don't run away at like 30.

676
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
You're where you're at.

677
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I think you're being real constrictive of what a woman can do Branson.

678
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
A 30 year old woman is not running away.

679
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,400
away if she is she's a fucking mess now but he's gonna text me and Andrew

680
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,780
tonight like dude I'm doing it I'm running away from home I'm a real messy

681
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:43,920
32 year old run away I'm packing a bag I'm putting one toy yeah I'm putting a

682
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:50,280
maybe she's in a cult oh running away from the cult or to join the cult that

683
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,680
changes well that's like that that's like the ambiguity that makes the song

684
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,640
like you know she's just a Jehovah's Witness she's running away from one cult

685
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:03,280
to another cult maybe she's just really scared maybe she saw a scary guy or a

686
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,440
scary monster and she's telling him to run away with her you're making no

687

00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,880

694
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,720
You're a fucking 10, Andrew.

695
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,280
She would be lucky to have you.

696
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,120
That's not true.

697
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,960
I'm like a six.

698
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,440
Yeah, a $10 bill.

699
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,840
I can buy a Subway sandwich with you,

700
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,680
you fucking monster.

701
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,120
When I see a woman, I also get the Metal Gear Solid

702
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,280
exclamation point above my head,

703
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,080
and I go, "Look, a box!"

704
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,320
(laughing)

705
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,160
Jizz!

706
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,040
A stooge!

707
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,120
I get the, I'm like the NBA's scarred stew

708
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,320
where I see the exclamation point,

709
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,520
and then I see the woman, I go, "Huh?"

710
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:22,280
I'm like NBA 2K and I get fire above my head and it's just "He's heating up!"

711
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,780
Number two is Hit Me Baby.

712
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,280
That's half of an existing title.

713
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Yeah exactly.

714
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,600
That's already a song.

715
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,880
Also that's either about domestic violence or blackjacks.

716
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,060
It's the prequel to Hit Me Baby One More Time.

717
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,240
Or about training your fighter child.

718
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,800
was yeah maybe one more time about domestic violence. No it's about blackjack.

719
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Yeah. What's she talking about like getting stuck? I mean let's be real she's talking

720
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,600
about getting fisted over there right? She's talking about getting like fucking

721
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:59,280
stuck. She's trying to get stuffed like a turkey. Let's be honest. Yeah. That's nice.

722
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,120
You guys are disgusting. I'm sorry. Andrew I take it back you're not a

723
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:13,800
monster oh that's where you're wrong brother no he's the loco gringo for my

724
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:20,840
one of my favorite videos of a guy or the guitarist and slipknot there's a

725
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,180
video of him or so I like an interview goes up to him and it's like like man

726
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,520
you got a scary mask are you a monster and he just goes you have to ask my wife

727
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:38,140
and then leave. That's so cool. Solid bet. Yes, he's a monster. Please get me away from him. He is a monster. Solid bet. Yeah.

728
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,520
Is he insinuating that he fucks like a Frankenstein? Yeah, that's the thing is it's

729
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,720
completely unclear. It could be something really bad or something really cool.

730
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,400
If you want to do a witty retort, you just bring up your wife though. That's why most

731
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
people get married. The documentary Some Kind of Monster was about that one guy from Slipknot.

732
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,080
Yeah, the guy from Slipknot idolizes Rodney Dangerfield.

733
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,160
Yeah, most Slipknot songs are about Rodney Dangerfield bits.

734
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Right. Yeah.

735
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,860
That Slipknot song about your doctor asks for a stool, semen, and urine sample so he

736
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,720
gives him his underwear and he leaves. That's what that song is about.

737
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,360
Hey, let me tell you. Yeah.

738
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,160
I forgot all the Slipknot lyrics.

739
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
As soon as I did the Rodney Dangerfield.

740
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
I felt that he rise up in me.

741
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Yeah. Slipknot has lyrics?

742
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Yeah, no, it's just screams.

743
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Slipknot.

744
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,360
I thought they were just saying bullcrap.

745
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
These guys are scary looking, huh?

746
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,720
I thought the lead singer was a dog.

747
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,960
Hey, hey, let me tell you, I did my time and I won out of my marriage.

748
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, "Hit Me Baby" could be a Rodney Dangerfield song title.

749
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah, true.

750
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Hit me baby.

751
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah.

752
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,040
I need to buy a new TV for my wife.

753
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,920
It's the only way I can come.

754
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Hit me baby.

755
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,320
(laughter)

756
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,960
My wife told me, "Hit me baby, one more time."

757
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,720
And I said, "Hey, I'm on parole."

758
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,980
(laughter)

759
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,420
Number three, I will hurt you.

760
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,260
Huh.

761
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,080
What?

762
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,560
Okay, this guy's, whoever made this list is a--

763
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,880
Is a freaking psycho.

764
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,160
The two comments on this one are,

765
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,320
"Sounds like a bossy bitch," and "Sounds bitchy."

766
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,620
(laughter)

767
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,760
Who made this list?

768
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,320
It's like Ted Bundy made this list.

769
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,560
It's a bunch of kids.

770
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,400
Yeah.

771
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,240
Here's a list of--

772
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,560
It's Dynaston, it was made by Dynaston Noble, who I just clicked on their profile

773
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,120
and their bio is "I'm Dynaston Noble and I'm a middle school teenager whose life

774
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,520
is disrupted by darkness."

775
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,000
Aren't we all bud? I think we need to save him. Send him the healing power of Jesus

776
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,960
Christ. Well he's probably like 40 now. I think he needs to discover the power of comedy. True. That's a really, yeah we should

777
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,880
send him a DVD copy of Brass Eye. Uh-huh. That'll save his life. Look I have one I can send it. I think we

778
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,120
should send him a Dane Cook special. Yeah. True. I can send him my Dane Cook

779
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,080
vicious circle tour t-shirt. I can send him that. It's not a bad idea. Yeah. I'm

780
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,360
gonna call him on the phone. I'll send him a VHS copy of a Bill Hicks stand-up special. You need Bill Hicks,

781
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,800
George Carlin, you need the latest Dave Chappelle special where he bitches about

782
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,960
trans people for an hour. Uh-huh. Exactly. George Floyd. That's what's funny now. That's what's

783
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,720
funny now, you know? Because he's this guy who disappeared for like a decade, then he came back

784
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,440
and was like, "Well, I'm gonna say this because I'm right and everyone's gonna agree with me." It's

785
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,480
like, "All right, man." Well, he's a tricky situation because it's like a caveman got

786
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,960
unthought. Right. Like, he really, none of that was happening when he went in, and then he comes

787
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,440
out and he's just surprised. And we got to give him a couple years of him saying horrible shit.

788
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,840
- That's where it's like, it's cool man, he's like,

789
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,160
- Shut up. - I'm buff.

790
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm buff now.

791
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
- He did get so buff in Africa, dude.

792
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,240
- That's true.

793
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,520
You know what's a weird thing about Dave Chappelle?

794
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,560
He loves to skateboard.

795
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,640
That's a--

796
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,480
- Really?

797
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,520
- That's just a fun fact about him.

798
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,760
- Well, he watched so much Jackass,

799
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,880
he's like, oh, these guys are really funny,

800
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,600
they're really funny, but they also all skateboard,

801
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,800
so I'm gonna be like them.

802
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,640
- Exactly.

803
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,040
- Hey, do any of you guys skateboard?

804
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
- I do.

805
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,680
- Okay, when are you gonna give that up?

806
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,560
'Cause I see like old guys skateboarding

807
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,920
and it's fucking depressing.

808
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,920
That is one of the best questions ever asked on this show.

809
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
When are you gonna give it up, man?

810
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
He's 23 years old.

811
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
We need an exact date, Patrick.

812
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Yeah, that's still young enough, though.

813
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Probably when I get bone spurs or some shit.

814
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,920
I think you have to stop when you're the oldest guy at the skate park.

815
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,920
No, 'cause even then, that's the guy who teaches the kids about the old skaters.

816
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Nobody fucking cares.

817
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Are you native American?

818
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,560
fucking well this is how Bucky Lasek did it no one gives a fuck people do no

819
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,000
skaters do

820
00:39:42,000 --> 00:40:01,360
I got this one right here I think 40 is a good age to yeah 17 years left to

821
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,780
skateboarding yeah yeah but like you still have guys like who are like the

822
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,120
best ever do it like Rodney Mullen who are like 80 years old and they're still

823
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,720
out there like just want to ride bro that's a goal they're gonna have a

824
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,040
senior tour they gotta get rich enough to have their own shit in their backyard

825
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,880
so they don't subject people to it yeah he's the original street skater bro he's

826
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,040
got to be on the streets you're thinking you're thinking of Mark Gonzalez Syria

827
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,800
you're getting all your history mixed up. I hate you dude. I fucking hate you. I wish I never asked you.

828
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,600
I can't believe you opened the Pandora's Box and brought up skateboarding.

829
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,040
Alright, so, I have a question though. I have a question to follow up Brant's question.

830
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,040
Does skateboarding have to do with the Filet-O-Fish idea? Look, I'm not gonna

831
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,200
talk about that right now. Oh, it could be a skateboarding trick. Filet-O-Fish could,

832
00:40:51,200 --> 00:41:01,880
that does Charles shut the fuck up yeah they keep um in in the in the new Tony

833
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,480
Hawk the remaster they keep renaming tricks for some reason they renamed

834
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,960
Smith grinds to Monty grinds cuz in the 2000 they're probably all like slurs that

835
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,840
they did yeah well yeah there's the Smith the Smith grind was originally called

836
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,560
that because it was a guy named Smith who ground like a minority's teeth into

837
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:24,800
the curve. That was a big problem. Let's change it to Monty Grind, because Monty was a guy

838
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,920
who ground a white guy's teeth into the ground. Yeah, Monty Python. They named it after Monty

839
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,320
Python. It's the dead parrot grind. But you're still riding Mongo in the game. Did they change

840
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,600
the Hitler air? No. No, the Hitler air stays. It's still you go up in the air and pretend

841
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:47,480
you're on a cross like Hitler. Yeah, and then they have the Hitler air to Mengele flip, and

842
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,560
still in there. Mangala Flip would be a great name for a skate trick honestly.

843
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,520
I think that a Mangala Flip is just when any white person moves to South America.

844
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,780
Also I think all these tricks would be less offensive if they were done by a cartoon

845
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,440
like why don't they have Bart Simpson in the game yet? They got Spiderman in it.

846
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,680
I think because it's in a game everybody does a cartoon. Spiderman does skateboard in Pro Skater 2.

847
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,620
No but fucking Bart Simpson actually skateboards in real life not just some

848
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:22,200
Well, he's a car. He made his own game. They had a Simpsons. Cars are you saying that spider-man's a poser and Bart Simpson is a real?

849
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,380
What I was a hundred percent. I legitimately believe that

850
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,940
Bart Simpson rides a cruiser. He doesn't even ride a real you better not fucking better. Watch yourself next time

851
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,520
You're in New York City talking in diapers. He can kick flip it though. Yeah

852
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,300
You're like my biggest problem about the old names in skating and you're not gonna tell him about Bart Simpson

853
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,980
I think Scott is the worst thing about skateboarding. Yeah. Yeah

854
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:51,580
Why do you not so much it it was just goldfinger and in pro skater - that's it our new

855
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:57,780
Is people still making skies Scott's the sweatiest doughiest guys all banging their heads together

856
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,380
like with t-shirts and checkered shoes I'm going like

857
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:10,440
And it is fucking epic it was really funny in like 15 years to make a ska band

858
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,540
I think yeah, I would love to maybe I'll get addicted to heroin and start playing a fucking p.s.

859
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,540
I'm like a bongo

860
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:25,620
What I think I'd be sick dude we have six people here we could form a scub and we oh my god

861
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,620
We need like three more guys on the whole

862
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,660
Play the trombone. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right. Cameron can play trombone. I can play bass

863
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,000
How does it make any money when there's nine of they don't you don't get paid in money?

864
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,800
You get paid in fucking Cameron Cameron knows all of the mighty mighty Boston's he knows all of them

865
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,880
I don't my parents know some of them, but

866
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,200
Now you know the point you're wrong

867
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,860
Number number four this girl hates Mondays

868
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:56,640
That's already

869
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,360
Here's and here's a comment

870
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,880
I think it's a good title because it can relate to any age really and you go wild with the song

871
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
in this girl's Garfield?

872
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Yeah, the female Garfield.

873
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,800
What emoji is that? That's the party horn emoji.

874
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,800
One of my friends growing up, his mother was referred to all of us by Garfield

875
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,800
because she had orange hair and she often complained.

876
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
That was it.

877
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,800
The thing about Garfield is that, say what you will about his comedy, but he was right about most things he said.

878
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
That's true.

879
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,300
History will vindicate him. I mean lasagna kicks ass. Yeah. Yeah

880
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:41,980
Dog shit. Yeah, it was a loser Odie was stupid as hell. Mm-hmm

881
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,180
Nermal don't even get me started. Nermal was straight up the devil. Uh-huh

882
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,580
That cat got the devil in him. Let me

883
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,480
know

884
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,640
Normal normal got the devil

885
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,720
normal often gets persecuted

886
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,520
What is the behavior of normal any worse than the behavior of Garfield himself?

887
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,720
No

888
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,720
Abuse odi and mock John relentlessly

889
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,840
Yeah, I gotta let normal go. Yeah, y'all know the prosecution may be

890
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,520
Confusing Garfield for for Heathcliff

891
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:29,160
See when he brought up the evidence about him being homeless

892
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:35,160
that that was that was Heathcliff that would not Garfield. I present to the

893
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:42,800
jury October 17th 1996 comic strip where Garfield kicks Odie off the table not

894
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,980
once not twice but three separate times and you gonna tell me normal is the

895
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:55,840
problem here? Garfield's so famous it would be hard to get him into court like

896
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,360
you know how they have to like find a place where the where the case isn't

897
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,480
well-known yeah put him in a put him in a crate that's true yeah he's a guy he's a

898
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,640
goddamn cat the guy that does all the drawings for the court cuz there's no

899
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,880
cameras a lot as Jim Davis

900
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,920
started it was a real story he drew the cat in court

901
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,280
Garfield looks in the original strips where Garfield is just like a fucking mountain of

902
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,280
fat shit.

903
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,280
Yeah.

904
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
Oh he looks...

905
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,280
It's like the original Simpsons, like season one they just look like fucking monsters.

906
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
They still look like monsters.

907
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,280
They look terrible.

908
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,280
Yeah.

909
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,080
But also they hadn't figured out the voices yet at the time.

910
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,840
Yeah it's like Burr's like "Wow, wow, Homer, where you at?"

911
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,440
It's like a fucking fever dream in the hotel.

912
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,520
Homer's like slippery, like he's like this like jelly that like slips through the episode

913
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:57,000
like just a guy chained to a bed trying to get off a heroin and he's just

914
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
imagining Tracy Oldman show Simpsons yeah I think that's what the Simpsons is I

915
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,280
need butterfingers right now I don't know what's going on I fucking need

916
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,440
butterfingers that's it do you guys think the Simpsons the people on the Simpsons

917
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,280
that are supposed to be white people.

918
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,200
Do you think they all smell like banana runs?

919
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,760
- Like Carl?

920
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,140
- Like banana runs?

921
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,120
- Yeah, I mean they're bright yellow.

922
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,400
- Oh, you're talking about a candy.

923
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,240
I thought you were talking about some--

924
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,080
- Are you insinuating that people just smell

925
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,640
like the candy that is their skin color?

926
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,560
- Yeah.

927
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,960
- So what do you smell like?

928
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,360
- Mahogany.

929
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,160
- Maybe I smell like fucking nougat.

930
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,200
- You are not nougat.

931
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,200
- My client has alabaster skin or the ivory complexion.

932
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,840
He do not represent Nougat in the slightest!

933
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,840
[laughter]

934
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,560
Uh, number five.

935
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,040
I'm gonna take a zero bar, baby.

936
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,840
[laughter]

937
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
Wait, zero bar is a fucking good--

938
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
Wait, zero bar is a fucking good--

939
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
--what Andrew was on trial for in that?

940
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,360
Yeah, no, zero bar is underrated.

941
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh, I'm a southern lawyer who only represents transracial clients.

942
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,880
[laughter]

943
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,160
So Nougat was the race he was trying to be?

944
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,800
Yeah, and he's obviously--

945
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,920
he looks like that French Moon movie.

946
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,920
Now I wanna talk about how I'm Portuguese.

947
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,920
Alright, that's all.

948
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,920
I'm from Brazil. That's where I'm from.

949
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,920
I'm from Brazil.

950
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,920
I'm from Brazil.

951
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,920
My client has clearly stated he is not white.

952
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
I wonder what he was.

953
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,920
Excuse my Cajun demeanor.

954
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,920
He is Acadian. He is not white.

955
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,920
I'm from Brazil. Or as I would say, "Bah-seel."

956
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,180
(laughing)

957
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,380
- My cousin Gambit.

958
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,640
(laughing)

959
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,060
- I wanna talk to y'all about a reggaeton.

960
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,120
(laughing)

961
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,720
- Y'all like Bad Bunny.

962
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,760
Y'all know Bad Bunny?

963
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,240
You gotta eat rain.

964
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,140
- Real quick, can I get a J Balvin meal, real quick?

965
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,880
- Can I get a J Balvin meal, real quick?

966
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,480
- Real quick, and I'm gonna get one of those.

967
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,980
- You don't know Baba Boss Simpson?

968
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,980
(laughing)

969
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,820
- See, basically he had invented a skateboard.

970
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,660
(laughing)

971
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,060
Basically he the first skateboard.

972
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,340
- Basically, it's a big green skateboard

973
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,100
with purple wheels and blue trucks.

974
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,500
- Boss Simpson, he from Baton Rouge.

975
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,260
I grew up with him in the swamp.

976
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,100
He from Baton Rouge.

977
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,820
- This little guy, he's a little prankster.

978
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,140
I never would've known because of his orange shirt.

979
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,940
He's got a big old bright old shirt.

980
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,300
- Y'all heard of him?

981
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,740
- In the movie, they showed his peggo.

982
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,860
(laughing)

983
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,700
- Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Wait around here,

984
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,540
look like a little shrimp.

985
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,940
- Wait around here a little bit.

986
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,300
- My boy Moe, he used to call Moe, right?

987
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,980
Moe, down in the swamp, Moe.

988
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,660
He used to call him with a wicked prank

989
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,980
from the devil brain, man.

990
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,820

00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,780
You got that good then, man.

00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,340
Don't get me started on mr. Burns

1000
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:19,200
Mr. Burns he could probably sell me out of voodoo. He got all the money

1001
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,340
But he he he he'll mean me he nasty

1002
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,940
I'm not gonna do I'm not gonna do the voice

1003
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,900
But I'm just imagining a black Israelite talking about how Smithers was once a black man

1004
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:45,380
help a he like Louisiana chupacabra I'm gonna skip ahead on this list just

1005
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,980
because uh there's a bunch of them um wait you're gonna skip number eight

1006
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,660
why don't you just rattle off I was gonna skip I was gonna skip I was gonna

1007
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,940
skip to number eight okay number eight is cookies and cream number eight okay

1008
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,440
- Okay, cookies, let's talk about that for 10 minutes.

1009
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,020
- Charles, go ahead, go ahead.

1010
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:07,180
- Charles, sing what you think cookies cream is right now.

1011
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,700
- I'm out cutting with a cookie monster.

1012
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,420
He loves our cookie cream.

1013
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,900
- Now you don't wanna get down to the bayou

1014
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,140
when you see the cookie monster.

1015
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,980
You don't wanna--

1016
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,380
- Now my dad says he looks like cookie and cream,

1017
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,020
but everyone focus on that cookie looking nice and dark,

1018
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,420
but there's cream not of a lot of complexion in the cookie.

1019
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,300
The cookies, your honor, are a fool's gold of some.

1020
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,820
within the cream. If you would make an amalgamation of the entire color you

1021
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:39,620
won't find that it is close to the cream. Now these were mega stuff cookies and

1022
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:50,020
cream let me tell you real quick. Number eight is the body of boys and the only

1023
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,460
comment is a bunch of question marks and exclamation points and then in all caps

1024
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,460
What?

1025
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,460
Can't do it man.

1026
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,460
He gets a pass because he's a middle school teenager.

1027
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,460
I guess so.

1028
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,460
He can talk about boys bodies all he wants.

1029
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,460
But you better cut that shit out.

1030
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,460
What's happened to this damn thing?

1031
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,460
This shit feel weird.

1032
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,460
Number 15, lip gloss stance.

1033
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,460
The top comment,

1034
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,460
"This is a great idea, it could have any meaning."

1035
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,460
That's just,

1036
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,460
isn't that a line from a train song?

1037
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:27,940
from a train song? Man shut up number 16 murderous miracle now this is my

1038
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,860
favorite comment here because this person wrote out the whole chorus. Hey

1039
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:34,260
buddy every murder is a miracle to me. Caleb will you sing the

1040
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,740

1041
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:45,540
goes how am I how oh sorry I fucked up. How I am that lonely in the stars where did I

1042
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:52,940
I'll go wrong and take this too far. I'm not gonna say it no more. No, no, I'm gonna have it all tour

1043
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:00,140
I'm not okay, and I promise I might punch life with my fist. Whoa is me. I'm in a full circle

1044
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,100
Oh, baby, it was all right from here like a murderous miracle

1045
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:12,260
Pretty good. It's a good chorus. Yeah, it says it reminds them of a 90s grunge rock song with teen angst lyrics from

1046
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,920
2000 emo song I had cam set this whole thing up so I can do one of y'all songs

1047
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:26,000
Had a time to long vibe to it. I'm I was getting a vibe. Oh, that's the only band I've ever

1048
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:38,580
Song with that title and those lyrics already so you have to come up with something new fuck. Can you do an Owl City voice?

1049
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,280
Which one is our city?

1050
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,640
Firefly a million

1051
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,640
You would not believe your eyes

1052
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,240
fireflies

1053
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,880
Pretty good pretty good dude. I knew those two guys in Cajun voice so

1057
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:19,280
Fruit Seattle

1058
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,560
Bullshit, that's what I call it. That's what the flavor I call it bullshit. What the fuck is a large?

1059
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,560
Can I get a venti coffee, please?

1060
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:30,880
It was such to be the the barista at the coffee shop where Dennis Leary goes every day

1061
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,600
Like you know the fuck I'm gonna say

00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600

And she's like, "You want a black coffee?"

1064
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,080
And he's like, "Fuck, yeah."

1065
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,140
(laughter)

1066
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,340
No, actually, can I try one of those frappuccinos?

1067
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,640

1068

Yeah.

1071
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,920
Number 22 is kind of like a riff on a Korn song here.

1072
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,260
It's N-I-K-E.

1073

"It just makes me want to throw someone in a volcano.

1088
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,880
"It's weird."

1089
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,720
- Yeah, Branson's just lighting

1090
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,460

1091
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,700
(laughing)

1092
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,220
She's like, "What the fuck is this, dude?"

1093
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,780

That's what this fucking candle smells like, yo.

1095
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,140
It smells exactly like Jersey.

It smells like fucking Hoboken and North Bergen.

1097
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,340
It smells like fucking Santeria, I'm telling you.

1098
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,340

1099
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,180
Silly, you fuckin' grab his ass. It fuckin' stinks.

1100
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,180
[laughter]

1101
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:21,720
Sounds like Joe Rogan's head in the hot Austin heat, dog. Real shit.

1102
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,180
Yeah, that man's fuckin' sweatin' in there.

00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,180
That's where he fuckin'.

1104
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,340
I don't even know what voice that is. That didn't even sound like Joey Diaz.

1105
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:29,840
I don't know.

1106
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,840
It's a kind of a monster...

1107
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,840
Yeah, that's what he sounds like.

1108
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,840
It sounds like a five-foot-two...

1109
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
I sound like Joey Diaz having a stroke.

1110
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
[laughter]

1111
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,340
A genius.

00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,620
Yeah man, my fuckin' arm stopped working before I got here.

1113
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,060
I'm basically just gonna ignore it.

1114
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,940
Yeah I don't know what's happening but my whole left fuckin' side, my whole left side has stopped

1115
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,940

*gibberish*

1129
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
*gibberish*

1130
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
*gibberish*

1131
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,300

1132
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,300

1134
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
for like 10 minutes because they think he's just telling a story

1135
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,300
in a wild and he's guessing

1136
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,300
on the bottom of his lungs

1137
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,300
they think he's just clearing his throat

1138
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,300
*laughter*

1139
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,420
(mumbling)

1140
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,740
- Joe just in there, what the fuck, that is crazy, man.

1141
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,420
- Wow, really, wow.

1142
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,580
- That's possible, I'll tell you that much.

1143
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,580
- He says, you're doing like a sling blade impression.

1144
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,460
(laughing)

1145
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,020
- He says, his whole fucking body went limp

1146
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,300
on the right side, Jamie, did we get that?

1147
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,140
(laughing)

1148
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,700
- Replay that, replay that, Jamie.

1149
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,780
- Come on.

1150
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,820
- He does the entire speech fucking Brad Dorff's character

1151
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,980
does in Child's Play when he's possessing Chucky,

1152
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,380
he's like, "Depella!"

1153
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,020
(laughter)

1154
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,260
- Patrick, I thought you were gonna say the Exorcist 3.

1155
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,500
- Hey, that's what I thought you were gonna say too.

1156
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,540
- I believe in slime.

1157
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,140
(laughter)

1158
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,260
- That's a great movie.

1159
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,100
- It's such a good movie.

1160
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,860
- It's the best, okay, so the best Exorcist number three,

00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,940
best Halloween number three, best--

1162
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,100
- Yeah, no, I agree.

1163
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,780
- Nightmare on Elm Street number three.

1164
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,580
- Yeah, okay, I'm with you on that one.

1165
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,380
- We're both-- - We're all shit.

1166
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,660
- I disagree about Halloween,

1167
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,700

00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,140
- It's a really good point. - I brought it up!

1178
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:01,980
Charles didn't even know what to do with the bow.

1179
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,900
- Let's talk about small soldiers again.

1180
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,940
- Dude, I could go, I could--

1181
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,300
- I forgot, I mentioned punching,

1182
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,340
I didn't remember his little bite

1183
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,180
that sits on his shoulders. - You see this?

1184
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,140
I'm gonna pee on it.

1185
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,740
I'm gonna pee on it right now. - Do not pee on my book.

1186
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,580
- This little guy-- - Do not pee on my book.

1187
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,020
- This little guy that sits on his shoulders,

1188
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,240
there's punch it, there's scratch it.

1189
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,860
Punch it's the big guy 'cause he punches it,

1190
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,880
and the little guy's the smack. - I'm peeing right here.

1191
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,220
- Do not pee on it.

1192
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,260
- Pee on the signature, dude. - Do not pee on my signature.

1193
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,100
Take care of that thing.

1194
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,940
- He wrote, his signature says dumbass.

1195
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:28,020
- Hey, I guess I'll have to get your book and pee on it.

1196
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,700
Oh, fucking wait.

1197
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,540
- Hey, we have a book.

1198
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,380
We have a book. - We do have a book.

1199
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,280
We have a book.

1200
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,120
- Okay, you have a book.

1201
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,940
You have a copy.

1202
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,060
I love that.

1203
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,900
- It's a PDF. - Oh wait, here's a title

1204
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,980
for your book.

1205
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,220
List about list.

1206
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:42,580
- Okay, that's the next one. - Oh my God.

1207
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,420
- Here's a title for your book.

1208
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,500
- Yeah, you guys can write us the check right now

1209
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,320
if you want to.

1210
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,160
We can figure it out offhand.

1211
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,980
- Yeah, sure.

1212
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,020
I'm writing it right now.

1213
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:53,020
Zero dollars and one cent to poopy head McStupidpants.

1214
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,260
Whoa!

1215
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,700
How are we gonna cash that?

1216
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,100
Wait, do we just start a beef?

1217
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,820
It's actually the Come Drinking Guys LLC.

1218
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,740
(laughing)

1219
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,860
It was a joke, it just kinda stuck,

1220
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,300
it's weird at the bank.

1221
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:11,020
Ours legitimately is Birdbrain Media, LLC.

1222
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,060
Ours is Sullivan the Frog Enterprises.

1223
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,900
(laughing)

1224
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,820
It's so funny when we have to go to the banks and shit

1225
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:25,560
set up the accounts because like bird brain. The banker at Chase was like, when I'm walking

1226
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,000
out the door, he's like, I'm just curious, I'm just gonna ask. He's like, what is the

1227
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,040
podcast about? And I'm like, gah. Mostly b-ball. I'm like, it's about getting pussy. That's

1228
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,360
what swag is. Have a nice day, sir. I don't know, who cares? It's about finding your own

1229
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,560
business. It's about being CEOs of fucking cash, pussy. We were wondering the other day

1230
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:51,400
whether we or you guys have worse SEO. True. It's pretty impossible to Google.

1231
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,760
Right. I mean you're just gonna find Star Wars prequels if you look up episode 1,

1232
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:00,680
right? Right. That's how we remain kind of underground. It's kind of cool. Yeah.

1233
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:06,200
You guys are like the Talib Kweli of podcasts. Yeah, we have all the same hats. I got a lot of...

1234
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,920
We're gonna mash up all the E1 episodes with the Ocarina of Time

1235
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,280
soundtrack mm-hmm damn that would be pimp is fly that's just a fucking fire talk

1236
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,840
just put it in the background oh shit they're talking about being cops but

1237
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,600
also I love this game what's up I just want to read one more one more from this

1238
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:32,400
list and then I'll never feel the fucking fillet of shut up number 49 is

1239
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:40,080
the queen of the good girls and then in parentheses that rocked everybody see

1240
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:49,280
I'm interested. Who's this? Annie Kaminsky? The hottest girl in school. The goodest girl in school. Turns out she can rock.

1241
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:56,000
Damn. That's crazy. That's the ultimate male fantasy. Do you guys think that she's like doing a guitar solo?

1242
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,320
Maybe. She's Lita Ford. She's an elected prom queen and she does a guitar solo? Dude, they put Lita Ford as the prom queen.

1243
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,640
You gotta bite your knuckles in the whole thing like...

1244
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:13,040
Dude, Slash is the prom queen this year. He looks so beautiful in that gown.

1245
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,880
And the prom king.

1246
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,400
He got a quinceanera dress and he's wearing it to prom.

1247
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,160
God damn he's pretty.

1248
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,200
They have prom in November so they can play November Rain.

1249
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,120
Prom king is Axl Rose and they perform One in a Million.

1250
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:32,240
Their most famous song with the best lyrics that are not racist.

1251
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,320
Is Slash still doing like Super Bowls and shit?

1252
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,320
I think so.

1253
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:42,640
I think the Super Bowl is mostly football nowadays actually.

1254
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,840
Yeah.

1255
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,000
It's Pepsi and commercials and football.

1256
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,120
It's so cool how it'll be like still like 2019 or whatever, 2020, and it's like, yeah

1257
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,640
we got the Rolling Stones and halfway through Slash comes up on a platform.

1258
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,520
Like everyone that liked these bands are fucking 90 man, like who gives a fuck?

1259
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,520
They got their weekend at Bernie and Slash.

1260
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,520
Get BTS out there or some shit. What the fuck are we doing?

1261
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,520
Please put BTS on there dude.

1262
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,520
BTS, Ariana Grande, and Pete Davidson.

1263
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Yep. Pete Davidson as Eminem.

1264
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,520
In the middle of the song.

1265
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,520
Wait, why do you guys want BTK to do a halftime?

1266
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,520
BTK fancam.

1267
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,520
He'd just be cool.

1268
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,520
He'd just be fucking swag.

1269
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Oh my god, should BTK just pull out the leather straps?

1270
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,520
Am I fucking alive right now?

1271
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,520
Is this a dream?

1272
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,020
Dude, look at it. He's not allowing his family into the basement.

1273
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,520
That's so fucking sick.

1274
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:41,520
Y'all really said that BTK wouldn't be sniffing snow panties on the stage tonight, but then this?

1275
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,020
[laughter]

1276
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:48,020
How did, uh, he, uh, I always wondered that. How did he convince his family there's just a whole room

1277
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,020
and you just can't go in there?

1278
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,020
It's his man cave.

1279
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,520
Yeah.

1280
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,020
Yeah.

1281
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,020
Yeah, but like you can't even look in there.

1282
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,020
He's just like, "I'm doing trains and stuff in there."

1283
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,020
Because he was a violent man and probably intimidated his family.

1284
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,700
You know what I bet he did? I bet he kept being like, uh, like kind of sarcastic.

1285
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:08,460
They were like, "Hey, Dad, what's in the basement?" He'd be like, "Oh, it's a bunch of murder shit and dead women."

1286
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:13,020
Yeah, totally. Yeah. Oh, no, seriously, go take a look.

1287
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,020
Oh, yeah. Whatever, man. I guess I'll do the dishes.

1288
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,020
If you can get past the dead bolts.

1289
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,020
Yeah, if you can unlock the door, there's definitely a woman's head in there.

1290
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,020
Dad, you're so lame. We hate you.

1291
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:26,020
He'd come out of his secret room and be like, "Oh, do not go in there."

1292
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,820
(laughter)

1293
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,280
- And everyone just thought it was like a secret bathroom

1294
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,820
where you go and take secret shits like Arnold's grandpa

1295
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,780
and Hey Arnold that everyone got mad about.

1296
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,180
When they found out he had a secret bathroom

1297
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,440
where he went to take shits.

1298
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,880
When he was like, I'll be in my office.

1299
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,980
Like no, he's going to shit again.

1300
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,180
Which is all he had I guess, I don't know.

1301
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,620
(laughter)

1302
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,460
- That's how he--

1303
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,620
- Anyone remember that, remember?

1304
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:50,100
- No I don't, no we don't remember that.

1305
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,100
I'm just Widow Babies.

1306
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,940
- We don't know.

1307
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,980
- Remember the song titles after that one we just read?

1308
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,020
'cause they get, the quality kinda drops off a little.

1309
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:58,940
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1310
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,780
- What's the worst one you think?

1311
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:04,260
- Like number 50, not your typical teen pop rock song.

1312
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,060
- Yeah, I did. - Bro, see now that's cool,

1313
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:10,100
'cause like some guys are rockers, you know?

1314
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,620
Like me, I'm a rocker.

1315
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,420
- Some guys in East LA walk up to you and say,

1316
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,860
"Hey, fool, are you a rocker?"

1317
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,920
- Hey man, you like Rock Band 3?

1318
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:23,180
You like Guitar Hero 3 and shit, real shit?

1319
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,180
You playing cool for cats?

1320
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,180
Damn this guy likes Megadeth, he's one crazy gringo.

1321
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,180
Damn.

1322
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:33,180
Are you playing Alex Chilton on drums?

1323
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,180
Bro you playing LA Noir right now bro?

1324
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,180

1325
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,180
You wanna go back to my house and watch me play LA Noir and shit?

1326
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,180
Fuckin crazy story bro.

1327
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,180

01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,860
- If you listen to the beginning of this episode,

1343
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,840
you'll hear a lot of references that will make sense

1344
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,700
now that you've finished the episode.

1345
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,540

1347
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,880

1348
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,480
and together we make a great combination.

1349
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,940

- 'Cause we're the crunch.

1353
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,580
- We're the cream 'cause we fill you up.

1354
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,780

1355
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,260

1361
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,480
- Patrick is talking to all the MILF listeners

1362
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,840
that the chat list has.

1363
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,200
- Yeah, we have a huge--

1364
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,680

1365
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,280
in their Versace robes with their big boobies.

1366
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,280
- Yeah, big boobies and tiny legs.

1367
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,920
- Their glasses on and they read their Kindle

1368
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,760
while they listen to this show.

1369
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,360
- Yeah, oil night, exactly.

1370
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,120
- Yeah, those are our most oil listeners.

1371
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,440
- Their glasses are huge by the fucking point.

1372
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,120
- If you want a nice man to come up

1373
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,160
and zip the back of your ballroom dress.

1374
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,680
I think Pat's your guy, dude.

1375
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:17,880
Give him a call.

1376
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,000
Hey, if he can reach it.

1377
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,160
And then the MILF is like,

1378
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,840
Patrick, what is the Filet-O-Fish idea, by the way?

1379
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,040
Oh yeah, you do have to tell us.

1380
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,560
I said I'd say it, you know what?

1381
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,800
We did do two hours of this.

1382
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,400
I gotta give you the Filet-O-Fish idea, all right.

1383
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,240
You have to.

1384
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,360
Are you guys, I can see you're all sitting down.

1385
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,840
I'm leaning forward, I got my arms folded.

1386
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,680
I'm just--

1387
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,520
Yeah, I got my hand down my pants,

1388
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,360
even though I already know it.

1389
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,640
Take a big bite of this giant edible that is all melded together.

1390
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,840
So just eat it like it's...

1391
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,840
Alright.

1392
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
A thousand milligrams.

01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840

Dude, don't eat that!

1396
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,840
It looks like a bunch of erasers melted together.

1397
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,880
No, eat that, you're gonna need it.

1398
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,880
You're gonna need it after this.

1399
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,880
It looks like a Rubik's Cube.

1400
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,880
You're gonna have a crazy 10pm.

1401
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,600
You gotta nibble a little bit.

1402
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,640
The filet-o-fish idea.

1403
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,760
It's more cheese.

1404
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,880
