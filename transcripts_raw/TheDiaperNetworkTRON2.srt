1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Last time on the Diaper Network Tron, Mark, Eduardo, and the Finger Bros were sucked into

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,440
the computer into the Diaper Talk site, now run by the villainous self-replicating program

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,840
from filled completely who has been sucking in diaper talk power users.

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,200
Also, he can I'm just waiting for you. I'm not doing anything. You do seem

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,280
tense. Just relax, man. Chill out. You want a beer? I'll go get the beer. I

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,640
don't want a beer. I want a beer

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,080
who has been sucking in diaper talk power users. Also, he can try to destroy

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,480
his creators, which would be you three

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,960
after sucking you in you three found yourselves imprisoned in a in a cell in

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,800
the website where you met the power user Joe music. Nineteen seventy six, who

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,240
sought your help in destroying the field completely programmed. Then you then you

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,280
three were forced to participate. It's so quiet

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,760
then you three were forced to participate in the play play games where

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,140
compete with the fellow power users for supremacy and access to the next level

15
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,840
of the diaper talk site. In this case, the Tinkle layer.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,760
During the final round of the games, the diap cycle race, you almost died.

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,440
So you opted to escape the deadly games free aided by Joe Music,

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,480
1976, who began to lead, escape the deadly games aided by free,

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,460
He did by Joe music 1976 and begin to lead you to a ship the SS nappy

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,200
pursued by two flippers flying diapers that hunt those who disobey filled

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
completely.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,160
You three just barely made it look like a bass player in like a seventies music

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,800
video to the wedding way.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,040
You got to talk into the mic if you're going to, um, we're talking,

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
we're having, we're goofing off.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,560
You got to goof off into the mic. So don't I look like a bass player?

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,160
And like, uh, when you see like a new wave music video,

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,340
He's like the ugliest guy in the world.

29
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,140
You look like Christopher Gass in Spinal Tap a bit.

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,940
That's pretty good.

31
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,440
Yeah.

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,940
See the...

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,340
Yeah.

34
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,340
Pursued by two flippers, flying diapers and hunt...

35
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,840
Where the fuck was I?

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,340
Oh, yeah.

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,040
You made it to the wedding way where you'll now be able to

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,740
travel all around the website and enter the Tinkle Air.

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,240
However, you made sure that Joe Music 1976 died.

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,240
He told you how to defeat filled completely and on his ship

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
there is a navigation panel that can help lead you to key locations.

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Turkey locations?

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I heard turkey locations as well.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
No, tequila, tequila.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Tequila!

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Tequila!

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Tequila!

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Tequila-cation.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Ooh, that's what I have, like echolocation.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Dream of tequila location.

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Which we will go over now. So, it seems like I got, I got about 33% attention on it. Do you guys need me to repeat anything?

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Nope.

53
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,120
I heard every we were going to the place and then we got interrupted.

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,160
We're going to we have access to the hamburger.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,560
You're like 300 and there's hot dogs.

56
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
There's hot dogs and hamburgers that are flying over for us.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

58
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,240
But now our objective is to now we have to kill the king.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,720
Pretty much. So what you have to do is it's a couple of things.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
This is from last time.

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,280
So, uh, you do have to get the hashed code from an outside user to do that.

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Uh, Juby, did you have the map still from a little bit ago?

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
I can, I can re-send.

64
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,240
Oh, I'm running a minute.

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,400
Okay.

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
I'll keep talking in the meantime.

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Um, so you guys have to go get the, get the hashed code, which you have to go to

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
the emergency mass communication tower.

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,120
A hash coding slasher.

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,000
When you go there to the tower, you'll be able to contact somebody on the outside.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,560
You eat pepperoni who will be able to provide you there.

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,280
It is you eat with the hashed code.

73
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,920
So where you guys are right now is you're at that ship.

74
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
You guys see that on the map?

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,680
What? Sorry. What's the ship?

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,640
The S.S. Nappy. That's Joe Music 1976 ship.

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,680
Oh, the the thing that those lines.

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
Oh, it's a fucking toilet bowl, isn't it?

79
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
It goes from it.

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,880
Wait, that's a sperm going into an egg, bro.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,140
it's a fucking toilet. It's a no look guys. It's a sperm going into an and

82
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,040
we're going to Japan. It looks like that does that is the Japanese flag is a

83
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,200
Japanese flag. You were in Japan and you left so by the way, Japan, Japan,

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,740
whoa, good job with that flag man. Not

85
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,520
you can't call them that I did not. I said Japan. I was going to say Japanese

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,320
and then you cut me off of the whoa. We have the map back up.

87
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Okay, so you guys made it to the ss nap. You actually have two of your dipe

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,420
cycles on there too. So you guys can ride all around the wedding way, which is that circumference,

89
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,420
right?

90
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,020
Well, where's the hash code?

91
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,020
The hash code's at that emergency mass communication tower.

92
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
Oh, then we're going there.

93
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,180
So here's the thing. The SSNappy will allow you to ride the wedding way across all the

94
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:24,500
perimeter, but it can't let you penetrate any further into the website.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,860
So you'll have to go around, but then you can park yourself there basically and then

96
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,060
Make your way through the Tinkle Lair to the Emergency Mass Communication Tower.

97
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Okay, let's do that then.

98
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,060
Okay, cool.

99
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,360
So, as you guys are riding the wedding way, on the main comms screen of the SS Nappy,

100
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,140
you see the screen comes up.

101
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,140
Here.

102
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,140
Joe Music 1976?

103
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,140
Are you there?

104
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,260
Hello?

105
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,680
You're not Joe Music 1976.

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
He couldn't make it actually.

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,560
He died from cancer.

108
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,780
And by that we mean he's out in the yard.

109
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,500
playing. He died from bowel cancer. Roll, I guess, like one of you roll, all of you

110
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,420
roll deception. All you roll talking and we'll just sort of figure it. You got 19.

111
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:18,300
Plus you're talking. I got a 13. I'm talking. I got an 18. 12. Yeah, that all

112
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,940
passes this person. Oh, move the how terrible. This isn't going to be useful.

113
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,940
I think you should roll it on the table.

114
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,740
I

115
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,040
well,

116
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,240
were you guys his friends in prison?

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,040
No,

118
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,640
we didn't like him at all.

119
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,540
So we killed him.

120
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
Shut the fuck

121
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,040
with kindness.

122
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,440
I killed one of the twins.

123
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,640
You kill one of the twins.

124
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,840
Okay, eat one of the twins.

125
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,040
There's one of the roll.

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,340
What do I roll?

127
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
Roll to eat?

128
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,540
It's also talking talking

129
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,040
because it looks like a me out.

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,760
That's an 11. Can you roll to not be eaten?

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,360
Seven. All right. Which one gets eaten? Which one?

132
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,840
Which ones are there?

133
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,600
Whoa. And hello. And hello.

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,280
OK, if I roll 11 or higher, I'll eat.

135
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,120
Whoa. OK. One to roll.

136
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,840
I want to use some abilities.

137
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,000
The other one. No, wait, don't don't do that because I'll lose abilities.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm making it easy for you.

139
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,920
No, no, no. Because I have the role of my head into the system.

140
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,000
All of my abilities, all of my abilities are twin based.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,320
least I'll be your twin yeah. That's my plan. You if you agree that you are my

142
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,080
twin now, okay, you can eat my twin. I rolled a thirteen. What did I say that

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,280
man said? Whoa gets okay, why? So okay, so now this actually would make it to

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,680
our to make more sense as a character. So he's now just because he's a werewolf

145
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,640
yeah exactly. Oh yeah, I forgot you're a werewolf. You forgot you're in charge.

146
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,680
Yeah, I remember that's why it's been a while.

147
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Whoa! Bye-bye!

148
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Now it's just hello?

149
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Bye-bye, whoa!

150
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Describe your kill.

151
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
I open my mouth and I swallow him.

152
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
He opened my mouth.

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
I open... yeah.

154
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
So, meanwhile, the person

155
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
on the comms says,

156
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
"I'm Sissy Boy...

157
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
where is the name? SissyBaby34."

158
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
This guy doesn't even know his own

159
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
fucking name.

160
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
How did he get this job as an announcer guy?

161
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm not an announcer guy.

162
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,320
I'm a member of the Leaky Legends.

163
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,240
I was Joe Music's 1976's contact.

164
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,640
- Whoa, my brother is gone.

165
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
- Hello.

166
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,720
- What up?

167
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
What up?

168
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,600
Listen, Joe Music, all right,

169
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,240
we didn't want to tell you, but he did die.

170
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,960
- I know you did tell, you told me right away.

171
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,720
- We killed him with kindness.

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,200
- No, we killed him brutally

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,160
by throwing him off of a motorcycle.

174
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,240
- Oh, yes.

175
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,100
- Why?

176
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,400
because he wasn't that fun man.

177
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Are you you better be fun or we'll do the same. Tell me a joke. Tell me a

178
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,780
no, tell us a joke. Tell us a joke you turn crazy. Tell us a street to see

179
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,560
baby thirty four turns the comes off

180
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,960
calling back. Wait here, call back yeah.

181
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm a woman

182
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,100
hello. I'm a woman doesn't pick up shit man. Why did we do

183
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,580
Okay, I throw the twin back up. No, you guys ride. Hello, you guys ride around.

184
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,960
Hello. Whoa, shut up. You guys ride around the wedding way. Okay, until you

185
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,740
do reach

186
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,360
right outside of the

187
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
emergency mass communication tower.

188
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,080
So, to get through to there, there is a

189
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,900
sort of layer of... Well, I'll describe it to you.

190
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,080
So there's yellowish waters with sparklish glint.

191
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,000
- Sure, waters.

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,880
- This is where many of the microservices

193
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,120
that make up the diaper network make API calls.

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,400
You'll notice the many shimmering glistening glares

195
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,740
that spark through.

196
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,160
- Oh wait, I have a twin over there.

197
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,520
- These are the data that fly across the globe

198
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,800
replicated 1,000 times per second.

199
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,720
Occasionally you'll find a floating garden

200
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,820
with whirling machinery.

201
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,680
These are nodes where worker programs

202
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,520
man the microservices.

203
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,960
- Could've had that the whole time.

204
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,820
- One for updating user information,

205
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,020
sending a message, one for up-diping, down-diping, one for translating diaper

206
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,820
comments from sissy to bull. So...

207
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Sissy to bull?

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
What's bull?

209
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,520
Bull is in the diaper world, I think is like a tough guy or something.

210
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,020
Now tell me why you know that.

211
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Because I freaking went on the website.

212
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,120
Check it out. I made a profile.

213
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,920
So you guys are...

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,720
You made a profile ten years ago, maybe?

215
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
No.

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,920
Back when you were in diapers?

217
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Sheesh.

218
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
[laughter]

219
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,860
I wasn't in diapers at thirty five man

220
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,640
so you guys are we'll be back in them soon enough. So you guys are sort of

221
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,620
looking out at this layer, this tinkle layer and you're seeing you could see

222
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,980
the communication note. It is this sort of like blue cone that's like pointing

223
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,840
upwards and inside of it is the terminal that you need to use to communicate with

224
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,060
somebody on the outside to get the hash code. You're going to need to go through

225
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,200
this like sort of like swim through this like tinkle layer and there are flippers

226
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,040
trolling the area. So you have to be careful.

227
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,340
We have to swim through the P. I thought we were on a ship. I didn't say it was

228
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,780
P. No, the ship can't pass through. What about the motorcycles? You can try to

229
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,900
use the motorcycles. Okay, I'm gonna try that then. Okay.

230
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,380
And it sounds like I just successfully used it. Done. What you can do is you

231
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,480
can... Well, hold on, don't just roll. I'm just... I put some triggers in my

232
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,060
brain to hear certain words. One of you guys can roll an intelligence

233
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,700
check to see if you can like okay, basically, I think I have the highest

234
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,620
and tell like what his name does in what Jeff Bridges does what's wrong where he

235
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,100
programs plus three mine's plus one. I ruled in my entire yeah, but maybe my

236
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,340
character is a little more heart. Okay, I'm gonna roll now.

237
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,500
You should have rolled. Yeah, I got a five. Okay, so you sort of assess the

238
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,020
motorcycles. Now we can keep we can go down. He can roll with advantage because

239
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,500
he's the smartest. No, we can go down. You try to assess the motorcycles and it

240
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,300
seems like code that you probably didn't write something I filled

241
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,300
completely might have created. So this has to be the code that I wrote.

242
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,020
Let me take a step. If you didn't write this, this is probably some of

243
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,140
the code I wrote. You can take a step. I don't think you wrote any

244
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,020
code. No, I wrote code like A equals one, B equals two, C equals three.

245
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,020
I don't think you wrote that. I wrote that and I put messages to

246
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,820
you. Did you ever read them? I guess I don't remember reading these.

247
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,500
oh, they said things like hello, friend, hi, friend, lovely, hello,

248
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,060
friend. Oh, that's a net twenty wow on didn't even get picked up with a

249
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,140
cop. I'll move it over see

250
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,380
this is a lost cause yeah, it's nothing

251
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,100
so

252
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,460
you got in that twenty. So yeah,

253
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:01,500
a torto wolf man. This is very much the only piece of code you wrote yeah was

254
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,980
to make dive site. One of the many piece of code I read that had like nothing

255
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,820
you wrote. Why do you write our website to have motorcycles in it man?

256
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,780
My uncle had a motorcycle. I always thought it was kind of cool, but it's

257
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,020
not

258
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,980
fix it. Just do I check this out and I press a button on the motorcycle and it

259
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,700
a bunch of screens pops up and it starts advertising cat food. This is actually

260
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,340
great because you did way that could earn money. This is actually earns us

261
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,300
about point two cents a day. That adds up. Whoa, this is your business savvy.

262
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,220
This is good. This is good for you because there wasn't there was a you

263
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,700
found a good way to suit. There was a

264
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,980
well. I'll explain to you after this is done. This is a very smart decision. So

265
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,980
So you have these really good motorcycles now that are able to travel across the

266
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,980
Tinkle layers. The wheels go on sideways.

267
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,300
Yeah, they go on the side. That's actually bad.

268
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Yeah, I go, "Check this out, guys. I wrote this code. I know how to modify it."

269
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,700
And I reach out and I grab the wheel and I go...

270
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,140
[laughter]

271
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,580
I turn it all the way sideways.

272
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,060
So the thing is, is, you know, what you'll give up in like the stealth of

273
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,540
like slowly moving through, you'll more than make up for in the speed of just

274
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
darting directly to the

275
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,300
emergency mass communication tower. I like speed. Oh, did I just say that

276
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,600
whoa?

277
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,180
Did you just say that you guys I guess are writing the same motorcycle. Are

278
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,660
you guys writing the same motorcycle? Because you I'm on the back of what he

279
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,900
threw our motorcycle. Yeah, he threw up that he's making us

280
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,900
rattling to motorcycles. I was like

281
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,100
you wrote a piece of code that gives you like a

282
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,520
like you remember the fucking the

283
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,640
platforms that Buzz Lightyear walks

284
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,900
across in Toy Story 2.

285
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,940
You're standing you're standing on

286
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,700
just like a little hover disc next to

287
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
us and just like

288
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,540
most motorcycles.

289
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,020
And I have both my I have my arms

290
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,820
around each of your shoulders.

291
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,100
I wanted to eat one of those.

292
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
So me too.

293
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,020
Oh, my God. They looked like

294
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Mentos. Delicious.

295
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,980
They looked like Mentos.

296
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,300
And I like with an electrical

297
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
charge.

298
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,220
Past the some of the flippers

299
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,580
that were before they even can get

300
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,300
to get like pay attention to you

301
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,780
when you arrive at the emergency

302
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,720
- Nice, mass communication tower.

303
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,360
- He's getting so good at that.

304
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,520
- Again, it's sort of like blue,

305
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,340
like multiple triangles kind of folded into one another.

306
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,920
Not quite like a pyramid,

307
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,640
but more like a sort of a weird cone shape.

308
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,680
- And then you see an advertisement for a hot dog.

309
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
- And there's a small door inside.

310
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
- And you see an advertisement and it says this.

311
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,220
- Time to eat hamburger.

312
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,080
- We all kind of stop and we're transfixed.

313
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,000
- Time to eat that hamburger.

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
- And actually when you guys arrive there.

315
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:44,880
time to eat that's hot dog ketchup. You hear Sissy Baby 34 in the distance like a

316
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:54,200
"Come here!" I yelled that. Well Sissy Baby doesn't quite notice you because he's in the

317
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I don't know why he made this sight. He's in the middle of fighting a fliper.

318
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
He's half made this sight.

319
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
So he's in the middle of fighting flipers and you see them in the background.

320
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
So you guys can either engage with that or just sneak in.

321
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
I want to kill that fucking baby.

322
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I drive directly into the baby.

323
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I'm nuts. No, you're not getting off that easy, sissy baby.

324
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm going to drive directly into you and I'm going to bisect you.

325
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Okay, so you're gonna kill him.

326
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I mean the sound effect said that it happened.

327
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,200
So just keep in mind, Sissy Baby is fighting the Fliper.

328
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
So if you attack Sissy Baby, the Fliper...

329
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I don't care man, I'm in a rage.

330
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
You don't care either way.

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
I'm gonna rip his arms off.

332
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Okay, so why don't you roll an attack roll.

333
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
(Screams)

334
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Eight.

335
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,200
And yeah, so you run up to Sissy Baby, who is in the middle of fighting a Fliper,

336
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
and you just miss. You just sort of go to grab...

337
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I try again.

338
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Yeah, and you don't try again.

339
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
That was a 20.

340
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
That would have been nice.

341
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Bitch.

342
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
That's a 20.

343
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
It has to work.

344
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Instead, initiative starts.

345
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Did you guys follow him or no?

346
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
No.

347
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm on the back of both their cycles.

348
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Yeah, we're doing our own thing.

349
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Well, you wouldn't have parked your cycles at this point.

350
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Well, yeah, we're watching the hamburger ad.

351
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I jumped off of my shit, though.

352
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,480
I guess I'm a bloodthirsty animal of the night.

353
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,960
I want to kill this fucking communication tower or you can fight them.

354
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,600
I think I'm going to go to the communication tower while they fight the baby.

355
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Okay, cool.

356
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,560
And I'm going to get the hex code and save the day.

357
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Okay, cool.

358
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,240
So both of you guys roll initiative since you guys are fighting sissy baby and now another and a flipper five

359
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,280
Eight would you say that the this battle is explicit in nature

360
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,880
Sexually no not necessarily you're talking about are you saying that it's sexual?

361
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:44,340
Nobody can see you're so stupid man. How is it? No it'll all be revealed a d20 for me

362
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,060
You're just dumb. So I have like 2 d12s and 0 d20s.

363
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,300
Don't slap my dice.

364
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,060
Wherever you put it, you had one for certain.

365
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,980
I'll snatch your wig.

366
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,980
Don't you dare!

367
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,660
Will somebody get patches of an extra d20? He lost his.

368
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,020
No, I did not lose it.

369
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,700
[Laughter]

370
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,580
Jesus Christ.

371
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Where is Sissy Baby's stats?

372
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,580
[Laughter]

373
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,340
Sissy Baby is fast.

374
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
I forgot.

375
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:23,560
Okay. I was doing a drag race impression. Sissy baby. I was acting like a gay guy.

376
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:31,320
Okay cool, so sissy baby's gonna go first. What type of gay guy? Just one of those ones that dresses up like a lady but isn't a lady.

377
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:39,120
Sissy baby's gonna go first. Sissy baby's gonna go, "I knew you were a program. No way the great Zuckerberg would do this."

378
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Come here!

379
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,560
Oh yeah, right. So, and Sissy Boob's gonna try to attack you.

380
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Why?

381
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,040
But he misses terribly. He goes to attack you with his rattle.

382
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I look so sad.

383
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
He just misses terribly.

384
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,240
Why don't you fucking... What are you doing, man?

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
You attacked me.

386
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,680
No, I wasn't. I was trying to... You dropped something. I was trying to pick it up for

387
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
you.

388
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Roll deception.

389
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,800
It's an 11. No.

390
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,120
But you add your talking to 14.

391
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,160
I'm... I don't know. I don't know.

392
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
of opportunity I rip his head off.

393
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
It is, it is. First it's Ed's turn.

394
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Okay, so I go

395
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
trip attack,

396
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
bonus attack,

397
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
action surge,

398
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
lacerate, bonus attack,

399
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
shove.

400
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
This guy's been playing a lot of Baldur's Gate

401
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
over here. Well I've been playing Persona, I use

402
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Maracuja. So you guys can't do either

403
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
of the things you're describing, you have to use

404
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
the very simple attacks.

405
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Okay, simple attack.

406
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,060
Duh.

407
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,800
Five.

408
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,060
Okay, yeah, you miss Sissy Baby.

409
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,900
Um, the Fliper is now gonna go,

410
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,160
and the Fliper is gonna go after Sissy Baby also.

411
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,360
Yes, let's--

412
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,140
-Good job. -He misses terribly.

413
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,160
You will be dereg.

414
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,660
And, Zuck, now it's your turn.

415
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,160
You're gonna get advantage on your attack on Sissy Baby.

416
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,340
I'm so sorry that you dropped that coin earlier.

417
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,200
I had this huge, uh, misunderstanding that was--

418
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,040
I got an 11 plus my--

419
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,740
Yeah.

420
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,840
-I hit. -Roll for damage, yeah.

421
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Come here!

422
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,180
That's not your damage die.

423
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,080
What do I roll? Damaged dice. It's going to be a D6 and then we're going to add

424
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,040
your arm.

425
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,940
I got a six. So five. I have a negative arm? Yeah. What did you do to him?

426
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,740
Rip his head off. Actually, you know what I do? I do end of inglorious

427
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,600
bastards where they stab Hitler's face a million times and... Or maybe that's in

428
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,080
Pan's Labyrinth, that's what I'm thinking of, where they take the butt of a gun

429
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,740
and they just beat the guy's face in until it caves in and it's like this

430
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,820
prosthetic and they're like shoving his nose into his own face. I do that to the

431
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,180
baby. You do that to the baby a little bit, but not enough to kill him, but

432
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,620
enough that the baby's face is now inward. He's got a different voice and

433
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,900
everything. Okay. And I'd like to trip him as well. Cool. What if he sounds

434
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,220
like this?

435
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,220
And can I spit on him?

436
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,100
He hung up.

437
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,020
Can I spit on it? He wants to spit on. Can you say, Hey, baby, can I spit on

438
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,980
it? Inside the emergency communication tower. What do you think you do in sex?

439
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Warning is

440
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Don't worry I've been keeping

441
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,980
I'll tell you what I think you're doing sexy

442
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
Put your hotdog in her hamburger

443
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,980
And she'll make ketchup

444
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
I've been keeping track of everything

445
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
sexual that's been said

446
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Did you throw

447
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,980
I crossed it out cause now he said

448
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,980
something sexual

449
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Did you actually throw up woe

450
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
or did you keep it in your tummy

451
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
So hello and woe

452
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Hello and woe

453
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,380
Tupac. They caught the bastard that did him.

454
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,560
Tupac, I saw that. So, hello, I was like, you guys walk into the

455
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,020
emergency mass communication tower.

456
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,820
I was so scared. I've been up at night since then. Every day I

457
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,060
haven't found a way that Tupac, the killer of Tupac is still at

458
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,020
large. I'm sure I'll walk this earth another day.

459
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,060
And in the center of the emergency mass communication tower is some kind of

460
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,340
program that is the avatar of Dylan, who was one of the people who funded

461
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:09,980
Zuckerberg's enterprise. Dylan, Dylan, Dylan. So you could see he spins to go

462
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,900
see you, 'cause he's sitting in sort of like a circular chair and he goes,

463
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,780
"Oh, hey, what's going on?" "Whoa, Dylan, it's hello and whoa."

464
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,020
"Oh, hi." "Hi."

465
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,660
"What do you guys want?" You guys sent the worst guy in here. Okay.

466
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,580
We need the hex code.

467
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
We need a code.

468
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
The hash code.

469
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,620
Oh, you want to get a hash code?

470
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,980
We need the hex code for the website so we can make the whole website a different color.

471
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Yeah, sure.

472
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,740
I can help you with that.

473
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,740
Is it #000000000?

474
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
No, no, no.

475
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
All you need to do is -- You did an extra zero.

476
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:55,260
Well, I guess not if you want the alpha channel.

477
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,620
All you need to do -- I want the alpha channel with the code.

478
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,540
quote is tell me who you want to communicate with outside of the in the

479
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,780
courtroom where you guys were sucked in.

480
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,380
Okay.

481
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,780
I want to talk to myself.

482
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,500
And you were obviously you remember the people in the courtroom 'cause it was

483
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,660
only two months ago that we recorded that episode. So, Rashida Jones. It's

484
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,300
Rashida Jones and then the Southern lawyer, Sullivan lawyer, New York lawyer.

485
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,540
New York lawyer and very bailiff.

486
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
I want to talk to the

487
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,200
okay

488
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,540
Dylan does a little bit of programming and you see like a beam of light pop out

489
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,880
of the top of his perfect haircut and in the courtroom now only like point one

490
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,080
milliseconds have gone by like no time has gone by. Everyone is just suddenly

491
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,880
reacting to you guys being sucked in and then

492
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,500
the computers, all three of the computers, because you guys were about

493
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,820
to do a hackathon light up

494
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,620
and it goes bailiff

495
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,280
Bayleth, can you get the attention of Dylan

496
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,780
a

497
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,640
one is over

498
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,520
so

499
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,840
the bailiff wanders over the computer. You see the judge judge solving being

500
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,120
like this is very unorthodox. Where did the and like and but the the bill goes

501
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,640
shut up and then walks over to the computers and he starts immediately

502
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
knows what to do and he starts typing in to the computer. The hash code that you

503
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Thank you. He finds it. It's copied to him. I was going to try and get him to

504
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,640
get Dylan's attention so I can ask him for the hash code. No, Dylan is reach

505
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,320
Dylan communicates outward. He knows him and he's yeah. I wasn't sure which

506
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,160
he's being funny. I'm sorry. It is funny. What are you talking about? It

507
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,040
just that is funny. He thinks he's being funny. Just let him do it. Sorry.

508
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,280
He's telling it his kind of idea of a joke. So his second weird idea. And so

509
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,120
the bailiff sends down the hash code. You Pat, you bombed. It's okay. It's not

510
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,600
got a bomb. You killed it. That was funny. You have the hash code now in

511
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,340
the form

512
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,500
of Patrick. I'm sorry of a sorry that you bombed so hard. Sorry for what

513
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,640
happened of like a frisbee, like in the traditional tron sense, and so

514
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,040
Dylan,

515
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,200
and Dylan turns to you, he goes massive bomb. So yeah, I guess if you

516
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,520
want to shut down the whole thing, this is what you would use

517
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,200
and he gives it to you and

518
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,700
yeah, we're going to go back outside now to you. You guys are in a little fight,

519
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,220
sissy babies turn cut back to me. I'm having a heart attack.

520
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:43,480
Sissy baby attacks, you

521
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,100
attacks you Zuckerberg. What the hell would I do because you went and attacked

522
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,420
him

523
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,460
and with his punched in face

524
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,360
oh yeah, this is because this baby is

525
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,880
yeah baby with a caved in brain is going to hurt me yeah for real. He does six

526
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,340
damage. Oh, you got fucked. Wait, I got I got two HP. This baby hurt me badly.

527
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,460
You got destroyed beating you in the face with the rattle trying to do the

528
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,080
same thing to him that you did. I pretend it doesn't hurt at all. I don't

529
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,340
I defend myself just go like yep yeah. This is fine yeah and you at is now

530
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,100
your turn. I have to make a death saving throw. You got a heart attack for real

531
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,020
okay roll roll death saving throw

532
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,260
okay. It's a success. Okay,

533
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,720
your computer program having a dead sick. I got a heart attack.

534
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,660
Okay, cool the flipper sir. The flipper is going to try to kill you because you

535
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,180
are on the ground having a heart attack. Wow, kind of shit. It misses, though,

536
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,580
just like cross battle ever.

537
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,420
It was never done. It's your turn, Zack. Now

538
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,820
I'm going to kill that baby. Okay, go for it.

539
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,920
Oh, wait, do that.

540
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,020
Oh my God, strategy.

541
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:04,220
Unlocked 19. My roll roll camera thinks he's the blower for

542
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
Okay, cool. Is that four total?

543
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,920
For real though?

544
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,020
Honestly, out of the four of us, I am like the blower.

545
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,820
No, it's 19 and then it's 19 minus one and then four, right?

546
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,720
18.

547
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,520
No?

548
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,920
No, minus one strength. So three.

549
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,120
So Sissy Baby's not looking good.

550
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,320
But he's still not fucking good.

551
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,720
How's it 19?

552
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Sissy Baby misses on you. You're pretty lucky.

553
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,620
Thank God, I have two HP, man.

554
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,820
It is your turn. Roll another death saving throw.

555
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,920
Why did we pick this fight?

556
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Okay, another success. You're doing well.

557
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
The fliper is going to join well y'all.

558
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
The fliper is going to...

559
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
The fliper misses you again.

560
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,920
The fliper is just the worst fliper.

561
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Just missing you completely.

562
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
And now it is Zuck, it is your turn again.

563
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
You're just having a hard time.

564
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Alright, I think that one more melee attack is going to...

565
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
You know what to do.

566
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Four.

567
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Okay, yeah, that misses for sure.

568
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
The average is still pretty good.

569
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,920
You now are outside and you can kind of come in and help I would say.

570
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,600
day. Can I just hold up the disc and shoot out a giant beam? Is that how that works?

571
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,520
That's from the cover of the movie. That's from the cover of the movie, so I imagine

572
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,280
that you could do it. That's probably one of the only things that can happen. No, you

573
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,680
could do... Oh, I'm going to throw the disc. No, no, no, you have to save the disc for

574
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,680
the end. I thought that the whole movie was about throwing discs. Put the disc on ice.

575
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,600
Yeah, but not right now. See if you can do a front flip in this world. Okay, you know

576
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,640
what? I'm going to have a makeover party. Before I do anything, I'm going to have a twin makeover.

577
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,760
All right, you and the twins step outside, see this battle going on.

578
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
Juvia, can you search on YouTube makeover music?

579
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,360
Do not.

580
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,680
Yeah.

581
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,240
Okay.

582
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,480
Do your thing.

583
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,040
We're going to have a little makeover session.

584
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,000
All right.

585
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,840
We'll see.

586
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,160
Songs for doing makeup, chill music mix.

587
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,240
Okay.

588
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,360
Whoa.

589
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,760
Hello?

590
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,680
Before we go to battle.

591
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,880
Yes.

592
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,240
There's something we need to change.

593
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,540
Okay,

594
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,240
okay,

595
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,240
we should change our hairstyle. Yeah,

596
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,740
describe what you're changing hairstyle, but describe how it's changing.

597
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,640
We paint us a picture with words. No, with

598
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
okay, you turn this hair back, backwards, the long parts on the front.

599
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,840
Okay, now maybe I have a little bit of a sexual scene tension wise between

600
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,440
you and your twin and then while my twin is putting makeup on my face,

601
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
I kiss him.

602
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,080
(laughter)

603
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,880
- You do the thing at breakfast club.

604
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,720
- Yeah.

605
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,540
- Yeah.

606
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,260
- And then I put my hand down the front of my twin's pants.

607
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,720
Wait, can you go grab my twin?

608
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,960
(laughter)

609
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:55,800
- All right, show us on the doll where you, okay.

610
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,040
(laughter)

611
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:06,120
And that's that. And then we go to battle. Okay, you put his foot in your mouth all the

612
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,120
way and then you're ready to fight.

613
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,480
So yeah, I guess, I guess, roll for initiative to enter the, please get the head sitting

614
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
next to you.

615
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
I'll hang out.

616
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
17.

617
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,440
Okay, cool. You're going to go, you're going to go. So yeah, what do you want to do? Now

618
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,760
you've, we'll just let you do that.

619
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,760
As soon as I get in there, I hit my shell launcher.

620
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,940
Okay, nice.

621
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,400
Which I, what do I do?

622
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,120
So it's when you and your twin get inside of a boat.

623
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,460
It looks like it says lunch is a straight line.

624
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,980
Launch is in a straight line, sorry.

625
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,900
Lunch is a straight line.

626
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,680
Lunch is the midpoint on a straight line.

627
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,020
Three feet, 10 feet water damage crowd.

628
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,620
Yeah, you're gonna fuck up everybody.

629
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,780
It's gonna cost you three.

630
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,500
Okay, wait, if I'm gonna fuck up everybody,

631
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,980
he has two HP, I'm not gonna do that.

632
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
Yeah.

633
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,560
Then I guess I'm going to do twin

634
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
maneuver.

635
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,040
Nice. So this is where you get to do

636
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,720
sort of an extra maneuver where you

637
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
could have one of your twins go.

638
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,060
Like you just described to me what

639
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,760
you're going to do and we're going to

640
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
figure it out.

641
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,900
I guess what we're going to do.

642
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Think of a twin antic then.

643
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,840
I don't know why I haven't had

644
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
this on me the whole time.

645
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,980
What I'm going to do is

646
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,500
I guess it's a leapfrog style

647
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,820
attack. Oh, you know what?

648
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,140
What?

649
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,700
Tabletop. We're going to tabletop.

650
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,740
I was hoping you'd say that.

651
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,660
we are going to table top somebody. You're going to Eiffel Tower somebody? No, no, no,

652
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,940
no. That is different. One of my, one of, I think, hello will go behind. Eiffel Tower

653
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,940
would be somebody standing behind them and you just push them into them. So roll, or

654
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,460
something. Roll stealth first. Or it could be something else, I guess. So that's balance

655
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,580
ball. That's a five. Okay, so your twin is very obviously. Actually, that's a seven.

656
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Your twin is very obviously going behind sissybaby34. And then you're going to try to push him into

657
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,080
this. You're going to push them at disadvantage, but you can still

658
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,120
potentially do enough damage. So roll d20. What'd you get?

659
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,320
Crit one. A 20. You got a crit one. Yes, I got a crit one. You

660
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,920
a hug, SissyBaby34. It's okay. I wasn't going to fight you. And

661
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,720
in, oh yeah. Oh, okay. Roll, yeah. Roll, roll speaking. That

662
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,260
is a 15. SissyBaby hugged you back. This fucking baby's so

663
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,700
so hard to kill. This is so sweet, smushed in phase.

664
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:31,240
Yes, I understand exactly what you're saying. Yeah, and it is now Ed's turn

665
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,780
you are yeah, rolled in the death saving throw. Okay, fail. All right. Okay,

666
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,780
that's the first. The flipper is going to try to shoot you now

667
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,340
and a crit one. Wow,

668
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,140
this viper, it's the worst flipper ever.

669
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,820
you're the fliper charlie browns away, just like depressed, like

670
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,860
just like you can't fucking do shit.

671
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Fucking more shit sucks. It fucking works and he just leaves. So it's just you

672
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,340
guys beating up this baby now. Well, the baby is now on my side. Baby's also a

673
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,780
man, but it's a man. I don't want to kill it anymore. It's a man using a

674
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,460
baby avatar. Yes, I mean I could, but how old is that? Can you show us a photo

675
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:35,280
what

676
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,640
your kill? I rip his arms off. I rip his legs off. I rip a hole in his chest. I

677
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,960
put all of it in like a bouquet of flowers. I rip his head off. I put it on

678
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,120
top. Wait, wait, wait. Throw the bouquet behind you. And then I throw it behind me

679
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,920
like a wedding. And who catches it? Cameron, roll. Yeah, well you two. Oh,

680
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,000
wait a minute. Who catches it? I can't catch anything. Well, you can still try

681
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,840
to catch it. Well, yeah. Can we roll to see if it lands on your dying body? It

682
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,960
could land on your dying body. Ready? 321419. He the twin catches it. I'm

683
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,840
having a heart attack. 20. So maybe okay. So which way he does. Okay. So hello

684
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,840
catches it. Nice. And then what happens and you two maybe look at each other a

685
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,400
little knowingly because you know that you're gonna be now you don't make out

686
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,080
with your twin. Why not? Because we let that happen for one second when the

687
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,280
music was going. We got caught up in the music. But now the music I think that's

688
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,780
the only time it can become sexual. I agree. I'm having a dream about being

689
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,860
trapped in an auditorium with a shooter and I'm dying. Describe your dream.

690
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,140
Describe your dream. The world is falling apart into pieces. There's

691
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,940
spider webs everywhere and there's an active shooter at your school.

692
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,700
Lightning is following me through the ground and I saw a baby bear and then

693
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,140
the mama bear came out and was killing me. And then is this a real dream?

694
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,660
You know, there's now there's a three guys who have guns and they have masks

695
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,380
because of COVID. Your character's having this? Yeah. Because of COVID-19. Because I'm dying.

696
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,340
Oh, okay. I have heart attack. What if you go to a Tony Soprano realm? I don't know if you want to

697
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,580
see what Sissy Baby's profile is. I really don't, man. Oh, I really do. Yeah, I'm not sure I do

698
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,860
either. I'm done looking. I'm dreaming of this in my brain. Whatever is on the screen right now

699
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,900
that I'm not going to look at, this is what's going through my... this is my last thoughts.

700
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,700
Well, no, because we're going to get you up right now. Sissy Baby's

701
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:32,700
My life is flashing before my eyes, me designing Facebook, me writing all the code for Facebook,

702
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,700
me putting all the money up for Facebook, me winning the court case, me escaping from

703
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Tron World, me and you having a platonic friend wedding to be permanent friends. I'm from

704
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,100
from hand to hand. I'm sure you are now friend and friend. Sissy Baby's last

705
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:57,060
words is... That's the most recent post. No, it's something else. He dies.

706
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,300
So you guys killed the Sissy Baby, but you did get the

707
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,660
disc you need, the hash code you need. So...

708
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,680
You guys, you got the hex code. With the hex hash code, damn it.

709
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,660
With that, you also can go to the next layer of the...

710
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,180
Oh, wow. Bitch, I'm going in. I'm going in. You only just saw that?

711
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,180
- Yeah, he's got a weird, strong baby.

712
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,940
- That's the classic baby.

713
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,980
- Doesn't look like me.

714
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,300
So the next layer is the damp layer.

715
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,020
And that's the layer where you can do--

716
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,360
- Maximum damage?

717
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,700
- No, so here's the thing.

718
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,700
- Crap.

719
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,660
- What you can do is the damp layer

720
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,780
is the sort of backend code layer,

721
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,420
and in there is the PVN launcher.

722
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,380
The private, or PVC launcher rather.

723
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,700
The private virtual cloud launcher.

724
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,100
So if you recall, what you guys have to do to break out of here is you have to, one person

725
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:57,620
has to be in the private virtual cloud and at the exact same time that somebody throws

726
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:06,100
the hash code into the, into filled completely's defeated husk, somebody has to shut down the

727
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
backup.

728
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,700
Spoiled it, we know he's a corn.

729
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,100
Somebody has to hit the backup code so that they sync so that there's no redundancies.

730
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,260
these. Okay, where's the backup code? You have to go to the PVC launcher. So

731
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,300
somebody needs to stay behind. Somebody's gonna need to launch into the cloud.

732
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,820
It was supposed to be Johnny Computer. It was supposed to be literally anybody

733
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,540
from the Leaky Legends crew who you have just, I guess, also started a war

734
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,700
against. Not a war. We killed a baby. I don't care. Yeah. Killed also Joe. Joe

735
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,700
was an accident. Well, I didn't know if anyone was gonna ask or even care.

736
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,780
But I did survive my heart attack. Also, how fast does Word spread in this town?

737
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:51,900
it. But, well you told Sissy Baby on the comms that you guys killed Joe Music. So this guy

738
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,540
believes everything he hears? Yeah, I mean that was pretty clear from his character,

739
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:02,660
right? No. Does he, did he tell everyone? Did he have enough time? Because he was fighting

740
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,020
a fliper. We can, we have this disc now, we can just hack into anything. No. The disc

741
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,260
lets us do anything. The disc lets us do whatever we want and hack into whatever. We can hack

742
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:29,260
to

743
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,980
They know who he is for sure.

744
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
They know who he is.

745
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Celebrity status.

746
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Probably Edward.

747
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,320
They might not know exactly who killed Joe Music 1976.

748
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,260
They might just know that Joe Music 1976 has been compromised.

749
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,580
Okay, alright, so we're good then.

750
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,860
Well, where, then we need one of them.

751
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,380
So where are the Leaky Legends abound?

752
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,900
There's a Leaky Legends lair, which is also in this level here.

753
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Can we...

754
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
We'd like to go there.

755
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,340
Can we shoot a beacon into the sky that says...

756
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,840
like to go there. Legends,

757
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,140
the poster of Tron, you cannot do it right now.

758
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,940
You keep mad, you keep trying to do the poster, the dream

759
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,040
is up. You already are a werewolf. You can't also shoot a beam. I shoot a

760
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,640
werewolf. You gotta pin werewolf shoot beams, but you gotta shoot a

761
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,740
moon. That's one of the werewolves thing. That's not one of the werewolves

762
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,740
thing. Werewolves do that in lots of movies. I'd like to I'd like to turn

763
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,540
tail and run directly to the triple l. Okay, cool. So you guys hop on your

764
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,900
motorcycles, which are now hover bikes and you guys, you guys are running to

765
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,740
the to the the cycles. I'm like guys, can you slow down? I'm not supposed to

766
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,860
run right now. I'm having some issues with my heart. He has agita. Oh yeah,

767
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,300
for you're just out that whole thing. Is that the thing? Is that the old

768
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,060
italian agita? He has agita. I may have survived my cardiac arrest, but that

769
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,420
doesn't mean it won't have lasting complications. Okay, well, then you can

770
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:02,940
ride on my bike. Whoa! Friendship perhaps repairing? Our bond growing closer?

771
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,760
Hamburger?

772
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,540
Yeah, you guys ride away around the Tinkle Lair towards the Leaky Legends

773
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,720
Lair, which I realised also while I was riding, I was like, "These are gonna

774
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,620
sound similar," but it did happen. So

775
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,580
yeah, you see there, it's sort of like a hoveled out

776
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:28,240
crystal cavern kind of a sitting amongst the alongside the between the between

777
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,440
the the tinkle layer and the damp layer and sort of a little hovel with like

778
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,280
little nodes and and then sort of like you know mother boardy kind of wires and

779
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,700
sparkies and knock on the door. There's no door. They just see them there. Do you

780
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,840
knock on the ground? I knock on what I think is a door. Okay, so you're going to

781
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,680
that's what do you think is the door? Can I roll to see what I think the door?

782
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,120
Yeah, that yeah, I'll just low low. It makes them think that I have a

783
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,760
disability. Yes, you're high.

784
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,560
A door appears. Okay, I get a net twenty a door

785
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,840
materializes. Yeah, you probably would have done that regardless. I'm going to

786
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,360
be honest. I'm a friendly guy.

787
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,060
get one so

788
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,760
you I mean you just like start clipping through the ground.

789
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,880
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, you're going to take some damage roll

790
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,680
one D six

791
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:31,140
or you take four damage from clipping through the ground ground and coming

792
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,580
back up. Okay, let me handle this

793
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,360
guys. Hey

794
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,200
leaky legends, somebody killed Joe

795
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,680
or Joe exotic

796
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,640
or what's his name? It was Carol.

797
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:51,920
Somebody killed Joe music at nineteen seventy six and the fucking sleepy baby

798
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,320
and now it's just sleepy baby is dead.

799
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,960
Yeah, so guys, we have to happen. We have to

800
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,200
buy a bunch of flyers so

801
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,440
fucking

802
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,440
covered in blood. I tried to save him. I tried to save him, so I'm trying to

803
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,640
save the sleepy, the sweetie baby. Look, I saved his skull. We saved his skull

804
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,080
because you guys thought we thought you guys might want it now. Now now hold on

805
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,720
whoa. My name is warm feeling

806
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,400
okay. Hello,

807
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,560
you're telling me that sissy baby's dead

808
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,720
sleepy. I can't believe I'm saying this right now, but honestly, this is the

809
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,260
first we're hearing of it too. Yeah, we like just found out from some fucking

810
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,980
bitch.

811
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,880
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

812
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,960
They're all deceptive of course. But that's a pretty good lie. Yeah,

813
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,240
it's a good lie.

814
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,440
It is a good lie. Nat 20, naturally a 20. I saw it, I saw it. You show the

815
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,960
world though, yeah. Oh, you guys thought Caleb couldn't play D&D.

816
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,640
Look at my dice.

817
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,400
You see warm feeling and he goes,

818
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
God damn it.

819
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,800
You see like, you know, it's a bit of...

820
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I hug him.

821
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
It's warm.

822
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,040
I clip back up under him.

823
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
You do what?

824
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
I like clip my...

825
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,920
I clip back up and I'm right in front of him like Skibbity Toilet.

826
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,640
Please tell me there's no Skibbities in here.

827
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,240
And you see warm feeling.

828
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,920
Honestly, I'm not on the floor enough to know if it's good or bad.

829
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,080
It's basically the worst fucking thing ever if you have a camera for it.

830
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,460
enough of a no, if it's cringe or based yet, because I do think that the

831
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,220
younger generation when it comes to analog horror, they're making some base

832
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,560
shit like the back rooms. This is this is stuff where it's like

833
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:51,940

00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,860
where the tinkle layer is bright and yellow we find the damp layer me the

883
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,860
damn player murky browns and chug this is the back and murky brown watching

rest a single gold.

890
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:24,440
Yeah, I got a single gold coin that authenticates each user as they log

891
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,040
into the diaper network overhanging our stalactites that stuck that suck up the

892
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,240
coins as needed and spit them out on the next one. So reusing those tokens on

893
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,920
either side of the Black Sea lies thick steel docks or programs create the

894
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,440
and stick each little coin inside it.

895
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,740
These programs sweat and ache

896
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,740
and work hard to make this beast run.

897
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,100
- These are doo-doo canoes?

898
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,580
- Mm-hmm, more flipers exist here,

899
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,820
along with the flipper captain.

900
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,780
- Warning, you will be derezzed.

901
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,520
- The flipper captain resides in his brown citadel,

902
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,520
well, citadel, where the PVC launcher rests.

903
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,800
Well, you'll have to either beat him,

00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,580

906
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,380
I don't wanna beat anymore, I'm done beating.

907
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,780

914
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,660
We don't need to distract, we just decided. I have the perfect distraction

915

934
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,200

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,000
six eleven okay all right, so they win this time. No wait wait before you guys

936
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,260
leave. Do you have any money or something? If we need to buy medical

937
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,720
supplies. Of course, of course. Oh, thank you so much. When you get to the Soak City,

938
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,480
you're going to probably need this. Do you have weapons? Oh, well, the weapons that we're

939
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,660
using, but... Can you give us all those? And probably you have to use those to storm. Okay,

940
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:52,640
can you leave one and give us the rest? We can give you one. Is there any kind of...

941
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,120
No, you have to give us three. How many of you are there? We'll take the money, we'll

942
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,480
take the money. Here's the money. And he gives you guys, he gives you guys each 100 tokens...

943
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,340
Oh yeah. To spend when you're in the Soak City.

944
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,640
And he says,

945
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,720
"Leaky Legends, charge!"

946
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,480
And him and Forst and the rest of the gang, they all storm.

947
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,280
I was kind of hoping to send them on a suicide mission.

948
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,320
And they all charge.

949
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,800
That's the second time that you've played that.

950
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,120
And I thought the world was ending.

951
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,320
Oh man.

952
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,520
Wait, that's cool.

953
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,560
That's how they run in.

954
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,560
And the fight begins.

955
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,880
And so they are now fighting the Fliper Captain.

956
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,660
It sounds like this. Yeah.

957
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,220
All right.

958
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:37,800
So you guys now have an opportunity to sneak around, get into the PVC launcher

959
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,720
and just fly right through to there.

960
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,460
Here's the thing.

961
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,020
You'll still have to leave one of you there behind

962
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,420
unless you take one of the guys with you.

963
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,660
We actually need it actually takes three guys.

964
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,860
Wait, I need you.

965
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,200
Or you leave one of the points at one person.

966
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,300
Wait, I need you.

967
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,460
We take forced. Yeah.

968
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,700
For maybe not forced.

969
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,140
he seems now because he won't speak. I bet him vibes though. Yeah, we were on

970
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,380
the same wave. Like they were on the stage

971
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,380
situation ship.

972
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,280
We've been sending each other and emojis.

973
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,680
Okay, maybe you should say baby. What are you eating?

974
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,980

00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,060

976
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:36,800

977
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,660

978
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,180
Are you

I'm in probably two hundred five in a row.

986
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,340
It's been pretty grim over here.

987
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,940
I've rolled so many fives today.

988
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,940

00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,640
Oh, a natural one?

1001
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:42,840
Yeah.

1002
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,640
That's very bad.

1003
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,840
And I have two health points.

1004
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:53,200
so forced in the twins easily make it by this guy, the battle to

1005
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,180
get spotted by the flipper captain who goes

1006
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:03,800
try to pass and he swipes away at the leaky legends. He was fighting and you

1007
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,680
two have to roll initiative while you and forced can start to travel to the

1008
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,160
network. Okay, okay, seventeen, eleven, should I wait actually eighteen up to

1009
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,180
Make up your mind, man.

1010
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,180
18 for you, Zuck?

1011
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,180
Yes.

1012
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,180
Remember, you do have healing, Ed.

1013
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,180
And I need that badly.

1014
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
What did you roll to, by the way?

1015
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,180
11. I only have 2 HP, man.

1016
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,180
I'll heal right now before initiative starts.

1017
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,180
If it's not, you can't.

1018
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,180
Nice try, Buck.

1019
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,180
I'll just take one turn

1020
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,180
before the order starts.

1021
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,180
Zuck, you do get to go first, though.

1022
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,180
Okay.

1023
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:49,620
fucking you say, but fucking, but fuck the animal in front of me, whatever it is,

1024
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:56,900
but fuck the diaper. The animal in front of me. Damn. That's a JPEG mafia line.

1025
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,820
I would like to, I would like to click rewrite and tell the program what to do

1026
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:09,180
for 30 seconds, which is five turns. Tell it to kill itself. Okay. So true. Yep. I

1027
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:13,180
know. Okay, bad writing by the way. It shouldn't be 30 seconds. That's so long.

1028
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:18,980
Yeah, it is five turns. Believe it or not though, for some reason, you don't spend

1029
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,180
any resources. It just doesn't work on the Flipper Captain. You don't know why.

1030
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,580
What's the next thing you can do?

1031
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:29,180
We're in the real world and we're in a simulation of a Squid Game style show to

1032
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,580
pretend we're inside a computer.

1033
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,380
Wait, that means that somebody else wrote this code.

1034
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,380
Roll wisdom or owl.

1035
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,380
I just figured it out. I don't need to roll this shit.

1036
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,380
No, you should roll owl.

1037
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,380
Okay, shut up bitch.

1038
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:45,780
Fucking nine. Fuck you. Okay. You can't quite tell but something is off about the Flapper captain

1039
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,500
He's a girl

1040
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:53,680
Okay, Flapper captain goes now. The Flapper captain is gonna start spraying at you too

1041
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,940
Yeah, me? Oh you too. Mm-hmm. I meant you too T-O-O. Okay, he misses.

1042
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:07,220
Spray again. Crit misses. His guns get jammed up. He's gonna only be able to shoot once next turn. You are now up

1043
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:14,220
up.

1044
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,700
whole party I guess. Yes it does. How much? Okay that's a beautiful 4 HP to

1045
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,300
everybody. That's a dude that's a lot of my HP on this. To me too? Yeah. I'm not good.

1046
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:29,540
Who's the squishiest here? Nice. I got 10 HP. This guy over here is the

1047
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:35,700
squishiest. Oh it's making him cry. Oh sorry. Shit. You think he's the squishiest?

1048
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:43,180
Trying to give you a massage. It's not working. Before we go back, before we

1049
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,180
I put my hand on his thigh.

1050
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,180
Yo bro, how did I know you were going to take it there?

1051
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,180
Forrest goes like, how did I know you were going to take it there?

1052
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,180
He's like very happy.

1053
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,180
And I say, Forrest, you have to jump on the back of the Viper captain and rip his head

1054
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,180
off or else you won't get this.

1055
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,180
And I showed him.

1056
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,180
What do I show him?

1057
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,180
Do I have anything in my hand?

1058
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,180
I don't know.

1059
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,180
I don't know.

1060
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,180
I don't know.

1061
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,180
I don't know.

1062
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,180
I don't know.

1063
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,180
I don't know.

1064
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,180
I don't know.

1065
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,180
I don't know.

1066
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,180
I don't know.

1067
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,180
I don't know.

1068
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,180
I don't know.

1069
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,180
I don't know.

1070
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,180
I don't know.

1071
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,180
I don't know.

1072
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,180
I don't know.

1073
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:14,180
talking with advantage.

1074
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,180
Show your body.

1075
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,180
Show that trump is a thing.

1076
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,180
That is a 15.

1077
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,180
With advantage, yeah.

1078
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,180
And a 13.

1079
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,180
I'm being hypnotized by this entire video.

1080
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:27,180
Forrest nods and like looks you up and down and nods.

1081
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,180
And then runs to attack.

1082
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,180
So he's going to roll initiative and enter into the fray.

1083
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,180
Okay.

1084
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,180
And I'm going to save a life.

1085
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:40,180
Oh my God, that's playing right now.

1086
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:44,180
Yeah, as he runs and attacks.

1087
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,180
Wow, good hit.

1088
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:56,180
This might be the last time you see Forst.

1089
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:00,180
Wait, turn that music up then.

1090
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:04,180
Yeah, slow motion. Forst goes like

1091
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:10,660
like jumps on the flipper captain and grabs him from behind and starts to

1092
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:16,500
like bite its neck and you two have a moment you can escape if you want to

1093
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,700
forest wait I'll never forget roll for damage for force he did he did for damage

1094
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,660
but I have to get out of here I can't hurt this guy he did none of my programs

1095
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:32,500
work on him we can't fight this truth I'm leaving wait wait but before they go

1096
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,900
So can we call one more person?

1097
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
I was going to say, you will have to leave one of them behind.

1098
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
Why don't we just bring Forrest with us?

1099
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,900
Well Forrest is now biting the guys.

1100
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,900
So just get him off of it.

1101
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,900
Whose fault is that? Why don't you send one of your fucking twins?

1102
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,900
I thought that maybe it was going to be...

1103
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,900
You thought it was going to one hit kill? You thought an NPC was going to one hit kill a boss?

1104
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:54,900
I thought that you guys were going to continue to fight and that I had just given you an advantage.

1105
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,900
Dude, I can't hurt him.

1106
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
I said you could, well you don't know quite if you can't hurt him.

1107
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
That means I can. Okay, I fight.

1108
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,100
I can have you you can roll insight again on him by the way to try to understand

1109
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:11,640
What's if I can't rewrite the code then I definitely can't scramble and refactor the code you also have hitting you're gonna do that's what

1110
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,780
I mean, I'd have to just normally attack. Yeah, and I'm not gonna do as much damage

1111
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,980
We'll just do it. I know that's being mean whatever I fucking hurt him

1112
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,460
Mm-hmm. I

1113
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,460
got a 13

1114
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,540
That hit let me check his

1115
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,780
It's a one.

1116
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,780
It does not hit.

1117
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,780
Shit, dude.

1118
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,060
I told you.

1119
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,060
I told you.

1120
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,060
It does not hit.

1121
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,060
You didn't roll well.

1122
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,500
Well, one of them is a werewolf.

1123
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,660
And now the Flipper captain is going to try to grab.

1124
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,660
Remember he's gunned down.

1125
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,660
He also has disadvantage, yeah.

1126
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,700
So he's going to grab, try to grab Forrest and throw it off, throw him off of him.

1127
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,180
So it's going to be a little strength contest.

1128
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,180
Oh, crit one.

1129
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,180
And he does win.

1130
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,180
Why did I get a crit one?

1131
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,180
What?

1132
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,260
No, he got a nine and Forrest got a crit one.

1133
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,260
Oh.

1134
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:01,420
is forced off back towards you, just like throws him back and that's when he sees you. So you

1135
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,480
roll initiative now. Just to join the fray.

1136
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,480
18.

1137
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,900
Okay, nice. You'll go early on next time. You have more balance ball, right, Zuck, than

1138
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,900
him?

1139
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,540
My balance ball is at plus one.

1140
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,540
Okay.

1141
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,540
And his is plus two.

1142
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,100
Oh, so you will go first now.

1143
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,100
Oh, okay.

1144
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,360
Next time. But cool. So that's his turn, though. Ed, it's your turn.

1145
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,360
What is my attack? I have nothing on my sheet.

1146
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,360
Well, you're a werewolf, so you have claws, biting, scratching.

1147
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:37,360
I gave you more attacks now. Now you have like attack plus your arm and it does 2d4+2 I think is what I had or something like that.

1148
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,360
Well, yeah, I don't know. I'll trust you.

1149
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,360
Yeah, I think that's fair because you're now a werewolf and I'm letting you. I think that's fun.

1150
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,360
Five.

1151
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,360
Damn, you missed. You just whiffed.

1152
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,360
Excuse me, I'm sorry, gang.

1153
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,360
It's not so pathetic that I missed because I am still recovering from a

1154
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,360
pretty crazy medical emergency. I call out and I say,

1155
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,360
"Edwardo, you're doing good with the situation."

1156
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,360
Forced does hit. "All things considered, you're doing amazing."

1157
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,360
I'm glad you're considering everything because a lot of people don't. Nice.

1158
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,360
Okay, forced does hit. So forced is the only one really doing damage so far guys.

1159
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,360
Maybe if you stop lowering our rolls. Thank you.

1160
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,360
It is now, though, your turn.

1161
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,360
I am going to do "which twin" on this fucker.

1162
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,360
Okay, what does that do?

1163
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,360
That, for one minute, enemies have disadvantage.

1164
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,360
So he still has disadvantage, or...?

1165
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,360
No, he would just have disadvantage on attacks against you.

1166
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Okay, so he has disadvantage...

1167
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,360
On attacks against you.

1168
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,360
...confused by the twinness.

1169
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,360
Confused by the twinness, we look at him and we say,

1170
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,360
"Hello!" in tandem,

1171
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,360
so he thinks we're both named "Hello" now.

1172
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,720
Oh, so he doesn't know. So when he's using his targeting program,

1173
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,800
targeting hello, he doesn't know who he's targeting. Exactly right.

1174
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,640
And then what's my like?

1175
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,520
Well, the shell launcher would hit everyone, would it?

1176
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,040
Not necessarily. No, it just goes in a straight line.

1177
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,400
OK, well, well, I'm going to do a shell launcher. Cool.

1178
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,320
That's going to use up most of your.

1179
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,440
Well, I'm good. I can also refill it later.

1180
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,560
So I'm going to do that right now because I haven't used it.

1181
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,400
OK, go for it. Shell launcher.

1182
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,700
It is a Mike.

1183
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,500
That was an 11 plus.

1184
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,000
Oh, sorry, yeah, no, it's what's your balance ball?

1185
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh, OK, then that is a 13.

1186
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Nice. Does that hit?

1187
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,500
It does half damage. OK, so what's the damage on there?

1188
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,600
Did I put that on there?

1189
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,900
Damage is 48 to D6.

1190
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,500
What? That's what it says.

1191
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,400
My crazy.

1192
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,300
I am crazy. OK.

1193
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,900
D eight and two D six yeah, so it's got

1194
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,060
whoa.

1195
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:50,000
I think I thought oh, I thought the ways would do two D six on the sides, but

1196
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,620
still crazy amount of damage. That is crazy. Oh well,

1197
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:57,920
can I get two more D eights? You can't roll multiple times. Oh yeah, yeah,

1198
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,640
yeah, okay,

1199
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,940
twenty well

1200
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,280
ten

1201
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,640
eighteen eighteen eighteen

1202
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,500
Eight.

1203
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,540
Eighteen and eight.

1204
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,920
That's twenty six and that's

1205
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,940
thirteen.

1206
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,020
So, yeah, you do some serious

1207
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,020
damage to this guy.

1208
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,260
You and your brother fucking row

1209
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,980
your shell boat through him.

1210
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,340
He's not looking too good right now.

1211
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,780
You guys doing a good job.

1212
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,740
It is now

1213
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,380
your turn, Zuck.

1214
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,300
I mean, I guess I'll try to.

1215
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,860
Fuck, man.

1216
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,700
None of my. I don't have any damage

1217
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,700
abilities.

1218
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,700
Which kind of stinks.

1219
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,700
Didn't he get a weapon?

1220
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,700
What weapon?

1221
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,700
No.

1222
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,700
You can just use attack right now.

1223
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,700
Pick me up and use me like a...

1224
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,700
I'll just attack.

1225
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,700
From what you can tell, this guy is somehow not a program or resistant to it.

1226
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,700
Crit one.

1227
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,700
This is somebody from the real world.

1228
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,700
Another crit one.

1229
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,700
Can I examine him and compare my celebrity memory?

1230
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,700
You can in a second, but it's actually his turn first.

1231
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,700
My egg is itching me.

1232
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:14,700
So he is now going to attack the twins, but he is going to have disadvantage.

1233
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,700
So, what's your AC?

1234
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
My AC is 14.

1235
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,700
Okay, he does hit you.

1236
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,700
What?

1237
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,700
It was 13, but he adds plus two.

1238
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,700
No, he doesn't.

1239
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,700
No, he does. I'm sorry.

1240
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,700
No.

1241
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,700
So that is not too bad. That's six.

1242
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,700
And now he's going to do a little bit more.

1243
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,700
He's going to try again.

1244
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:39,460
disadvantage, so he misses. So you only take six. And now, now, Ed, you can try

1245
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:44,500
to, you can try and place his face. Yeah, roll, roll, yeah, and then we'll add

1246
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:51,260
intellect, brain, intellect, brain. Fifteen. So you realize why, and it's

1247
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:56,740
because this is the user, LittleAndAlone, who's somehow been corrupted. What?

1248
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:00,740
How could you corrupt Little and Alone?

1249
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,740
Snap out of it Little and Alone! Snap out of it!

1250
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,740
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

1251
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:12,740
Roll Talking.

1252
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:16,740
Eleven. Oh my god, he's got stitch slippers.

1253
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,740
Like from Lilo and Stitch? Yes. I'll show you guys later.

1254
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:24,740
Why would you not do one Lilo, one Stitch? You got eleven? Eleven? Okay.

1255
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,740
it's like I

1256
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:31,360
didn't notice he was doing that before men in black sort of like a alien guy

1257
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:37,260
like fucking almost snapping into it, but not quite yet, but now fuck the

1258
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,700
soofy. It is your turn, though

1259
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,560
is forced somebody talk to him

1260
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:48,660
forced. Here's you say that and and well, he forced hears you say little and

1261
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,260
alone and he goes like

1262
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,920
really can treating him. Was that a girlfriend as

1263
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:02,200
I was a your diaper diaper friend and the fiber captain starts to transform

1264
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:07,220
into a werewolf like me. It's your water wolf. No for a second you think

1265
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,580
you might have a peer yeah

1266
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:14,780
you have to transform back into a user, but he's like halfway transformed. It's

1267
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:20,300
not quite there yet. He's like kill me okay. Well, that's what we've been

1268
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,540
trying to do man. Stop fighting back then asshole. Forrest is like give up,

1269
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:28,980
give up right now. What'd you get? What was the first roll? Oh, I didn't know I

1270
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,260
was rolling. I was trying to get all my bad rolls out before I get a,

1271
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,300
before it's my turn. So I have to roll. So now I'll roll. It's my

1272
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,320
turn? You weren't done with your cut scene. It's not your turn actually,

1273
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,540
sorry, it's his turn. Exactly, I'm getting my bad rolls out. You're getting

1274
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,380
your bad rolls out. Alright, you're up, you're up though. Okay, it's my

1275
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,060
turn. Yeah.

1276
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:52,780
That is a dirty 20 because I just go over and I, or we do a, I pick up my twin like a bat

1277
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,620
and I swing my twin at him.

1278
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,620
Well, that's cool.

1279
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,340
Yeah, describe your kill on this guy.

1280
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,340
Yes.

1281
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,540
Head lobs off like it's a t-ball.

1282
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:06,940
I go shoot, throw 420 feet away like it's Fenway Park.

1283
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,700
420 feet, that's funny.

1284
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,700
No, that's Fenway.

1285
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,700
Oh shit.

1286
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Yeah.

1287
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,700
Flawless victory.

1288
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,700
Well, there's some flaws.

1289
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,700
Yeah.

1290
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,700
Yeah

1291
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,100
It probably would hurt does his head disappear head

1292
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:27,740
Yeah, his head flies off like it's going to go in a left field. It's going past the green monster. Oh, yeah

1293
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:32,340
Wally the green monsters in a diaper in the

1294
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:37,100
Body the green alien sure

1295
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,640
Yeah, this guy's dead and you see the the crew

1296
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:46,440
Many of them are battered and broken the leaky legends and they look and they realize who it was and they're like

1297
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,660
Crestfallen and they know he said to kill him

1298
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,760
y'all and warm feeling says

1299
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,740
You guys have to go go to the launcher, okay

1300
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:02,100
We're trying to go that's literally we're trying to meet you when you're fucking friend here decided

1301
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,100
He wanted to start a fight your friend

1302
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:08,260
but your lacking friend, your friend, you all come with us because we're going to

1303
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,460
sacrifice all of you.

1304
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:13,860
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, we definitely need somebody to say they're

1305
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,940
going to the soaked city and they said they'll meet you guys there. So you

1306
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:21,220
three enforced can go and fly into the cloud. Let's do it right now. Let's go.

1307
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:27,380
Okay, so the three of you, four of you rather get into the PVN launcher and

1308
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:32,500
it goes like countdown five, four, three

1309
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,100
and then you guys launch into...

1310
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,100
It whispers.

1311
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,100
It whispers.

1312
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,100
It launches you guys past the code.

1313
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,100
You can almost see the full makeup of the website.

1314
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,100
And then you realize you're in like a private

1315
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,100
cloud server. Makeup.

1316
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,100
Makeup song.

1317
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,100
Sounds like it's going to be next.

1318
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,100
So the makeup of the website. Yes, good call.

1319
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,100
And you're in

1320
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,100
the stinky cloud layer now.

1321
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,100
Floating in the air. Eww.

1322
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,100
A green matrixy stream of

1323
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:07,260
code swirls and congeals into foggy tangibility with tendrils of lingering

1324
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:12,300
binary flavor. In what flavor? It's the stink of the stink cloud meant to hold

1325
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:19,820
all PII and PCI user data. PIIs. Mm-hmm. Encrypted and hashed and rehashed and

1326
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:24,020
blockchained and scrambled and all these things. You guys are now barreling

1327
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:29,660
through to get to the private cloud server itself and

1328
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,060
and mess balls now are flying through.

1329
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,860
You guys are going to have to start dodging these things.

1330
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,060
These are balls of mess.

1331
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,060
Scrambled poop.

1332
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,060
Come off it.

1333
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,060
Yeah.

1334
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,060
Come off it.

1335
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,060
Barrels of scrambled poop.

1336
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:41,060
So, deck saving throws.

1337
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,060
Let's go.

1338
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,060
I got a 13, man.

1339
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,060
I got a 2.

1340
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,060
I got a 17.

1341
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,060
But I get two rolls because I'm a twin.

1342
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,060
No, but you do get to add two to it.

1343
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,060
Okay.

1344
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,060
I got a 4.

1345
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,060
You take four damage.

1346
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,060
And four saves.

1347
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,060
And I'm going to go ahead and roll.

1348
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,060
I'm going to roll a 10.

1349
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,060
I'm going to roll a 10.

1350
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,060
I'm going to roll a 10.

1351
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,060
I'm going to roll a 10.

1352
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,060
I'm going to roll a 10.

1353
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:01,060
And forced, oh yeah, I have to roll for forced as well.

1354
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:05,060
I have 3 HP.

1355
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:09,060
Where's my... where's the fucking d20?

1356
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,060
Ugh, forced. Forrest, what have you done?

1357
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:17,060
I look like Patrick Pespo's right now. You do, he's

1358
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:21,060
missing. Oh, is he really? Yeah, he's missing. That's sad.

1359
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,060
Him and his wife, both missing. I bet you know where I bet he is, in Hollywood. Again!

1360
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,340
We can only hope.

1361
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,780
Dexterity saving throws again.

1362
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,780
Damn.

1363
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,780
There's a crit one.

1364
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,780
Fuck me, man.

1365
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,780
No, wait, wait, wait.

1366
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,780
Oh, another one?

1367
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,780
That's a three.

1368
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,780
It's still a crit one.

1369
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,780
That's another one we have to roll?

1370
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,780
Yeah, I got a four.

1371
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:37,780
Oh, that's a crit on.

1372
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:38,780
Eighteen.

1373
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,780
Okay, what'd you get?

1374
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,780
Crit one.

1375
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:41,780
Crit one, what'd you get, Zuck?

1376
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,780
I got a four.

1377
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:43,780
You take nine damage, Zuck.

1378
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,780
Whoa.

1379
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,780
I'm fucking dead, bruh.

1380
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,780
You take five damage.

1381
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:47,780
I'm dead.

1382
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,780
He got a crit one?

1383
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,780
I'll just heal both of them.

1384
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,780
I'm gonna heal both of them.

1385
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,780
I'm gonna heal both of them.

1386
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:56,300
damage. I'm gonna crit one. I'll just heal both of you guys right now. I'm

1387
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,180
dead. Okay, I heal them.

1388
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:02,660
Okay, you guys land. Wait, wait, I'm healing them. Another campaign where we

1389
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:06,220
just die. That's all we do. We just fucking die and heal them.

1390
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:13,980
Eight damage. Eight forces healed back. I'm back to full. I'm at eight. You

1391
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:19,240
guys are healed and then I take two energy chargers. Yep. I pop an Adderall

1392
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,440
that I had in my pocket.

1393
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:26,140
That's awesome as a power up like Mario, like Super Mario. That's fucking sick.

1394
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:30,440
So you guys land on the private server. Yeah, that's good man. I don't know you

1395
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,440
were do you focus you've a lot of focus. No, because I don't have ADHD because

1396
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,240
I'm me and my twin don't have a d. You're just you're just we we stand up

1397
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,840
we we

1398
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:46,740
now that I've taken the Adderall, my brother's name is now we no bro. Don't

1399
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:51,040
bring we sent to know not we send we can't go on this. No, we're saving. We're

1400
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,840
saving. We're saving weeks for the next campaign. And yeah, you guys approach the

1401
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,840
private virtual network. So one of you forced can stay behind and you're going

1402
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,240
to have to tell him forced. You will stay behind.

1403
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:09,140
Okay, and force will stay behind. Somebody has to communicate with him.

1404
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:14,240
So forced. How's my phone? Now? I see. Give me your phone. How can we call him?

1405
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:18,420
if you have you gave him where's your phone to you have a phone yeah. I've

1406
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:21,340
had a phone the whole time. I've been a phone. I developed this.

1407
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:27,020
I have a draw. I all have ways of communicating with each other. You can

1408
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,960
just tell him to like you will communicate with him. The second the

1409
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,900
hash just thrown in will communicate with you every second yeah.

1410
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,240
So now you guys need to

1411
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:43,780
fly back through the cloud and into the portal and you'll fall through directly

1412
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:48,100
It's a soaked city. But before that happens, oh wait, I do another makeover.

1413
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,540
This is the sound for flying.

1414
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:57,500
Pretty cool. And then play the makeover music.

1415
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:05,980
It's over. It's over? It is. It's over for you. Oh, okay.

1416
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:10,380
The episode's done? No. Oh, it's just over for you.

1417
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:17,380
So we fly and we get you guys into Soak City.

1418
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,380
Geez.

1419
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:22,380
And next time we will.

1420
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,380
Oh, it is over.

1421
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,380
It is over.

1422
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,380
Oh, wow.

1423
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,380
Yeah, sorry.

1424
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,380
Next time we will explore.

1425
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,380
I was just saying it was over for Patrick because Julio wasn't playing the music.

1426
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,380
You had an amazing read there, my friend.

1427
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,380
Yeah, it was a good read.

1428
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,380
Because we got, we got, we have.

1429
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,380
Julio left the computer.

1430
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,380
Yeah.

1431
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,380
I think Julio fell asleep.

1432
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,380
We need to check on him.

1433
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:44,580
on him. Is he sleepy? Hello, are you there? You there, buddy? Julio. He's completely gone.

1434
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:49,220
He's gone. He left us. There's no way. We're going to have to stop the recording manually.

1435
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:54,420
Great. We just have to press a button. How much fucking work does he make us do? I know.

1436
01:12:54,420 --> 01:13:01,420
Bro, we pay you $200 a month. Do I look like the Beatles or maybe? You do. Say Ringo. Ringo.

1437
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,060
- Oh. - Ringo.

1438
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:03,980
- Ringo.

1439
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,660
- I smoked weed in Japan. - Well.

1440
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:09,740
- Paul McCartney got caught with pot in Japan.

1441
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,180
- Unbelievable episode.

1442
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:13,060
- Pot, he was caught with pot.

1443
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:19,020
- I'm gonna stay completely neutral on the two.

1444
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,060
I'm gonna say my first memory with,

1445
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,980
I think the first memory I remember

1446
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:27,100
is the shadow of a hot dog poking out

1447
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,100
in my bedroom when I was a kid.

1448
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,460
I saw the shadow of a hot dog on the wall.

1449
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:38,420
And it was kind of like a come to G like a Batman type moment. Come moment.

1450
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,060
Nope. Come to Jesus.

1451
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:45,620
Are you saying you got molested? I'm saying I saw the shadow of a hot dog.

1452
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,740
Are you trying to say seeing a shadow of a bat?

1453
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:52,060
Are you saying shadow? Oh, did he see the full bet?

1454
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,740
I don't know. I thought he saw the shadow of the moon.

1455
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,940
My bad. So you got attacked by a hot dog.

1456
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,900
No, I was attacked by burgers,

1457
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,460
but I saw the shadow of a hot dog that saved me.

1458
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:04,340
And there's nothing about molestation in this.

1459
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,700
Why are you bringing up molesting on the hamburger versus hot dog debate?

1460
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,140
Well, you brought up the shadow of a hot dog on your bedroom wall,

1461
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:13,060
which kind of makes it it feels like that's what you're getting at.

1462
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,620
It feels like you're trying the way you were kind of laughing when you were saying

1463
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:20,460
it. No, I was imagining a hot dog style Batman.

1464
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,380
But what is the shadow?

1465
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:23,780
Why would you be a shadow?

1466
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,740
Is because Batman is a different hero.

1467
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,140
That's a shadow.

1468
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:27,980
- What do you mean?

1469
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:28,820
- A shadow is Batman of the night.

1470
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:29,900
- Also, what are you, you're saying like,

1471
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,900
like you, bats are to Batman,

1472
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,460
like hot dogs are to you?

1473
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,420
- A shadow is the Batman of the night?

1474
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,260
Is that what you just said?

1475
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,100
- Let's just move on.

1476
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,780
- Wait, I just, we're not gonna get anywhere.

1477
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,460
- We're not even gonna get anywhere.

1478
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,500
This actually makes the most sense to me,

1479
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,340
is what I was trying to say.

1480
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,660
- This is what makes the most sense to you?

1481
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:47,600
This is what you're trying to say,

1482
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,340
is that a hot, a hot dog as Batman on a plate?

1483
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,860
You're making no sense.

1484
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:53,500
- You're, something is wrong with you.

1485
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,980
- I feel like I just went crazy trying to puzzle out

1486
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,820
what you said.

1487
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:01,420
Can you answer, did you actually say a hot dog or a shadow is the Batman of the night?

1488
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,420
Or did I?

1489
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,340
Was I like falling asleep?

1490
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,340
I heard that too.

1491
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,340
I heard that too.

1492
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,340
I heard that too.

1493
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:07,340
I heard that too.

1494
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:08,300
(explosion)
