ingredients peanut butter chocolate and peanut butter and chocolate that's a

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:42,420
good point yeah yeah there's some other classic two ingredients the point is the

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:50,980
point is we're better off without them yeah and I don't know what he's doing I

37
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,980
I know what he's doing. I wrote a battle rap about it.

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,980
Yeah.

39
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Yeah, do you want to hear it?

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,980
Like an asynchronous battle rap? He can respond next week?

41
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Yeah, he'll have at least a week to respond.

42
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980
Yeah, okay.

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,980
But I did write something for Patrick.

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,980
Patrick, this is for you, you punk.

45
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
You stupid punk bitch.

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Patrick.

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
*music*

48
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,980
Fuck Patrick

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
*laughs*

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,980
Fuck Jay Z

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
What's up Patrick you stupid fat fuck

52
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,980
Thought you could skip this episode?

53
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,980
Well good luck

54
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,980
You had to take a day off just to change your diaper

55
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,980
If I had a sniper I would shoot you

56
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,980
With my sniper

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
Bet you skipped the episode to put stuff in your ass

58
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Probably skipping recess right now

59
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,980
To go to class

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,400
Being paddled by the principal for punishment then explaining to his parents that he really wanted it

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,880
Because a secret about Pat you might not know there's plenty that I can say right now

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,420
So I'll take it slow first off Pat like school, and that's not cool Pat loves rules his cats do too

63
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,920
That's just true. He loves homework. He hates fucking toys. He hates playtime. He loves fucking eight boys

64
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,860
He takes up the entire couch when he sits and Eminem murdered you on your own shit

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,080
His favorite movie is probably a girl one my favorite movie is Star Wars the third one

66
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,640
With the awesome fight scenes and lightsabers the Star Wars franchise to me was a lifesaver

67
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,560
The part where Anakin and Obi-Wan fight the night that I watched that was a great night

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,800
I wish it had more Padme so I could jack off to it even with pregnant Padme

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,000
I jacked off to it this thing between me and Patrick is like Vader vs. Luke

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,440
But I'm Darth Vader and he is a dog's poop and hey Pat don't even bother coming back because if you do

71
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I'll own you with another rap

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,320
whoa

73
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Fuck you Patrick

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,560
damn

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
You fucking suck man

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Yeah, that was brutal

77
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,920
Yeah, I took it to him. I think you took it a little too far. I had to bring something to him

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,560
You think I took it too far? Yeah, I think he's gonna cry.

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,360
Hope so. I hope he cries. I hope he I hope he apologizes

80
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,880
For skipping for letting everybody yeah for crying like a bitch, baby and for letting everybody down. Yeah

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:26,320
You're paying for this Patrick. He's not he's we're not giving him the patreon cut this month. No, definitely not

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,920
What is he even doing? I don't know. I think he has a

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,980
Think he has a job interview for cleaner of his own toilet using his mouth and tongue. Oh, yeah

84
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,380
Yeah, yeah, I forgot about that.

85
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,940
He has a job interview to be the guy

86
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,160
who fucks his mom instead of his dad.

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,460
Yeah.

88
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,440
He's interviewing with his cats to be allowed to pet them.

89
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,260
They don't--

90
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,140
He's interviewing with his penis

91
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,060
to see if he could beat his own third wall.

92
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,540
Touch it.

93
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,460
Yeah, can I suck you penis?

94
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,660
Yeah, we'll have to have an interview for.

95
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,460
(laughing)

96
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,740
What's your greatest weakness?

97
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,860
I'm not flexible.

98
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,260
Okay, this isn't gonna work.

99
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,220
I bet you he's interviewing two or three hot dogs right now.

100
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,300
He's interviewing to be a remote eating contest contestant.

101
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,980
Yeah, he's doing his audition for a guy who's watching TV instead of doing the podcast.

102
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Yeah.

103
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,740
And right now he's crushing it.

104
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
Yeah.

105
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,660
Fastest, fastest guzzling a bucket of cum down to the bottom.

106
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,580
Fastest guzzling a bucket of cum.

107
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,820
Fastest.

108
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,140
He's doing Adobe Premiere video editing to make it look like he's a girl in every video

109
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,700
of him online.

110
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,980
He's going back and he's adding big fake tits.

111
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Yeah.

112
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,660
He's learning After Effects so that he can digitally add tits to himself.

113
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Exactly.

114
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,980
Yeah, but he doesn't want to get the real ones because he doesn't want to actually touch

115
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
tits.

116
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
He just wants to look like he has them.

117
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
He's terrified, yeah.

118
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
He's terrified.

119
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,220
Yeah, Patrick, you suck, man.

120
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
Got him.

121
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
Got your ass, bitch.

122
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,380
I don't think he's going to be able to respond to that rep.

123
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,260
I think that's a nail in the coffin, career-wise.

124
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,420
Yeah, finally.

125
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,340
Finally somebody put him in his place.

126
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,700
Yeah, six feet under the ground.

127
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,260
Yeah, 'cause the reality is he doesn't like toys.

128
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,660
He doesn't play with Legos.

129
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,500
He doesn't have Nerf guns.

130
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,860
He has two cats.

131
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,900
He has two cats and a psycho-themed bathroom.

132
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,400
Yeah, and a mind freak magic set

133
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,780
hanging on the wall unopened.

134
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,700
Yeah, uh-huh.

135
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,860
Doesn't even take it out to play with it.

136
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,980
He sucks man, he watches R-rated movies.

137
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,480
Yeah, we're only G.

138
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,180
We watch G-rated movies for the G.

139
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,960
I wish G, sometimes I watch PG because it's pimp,

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,640
that means pimp G. Pimp gangster.

141
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,020
Pimp gangster, G is gangster.

142
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,540
PG is pimp gangster.

143
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,840
PG-13 is pimp gangster at 13 years old.

144
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,100
(laughing)

145
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,460
Yeah, we all know what the R is for.

146
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,260
And that's why Patrick watches it.

147
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,620
That's right, that's right, 'cause he's an R.

148
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,460
- Yeah.

149
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,300
- Yeah.

150
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,260
- Yeah, really ugly.

151
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,900
- Yeah, and we know what triple X stands for,

152
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,140
the movie Triple X.

153
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,080
- Yeah.

154
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,700
- Yeah, and NC-17, that means North Carolina.

155
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,260
- 17. - 17, that's why I watch it.

156
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,660
- 'Cause you're 17. - That's why I watch it.

157
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,860
'Cause I'm 17 years old.

158
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,760
I wish, man.

159
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,860
I wish I was 17 again, like the movie.

160
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,900
- Yeah, I remember I watched that movie on an airplane,

161
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,420
and I was like, damn.

162
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,660
- I said, damn.

163
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,940
- That guy's 17 again.

164
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,820
That guy turned into Zac Efron.

165
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,860
The first movie I ever watched on an airplane was,

166
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,980
also that movie 17 again,

167
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,340
can you imagine having that big of a drop off

168
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,260
in your looks from 17 to 40

169
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,100
that you go from Zac Efron to Vince Vaughn?

170
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,980
Also, like doesn't he have sex with a girl?

171
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,580
Yeah, dude, of course.

172
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,420
Yeah.

173
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,300
Well, 'cause there's no mental age of consent.

174
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,020
All of those movies are based on the idea

175
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,780
that it's just your body.

176
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,020
So like in Big, remember he fucks the shit out of that bitch.

177
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,220
I've never seen Big.

178
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,460
Oh dude, Big is like about an 11 year old boy who gets old and is like a fuck so grown

179
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
woman.

180
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,980
He turns into Tom Hanks, he plays on a giant piano, and then he takes this girl, this girl

181
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,860
he works with, he like takes her back to his apartment and he like is so stupid and has

182
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,780
such a child's brain that he is not thinking about sex at all.

183
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,780
They get back to the apartment and he's like, "Do you want to jump on my bed?"

184
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,780
Oh my god.

185
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,380
like sure he has a bunk bed and then and then he she's like do you want to touch

186
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,780
my tits and fuck my face and he's like yeah I guess I'll do that yeah okay

187
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,260
alright it'd be funny one of those movies like if he's like he gets into

188
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,700
the he goes in the magic microwave or whatever trans changes your age and

189
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,180
they actually press the big button on the on the Samsung microwave and he

190
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,300
comes out and he's Zac Efron and he looks in the mirror and he's like oh my

191
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:54,740
god I'm Zac Efron. I love that scene in 17 again where Vince Vaughn turns into Zac Efron and says

192
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,940
oh my god I can finally fuck high schoolers. This is gonna rock. That is the plot of that.

193
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:11,140
The plot of the movie is what if you could go fuck high schoolers again. And Vince Vaughn signed on

194
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:17,780
so fast yeah yeah yeah then then they change the name afterward also the part

195
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,460
of big the best part is the end where he turns back into a kid and meets up with

196
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:29,500
the girl really he's like you're a child and he's like yeah sorry do you still

197
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,500
wanna fuck and she's like I don't think I can anymore but if you oh she says

198
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,140
yeah like wait ten years or something yeah call me when you're big again like

199
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
something like that.

200
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
(laughing)

201
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Yeah. Call me when you're...

202
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Hey, to a 13 year old.

203
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Call me... I know I fucked you once,

204
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,140
but call me when you're...

205
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,140
old.

206
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
Yeah. Let me get back in the microwave.

207
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,140
I'll get paid again.

208
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,140
That's the thing. That is like, you know,

209
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,140
it may be well trodden territory,

210
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,140
but I think also,

211
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,140
in movies and shit, there's so many examples of

212
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
like, older women talking to

213
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,140
to little boys and being like, "When you're old, I'm gonna suck your dick."

214
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
And if that was reversed, it was just like...

215
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,140
If Big was reversed, it was just that girl,

216
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,140
a teenage girl with like a diary with a lock on it,

217
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,140
and she accidentally turns into like Scarlett Johansson,

218
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,140
and then like Mickey Rourke fucks the shit out of her.

219
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,140
And then at the end of the movie, she's like,

220
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,140
"Hey, so, I'm actually a little girl."

221
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,020
And he's like, yeah, call me when you're coming the day of your 18th birthday

222
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,740
As long as you have the same snatch

223
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:54,700
Yeah, we're 17 again seven well 17 again definitely would have been

224
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:01,660
Would have been more people would have liked it more if it was about a girl. Absolutely. Everyone likes everything better when it's about a girl

225
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,160
Yeah, that's what's happening 13 going on 30s another movie like that. I don't remember she has sex in that though

226
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,820
I haven't seen that one either 13 guys the

227
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,360
Isn't it doesn't happen in blank check - or but there's not a transformation. He's just rich

228
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,620
Which is kind of it's the same thing if you're a rich kid you can

229
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:27,140
You're an independently wealthy 13 year old that's really do whatever you want. Yeah

230
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,580
That's basically to a woman. That's the same as being an adult. Yeah

231
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,720
(laughing)

232
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,060
Having a lot of money.

233
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,760
That movie rocks though.

234
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,820
Blank Check was like,

235
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,980
that was like, as a kid I was like,

236
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,620
this will be the blueprint for my life.

237
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,140
Yeah, this is what's gonna happen to me.

238
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,980
Yeah.

239
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,060
I'm gonna have a rocket skateboard

240
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,480
and I'm gonna ride it down the banister

241
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,120
of my mansion every morning.

242
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,620
Yeah, I'm gonna have a,

243
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,500
I used to love any movie that was about

244
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,440
like a really rich kid.

245
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
I used to love that movie,

246
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,660
did you ever seen The Toy with Richard Pryor?

247
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,500
No.

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,340
Terrible movie in hindsight. It's about Richard Pryor is

249
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,420
Get this he's a black guy. What and a rich man buys him for his son

250
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:24,060
Richard Pryor like works for this guy or something and he's like listen, what if I what if I pay you to be my son's toy?

251
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,020
And he does it dude and when I was a kid, I was like the it was my favorite movie. I thought it was

252
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,060
It is funny to me, you know, it is a Richard Pryor movie but

253
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:48,260
Any movie that's just like like a kid doing adult stuff. Yes was cool to me, you know, Richie Rich

254
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,260
just being

255
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,020
Being able to do anything you wanted, you know, yeah

256
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,620
Butler prank, but yeah pranking the butler. Yeah

257
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,420
I mean that is what the toy is, is it's just Richard Pryor, he gets bought by a white guy

258
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,660
and then the son just like pranks him all day.

259
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:18,140
Is like pulls out, pulls the thousands dollar carpet out from under him and breaks his neck.

260
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,100
That's what you do with the toy, you prank it.

261
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,340
Yeah you prank the shit out of your toys.

262
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,460
Play tricks on your human toy.

263
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,860
It's funny that Richard Pryor was in a movie called The Toy before there was ever like a

264
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,540
a black GI Joe or anything.

265
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,460
Like it was, Richard Pryor was the first black toy.

266
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,900
I mean we don't, we won't have equality in movies until we get an all-white reboot of

267
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
the toy.

268
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Yeah, that's right.

269
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,460
Yeah, yeah, directed by Jordan Peele.

270
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,460
Yeah.

271
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,420
Yeah, and it's a, they could, he could do a remake of that as a horror movie now probably.

272
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Yeah.

273
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,300
No, it should just be a comedy.

274
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,740
Who would he buy as a toy?

275
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Who would the white toy be?

276
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Yeah, the white toy.

277
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,740
Adam DeVine.

278
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

279
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Perfect.

280
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Yeah.

281
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Or Adam Devine.

282
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
Whatever the one from Workaholics is.

283
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
The chubby one.

284
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
I don't know.

286
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,740
Yeah.

287
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
That guy is annoying.

288
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
I don't like looking at him.

289
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,740
Oh, yeah.

290
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
You don't like his house party?

291
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
What's that?

292
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,140
He has a show called Adam DeVine, DeVine, DeVine, DeViney's House Party.

293
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
That's a really long name.

294
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,300
Yeah, it's a terrible name for a TV show.

295
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,620
But it's like 30 minutes of just like his friends doing stand up.

296
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
It's not very good.

297
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
It's pretty awesome.

298
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,300
But they do it outside.

299
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,140
It's an outside...

300
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
I wish that more...

301
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
I really hope...

302
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
It would be awesome.

303
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,860
You know how so many like...

304
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,660
I guess this is probably not just an Emerson thing but like just like a bunch...

305
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,180
When there are a bunch of rich kids who are in a friend group who are like want to do

306
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,980
like comedy or write or whatever, there's always...

307
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,620
like a thousand friend groups and they're all just like you know what we should

308
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,780
just write a sitcom that's just us and I really hope that like it would be so

309
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:08,340
like it is in like five years just TV is just full of just terrible yeah the

310
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:14,140
other one is the kids quad the friend a mutual friend of ours I don't want to

311
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,420
tell I don't want to say who this is because but you will know who this is

312
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,060
because it is kind of embarrassing but he told me and another friend that what

313
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,740
like the first week that we were in college, he was like, "Yeah, my dream show, my dream

314
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,580
like job basically would be like a show that's like about me as like a stand-up comedian

315
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,860
in New York City and I would just be like walking around and like doing shows.

316
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,420
Maybe I'd eat pizza in the opening."

317
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,020
It was just, it was Louis.

318
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,020
Yeah.

319
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
No, absolutely.

320
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,520
That's those are the two the two ends of the spectrum is of like rich of like here's my pilot idea

321
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:02,540
Yeah, it's either the sjw side is is the the the friend group and the free speech side is the is the bomb

322
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:10,560
Stand-up. Yeah, yeah, but but because for the sitcom breaking to one of my friends that he has to be the disabled one

323
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,620
Hey, man, I know that your legs work in real life, but in the show you're gonna be in a wheelchair

324
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,000
Listen pal. Um, we're like really committed to diversity, but we're all white. So you gotta be Chinese. Yeah

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're gonna have to take

326
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,020
You should be you should be really excited for this opportunity to to try and portray another culture

327
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:41,220
It's really you can bring it. This would be you can branch out here. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna you're the one everybody's gonna play themselves

328
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,220
But we are we're gonna cast Lupita Nyong'o to play you just so you know

329
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,440
David you're gonna be yeah played by Lupita. Yeah, we told David he had to be Chinese in the show

330
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,800
And it's he's we don't hang out with him anymore because he just started method method acting all the time

331
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:03,900
Yeah, he insisted on playing. Yeah, he was doing Jared Leto style pranks. He was sending he was putting rice in people's mailboxes

332
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:10,900
That's my role.

333
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,500
Yeah, I don't think TV like that's going to exist in five years, honestly.

334
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Absolutely not.

335
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,180
No, like it's just everybody's so stupid that they think that like, like, there's a point

336
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,340
where like, even even though like every there, you'll have a 10 person friend group and every

337
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,220
single one is the son of a different executive at some like TV company, their show is never

338
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,140
gonna get made, 'cause it sucks fucking ass, dude.

339
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,740
It's so bad.

340
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,500
Yeah, also just like, I truly don't think in 10 years

341
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,160
there will be the same sort of network infrastructure.

342
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,060
I think it's already going away so fast.

343
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,100
I think in like five years,

344
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
something I remember in like late 2000s,

345
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,120
when cord cutting first became a thing

346
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,020
and Netflix streaming and Hulu

347
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,500
and a couple years later, the HBO stuff.

348
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,700
I think then everybody was like,

349
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,140
oh, this is like the beginning of a new era in media

350
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,900
or whatever, it'll be super hyper-focused

351
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,260
and no show will have 50 million people

352
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,700
watching it ever again.

353
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,500
And everybody's like, ah, phooey.

354
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,260
But I think it's now is when that's happening.

355
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,100
- Absolutely. - You know what I mean?

356
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,260
- Yeah, there's so many shows

357
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,060
that just people have never heard of.

358
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,740
- There's also, at any given point in time on TV,

359
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,760
there's five good TV shows that are worth watching

360
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,840
out of hundreds, but people, a lot of people,

361
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,160
especially now are just, even like my parents,

362
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,640
like my dad watches like a YouTube show now.

363
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Yeah.

364
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
And I was like, oh, that is like the,

365
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,200
I would say the barometer for when the seas

366
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,240
have changed a little bit.

367
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,080
Absolutely.

368
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
When my fucking, my dad who,

369
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
my dad doesn't have cable anymore,

370
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,760
and my dad used to watch, he used to watch ESPN

371
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,960
like it was his job.

372
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,800
Yeah.

373
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,600
sit there, watch PTI, dip, drink Coca-Cola,

374
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
and then spit on me.

375
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,220
And now, like he watches some fucking sports show on YouTube.

376
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,240
- Yeah. - You know?

377
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
Just weird.

378
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,960
- It's so funny to like look at the landscape of streaming,

379
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,680
like how it is in this like crazy time

380
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,060
where just like all these people are getting their voices

381
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,040
heard and like new stuff being made,

382
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,200
and then like fumble the bag as hard as Quibi.

383
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,680
- Oh man. - This is the new thing.

384
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,560
I haven't even looked at Quibi. What happened with Quibi?

385
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
I mean it's just failing miserably.

386
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,060
But did it actually launch and shit?

387
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
Yeah, it's been out for a while.

388
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,060
And I remember, because when I was interning at a company,

389
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,560
You can just say it, they'll be gone in nine months.

390
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,060
Yeah, when I was interning at Funny or Die, like so much of their shit was like,

391
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,060
"Oh yeah, we're producing a new show for Quibi."

392
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,560
And I was like, "What the fuck is Quibi?"

393
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,060
And they're like, "Oh yeah, it's a new streaming service where you can only watch on your phone."

394
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
And I was like, oh, well, that's gonna fail.

395
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,500
Like this, that's the instant reaction.

396
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,860
It's like, oh, nobody would watch that.

397
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,700
What are you talking about?

398
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,540
- I mean, that's just what YouTube is.

399
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,340
- Yeah, it's like, but YouTube,

400
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,660
you can watch it on your computer

401
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,500
and you don't have to pay.

402
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,340
- True.

403
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,180
(laughing)

404
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,000
- Yeah.

405
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,140
- Quibi's just like, what if we took,

406
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,980
what if we made like worst shows that nobody wants to watch?

407
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,340
And they're like, their whole deal was like,

408
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,820
oh, we're gonna get like big directors

409
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,100
and we're gonna get like a draw for this.

410
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,260
Like, it's all new content.

411
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,580
So we're like, oh, we're gonna have a new Sam Raimi show

412
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,860
and everybody's gonna flock to that.

413
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,700
- But they don't realize is that--

414
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,140
- Nobody fucking cares.

415
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,300
- Yeah, nobody's like,

416
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,940
there's maybe 4,000 people who are like,

417
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,060
I need to watch the next Sam Raimi project.

418
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,660
Most people have no idea,

419
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,980
like a larger audience doesn't know,

420
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,820
unless you get--

421
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,020
- They don't have enough big jobs.

422
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,900
- J.J. Abrams or Christopher Nolan to make quibby shows,

423
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,820
which will happen. - Exactly, yeah.

424
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,780
They didn't get big enough names.

425
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,180
- Yeah, nobody's gonna fucking--

426
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,300
- It's so funny, and yeah,

427
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,300
just like the only way I could see that succeeding

428
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,020
is if like people watching it on their commute, right?

429
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,540
But now nobody commutes anymore

430
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,820
'cause everybody's at home all the time.

431
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,300
There's no reason to watch anything on here.

432
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,620
It's so funny.

433
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,460
Like they're only paying us for success.

434
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,300
I'm glad, dude.

435
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,780
Quibi deserves to fucking rot.

436
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,620
- Well, there's enough platforms.

437
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,560
- They're pumping so much money into it.

438
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,380
It's like so insane, dude.

439
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,220
- Is there any like, you know,

440
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,260
'cause they always do that thing where they like,

441
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,480
those new streaming services get like one,

442
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,440
One like niche, like cult comedy,

443
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,920
like sketch team or whatever.

444
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,080
It's all new content.

445
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,720
So they don't even have the draw of like,

446
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
oh, the movies you used to like.

447
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,360
But do they have like,

448
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,200
did they pick up like some like YouTube,

449
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,520
like a sketch trio or something and give them a show?

450
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,360
I don't know.

451
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,200
Oh, wait, I'm gonna look up their--

452
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,240
That's what, what was the NBC one

453
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,560
that was just for comedy that sucked so bad?

454
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,680
See So.

455
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,240
Yeah, See So tried to pick up like all these small,

456
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,920
Like, basically tried to grab all these podcasts

457
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,080
and they were like, "Hey, make a show."

458
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,920
- Yeah.

459
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,520
- And all of them fucking sucked, dude.

460
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,040
- I mean, yeah, it's just, you're not gonna,

461
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,840
you're not gonna make a new streaming service

462
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,680
and have it succeed unless you,

463
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,160
unless you're a giant, already a giant, like.

464
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,720
- Yeah, basically if you can,

465
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,240
the only reason Disney+ worked

466
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,280
is because they had Star Wars to put on it.

467
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,660
- Absolutely. - And the Avengers.

468
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,880
If Disney+ had been like,

469
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,800
"Hey, you can watch Song of the South again."

470
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,080
Nobody, except me maybe, would have subscribed to that.

471
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,960
- Wait, I'm trying to find the lineup.

472
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,280
Oh, they're putting movies on there too?

473
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
I thought it was just shows.

474
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,800
- Movies that are, they have vertical movies?

475
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,960
- Yeah, no, so the thing is,

476
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,800
it's like all either vertical or horizontal.

477
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,600
Like you can change, you can switch it,

478
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,520
and it's like a different shot

479
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
based on how you hold your phone.

480
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,560
Yeah, this is so...

481
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,120
(laughs)

482
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
It's starring, you're just scrolling through a movie,

483
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,320
It's like starring Liam Hemsworth and Christoph Waltz.

484
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Starring, uh...

485
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,840
We're gonna make- let's do a new streaming service so you can only watch on the LCD panel

486
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,320
in your car.

487
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,860
And you can only watch it when it's- when you're driving.

488
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,960
The engine has to be currently active.

489
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,300
They have a- they have a Chrissy- they have a Small Claims Court show hosted by Chrissy

490
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Teigen.

491
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Oh, fuck, dude.

492
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Called Chrissy's Court.

493
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Goddamn it, dude.

494
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
That sucks.

495
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Damn it, dude.

496
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,860
Oh shit, they have a reboot of Punk'd.

497
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
I hope all the-

498
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,140
Who did I chance the rapper?

499
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,660
I bet every- that her ruling on every small claims court thing is she's like-

500
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
Stop attacking me.

501
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,980
Yeah, I need $3,000 from this person.

502
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,500
She's like, "Well, why don't you just ask your husband for it?"

503
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Yeah.

504
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Yeah, just give it-

505
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Just ask your rich husband.

506
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Oh, it's only $3,000?

507
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I mean, just give it to him.

508
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,060
$3,000, that's not- I mean, I would give it to you if I didn't need it to publish a

509
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,580
cookbook. Yeah I thought this was supposed to be issues that mattered. I mean just

510
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,460
give them the $3,000. I still love watching Divorce Court. Did you ever

511
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,940
watch that? No. Divorce Court rocked. They'd get two of the like shittiest

512
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,660
white people in the world who were fighting over some ugly kid with an

513
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,860
undiagnosed learning disability and they'd put the kid in the middle and

514
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,420
and they'd put the two white parents

515
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,180
with pimples on either side.

516
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,180
And then the like sassy black judge would just be like,

517
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,160
"You need to do this for your daughter!"

518
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,240
And make them cry.

519
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,620
It was one of the greatest shows ever.

520
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,960
I don't think it's around anymore.

521
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,020
It was that, Judge Joe Brown.

522
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,580
They were like Judge Judy like spinoffs, you know,

523
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,400
but just doing kind of the same thing.

524
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,680
- Dude, I'm reading through the like lineup

525
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,620
of like unscripted shows on here, on Quibi,

526
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
and this is just insane.

527
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,080
There's so many that just sound like

528
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,360
they're generated by AI.

529
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,200
There's one called Game Show, G-A-Y-M-E.

530
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,000
You said generated by a guy?

531
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,960
AI.

532
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,800
Oh.

533
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Artificial intelligence, you heard of it?

534
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,640
No.

535
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,520
There's Game Show, it's a gay game show.

536
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,600
There's-- Game Show, G-A-Y-M-E?

537
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,840
Yeah.

538
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,760
That's not bad.

539
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,720
Listen to this, listen to the description of this.

540
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,640
This is a cooking show called Dishmantled.

541
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,360
Each episode of the cooking competition hosted by Titus Burgess starts with a cannon blasting

542
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,080
of a mystery food dish into the faces of two blindfolded chefs.

543
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,160
They have to identify the exploded dish and then race against the clock to recreate it.

544
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Fuck, dude.

545
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,400
Oh my god, man.

546
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:27,160
The race to like, the like, turning, I mean it's just, it's becoming idiocracy so much

547
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,500
faster than I thought it would be.

548
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,720
You ain't got these.

549
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,720
about sneaker culture from executive producer Lena Waithe. Fierce Queens

550
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,760
presented and narrated by Reese Witherspoon nature series from the BBC

551
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,600
Studios natural history unit explores the fabulous females of the animal

552
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,960
kingdom from ant Queens to speedy cheetahs. Oh my god bro are you serious?

553
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,520
That fucking rocks it's just Reese Witherspoon just talking

554
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,800
over like a praying mantis eating its mate. Yeah, work. And that's boss shit. God man,

555
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,000
that sucks. We should get a show. Yeah, we should. Quibi, we'll stop flaming you if you

556
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,320
uh... I'll do a whole show of Patrick Rap Battles. The Daily Chill, show that takes users

557
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,540
on a pathway to calmness with each episode featuring a new global destination and a new

558
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,120
ASMR journey to peace. Damn, it's so much funny how much money, like between like, stuff

559
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,560
like that ASMR headspace just like how much money gets pumped into just making

560
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,480
people calm yeah because everybody freaks out all the fucking time damn they

561
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
have so much news what the fuck they have a bunch of news networks they have the

562
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,480
weather channel and NBC and BBC News CBS ESPN is there like like is it right if

563
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,920
you hold it side if you hold it sideways it's just regular news but if you hold

564
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,360
it if you hold it horizontal or vertical you get to see under the desk yeah you

565
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,840
to see what their legs look like.

566
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,640
Yeah, that's right.

567
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,440
You just see the bottom half, baby.

568
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,520
(laughs)

569
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,020
Yeah, this is,

570
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,600
it's ridiculous, so stupid.

571
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,200
It's just that I don't understand

572
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,160
why they thought this would take off.

573
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,800
It's because the people who have money

574
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,880
and put money into stuff are so stupid about,

575
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,440
they just have the worst ideas

576
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,000
and they invest in the worst ideas

577
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,800
because they're all fucking 70 years old.

578
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,900
- Yeah, well the guy, the like CEO of Quibi or whatever

579
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,480
did like a talk at our school in LA.

580
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,580
And I didn't go, but apparently he was like super like

581
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,000
excited about it and like super pumped up and be like,

582
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,240
"You guys are not gonna believe how incredible

583
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,160
"Quibi is gonna be."

584
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,480
And like showed everyone like a demo of it

585
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
and they were just like, "Oh."

586
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,500
- It's 'cause he probably fucking snorts Adderall

587
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,480
before he does any one of those fucking shows.

588
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,760
He doesn't care.

589
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,480
Nobody cares, if you're making over a million dollars

590
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,760
for anything, you don't care about it.

591
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,600
Absolutely.

592
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,120
No, you're just, you're phony, you're pretending.

593
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
That's why we care about this podcast,

594
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,780
because we make like $1,100 a month split three ways.

595
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,560
That's why this podcast is so good, of the highest quality.

596
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,400
Yeah.

597
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Because we review movies like "The Toy"

598
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,800
and uh... big and other movies where kids fuck adults

599
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,240
you know and you don't you don't get that kind of stuff a million dollar

600
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,600
production budgets you get that from home-grown grass-grown grass-fed organic

601
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,960
smoking grass podcasts

602
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,100
they fucking uh... they'd be making a remake of the fugitive

603
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,560
a modern social media infused update of the classic

604
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,080
come on dude

607
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,300
yeah

608
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,380
we're thinking of infusing the storyline with apps

609
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,920
yeah we're thinking of doing uh... the great gatsby but it's it's the great

610
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,120

He's freaking flipping the camera off.

623
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,700
Yeah, I bet he does a back flip.

624
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,540
Yeah.

625
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,140
Yeah, I bet they get a guy who looks

626
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,860
kind of like him to do a back flip.

627
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,700
I bet.

628
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,660
And they cut between, yeah.

629
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,500
Yeah.

630
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,580
We should do an awesome Eric Andre video.

631
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,700
Yeah, I mean that's, people love it, dude.

632
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,620
It's millennial daddism.

633
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,380
It's become a huge, yeah, exactly.

634
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,720
Yeah, if you ever watch a video--

635
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,300
It's become a huge, huge genre.

636
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,460
And something in there makes you freak out a little bit

637
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,560
you don't understand how it is or what it means,

638
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,380
I'm thinking you might've just seen some millennial daddaism.

639
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,820
- Yeah, hey mom, somebody's screaming on TV.

640
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,420
- Yeah. - This is not normal.

641
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,940
- Somebody posted a picture of a guy and said,

642
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,580
this is Justin Bieber, but it wasn't Justin Bieber.

643
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,660
- Yeah, that's right.

644
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,140
- That's a little thing called Zoomer Absurdism.

645
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,220
And it's the new-- - Yeah, that's sort of,

646
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,180
that's like, Drill is sort of the new Man Ray.

647
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,020
- Yeah.

648
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,860
- You know what I mean?

649
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,540
It's just about skewing reality

650
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,020
with just by just noticing,

651
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,420
oh, one little thing is off here, you know?

652
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
- Yeah.

653
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,740
There's this picture of a box and it says,

654
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,500
it's a box of Pop-Tarts, but it says Cop-Tarts.

655
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,300
And do you know what the picture on the box is?

656
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,220
It's a picture of a policeman.

657
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,500
- Oh my God.

658
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,740
You know what, to me, I was thinking,

659
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,780
I think the image macro that still makes me laugh

660
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,780
from my childhood is the Call of Duty Black Cops

661
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,320
and it's Michael Winslow from Family Matters.

662
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,200
That's a good, that's good, man.

663
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,640
That's still, that's some good zoomer dot dot dot dot.

664
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,960
That's some goo goo ga ga.

665
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,920
- That's some goo goo ga ga.

666
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,940
- That's some good good gingo ga go.

667
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,880
- You got that good good gingo ga go for me.

668
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,240
- Have you, I know me and Pat have talked to you,

669
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
but have you watched any goo goo foods yet?

670
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,220
- No.

671
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
You have to, man.

672
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,300
All right, I'll check it out.

673
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,580
It's so good, dude.

674
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,900
He made a video, Pat sent me this video,

675
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:39,360
it's him deep frying, the title is Deep Frying Every Meat.

676
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,260
(both laughing)

677
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,420
It's really just like six meats,

678
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,320
but he deep fries like a lobster tail,

679
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,140
and everything, he just like, he loves all of it,

680
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,740
but it's like, the question every time is like,

681
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,860
Is this good?

682
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,320
But he's a big, fat Puerto Rican dude,

683
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,100
and, or Brazilian guy, and it's like,

684
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,860
yeah, of course he's gonna like a deep fried pork chop.

685
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,500
So every single time he's just like,

686
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,140
and I was very worried about whether or not

687
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,380
this deep fried steak would be good,

688
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,580
but I took a bite and oh my goodness,

689
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,740
let me tell you folks,

690
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,300
it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.

691
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,260
And he just says that about every kind of meat.

692
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,100
It's really good, man.

693
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
That sounds awesome.

694
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
You ought to check it out.

695
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,260
I haven't been watching as many stupid videos recently.

696
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,300
I've just been playing video games like seven hours a day.

697
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Yeah.

698
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
It rocks.

699
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,300
I've just been watching movies and TV shows.

700
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,300
Anything good?

701
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,300
No.

702
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
No?

703
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Just don't watch shit movies?

704
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,300
Yes, but it doesn't really matter.

705
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,300
I mean, it wouldn't be interesting to talk about.

706
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,780
I'm just interested in what you're watching.

707
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,180
I've been watching, well I recently, I already talked about it, I recently watched the Planet

708
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:59,020
of the Apes reboot trilogy. Those are so good. I've been thinking about those like every day.

709
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,180
You just want that to- You want monkeys to take over the world.

710
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,680
No, I- Only if I was a monkey. I wouldn't want to be killed by a monkey.

711
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,660
You should get surgery to look like a monkey. That's not a bad idea.

712
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,020
Human proportions. Human proportions so they think you're really

713
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:22,780
big. Well, no, you could have your legs and arms like- or your torso like shortened. And

714
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
You could have your feet all fucked up.

715
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,060
Just put your shoulders right on your hips.

716
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,180
Just completely eliminate your tits.

717
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,660
And uh, yeah, yeah, you're all fucked up.

718
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:38,220
Coming out of surgery, "Do I look like a monkey now?"

719
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,700
Yes Cameron, you look so much like a monkey.

720
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,140
Please just get in this cage like a monkey is and we'll put you on display and people

721
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,020
can pay to watch you like a monkey.

722
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,140
We're gonna put you in the carnival like a monkey.

723
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Thank you.

724
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,660
Yeah, and you get hair plugs all over your body.

725
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,660
You look like, what's his name, Cousin It or whatever.

726
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660
Chewbacca.

727
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
You're thinking of Chewbacca from Adam's family.

728
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,340
You look like Chewbacca from Adam's family, yeah.

729
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Cousin Chewbacca.

730
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,220
Yeah, Cousin Chewbacca.

731
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,300
What if freaking Chewbacca was your cousin?

732
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,260
Oh my God.

733
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,740
Imagine what that uncle looks like.

734
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
Yeah.

735
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,860
Uncles are already so, my uncle's pretty hairy.

736
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,980
He's kind of got Chewbacca vibes.

737
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,980
Yeah.

738
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,420
Serious Chewbacca vibes from my--

739
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Who's your hairiest uncle?

740
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,260
I have an uncle named Harry.

741
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Is he hairy?

742
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
Yeah, pretty hairy.

743
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
Or is that a prank from God?

744
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,820
Yeah, that's one of God's great persons.

745
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,180
A lot is more is that, "Like an uncle named Harry, who is not hairy."

746
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,220
He's completely smooth all over.

747
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,700
Like a baby named Harry.

748
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,780
But the baby doesn't have hair, just to clarify.

749
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,020
Yeah, the baby--

750
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,020
A brand new baby.

751
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,860
Try again.

752
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,660
Like a hairless baby who won't grow any hair.

753
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,080
Who's named Harry.

754
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,240
- And he just came out.

755
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,420
- And he just came out of the vagina.

756
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,140
- You can't say that word in a song.

757
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,980
They'll ban the song.

758
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,800
- Vagina?

759
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,640
- Yeah.

760
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,480
- Yeah you can.

761
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,300
- No you can't.

762
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,140
They'll ban the song.

763
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,980
- Yeah.

764
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,940
Three, six, nine.

765
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,060
Damn you fine.

766
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,860
Put your vagina.

767
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,100
Man, you bitch, your vagina's on my mind.

768
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,020
Remember that song?

769
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,500
- No, it got banned.

770
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
- You don't remember that song?

771
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,340
Vagina wide open. You remember that? I don't know what you're talking about or

772
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:29,220
Head strong I take you on head strong vagina

773
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,580
Yeah, I never understood. Yeah, they're trying to say

774
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,300
Yeah, what are you trying to say there?

775
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,580
Yeah, it doesn't really make sense

776
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,660
Yeah

777
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,980
Doesn't uh, yeah. Oh, I

778
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,180
Vagina, how about instead of I'm a bee, it's vagina free.

779
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,300
Free?

780
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,540
It's about being such a guy.

781
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,380
Yeah.

782
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,300
I'm vagina free.

783
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,380
I'm living the vagina free lifestyle.

784
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,300
Yeah, vagina free.

785
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,500
I'm a bee, vagina free, that's what I am.

786
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,660
That would be one of the lines.

787
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,500
Yeah.

788
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,100
And then will I am, it would be,

789
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,260
instead of will I am, it would be I am Will,

790
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,500
because Will's a boy's name.

791
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,780
Yeah.

792
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,620
Yeah.

793
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:19,620
And Fergie, Fergie, um, well Fergie would be a guy then.

794
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,340
I guess.

795
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,340
It would be Fergus.

796
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
Ferguson.

797
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:35,620
Ferguson, the guy, the tall, the tall blonde guy in the Black Eyed Peas named Ferguson,

798
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:41,820
who has a song called "My Humps" and it's about his balls.

799
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,460
my humps, my lovely--

800
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,860
It's called My Dumps,

801
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,580
and it's about the big fat man poops.

802
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,060
Yeah, he's about taking a big shit in the toilet.

803
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,660
It'll take half an hour.

804
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,620
Yeah.

805
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,660
My dumps.

806
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,660
I would say, I probably spend about an hour a day

807
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,580
on the toilet. My stinky fella dumps.

808
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,100
My stinky fella dumps, check it out.

809
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,020
I probably spend about an hour of my day on the toilet,

810
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,540
And I probably spend, of that time,

811
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,300
maybe 15 seconds shitting.

812
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,260
Yeah.

813
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,780
'Cause when I get on the toilet,

814
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,780
it's like a trash chute opening.

815
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,700
Like it's just, all of it falls out

816
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,140
of my big asshole immediately.

817
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,980
Yeah.

818
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,800
And then I just sit there and I'm like,

819
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,220
well this is phone time.

820
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,300
Yeah.

821
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,500
You know?

822
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,260
Oh I know, I know what you mean.

823
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,100
Yeah.

824
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,360
I think I've talked about this,

825
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,560
but I think when I was a kid one time,

826
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,540
I walked in on my dad taking a shit

827
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,860
and he was reading the newspaper.

828
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,940
And I just looked at him for a long time

829
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,020
and he was like, "Get the hell out of here."

830
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,740
And the reason I was looking at him

831
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,060
was 'cause I was transfixed,

832
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,100
because I never thought of the idea

833
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,460
that you could just sit on the toilet

834
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,380
and read and escape your family.

835
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,220
- Yeah.

836
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,060
- It's so genius.

837
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,200
- It is ingenious.

838
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,700
- That's why they made bathrooms.

839
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,500
You used to just shit in the living room.

840
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,340
But then a man--

841
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,180
- I used to be at the dinner table.

842
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,500
- A man was like, "I need a fucking,

843
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,380
"I need some fucking alone time.

844
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,780
I need to do a crossword.

845
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,300
Dinner table chairs used to just have a hole under them.

846
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Chamber pots under, yeah.

847
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,300
Yeah.

848
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
And you would shit in them.

849
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,780
Yeah, and then some guy was like, "Man, I hate my wife so much."

850
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:22,540
"I hate my wife so much that I'm gonna build an entire new room that's a no wife zone."

851
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:27,980
And then eventually, because of various amendments and second wave feminism, women were allowed

852
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
to use bathrooms.

853
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,580
Yeah, and then they made the man cave, which is kind of like a second bathroom for the house.

854
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,820
And then pretty soon they're gonna try to, those fucking sneaky bitches are gonna try

855
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,860
to weasel their way into the man cave. And then you know what we're gonna make? We're

856
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,180
gonna make a spaceship that only men can go on that flies over the moon. We're gonna make

857
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:49,460
the man car. We're gonna make the, yeah. Yeah. That's an idea I stole from Saudi Arabia where

858
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:56,580
all cars are man cars. It's kind of a genius. That is why they did that. In Saudi Arabia,

859
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:03,020
they don't have man caves. They decided that men needed a place just for them and it's a

860
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:09,260
sweet Corvette. Absolutely. It's a fucking just a pimp ass vehicle. Yeah. Women,

861
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,980
hey sorry baby no girls allowed. Yeah. I'm in my man car I'm driving around I'm

862
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:24,220
listening to my vagina free song. Yeah. I'm listening to the sack guy penis. Yeah I'm

863
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,820
listening to your favorite Martian riding around in my Volkswagen and I'm

864
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:34,120
just having a little man time. Yeah. Just for myself. Singing along. Yeah. I'm listening

865
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:41,400
to the audio of Dave Portnoy's pizza reviews on YouTube just because I'm such a guy. And

866
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm singing along to that too. Yeah. One bite, that's the rules. Yeah. So, we actually, I

867
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,960
I don't know if you saw this,

868
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,400
but we got a hit piece written about us.

869
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,240
A hit piece?

870
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,060
Somebody's talking shit?

871
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,520
About podcast, about list.

872
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,120
Yeah. Oh my God.

873
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,940
It's not.

874
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,780
Well, we gotta take them down.

875
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,880
Did you hear that hit piece that I threw at,

876
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Patrick's, wait, did they talk about Patrick in this?

877
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,960
Oh, they do.

878
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,840
Oh my God, he's gonna get over twice, dude.

879
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,120
Yeah, no, there's some stuff I didn't know about him

880
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,400
in here. Wow!

881
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,760
Yeah, this is, it was from,

882
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,600
it's from kind of like a scold outlet

883
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,480
called the daily gulag

884
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,280
uh... okay like this like s leftist online publication which i've never

885
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,800
heard of but

886
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,240
uh... yeah and uh...

887
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,200
it's by this guy named i_m_d_ poop sucka

888
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,160
so i which i've never i_t_d_

889
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,400
it stands for

890
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,520
isaiah michael david

891
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,560
so that what she put under is and under the byline it's he said it stands for

892
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,680
as a michael david but it says

893
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,120
it also says it says right next to that i chose to use the initials because i

894
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,720
I just think initials sound cool when you're writing.

895
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,800
'Cause I don't know why he put that

896
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,560
at the top of the article. - IMD.

897
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,400
- But-- - What's it, wait,

898
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,420
what's his last name again?

899
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,260
- Poopsucka?

900
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,920
- Hmm. - I think that's like--

901
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,000
- Yeah, I would've gone IMDP.

902
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,840
If I was him. - Hmm?

903
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,720
- I would've gone full initials.

904
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,560
- Oh, it says actually right next to that

905
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,840
that he didn't do full initials

906
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,040
because it would get confused

907
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,840
with the Internet Movie Database,

908
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,440
which is IMDB. - Oh, Internet Movie Database.

909
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,280
- Yeah. - I forgot.

910
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
Yeah, I use that a lot. - The sequel.

911
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,660
But yeah, so this article,

912
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,340
hopefully we can put some of these,

913
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:28,640
the the... We can respond yeah you know kind of this is a huge milestone you

914
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,360
know first people trying to take us down. Yeah so this is the article is called

915
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Israel's number one podcast a look at podcast about list the crap monster of

916
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,720
the online left. So I'll just I guess okay yeah yeah this is our first

917
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:50,240
literature review. Yeah yeah there's a new podcast on the block and leftists

918
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,440
everywhere are dropping everywhere to drink dropping everything to drink

919
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,120
deeply from its proverbial trough the problem as it always seems to be with

920
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,300
these podcasts is that the slop in the trough isn't as pure as the piggies

921
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,920
seem to think welcome to the dark world of podcasts about lists I'm gearing up

922
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,160
just spray go to war yeah I mean I mean if we're just gonna pick this apart as

923
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,120
we go it's not fair to call the fans piggies I mean yeah if you're a tag you

924
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,640
attack us all you want but the second you come for the people who give me five dollars on patreon.com

925
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,440
Will you leave our disgusting fat fans alone? Yeah I'm gonna wild out on you.

926
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:37,200
But it continues despite claiming to oppose the views of the Grinch, podcast about list has on

927
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,640
multiple occasions provided a platform for his revolting and frankly dangerous system of beliefs.

928
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,160
The trio uploaded a Grinch-along to their Patreon spreading the Grinch's sick gospel to their premium

929
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,640
subscribers. They also constantly crack jokes about the plight of the Hoos in

930
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,360
modern Whoville and prominently feature the Grinch in multiple promotional

931
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,700
graphics. Even amidst claims that they align with the Hoos of Whoville, one

932
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,960
can't help but wonder whether the "list boys" are crypto Grinchists.

933
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,220
Even beyond the issue of the Grinch, you don't have to look much further than the

934
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,960
backgrounds of the hosts to deduce that the podcast might not be the wholesome

935
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,160
politically pure romp many consider it. This is where it starts to become kind of

936
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,760
a personal case. Okay, can we just stop right here? Yeah. Any sort of, I mean, I

937
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,160
feel like we've made it abundantly clear that any endorsement of the Grinch's

938
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,840
actions is completely ironic. Absolutely. We're doing it sort of to make fun of him.

939
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,480
Yeah, to highlight the stupidity of holding that position. How funny it is, how weird it would be, and how absurd it is to

940
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,720
actually be pro-Grinch. Exactly. I feel like we've made it clear, like with our

941
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,000
are, and that's what it was so annoying. People got, people came after us for,

942
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,040
because we made fun of when they did the, the hoove bombing.

943
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,520
Yeah.

944
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,000
The Philadelphia police department did the hoove bombing and they killed all

945
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,800
those hoos in Whoville. But it's not, that was,

946
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,400
we weren't making fun of the victims.

947
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,840
We were making fun of the Philadelphia police department.

948
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,320
Exactly. And you know, it's comedy that can take down people like that.

949
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,240
That's why it's so important.

950
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,480
Exactly, and that's why I think it's important for us to lampoon the grand...

951
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,040
Okay, have you... do you know Stephen Colbert?

952
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,640
I've heard of him, yeah.

953
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:26,160
Okay, so basically every night of the week, this guy does a brilliant impression of a mentally

954
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,560
disabled guy on TV.

955
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
Yeah.

956
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,480
On... it's called The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

957
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,600
And what he's doing is he's lampooning that kind of person.

958
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,360
He's not actually disabled.

959
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,080
He actually in real life knows how to tell a joke.

960
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
But he does this awesome character every night.

961
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Exactly.

962
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,740
Where he tells just the worst jokes, just over and over and over again to nobody.

963
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,080
And they mean nothing and they're about nothing.

964
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,160
But he's doing an impression of a terrible late night host with mental.

965
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,120
He's showing how ridiculous it would be to be a late night host who had that kind of

966
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,440
limitation in your brain.

967
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Exactly yeah.

968
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
So he's doing sort of an impression.

969
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,480
And how unjust that would be.

970
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,480
Exactly yeah.

971
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,960
He's, I don't know, it's called parody.

972
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
Look it up.

973
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,600
find a little, you know, a little song called "Bad" or called, sorry, "Fat" by Weird Al

974
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,520
Yankovic and you're gonna, you leave it to this guy to watch that and go, "Oh, okay, so

975
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,920
I guess Weird Al's fat?"

976
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
Geez.

977
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,320
Yeah, it's like just because you're not smart enough to understand the-

978
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,000
Weird Al isn't fat in real life.

979
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,840
He's also not Amish, okay?

980
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,600
He might be Amish.

981
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
He might be Amish.

982
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
But-

983
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,640
Yankovic sounds like an Amish last name to me.

984
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
He could be, yeah.

985
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Alright, continue.

986
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
Alright, continue.

987
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,840
Yeah, so this IMDpoopsucka starts out with talking about Patrick's background.

988
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,360
Patrick Doran, who constantly posts skateboard and Yoda content in order to draw attention

989
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:55,600
away from his extremely upper-class upbringing, is the heir to both the McDonald's and Taco

990
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,120
Bell fortunes.

991
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:03,400
That's right, his parents are none other than Ronald McDonald and Gidget the Taco Bell Chihuahua.

992
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,120
He's also recently become CEO of the video app Byte.

993
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,520
Is this your working class just like you online darling?

994
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,720
A billionaire rich kid who's a CEO and also half dog?

995
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,720
That's fair.

996
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
I think...

997
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
Yeah, no, that...

998
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,000
I would say I'm in no position to try to defend Patrick right now.

999
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,740
I think if there is...

1000
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,920
If anything in this article is true, it's definitely that.

1001
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,240
I will say he doesn't talk to his parents and they don't support him anymore because

1002
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,280
the podcast Patreon does plenty for him.

1003
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,480
He lives on about $150 a month.

1004
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,200
- Yeah, which is, I mean, fine.

1005
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,280
He just eats kibble.

1006
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,040
- Yeah, I mean, how many dogs live on more than $150 a month?

1007
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,320
- Not many. - Very few.

1008
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,600
- And he's only half dog, so he actually only needs $75.

1009
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,280
- Yeah. - That's how it works.

1010
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,760
And then they move on to you, Caleb.

1011
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,000
- Whoa. - Yeah.

1012
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,120
And speaking of ancestors-- - Can I pause you right here?

1013
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,440
- Yeah, yeah.

1014
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,280
- Is thisy gonna hurt my feelings?

1015
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,880
I mean, I don't know. Only you can control that. Think about that.

1016
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,080
All right.

1017
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
That's something Ricky Gervais once told me.

1018
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,080
Let me put on my helmet.

1019
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,480
Okay. And speaking of ancestry, let's talk Caleb Pitts.

1020
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,980
It's with Caleb that the corrupt and questionable dynamics of the podcast start to truly reveal themselves.

1021
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Based on pictures and videos posted to his Twitter feed,

1022
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,380
scientists have deduced that Caleb is some sort of Pokemon style pre-evolution to the human race,

1023
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,820
a missing link between monkey and man

1024
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,420
he is coerced into recording the podcast by patrick and cameron and research

1025
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,960
confirms he doesn't even receive compensation for his labor

1026
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,960
i have always just felt like you guys are doing such a great opportunity

1027
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,120
being the podcast yeah the intern

1028
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,620
you know being the only non-human

1029
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,800
pre-evolved

1030
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,620
yeah i i understand that i don't deserve

1031
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,500
any money you know what i mean because i'm subhuman yeah you know i don't want to say

1032
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,860
I don't want to say scum, but I'm not a guy.

1033
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,860
You're getting exposure.

1034
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:06,180
Yeah, and I actually didn't even know that I was a monkey or had monkey sort of stuff

1035
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,500
in me, monkey whatever.

1036
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,180
See, I can't even think of the word because of my monkey brain.

1037
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Monkey spunk.

1038
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,420
I didn't know I had monkey spunk in me.

1039
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,340
I didn't know I was half monkey spunk until you guys pointed it out by taking that photo

1040
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,500
of me.

1041
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,460
I always just thought I was a normal kid.

1042
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,340
And yeah, sometimes I like to climb trees.

1043
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,260
I like to eat bananas.

1044
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,740
times I'd like to fuck a frog to death, use it like a fleshlight in my backyard.

1045
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:36,380
But I always was just like, well, I'm just maybe, you know, a gifted kid.

1046
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,980
That's just how you express yourself.

1047
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,540
Yeah, you know, and that's what everybody told me.

1048
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,340
But so I really, really, I should be paying you guys.

1049
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,340
Absolutely.

1050
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,340
You know what?

1051
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,340
For teaching me who I really am.

1052
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,180
We should talk about that after the episode.

1053
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,180
Yeah, I'm willing to do whatever, you know.

1054
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,340
I don't have much, you know,

1055
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,140
'cause I don't get paid from this,

1056
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,300
or even my real job at Amazon Fulfillment,

1057
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,420
because they heard about that you guys aren't paying me,

1058
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,940
and they figured, you know,

1059
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,180
they said, "Well, it's only fair."

1060
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,020
Yeah, well, we told them.

1061
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,860
"If we also don't pay you."

1062
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,680
Not to.

1063
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,520
Oh, you guys told them?

1064
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,780
Oh, thanks, 'cause now it's like way,

1065
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,660
now I feel like I have a huge monkey off my back.

1066
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,260
It's simpler for you.

1067
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,620
I mean, it's easier, it's not way hard,

1068
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,140
it's hard to keep track of numbers

1069
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,240
and pieces of paper and--

1070
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,140
Exactly, yeah.

1071
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,100
Yeah, so yeah, that was all us.

1072
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,820
So you have us to thank for that.

1073
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,660
- Thank you, buddy.

1074
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,380
- Of course. - You can continue.

1075
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,020
- Now then they say some stuff about me.

1076
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,460
Deep research into Cameron's background

1077
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,340
revealed that he is actually normal

1078
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,140
and not at fault for anything mentioned in this article.

1079
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,940
Cameron is normal and honestly a pretty cool guy.

1080
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,740
Would love to talk to Cameron sometime

1081
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,820
and maybe even give him a weekly allowance,

1082
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,380
you know, some pocket money

1083
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,980
so he could buy snacks and video games.

1084
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,000
So this is where it starts making sense to me a little bit.

1085
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,160
I can understand where this guy is coming from

1086
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
towards the end of the article.

1087
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,880
It's just, you know, I think he,

1088
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,040
maybe he isn't as stupid as he seems at the start

1089
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,720
'cause I think he's making some pretty salient points

1090
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,480
about my background and how I'm normal.

1091
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,040
- Yeah, I mean, what'd you say the guy's name was again?

1092
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,560
- IMDPoopsucka.

1093
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,200
- Okay, could you link me this?

1094
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,040
- Yeah, sure.

1095
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,080
I'm gonna share it with some people.

1096
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,740
All right, I just sent it to you.

1097
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,240
Okay.

1098
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,520
Cool.

1099
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,100
What are you thinking?

1100
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,260
I mean it's--

1101
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,980
No, I mean it looks, you know,

1102
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,340
it looks real to me.

1103
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,580
Yeah, it's on, this is the Daily Gulag.

1104
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,620
Why would this not be real?

1105
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,640
No, no, I'm not saying it's not real.

1106
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,120
It's just interesting that they would go after

1107
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,560
me and Patrick so hard.

1108
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,200
They're going after me pretty hard.

1109
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,080
I mean, they didn't, they just said I'm normal.

1110
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,420
I mean, they could have said I was cool.

1111
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,260
Or they did say I was cool.

1112
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,600
They could have said I was really cool, very cool.

1113
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,920
- They could have said you were extraordinary.

1114
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,920
- So, yeah, they could have said

1115
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,360
I was an extraordinary young boy

1116
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,060
and I deserve everything in the world,

1117
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,480
but they just, I know, it's a weekly,

1118
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,720
it's not a daily allowance.

1119
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,620
I think they were pretty harsh on me.

1120
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,680
- Is that where they ended it?

1121
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,660
That's where they ended the piece?

1122
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,760
- Well, no, and then it says,

1123
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,200
"So next time you hear someone say

1124
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,160
"they love listening to podcasts about lists,

1125
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,480
"sock 'em one in their fat, juicy mouth.

1126
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,540
"They deserve it.

1127
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,540
"P.S. Cameron, if you're reading this, you're awesome."

1128
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,220
So I guess they did say I was awesome, too.

1129
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,780
But I mean, that's, it's probably sarcastic.

1130
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,380
Maybe it's sarcastic.

1131
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,440
That's what I'm starting to think.

1132
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,580
I'm starting to think maybe they listened to us

1133
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,460
be so sarcastic in our episodes of the podcast

1134
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,300
that they learned, we sort of taught them a lesson

1135
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,860
in using sarcasm as a tool.

1136
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,400
But I will say this, sarcasm,

1137
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,700
satire requires clarity of purpose.

1138
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,540
Yeah.

1139
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,340
I'm not sure what the clarity is.

1140
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,500
I mean, I sent a message to Mr. Kupchak.

1141
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,340
Oh, you did?

1142
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,160
You responded?

1143
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,000
Yeah, I sent a message.

1144
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,840
What'd you say?

1145
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,260
I said, "I would love a weekly allowance,"

1146
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,880
and he sent me $1,000.

1147
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,060
Which I'm assuming it's ironic, so.

1148
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,100
He sent you $1,000?

1149
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,140
Yeah, it's probably a joke.

1150
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,340
'Cause I feel like if he--

1151
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,480
And then he also, he posted a picture,

1152
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,660
he attached a picture to the email

1153
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,620
that was printed out pictures of you and Patrick

1154
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,460
hanging on the wall.

1155
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,500
Okay, so far I like it.

1156
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,400
bullet holes

1157
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,140
in the in the four-inch shooting he's

1158
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,500
he's shooting this the pictures of us

1159
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,820
yeah i mean it's it's a it's a hippies after all i mean it makes sense to be

1160
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,900
rude right now

1161
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,040
that's you know it's probably also satire

1162
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,360
now i think you know i think you really doesn't like you doesn't like us

1163
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,020
no or

1164
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,460
well he can i think he does any might actually like you now i think about it

1165
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,620
i mean i think he was pretty harsh on me is on saying

1166
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,340
he just said you were normal

1167
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,800
- Yeah, but he could have said I was like the best guy ever

1168
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,640
and he didn't.

1169
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,460
- He said I was the missing link.

1170
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,240
- I mean, look at me, right?

1171
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,520
If you look at me and you say I'm normal,

1172
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,360
that's an insult.

1173
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,260
- He could have called you a monkey.

1174
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,760
- No, 'cause I'm not a monkey.

1175
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,140
- Sorry, I kind of forget sometimes

1176
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,600
other people aren't monkeys.

1177
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,120
You know, I forget to check.

1178
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,320
- No, I understand.

1179
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,160
It's okay.

1180
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,540
Yeah, it's my bad.

1181
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,880
But yeah, so I'm actually flying him out

1182
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,600
to the podcast about this.

1183
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,960
You're flying out IMD Poop Sucka?

1184
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,120
Yeah, just to hang out.

1185
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,840
But he's gonna, he'll like kill me.

1186
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,040
I mean, I'm sure it was,

1187
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,880
we'll figure it out when he gets here.

1188
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,240
You just wanna play it by ear?

1189
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,120
Yeah, we'll play it by ear.

1190
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,160
That's a perfect phrase, thank you.

1191
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,880
That's exactly what I was looking for.

1192
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,200
Yeah.

1193
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,120
So, I mean, I'm a little worried.

1194
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,320
for why? If I'm being honest, because he sent you a picture of me with a gun hole, bullet.

1195
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,640
Okay, maybe it wasn't, maybe he was, maybe it was kiss marks and he just has a weird mouth.

1196
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,520
He has bullets for lips? He has bullets for lips. Okay, did you think of that? He has a very sharp mouth?

1197
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,160
He has a very sharp small mouth. I mean he does say at the end of the piece,

1198
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,760
"Sock him one in their fat juicy mouth." Maybe to every, him, everyone

1199
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,640
looks like they have juicy mouths because his mouth is... He's gonna sock me! He has a little

1200
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,880
bullet beak. He's gonna fight me, dude. I mean you can just fight him back, it's not

1201
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:12,840
a big deal. Oh, I could use Monkey Fu. You could use a banana boomerang. That's true.

1202
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:19,160
I could use the Donkey Kong boxing glove from Super Mario Baseball.

1203
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:27,040
Yeah. Yeah, and I could hit him. You could wind up like Donkey Kong. I could wind him up, I could hold it to a super charge and then hit him with it.

1204
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,720
Or I could do a banana blast. I could climb him. You could jet pack like Diddy Kong.

1205
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,160
I'm gonna climb up his pant leg and hit his balls like a speed bag.

1206
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Yeah.

1207
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,520
Hey, don't mess with the monkey.

1208
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,520
That's what I'll say.

1209
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,520
That's a good catchphrase.

1210
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,520
Is it?

1211
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,520
Don't mess with the monkey.

1212
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
That's pretty good.

1213
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,520
I've been working on my catchphrase for after fights.

1214
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Yeah.

1215
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,920
Last time I got in a fight, my catchphrase was, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize that was

1216
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,920
a girl."

1217
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,920
Yeah.

1218
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,920
Yeah.

1219
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Nobody liked that catchphrase.

1220
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,280
Nobody liked that catchphrase.

1221
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,520
It didn't work.

1222
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,360
Yeah.

1223
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,800
I think it was just the way you said it.

1224
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,620
I'm sure it didn't work.

1225
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,960
I did do an Indian accent.

1226
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,680
I did an Apu accent.

1227
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,640
'Cause I was like, well, I need them on my side.

1228
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,360
So, you know, who's the most,

1229
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,420
I thought who's the most loved cartoon character

1230
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,240
in the world right now?

1231
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,680
Apu from the Simpsons.

1232
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,420
So I did an Apu voice.

1233
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,520
I don't think they liked it very much though.

1234
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,360
Yeah.

1235
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,920
You should have done the crows from Dumbo.

1236
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
That would have been a good idea.

1237
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,120
That would have gone over well.

1238
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,480
Yeah, or the guy from Song of the South again.

1239
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,400
I should have done Zippity-Doo-Dah.

1240
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,240
Yeah.

1241
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,720
My grandma showed me that.

1242
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:48,360
Disney, they've released that movie so many times.

1243
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,080
Yeah, every year.

1244
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,280
Yeah, until like the '70s,

1245
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,000
they basically released Song of the South

1246
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
every five years with like a theater release

1247
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,760
because people loved it so much.

1248
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,160
And then in the '70s at some point,

1249
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,920
They were like, we're just gonna do that song.

1250
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,560
And so they started clipping,

1251
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,680
they stopped releasing the full movie,

1252
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,380
like the theatrical release.

1253
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,880
And they put it, they just put that song on like these tapes

1254
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,200
that were like, like the best of Disney, whatever.

1255
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,200
And so when I was a kid, I watched that,

1256
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
I had like one of those tapes and I'd watch it all the time

1257
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,260
and I'd watch Zippity-Doodah.

1258
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:30,020
And then when I got older, people told me like,

1259
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,780
yeah, that movie is like racist or whatever.

1260
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,780
And I didn't realize it was a full movie

1261
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,340
about like him being like a slave.

1262
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,580
I was like, why, it's just a song where he like sings

1263
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,580
to birds, what's racist about that?

1264
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,540
He's just sing zippity do da, it's awesome.

1265
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,780
(laughing)

1266
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,100
- Yeah, what are you guys talking about?

1267
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,460
It's wonderful.

1268
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,300
- Yeah.

1269
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,140
- It's beautiful.

1270
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:00,940
Alright, fine. You're right, that's racist. I'll watch the toy. I'll just watch the toy instead.

1271
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:09,580
We should write a hit piece back. Yeah, we'll do it, baby. Next episode we're gonna have the

1272
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:18,380
hit piece back and then we're gonna have Patrick responding to the rap battle. Patrick couldn't,

1273
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,780
not in a million years could he write a bar. Well, actually, next episode is gonna be big.

1274
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,020
number 100. Oh yeah this is the last one before the 100. We got something very

1275
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:32,180
secret and special in store for you sick serpents. It's 10 hours long and it's called the

1276
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:38,060
Patrick story played on a skateboard. Yep you have to play it on a skateboard.

1277
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,300
Well no it's like he played on a skateboard that's like the subtitle.

1278
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:46,380
Oh it's yeah it's 10 hours of Patrick falling over at the skate park and all

1279
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,060
the kids getting around and laughing at him and pointing. Yeah and it's it's

1280
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:55,060
actually 20 hours long it's slowed down. We thought it wasn't long enough so we

1281
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:00,260
slowed it down to half speed. We said 100th episode we got to go all out.

1282
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,980
So it actually it is a 15 or 20 hour episode depending on how fast

1283
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,300
you listen to it. Yeah. Also depending on what choices you make. Could be a

1284
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,660
one-second episode. Because it's also a choose your own adventure. Yeah. There's a choice at the

1285
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,780
beginning that says do you want to listen to the episode. And you can say if

1286
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,820
If you say no, it's a skip to the end,

1287
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,020
and then it's like a five second episode.

1288
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,100
- If you say no, it plays a fart sound in your ear

1289
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,940
for 10 hours.

1290
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,820
- We should do a choose your own adventure episode.

1291
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,060
- We should, we should figure out how to do that,

1292
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,900
and then do it.

1293
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,220
- All right, let's do it.

1294
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,060
- Yeah.

1295
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,900
- You'd have to do like different time stamps.

1296
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,700
- It's like a video game.

1297
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,820
- Let's just, oh my God, let's just build a house.

1298
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,900
(laughing)

1299
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,860
- Let's have a baby.

1300
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:45,600
- Yeah, let's all have a baby together.

1301
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:52,540
Yeah, we'll all take turns getting your mom pregnant and we won't know whose kid it is.

1302
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,840
But then when it pops out, we'll all share him.

1303
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Yeah.

1304
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
And it will be a him.

1305
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
Yep.

1306
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,040
And we'll raise him to be the human podcast.

1307
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:06,420
Yeah, because if it's not, my apartment is technically a, and it's been annexed by China

1308
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,120
and so we follow the one, the two child policy in my apartment.

1309
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,160
So if it is a girl, it's going in the trash can.

1310
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
Yep.

1311
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,160
Yeah.

1312
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,440
I'm just putting it in the cabinet under the sink and ignoring it.

1313
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,380
Yeah

1314
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:24,480
Until it grows to be a beast from a Goosebumps book. A hairy stinky beast.

1315
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,660
That's not how Patrick was born. It's not neglect if you turn your baby into an awesome beast. Yeah, Patrick was born

1316
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:34,120
directly into a fridge.

1317
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:40,680
He was birthed, they did a home birth and they didn't have a tub so she sat in the fridge and then they just forgot him there.

1318
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah

1319
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,400
Yeah

1320
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,320
They do you're listening of mayonnaise

1321
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,360
Yeah

1322
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,300
All right. Well, I have to shit really badly. Yeah

1323
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:57,400
Another successful one without Patrick. Why don't I even have him on it makes no sense. Yeah

1324
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:03,520
Whatever. Fuck him. Bye. I'll see you after the hundredth episode. Yes. See you on the other freakin side

1325
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,560
Yeah, cuz it's gonna chip. He's gonna blow your mind change your world and a new era will begin one million days a nightfall

1326
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,480
Demons will walk the earth.

1327
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,480
Yeah, and Patrick will, uh...

1328
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,480
Not walk the earth anymore.

1329
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,480
Yeah, Patrick will be in one of those fat guy scooters at Walmart.

1330
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,480
May God have mercy on his soul.

1331
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,480
That's right. Bye.

1332
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,320
Bye.
