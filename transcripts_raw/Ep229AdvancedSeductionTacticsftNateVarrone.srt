1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,540
Yo, if you're a young man right now and you're alone and you're single and you're trying

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,080
to hook up and you're trying to date, you know what I'm saying?

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
What I want you to do is you don't need to be mean.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
You don't need to be, you know, aggressive, aggro and alpha.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,040
You just need to be yourself.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,700
Okay?

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,760
And you need to be you.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,540
And I don't care if women hate you.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,980
They don't like you.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,020
they think you suck, they think you're weird, they think you're a fucking loser and they're

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,620
saying that to your face constantly.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,200
You just need to just be you, even if that person is a bad person or you suck, you just

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,140
have to keep going with it until you find somebody who kind of accepts you and that might take

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,420
a long time, an extremely long time for you to find somebody who can kind of put up with

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,460
that bullshit, but you're gonna get it eventually.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,460
and yeah.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:15,460
That's how it's done.

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,460
This is what real podcasters do.

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,460
This is a real podcast.

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Take notes.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,220
- Hey, y'all ain't playing around here, are you?

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,060
- See this?

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,020
That's what it's recording to.

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,860
- It's recording straight to that.

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,340
- Oh, yo. - See how it's spinning?

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,780
- Old school style.

27
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,860
- Yeah, we do it analog.

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,220
We're more into, have you ever bought--

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,560
- It's for the warmth. - Maybe the LP?

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,180
Like a big, it's like the big disc.

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,300
That's the kind of thing we're into.

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,500
- Yeah, VHS.

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,540
- We're into all that kind of shit.

34
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,420
- Yeah. - Cassettes.

35
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,260
- Yeah, we do all that.

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,300
- SNES. - Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,540
- Retro vibe. - Retro.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,620
- On the Super Nintendo.

39
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,140
- What is it like, you're so new to the podcasting game.

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,100
How do you like the lifestyle so far?

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,680
- There is, you know how there is a BC and an AD in time?

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,640
- Yes. - Uh-huh.

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,440
- Before, geez, I feel like my life before a podcast,

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,500
before becoming a podcaster, and after it,

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,260
I'm seeing things in a different way.

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,140
- It's completely different.

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,820
- I'm seeking out new experiences just so I can

48
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,340
talk about it and give the public some new information

49
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,540
about my observation.

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,100
It controls my entire life. - You gotta go get a story.

51
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,940
You have to go, yeah.

52
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,300
You need material, you need stories.

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,380
So I'm going out into the world and I'm fucking with people

54
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,000
and shaking people on the street

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,020
just so I can have some crazy ass story.

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,900
- Some guy punched me in the face for no reason.

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,100
- It is kind of ruining my fucking life right now.

58
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,940
- I can imagine.

59
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,820
I think we all went through that when we first started.

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,140
But then at some point you kind of forget,

61
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,420
like you forget the BC.

62
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,980
- Oh, you don't need any stories at all.

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,820
- Yeah.

64
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,260
- You can just sit here and say nothing for an hour.

65
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,980
- You can do like first five minutes of the show,

66
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
just fart sounds.

67
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,780
You're kind of like, I was thinking about how you are,

68
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,260
'cause you live on the West Coast, right?

69
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,860
Yes, I'm West Coast vibes.

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,180
But you're part of an East Coast collective,

71
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,460
an East Coast podcast.

72
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,300
It's true. So you're kind of

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,180
a Tupac kind of coast trader.

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,020
(laughing)

75
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,740
You know, like you're from the West,

76
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,140
but you now are like with straight up

77
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,740
the East Coast death row.

78
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,020
By the way, speaking of Tupac and Biggie,

79
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,540
I think that we need to have a kind of beef and a war.

80
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,380
A beef?

81
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,220
That's why I brought you guys up.

82
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,040
Yeah, okay.

83
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,080
Joy Tactics, the podcast I do with Jack Benzinger and Eric Rahill and Potabot

84
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,520
List. I think it needs to get violent. I think we need to get into the boxing ring.

85
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,200
One of us is gonna die. I'd be down. For sure. Do y'all think, be honest, be

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:42,360
honest. You. No, no, no, okay. We are in kind of like a fenced-in cage, okay?

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,920
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay, just a cage. And it's three on three, joy tactics vs.

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,360
potlicks, bare knuckles. We're all in, you know, kind of sexy outfits as

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,560
well, just for no reason, just for the viewership. Yeah, okay. Is it being like, is

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,000
it televised? It is. That does add an element. Worldwide. It's put on by feedback. How hard you're gonna fight.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,440
Yeah, it's three billion people watching. Who is gonna win in this ass-whipping

92
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,340
competition. Which podcast has more fighting abilities? Well you and Jack are

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,520
like gigantic. You are hugely tall. We have that. We have one guy but he also happens to be the

94
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,080
biggest wimp on our podcast. Not true. You can't call me the biggest wimp.

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,720
No no no. This guy is so much more of a wimp than me. He's a scared of sounds.

96
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,280
Do you see what he just tried to do? That's a wimp. That's not a wimp move.

97
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
He's scared of sounds.

98
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
He's scared of sounds.

99
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
No I'm not.

100
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Hmm.

101
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Don't test it.

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Meanwhile, I'm over here.

103
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Yeah, I'm not a wimp.

104
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
That's all I gotta say.

105
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,560
We would beat the fucking shit out of you.

106
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,080
It would be like a two minute rant.

107
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
We would disappoint people.

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,200
If it wasn't, you would beat us up physically, but we would get you mentally.

109
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,960
We would talk mad shit and throw you guys out.

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
We would leave you hungy-tied.

111
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,600
You may beat us up, but then after you leave that fight, you're gonna be like thinking like,

112
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
is my hand too small?

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
[laughter]

114
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
is my hands way too small?

115
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
you know what I'm gonna do too is I'm gonna look where the cameras are

116
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
that are televising this, I'm gonna put my back to the camera

117
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
so nobody can see what I'm doing and I have a

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
blade.

119
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm gonna slit your throat.

120
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
really? that's against the rules.

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
but nobody can see it so did it even happen?

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
and then I'll turn around and be like I did that with my fingernails.

123
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
that's why we'll have a referee.

124
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
who's the referee gonna be?

125
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
there's literally nobody in the world who's unbiased in this fight.

126
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,600
It's not possible to find someone who's not already leaning towards one of us.

127
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
It's like the OJ trial. How do you pick a jury for that?

128
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Maybe, I guess maybe Cato Kaelin could be the ref.

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Who?

130
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Cato Kaelin. The guy that was just like in their backyard or some shit.

131
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
What are you talking about?

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
The guy from the OJ trial.

133
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, the guy from OJ.

134
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
He's only known for the OJ trial.

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
He probably doesn't want to be involved in any more stuff like that though.

136
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
That's true.

137
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
This is going to be bigger than the OJ trial.

138
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
- One nation dividing debacle.

139
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,680
He can't do another one, dude.

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
He can't handle that.

141
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,340
- Our headphone cords are tangled.

142
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,440
- That means we're in love.

143
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,280
Speaking of love, dude, Valentine's Day.

144
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,800
- Valentine's Day is when this episode comes out.

145
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
- No, it doesn't.

146
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,480
- No, Valentine's Day was yesterday.

147
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,760
- Somebody's gonna get in trouble this year.

148
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,600
- Gulp!

149
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
- You're basically in trouble.

150
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,360
- Oh no.

151
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,440
- But, and we had you on because we love you.

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,280
- Wow, really?

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,520
- Because we love you so much.

154
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,400
- And you were wearing red.

155
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,720
- I know, I kinda am.

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,520
- I do have that V-day.

157
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,280
Yeah, they saw me on the street and they were like,

158
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,320
"Yo, you wanna come on the pod?

159
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,520
"You're wearing red."

160
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,680
(laughing)

161
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,080
I don't know, I was like, "Fuck it,

162
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,180
"I like podcasting so much, and I like you guys.

163
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,280
"I'll come chill."

164
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,120
Yeah.

165
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
- You've advanced to, I would say,

166
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,760
a high level of podcasting pretty fast.

167
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,560
It's like you had your 10,000 hours already banked,

168
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,860
and then you just come out on the scene,

169
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,760
you're already destroying and abolishing.

170
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,840
- We kinda went from zero to the elite level

171
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
podcasters immediately.

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
- Pretty much immediately.

173
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,040
- And it's like, kind of like, you know how,

174
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,360
I don't know, someone, Britney Spears or Justin Timberlake,

175
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
they're all of a sudden famous.

176
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
- Yeah, yeah.

177
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
- They're on the red-- - They're on the red--

178
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,080
- Yeah, they're on the damn red carpet

179
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,040
and the lights are flashing and everybody at the paparazzi,

180
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,680
hey, come over here, come here, take a picture.

181
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,600
It's kinda like, you don't even have time to process it,

182
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,100
being an elite level, elite God tier podcaster.

183
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,120
- Do you think that maybe that is just podcasting

184
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,780
or that kind of anything that you do,

185
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,520
you could be at the top S tier highest level of doing it?

186
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,920
Like maybe if you got into exploring,

187
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,000
maybe you could explore, you could find a new continent.

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,180
- They say 10,000 hours,

189
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,400
but I feel like there's some people,

190
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,200
like you probably included, where it's like it's one hour.

191
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,640
- Basically one hour.

192
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,040
- Some people are one hour people,

193
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,560
where they do one hour of something in their approach.

194
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,360
- That's way more impressive than 10,000 hours too.

195
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
- Yeah, 'cause it's fast.

196
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
- Yeah.

197
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
- That's a really good point.

198
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,160
- 10,000 hours, show me somebody that can do it in one.

199
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
- Yeah.

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,720
- Then I'll be like, all right, okay.

201
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,560
- That's like--

202
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,160
- What's that guy's name, Malcolm Gladwell?

203
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,000
- Yeah.

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,820
- The guy who came up with that?

205
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,660
- Yeah.

206
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,680
- Fucking dumbass, 'cause you should have said one hour.

207
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,960
Should have talked about cool guys doing stuff in one hour.

208
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,760
- Giannis Attitukuompo, you guys know that basketball player?

209
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,880
He had never played basketball before

210
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,780
and then he was like 18 years old and somebody was like,

211
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,020
I don't know if this is exactly how it happened,

212
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,860
but I imagine somebody--

213
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,060
(laughing)

214
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,540
- This cannot be how it happened.

215
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,420
- But I imagine somebody was walking down the street

216
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,520
and saw him and was like, oh fuck, you're huge,

217
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
and tried to--

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,460
- Just tossed him a basketball.

219
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,260
- Yeah, and he like palmed it immediately.

220
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,100
- Whoa.

221
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,940
- And he dunked it into--

222
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,100
- Dunked from the curb all the way.

223
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,380
- Yeah, he dunked it over a telephone line.

224
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,060
- All the way to the court that was like two blocks away.

225
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,900
- Yeah, and also--

226
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,720
- One jump.

227
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
- Wow.

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,040
he but in like two years he became an NBA player he had never played basketball

229
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,240
before he was a soccer player oh so he already knew about how to do sports I

230
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,160
mean you know that's not that impressed he understands he knew he knew rules and

231
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,760
also I'm not playing I don't know that he had never heard of basketball I think

232
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,640
he was just like what is this shit it's like it was a miracle and so you're kind

233
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,200
of like the Giannis Antetokounmpo of podcasting at this point I that's what

234
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,480
people are saying yeah yeah yeah you're both the Tupac and oh back to the Tupac

235
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:25,720
I think that two things about Tupac I found out today that Tupac was gay I

236
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,840
found out I googled it yes but then second that must have been someone from

237
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,640
the East Coast though

238
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,440
You gotta use unbiased. You have to go on a VPN and say it to West Coast Google. I did

239
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,360
I

240
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,680
Think that we need to start an East Coast West Coast podcasting war beef in the same kind of fashion

241
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,480
Absolutely. I think we need to be jumping up on stage doing this podcast awards and fuck you Bert Kreischer

242
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,080
Fucked your bitch you fat motherfucker. Yeah

243
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,100
I would do yeah I would interrupt the him when he's accepting the award I would be

244
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,100
like hey listen Burt I'm not gonna let you finish yeah about list yeah that's

245
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,200
podcast of all time yeah two bears one cave we're gonna send you back to the

246
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,000
cave drop a nuclear bomb on Los Angeles and send you back to the Stone Age yep

247
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,360
right Brendan Shaw but we're gonna you know what you've done enough to yourself

248
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,760
we're fine. Yeah, he doesn't need it. Ari Shafir, smack the fuck in the face.

249
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,480
Fuck you, Ari Shafir. Honestly, we should shoot Tim Dillon in the head.

250
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,920
Yeah, yeah. Drive by, shoot him, and kill him. He'd be okay with that. I feel like he would like to die.

251
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,760
One of the only safe ways to dispose of Tim Dillon would be to

252
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,760
launch them into space. Otherwise, his body's gonna cause trouble. He's gonna leak into

253
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:06,560
the water supply. Like Chernobyl elephant foot, just fucking like there's some cave somewhere

254
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,960
in Los Angeles that you can't go in. And like 500 years aliens come to the earth and they

255
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,960
have a religion that they built around Tim Dillon's body and they found him floating

256
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,400
in space. Yeah, see this is what we need, man. We need to fucking destroy these people. Yeah.

257
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,680
We need to fucking wipe the West Coast, I mean except for some.

258
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,560
Well he's honorary East Coast.

259
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,800
Yeah, if we take it out right now, we finally use this.

260
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah, we use that big red button.

261
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Let's do it tomorrow.

262
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah, I'm a little, you know.

263
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
I'm kind of lazy.

264
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
I have heartburn right now.

265
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
So we should figure that out first.

266
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
That'll stop you from doing anything.

267
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Yeah, true.

268
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
It's the worst thing to get.

269
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Man, it sucks.

270
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Probably, I think we need to spread awareness about it.

271
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah, I think we need to spread awareness about it.

272
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Yeah, I think we need to spread awareness about it.

273
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Yeah, I think we need to spread awareness about it.

274
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Yeah, I think we need to spread awareness about it.

275
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Yeah, I think we need to spread awareness about it.

276
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,080
awareness about it through the show. About heartburn? About heartburn. I think we need to spread

277
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,760
awareness about hearts. True. I think heartburn... That's the best idea you've come up with

278
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,440
all day. Heartburn is... Look at how beautiful that is. Can we get a punch in on that?

279
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,760
That is really amazing. You're doing a really really amazing job. Yeah, that's a

280
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:16,360
punch in on Nate's face. Oh shit, I kind of look sexy. Damn, I didn't see me on the monitor. You kind of do, man.

281
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,760
- Oh my God, with the headphones?

282
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,840
- With the bald swag.

283
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,400
And shout out to Potabot Liz

284
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,320
getting the bald representation.

285
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,900
- You already know, I wear a hat most of the time,

286
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
but yes, I do have no hair on my head.

287
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,880
And he's on his way.

288
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
- And Jubio's--

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,540
- Are you on the way out?

290
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,640
Be honest, are you on the motherfucking pills or what?

291
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,320
- No, I'm letting it happen.

292
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,960
- I think me and Caleb are the two last bald men in America.

293
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Everybody is taking these psycho pills

294
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,680
that are making them crazy.

295
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,640
You can't nut on them, and then--

296
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,320
- You can nut on them, but they don't taste that good.

297
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,980
- Oh shit, oh my god.

298
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,640
- Oh shit, oh my god.

299
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
- Damn.

300
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
- Yeah.

301
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,140
- I didn't hear it.

302
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,980
- Wow.

303
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,040
- You didn't got him.

304
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,760
I'd like to see Theo Vaughn do that.

305
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,600
- Yeah, that's right.

306
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,600
- Theo gone.

308
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,680
- Yeah, that's right, 'cause we're gonna fucking obliterate

309
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,520
him and just wipe his smudge.

310
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,880
- I did not hear what you said.

311
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,080
- I said I'm gonna come do a cum shot on my own medicine.

312
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
- Oh, okay.

313
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,120
- Oh, all right.

314
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,600
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,280
But yeah, they make you crazy.

316
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,360
I took them and I started just like freaking out

317
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,760
all the time and like crying.

318
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,320
- Yeah, you were, it was like your evil birth.

319
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,400
- And then my hair fell out even more.

320
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,680
- Yeah, you probably took something else.

321
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,920
- I did do minoxidil for a little bit,

322
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,880
the flammable liquid.

323
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,840
- That one's scary 'cause they don't know how it works.

324
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
- Yeah.

325
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,520
- The stuff that like Rogaine,

326
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,920
they have no idea why that makes your hair grow back.

327
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,760
- Yeah.

328
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,640
- They have no idea.

329
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,420
- I feel like I am like the, you know how like in Zion,

330
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,920
there's like the humans that have what,

331
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,200
they don't have the ports in them?

332
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,040
- Yeah.

333
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,760
- I'm like that, but like for bald people,

334
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,120
like I've never put any type of medicine.

335
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,960
- You're a genius.

336
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,800
- Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

337
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,160
When did it start going? You're not gonna believe this but I started balding when I

338
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,360
was 11 years old. I swear to fucking God. You're right, I don't believe you. I know I swear.

339
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,720
I have a similar, there are photos of me at 8, 9 years old where I have a fucked up

340
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,960
hairline. Oh yeah, there's photos of me at like 15. I'm saying I would like buzz cut my head,

341
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,240
get like a number two buzz, and everybody, and it would look like I was like a like 42 year old

342
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,280
old man. And I think I had like, I looked it up online, I think I had like too much

343
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,480
testosterone. That's what it is. That's apparent. Yeah. So all throughout from

344
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,880
from the second I hit puberty, like those hormones were going, you were going, it

345
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,540
was a slow like 15 year trickle to being completely bald. At what age did you just

346
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,840
buzz that thing? I went like, I went in crazy waves because I have, oh fuck I

347
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,520
I should show you my passport. I have it in my bag, but it looks like insane.

348
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,880
I used to grow out my hair super, super fucking long,

349
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,840
like almost Gallagher style and have this huge fucking mustache.

350
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,360
That's what I'm going to do. That's my plan for this.

351
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,760
I'm going to get the sides real long. I'll start shaving the top early.

352
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,240
So when it does happen, everyone's just like, it's already there.

353
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,400
That is pretty smart actually. But you had a big Gallagher look?

354
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,940
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I wanted to,

355
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,980
you know how like when, it was almost like

356
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,520
if I'm on like Jay Leno or Jimmy Fallon

357
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,180
or something like that, and you know how they'll

358
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,100
pull up like a pic of you in high school or something?

359
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,480
Look how crazy I used to look.

360
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,080
I wanted to just have a couple years

361
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,440
where I was looking crazy and I could show people like,

362
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,760
yo, I used to look like that.

363
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,960
- Yeah, and then you can lie.

364
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,780
You can say like, I was a drug dealer.

365
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,460
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

366
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,920
- I looked like I was selling,

367
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,520
I was like a Coke dealer from Lebanon.

368
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,360
- That's amazing.

369
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,180
(laughing)

370
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,020
- Yeah.

371
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,860
- That's amazing.

372
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,680
- Wow.

373
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,520
- Mm-hmm.

374
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,860
- I just went, I just one day shaved my head,

375
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,440
but it was pretty, I kept, I held on a little too long,

376
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,280
I think.

377
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,000
- Do you know that Larry David doesn't consider you

378
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,100
a part of the bald community, if you shave the head?

379
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,940
- Oh really?

380
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,160
- He's like, you're like, you're not one of us.

381
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,560
- Is that your goat?

382
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
- I actually do love L.D.

383
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,440
- Is that your like, that's, you think he's the,

384
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,960
kind of the imam, he's who we look to?

385
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,080
He's the adept.

386
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,560
He's definitely one of them.

387
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Yeah.

388
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
I think he's like obviously the bald.

389
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Who are the pillars?

390
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,280
He's definitely, I don't know, who's the top bald goats?

391
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,400
The top bald goat, honestly I feel like you have to give it, even though he's fighting

392
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,520
it, LeBron is a bald goat.

393
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Oh yeah, absolutely.

394
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,600
LeBron is a bald goat, kind of on the opposite spectrum.

395
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,600
And it's just weird that all the people we're mentioning are the top people in their field.

396
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,240
Isn't that weird?

397
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,360
Isn't that strange and weird that bald kings are taking over every single thing that they

398
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
touch?

399
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,800
- We're talking Jeff Bezos.

400
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,640
- Yeah.

401
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,480
- Walter White.

402
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,520
- I never even thought about that.

403
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,840
- Yeah, Walter White, yes.

404
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,680
- Joe Rogan.

405
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,520
- Joe Rogan.

406
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,340
- Joe Rogan.

407
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,120
- Donald Trump counts 'cause he was bald,

408
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,320
but he grew, I mean, like he was born bald.

409
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,920
- He was born bald, you know what I'm saying?

410
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,680
He's 100, and he has the highest office in the land.

411
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,500
- Wow. - True.

412
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,340
- Yeah.

413
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,360
- It's just, there's something there, I don't know.

414
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,600
- There's probably some boxers

415
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
that didn't have any hair on their head.

416
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,180
- Yeah, probably. - Mike Tyson.

417
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,100
- Mike Tyson, now he's bald at least.

418
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,220
- Yeah.

419
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,960
My dad is not bald, which means he's not very good at construction.

420
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
My grandpa?

421
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
That makes perfect sense.

422
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
He's good at aikido.

423
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Oh shit.

424
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Is that this one?

425
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
He's a black belt.

426
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Yeah.

427
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Where you flip people?

428
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I think that's with weapons too, right?

429
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Don't you guys know weapons?

430
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
It might be.

431
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
You do it against weapons.

432
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
He lived in my parents' house.

433
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,140
My friend was obsessed with aikido in elementary school.

434
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,580
He had these meditation balls that he left.

435
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,140
They're like these silver things and you ring them.

436
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,460
And you sit there while they're ringing and you meditate.

437
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
Oh wow.

438
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
He's weird as shit.

439
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,640
- My grandpa, he's a weird, balding guy.

440
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,480
He's not that cool.

441
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,940
He doesn't know my, he thought my name was Crispin.

442
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,140
He didn't know who I was. - Your grandpa?

443
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,980
- Yeah.

444
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,720
- You thought your grandpa thought your name was Crispin?

445
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,280
- My name was Crispin.

446
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,660
When I was 21 years old.

447
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,500
- Wow.

448
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,540
- He was living with my family,

449
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
and I would go and visit for holidays.

450
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,300
- Your immediate thought was like,

451
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,420
oh, this guy's an asshole,

452
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,940
and not, oh, my grandpa has Parkinson's.

453
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,180
- No, he's full, he's completely there.

454
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,900
- Except, yeah, he totally sounds like he is.

455
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,500
- He just does not give a shit.

456
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,020
He doesn't care at all.

457
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,540
- I think that he definitely has dementia then.

458
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,380
- No.

459
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,200
- I hate to break this to you.

460
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,220
- No, 'cause he ran away.

461
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,060
- Yeah, I might.

462
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,220
(laughing)

463
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
No, he knows what he's doing, he ran away.

464
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,420
Now we don't know where he is.

465
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,380
- Yeah, he has dementia.

466
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,580
- Yeah. - No.

467
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,860
- He's completely fine.

468
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,500
- I think that bald men also, I could be making this up,

469
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,340
I think that we have some kind of like,

470
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,100
I think we live longer than haired men.

471
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Oh, absolutely. I feel like, you know, with this new tech coming out of like,

472
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,060
um, you know, extending our lives, we are going to be,

473
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,660
there's going to be a group of bald men that are getting to 360 years old.

474
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,860
I think we might be some of those in the first kind of group. Yeah.

475
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,660
I also think that people say all the time, they're, I'm like, Oh,

476
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,780
I don't want to get a hair transplant or whatever. But somebody will say like,

477
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,060
well, what if they made it so easy that it's like one day and it's just like

478
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,500
instant or like you take one pill and grow back. It's like,

479
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,420
That to me is the same question as somebody being like,

480
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,900
if you could upload your brain to a computer, would you do it?

481
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,100
It's like, I would lose myself entirely in the process.

482
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,340
I would fear that I'd be a different person

483
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,100
if I had a giant afro rainbow.

484
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,780
And what about the situation where it doesn't stop?

485
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,460
Yeah, that would be the worst part

486
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,700
about the first couple trials of that shit,

487
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,100
where you're taking the pills that grow your hair back

488
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,500
and shit, but it only grows back in rainbow--

489
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,020
- Well I would do-- - Or like it grows it back

490
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,220
at a completely new length that you've never tried.

491
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,740
- I would either not do the surgery

492
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,340
or I would get surgery all over my body to be Bigfoot.

493
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,380
And those are the only two versions of it

494
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,420
that I think that I could possibly do.

495
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,780
'Cause I don't wanna go and get the robot--

496
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,420
- If I got the hair transplants,

497
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,260
I'd also get the synthol in my arms

498
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,220
to make it look like I'm super buff.

499
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,980
- Also they take the hair from like your asshole and shit.

500
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,140
And like, I don't wanna-- - Aw, what the hell?

501
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,900
- Trust me, I got enough. - Is that true?

502
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,460
Do you have to pick where they take the hair from?

503
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,460
I don't think so.

504
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,420
I think that they have to-- well, because if you do multiple--

505
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,980
you've tried it.

506
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,980
If you do multiple places, then you

507
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,420
have a part of your hair that looks like pubes,

508
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,900
and then a part of your hair that's normal hair.

509
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,100
It looks like a cornfield from above.

510
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,020
All the different crops and different squares.

511
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,740
That could look awesome.

512
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,940
If you're a musician, I feel like that would help you out,

513
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,180
just in terms of looking kind of--

514
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,980
Yeah, pube mohawk.

515
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
Yeah, yeah, like have different kind of patches.

516
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,380
That would be--

517
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,940
Pube hair.

518
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,420
You're right.

519
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,780
You kind of look like a quilt.

520
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,340
Yeah.

521
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,180
- That'd be cool.

522
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,660
- You know, I mean, not to get topical,

523
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,720
but I'm thinking now, you know,

524
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,540
who else is bald is aliens.

525
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,380
- Oh, that's right. - And they're the best

526
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,700
at traveling through space.

527
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,860
- That's true. - And they like cornfields,

528
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,700
too. - Yeah.

529
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,980
- So it's kind of like it relates,

530
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,460
it's almost like we subconsciously,

531
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,420
we're steering the conversation towards aliens.

532
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,300
- And aliens are the most advanced beings.

533
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,940
Again, they're bald. - Yeah, exactly.

534
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,780
- They don't have hair at all.

535
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,900
- So then-- - And they're great.

536
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,240
- If we're headed that way already,

537
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,900
then let me just push us right over the edge.

538
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,060
- Right. - How about this UFO

539
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,900
that they have completely destroyed--

540
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,900
completely destroyed over the Alaskan airspace.

541
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,400
There's been three of them and they're objects.

542
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Yep.

543
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Unidentified.

544
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm like, what the hell is this?

545
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Yeah.

546
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
They've been shooting down objects.

547
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,140
I'm going to be completely honest, no idea.

548
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,380
Have not paid attention to this news story at all.

549
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, here, I'll run it down for you.

550
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
It's pretty simple.

551
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Tell me everything about it.

552
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,740
Basically, there were some objects.

553
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,300
They scrambled jets, which means flying them, and they shot the objects and they closed airspace.

554
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:30,300
space. No fucking way. But it wasn't. That's the whole story. No way. I'm not lying to you.

555
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:36,420
Genuinely, that's what happened in Alaska, Canada, Michigan, and apparently China. In

556
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,260
China as well? They said that. But I don't believe that one. If I was China and I was

557
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,260
sending objects over, I would do it. Yeah, we got one too. Fuck me, holy shit. That's

558
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,220
a clear, that's obvious, you know? Yeah. That's like if you're a serial killer and you're trying

559
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,960
to avoid being caught you kill yourself. Exactly. You kill your family. You go, "No, my family

560
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,820
got killed! Who did this?" I heard an awful story about a serial killer the other day

561
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,500
in Germany, so you know it's for real. In Germany, there was a serial killer called the

562
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,860
Lady with No Face, and they kept every serial killing scene, every murder scene, they would

563
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,820
test the DNA. Not everyone, but a bunch of them. They'd be like, "Fuck, it was this lady."

564
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,280
like it was the same DNA every time.

565
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,860
And then they find out, after like 15 years

566
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,680
of trying to solve the murders of this serial killer

567
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,480
that they think is the lady with no face,

568
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
they find out that the DNA is from a lady

569
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,220
who works at the DNA fucking factory,

570
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,720
making the test tubes.

571
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,640
- Oh, she got her fingers in the,

572
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,480
she was dipping her fingers in the blood and stuff.

573
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
- She just was like too wet one day,

574
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,600
like she was sweaty, or she was wet,

575
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,520
and she was just gooing all over all the stuff.

576
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,160
- Or, I mean, that's the best place to work

577
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,120
if you're a serial killer.

578
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Well, that's true. You're pretty rock solid.

579
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Isn't there a whole show about that?

580
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
No, that's different. He's a good guy and he kills serial killers.

581
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Oh, he's a good guy with a gun?

582
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
What do you mean, what Dexter's about?

583
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Dexter's job is he works at the investigation.

584
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
He's a forensic analyst.

585
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,120
He's not a DNA woman. He's a man, first of all.

586
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
I was close enough.

587
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
I was close enough.

588
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
You were far off. You were way over there.

589
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,160
way over there. You're way out. Not true. Y'all need to do some Molly therapy together.

590
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,160
You guys need to do a psycho amount of Molly together and record it on the pod with

591
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,120
like some therapist like to hash this shit out. You guys are beefing too much.

592
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,400
I know that it would be something though if I did Molly with these two that it

593
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,200
would pretty much instantly become sexual. I was just about to say I think

594
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,920
like you guys would be like kind of rubbing and touching on each other.

595
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,320
No, because I already get like that with Patrick if I just kind of watch too much TV in a day.

596
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
So I think that Molly would affect my brain.

597
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
If he has three beers, I get a swat of them away.

598
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,920
I don't even need beer. If I have half a cigarette and I've watched and I have an episode of reality TV on,

599
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,720
that is enough modulation of my brain that I start getting a little bit sexual with Patrick.

600
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Even now, I'm kind of on the ground.

601
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,920
When we record, I stand in the backyard until it's time and then as soon as we're done, I go back out there.

602
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,440
Because if these pheromones are coming at me, there's not...

603
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,800
I mean, I'm human, I'm a man.

604
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,680
- We have a hypersexual workspace.

605
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
- Yeah, it's a problem.

606
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,320
- I do feel like in a past life--

607
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
- We've had 10 HR ladies quit on us

608
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,800
'cause she just can't handle how much is going on between us.

609
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,160
- They open the file and they just vomit instantly.

610
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,560
They can't even handle it.

611
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,480
It's like the first day in some kind of,

612
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
speaking of forensic analyst.

613
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,960
- We're like an HR nightmare.

614
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,000
- Nobody will handle it.

615
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,760
- Nobody, literally, it's almost an in-joke

616
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,540
in the HR community, where they're like,

617
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,840
you can always go work for them.

618
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,440
People are like, hell no.

619
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,540
No, we're not touching that.

620
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,380
They're touching it.

621
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,280
- There's gonna be some seriously bad articles

622
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,360
about this whole thing in a couple years.

623
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
- Yeah, I know.

624
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,040
- Written about us, by us, towards each other.

625
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,760
- We do a thing called harassment rock, paper, scissors.

626
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,920
We're kinda just going in a circle against each other.

627
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,080
- Yeah. - Against.

628
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,000
- Yeah.

629
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
You know, when we travel, I only book,

630
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,320
when we get on a plane or something, I book us one seat.

631
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,200
- Wow. - And then we have to

632
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,440
just figure it out.

633
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,280
We just gotta figure it out.

634
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
- He's also multiple times booked a hotel

635
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,440
that's only got one bed.

636
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,480
- But luckily our bodies are perfectly made

637
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,120
to stick like Legos to each other.

638
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,000
So we just kinda pop on.

639
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,640
But getting this, you know,

640
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,880
you don't wanna be the flight attendant

641
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,120
who has to pull us apart, I'll say that.

642
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,940
- Right.

643
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,780
How do you guys sit?

644
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,120
Is it one person sits normal

645
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,440
and then the two are like facing--

646
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,760
- One on each leg, yeah.

647
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
- Stack sideways.

648
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
- Oh shit.

649
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,080
- It's me, he sits like this,

650
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,920
I sit facing him, kind of cowgirl.

651
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,760
- Yeah, yeah.

652
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
I'm in between you guys.

653
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
You hear that?

654
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
And I switch which direction I'm facing.

655
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
He sits like he got a BBL.

656
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,760
I was on a flight once and there was somebody who had gotten a BBL in a foreign country for cheaper.

657
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,760
And I was asleep and I woke up to this lady was passed out in the middle of the aisle way.

658
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Whoa.

659
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Begging for a doctor on the plane and she was like passed out like seizing out because she was not supposed to

660
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,280
to leave the country and get that high altitude yet.

661
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,080
So she was crying and like, ah,

662
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
and she was on the phone with her boyfriend,

663
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600
like, you shouldn't have fucking done this.

664
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,720
- Oh my God. - It was wild.

665
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,240
But there was a doctor on the flight who was like--

666
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
- Whoa, wow.

667
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
- Who helped her out and thank God she's okay.

668
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,960
- She lived. - Yeah, we keep in touch.

669
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,400
- And the butt was okay?

670
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,360
- The butt was great. - Okay, good.

671
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,960
- The butt was good. - Women go through

672
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,880
so fucking much just to make our experience on Instagram

673
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,360
just a little bit better.

674
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,280
- Shout out to all the women out there.

675
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,160
- They really do, they put all of us in a massive way.

676
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,680
- Speaking of all the ladies out there,

677
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,640
we got some lists for your ladies at home,

678
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,480
for how to get a lady.

679
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,320
- That's true.

680
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,960
- I don't know how to transition.

681
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,920
- Listen, I'll handle it.

682
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,240
So it's Valentine's Day, it was Valentine's Day.

683
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,600
We're gonna pretend it is Valentine's Day.

684
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,840
And let me tell you something.

685
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,680
- Tell me.

686
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,600
- At least for me, Valentine's Day, one day of the year,

687
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
I don't have a girlfriend.

688
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,560
I'm out on the hunt.

689
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
- Oh yeah, dude.

690
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,240
- Okay, I don't know.

691
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,720
- What, basically, so 364 days a year?

692
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,640
- 364 days, I'm monogamous.

693
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,480
- Well, here, let's--

694
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,840
- Valentine's Day, I'm at the bars, I'm at the museums,

695
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,680
I'm at the--

696
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
- You're microdosing.

697
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
- I'm at the beach. - I'm at the beach.

698
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,340
- I'm at the beach. - I'm at the beach.

699
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,480
- I'm in the lake.

700
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,520
Whoa, my mic just went out.

701
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm in the lake.

702
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,480
You're at the bottom of the lake.

703
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,160
- You're in the lake trying to find a woman?

704
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,000
- I'm chained up at the bottom of the lake.

705
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,200
- I'm trying to find the lady in the lake.

706
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,680
- Let's ask our-- - Like, space reporters.

707
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,740
Nate, you're like, I feel like you're pretty legendary

708
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,280
when it comes to like, basically game.

709
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,600
- Uh-huh, yeah. - Oh yes.

710
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,840
- I feel like you have some of the,

711
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,980
if not the most advanced techniques.

712
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,080
You're a developer of a lot of them.

713
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,360
So like, I guess, what is your history

714
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,360
with basically like, with getting pussy and smelling it?

715
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,820
- Well, basically I am one of the most sexual beings

716
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,840
on planet Earth.

717
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,920
And a lot of people look at me and they say,

718
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,900
"Hmm, I don't think this guy is like sexy,

719
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,360
"he's kind of like fugly."

720
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,600
But when they--

721
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,800
- Who calls you fugly?

722
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,120
- That's fucked up, man. - A lot of people

723
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,800
in my DMs are really coming at me.

724
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,880
- That's so not right.

725
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,200
- But when they come near me and they feel that energy

726
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,080
and that cosmic connection and those pheromones,

727
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,600
yeah, I might smell like shit, but you like it.

728
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,720
But it's like, it's kind of a shitty pheromone.

729
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,280
But do you put that, so when you say you smell like shit,

730
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,680
are you rolling around in shit?

731
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,440
Do you spray it on yourself or is that on natural?

732
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,200
- I just have never wiped once in my life.

733
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
Never once.

734
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,860
- Why would you?

735
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,680
- And I let it just kind of just be a part of it.

736
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,000
- Like a cast iron pan.

737
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,840
- Yep.

738
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,660
- Why would you wash it?

739
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,080
- Treat the booty hole like a cast iron pan.

740
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,200
Yep.

741
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,840
- You know there's that guy.

742
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
- That's giving me like a visceral reaction.

743
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,320
(laughing)

744
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,560
A caked on booty, like that's.

745
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,360
But over time, you know, it kind of merges.

746
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,700
- It looks exactly like a cast iron pan.

747
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Also, there's a video of some guy restoring it with like...

748
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,700
One of those Facebook videos with a power washer.

749
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
You have to heat it up and put hot oil on.

750
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Disgusting caked on ass transformed.

751
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Looks brand new.

752
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,700
You guys know about that guy in, I think it was Iran,

753
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,700
who was like 95 years old and he had never had a shower in his life.

754
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Then he took a shower and then he died.

755
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
No!

756
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,700
He had never had a shower. He would literally smoke...

757
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,940
- Well it's a good thing he didn't have a shower earlier then.

758
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,780
- Yeah.

759
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,620
- Yeah, he wouldn't have lived so long.

760
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,460
- He looked like a mud man.

761
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,420
He would smoke, he loved smoking cigarettes,

762
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,500
but then when he ran out of cigarettes,

763
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,820
he would smoke his own poop out of a pipe.

764
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,860
(laughing)

765
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,900
And then, he was like, people were like,

766
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,240
you have to wash yourself.

767
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,860
And he was like, no, it'll make me sick.

768
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,340
And then eventually they wore him down

769
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,420
and he was like, okay, I'll take a shower.

770
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,140
So he takes a shower, he gets clean.

771
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,100
Like 90 days later, dead.

772
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,740
- That's probably the guy they based Shrek off

773
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,580
from the movie.

774
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,400
- Well it was also, he was 96, right?

775
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,820
- Well yeah, but also, but it's a little,

776
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,920
I mean he could've just lived forever, you know?

777
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,520
I think he'd kind of fossilized himself

778
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
and created a protective layer.

779
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,320
So I think if you're doing that with your ass,

780
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,960
probably some good news.

781
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,360
You may attract women, this guy attracted the news

782
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
from all over the world.

783
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,720
- That's how you get girls.

784
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,560
- Probably a lot of female reporters too.

785
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,240
Well maybe not in Iran.

786
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,360
- Yeah maybe not that many.

787
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,800
- But maybe from the world.

788
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,120
- But so you're using pheromone technology.

789
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,960
- Absolutely.

790
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,880
- But some people don't have pheromone technology,

791
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,500
which is what we've learned.

792
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,060
And here's some information from these guys that we found.

793
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,840
- You are so bad at English.

794
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,920
(laughing)

795
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,440
- Y'all, y'all, we're talking Riz.

796
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680
- Talking Riz today.

797
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,040
Riz, or as it formerly was called, Pickup Artistry.

798
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,160
And here's a list of things that you can do

799
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,320
for pickup artistry.

800
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,160
- First of all, talk about your fit here.

801
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,600
- It's from a pickup artist forum.

802
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,440
- Can you please talk about your fit here, Patrick?

803
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,920
- What happened was, we were reading through these things,

804
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,120
and then I became completely--

805
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,240
- Oh my, the hat.

806
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,080
- Whoa.

807
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,920
- Damn, wait.

808
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,000
- Okay, Cameron is doing something called peacocking,

809
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
which is what you can learn about on the Pickup Artist--

810
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,840
- Yo.

811
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,120
- What happened was, we were reading on these

812
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,960
Pickup Artist forums-- - Cameron Fetter Rizz.

813
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,440
- Cameron Fetter Rizz, y'all.

814
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,720
- Is that your blog this year? - Oh, shit.

815
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,800
- Cameron Fetter Rizz.

816
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,000
- Okay. - It's dropping.

817
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,040
- All right, I'm excited.

818
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,280
- We read all these, I got completely indoctrinated.

819
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,820
I am now a Pickup Artist entirely.

820
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
You're nothing else.

821
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,960
No. I'm basically, after this episode, I'm gone.

822
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
You're dead?

823
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,700
Dead to podcasting, but then I'm alive in PUA lifestyle. Okay? So here's a list of things

824
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,460
you can do, pick up artistry. Before we begin, though, I just want to say I've been trying

825
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,320
some new PowerPoint templates.

826
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I can see that.

827
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
What do you think of this one?

828
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Wow, it looks great.

829
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,640
I am just now noticing that this is a witch-themed one. Is that kind of a common-

830
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,740
It was the first one that I found.

831
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Okay.

832
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
But what were you going to say?

833
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,800
Is this a, are you commenting on how basically SJW culture has turned a lot of these women

834
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,120
into kind of witches, kind of old hags?

835
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,880
I wasn't, but holy fuck, that's symbolism.

836
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,040
Yeah, that's pretty mind blowing.

837
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
That's symbolism as fuck.

838
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
I love symbolism.

839
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,800
Also, I tried to join the PUA forums.

840
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,100
I tried to make an account so I could talk to these guys and their name is Gangstalicious

841
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,480
and they did not accept me.

842
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Really?

843
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
That's a shame.

844
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,860
When you say they didn't accept you, they didn't let you make an account?

845
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,700
- Does that mean I-- - Did they let you make

846
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,900
an account or they shunned you when you did?

847
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,820
- I have not gotten a confirmation email.

848
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,660
- Oh, okay. - Wow.

849
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,140
- Or anything yet. - That is so sad.

850
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,860
- That is a shame. - Yeah, it's fucked up.

851
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,740
But here's the first thing.

852
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,540
People you model yourself after.

853
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,620
Oh shit, I can't read that.

854
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,700
Make it full screen.

855
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,860
- Make it full screen. - No, you can't make it

856
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,900
full screen, then you won't be able to see it.

857
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,920
In terms of people that you,

858
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,580
damn, I should've made this way bigger to see.

859
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,060
- In terms of people you look up to

860
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,020
that improve your everyday mannerisms,

861
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,900
conversations and overall personality,

862
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,460
who do you look up to and why?

863
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,060
For me personally, I love Alec Baldwin's character

864
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,900
on 30 Rock.

865
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,980
(laughing)

866
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,060
He maintains a dominant, calm, but still human personality

867
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,900
who's just interesting from hearing him say words,

868
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,080
let alone anything else.

869
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,380
I've heard a lot of Tyler Durden,

870
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,760
although I haven't seen Fight Club.

871
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,760
I'll take my bets that it's, at the least, a decent movie.

872
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,980
- Okay, at least a decent movie.

873
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
- A decent movie, Fight Club, the greatest movie ever made.

874
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,260
- Five stars out of five stars,

875
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,100
10 stars out of 10 stars, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

876
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,220
- I do understand being attracted to Alec Baldwin

877
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,540
in 30 Rock. - In 30 Rock.

878
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,500
- What, does he ever tap that ass?

879
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,260
- It's a will they, won't they?

880
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,500
- Yeah, I've never seen it.

881
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,980
- But he gets it on with Salma Hayek.

882
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,860
- He does do that, Salma Hayek does.

883
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,020
- He has amazing riz in that show.

884
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,060
- He does. - Which is what

885
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,140
they're talking about here, is guys with amazing riz

886
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,420
that they model themselves after.

887
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,980
- 30 Riz techniques. - 30 Riz.

888
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,380
And then this next one, Style, intelligent and socially well calibrated. I think that's

889
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
another pickup artist named Style.

890
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
Oh, okay.

891
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Style's a good name.

892
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
Or it's the type of style guide.

893
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,900
Oh no, there is. No, no, I've seen that there is a guy named Style.

894
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Named Style?

895
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Okay, on the forum?

897
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,780
No, no, he's like, there's a couple of people, Derek Dark, I think is one of them.

898
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,780
Mystery?

899
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Maybe mystery, I don't know.

900
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
Yeah, that's the VH1, like, famous.

901
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
Oh yeah.

902
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,780
You do have the reality show.

903
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,780
He's going to come up later in this live show.

904
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,620
- Spoilers.

905
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,740
- Uh-huh.

906
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,480
Dexter Morgan, mysterious and humble misanthrope.

907
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,400
Now that's Dexter from Dexter, isn't it?

908
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,240
- Yeah.

909
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,060
- Wait.

910
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,900
- What you thought was a DNA lady.

911
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,740
- How?

912
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,580
- But apparently, pick-up artist wizard.

913
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,660
- Can we just appreciate how incredible that is

914
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,620
that we were already had Dexter Morgan on the line?

915
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,900
- That is pretty incredible.

916
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
- That's called synchronicity.

917
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,940
- So what I'll say about this, about Dexter being on here,

918
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,700
I watched two episodes of Dexter

919
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,060
'cause my girlfriend wanted to watch it.

920
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,220
It's horrible.

921
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,020
But the second episode is about him,

922
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,520
a girl wants to have sex with him,

923
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,200
and his whole thing is he's like a psychopath

924
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,600
who feels no emotion or whatever,

925
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,760
and he's like, "I don't wanna have sex with you.

926
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
"Please don't have sex with me."

927
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,720
And then he does anyway.

928
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,120
- That's called reverse psychology.

929
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,440
- That's fucking pick-up artistry.

930
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,840
- That is pick-up artistry.

931
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,680
- That's genius.

932
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,500
- That is Riz.

933
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,560
- Do not have sex with me.

934
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,760
I feel no emotion.

935
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm a killer.

936
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,360
- I'm a crazy serial, that's been my recent technique.

937
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,560
I'm a crazy serial killer, and my name is Dexter Morgan.

938
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,400
(laughing)

939
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,840
And they go, "So you're famous."

940
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,380
So then Don Draper, a real man.

941
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,220
- Yep.

942
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,760
- Arnold Schwarzenegger, persistent and successful.

943
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,600
- Yep.

944
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,840
- Royce Gracie, UFC champion, underdog with family values.

945
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,800
- The Gracie family, they're an amazing, amazing family.

946
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,680
- Then we got,

947
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,280
nothing can beat the power of a mixed character.

948
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,760
I combine them.

949
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,560
Example, the combination of Tom Cruise,

950
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,080
Mystery and Alec Baldwin.

951
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,280
Lot of Alec Baldwin on here.

952
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,120
- I get it.

953
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,680
- But this came out in 2000, what is this?

954
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,680
2007, 2009, this is before this tragic shooting.

955
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,240
- Yeah, long before.

956
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,840
Before anyone could even conceive

957
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,080
that he would even hold a gun.

958
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,280
- I would bump him by the head.

959
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,120
- Did you have to shoot a Democrat?

960
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,080
Couldn't you shoot a Republican?

961
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,920
- Really?

962
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,820
- Like, what is that about?

963
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,400
Like, why'd you have to shoot somebody who's on our side?

964
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,720
- Or like a corrupt politician.

965
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,760
Maybe not even a citizen, but like--

966
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,280
- Or just like, there's enough people,

967
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,120
she was a firearms lady.

968
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,200
- Or not an American.

969
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,040
- Yeah, exactly.

970
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,560
- Maybe you have to skip the whole Democrats

971
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,600
Republicans all together and maybe do a Democrat or Republican from a different

972
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,640
country. Yeah or at least somebody like just don't shoot like a like a

973
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,040
registered voting Democrat that definitely feels like a waste. Yeah.

974
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,840
Kind of and that yeah the numbers they matter. Yeah. Alec Baldwin I know you're

975
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,600
watching this shit. I know you're watching this shit from your cell. He's watching this from his cell

976
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,160
right now. I saw him put the the Joy Tactics episode on his Instagram story. Oh yeah I did see that.

977
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,520
Yeah he's one of the fans we're trying to get him on the pod right now. It's kind of like

978
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,280
gonna be easy. Yeah you think so? Yeah I mean you know watch out I'll say that.

979
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:38,640
He kills us all. He's a complete murderer. He's a psycho now. He got a taste for it.

980
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,760
I actually loved doing that. This last person, Bam Margera for me.

981
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,600
Ultimate Rizko. I'm seeing the name on here, Gangsta-licious. I thought they

982
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:56,520
didn't let you make an account Patrick. Nope, that is Soil Worker. That is from Soil

983
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
worker.

984
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,240
Hold on, let me read some of the names of the last people.

985
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,640
I forgot about the names here.

986
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,680
Soil worker, Bam Margera.

987
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
The last person here, Motherfucker2000.

988
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Damn.

989
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Okay, that's pretty cool.

990
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
I hope that's not the year he's born.

991
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
He probably means it literally, "Motherfucker."

992
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Oh yeah.

993
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Defy.

994
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,360
So the next thing, the next thing about pickup artistry, how to fucking dress.

995
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Look at this.

996
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Look at Mystery right now.

997
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
Oh my god.

998
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Please tease me, dude.

999
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Look at that swag.

1000
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Oh my god.

1001
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Yeah, look at how amazing.

1002
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
The fuzzy hat.

1003
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,100
Peacocking which Cameron picked up on pretty much immediately with this big LED hat that says let me hit

1004
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:35,720
Can I please hit it yeah, well you got a dress I don't even have to say anything

1005
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,240
Girl do you mind if I hit it?

1006
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,200
Yeah, okay, and it's going reverse by the way

1007
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,320
He's doing a double peacocking here girl. Let me hit that in this beautiful lion shirt right you think that's a lion tiger

1008
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,280
Okay, see well that and that that's a teaching moment because that is how you start a conversation

1009
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,240
Exactly you wait for a girl to say something stupid. Yeah. No you go up you say something stupid

1010
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,200
So he's got this you say I like your lion shirt. She says seriously you think there's a line. It's a tiger

1011
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,240
I say I know but now you're talking to me. Do you think I'm gonna hit that?

1012
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,720
Do you think that you can peacock a little too hard like if I were to show up in a bar like?

1013
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,640
Completely drenched in in like pig blood. Oh and let's start growling

1014
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
There's no such thing as going too hard.

1015
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
See, okay, so...

1016
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
You think that works, you know?

1017
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Female psychology, when God made females,

1018
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,080
he made them to basically think the opposite of what a guy would think.

1019
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
So you walk in, right?

1020
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Interesting.

1021
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
If you walk in covered in pig's blood, I'm saying,

1022
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
"I will not be fucking that guy."

1023
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Right.

1024
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
I'm thinking about most guys who walk in.

1025
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
And girls are sitting there like this.

1026
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
But girls are sitting there like...

1027
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Twirling their hair.

1028
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
So whatever a guy would think, the girl's thinking the opposite.

1029
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
So you gotta keep that in mind.

1030
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,080
That's kind of interesting, and I never ever heard that shit before.

1031
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
- Thank you, man. - They're gonna go,

1032
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,920
they're basically gonna ravenously--

1033
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,240
- They're gonna say, "Damn." - They're gonna say,

1034
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,440
"Let me clean you off."

1035
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,920
- Ooh, oh, shit. - Oh, damn.

1036
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,080
- Oh, damn. - Wow.

1037
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
- So Cameron goes for a more casual style.

1038
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,560
See, I'm a classic man. - Also, I got the case in me.

1039
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,760
- I'm a classic man.

1040
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,200
- You can be, Jadina, by the way,

1041
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,520
number one pickup artist, maybe, whoever that is.

1042
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,360
- Number one.

1043
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,920
- That's what I would put for my pickup artist influences.

1044
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,840
Style Jadina, lyrics Jadina.

1045
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,920
- So I got this classic blazer that fits me perfectly.

1046
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,760
See that? - Oh, yeah.

1047
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Wow.

1048
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Look at that.

1049
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Well, that shows off your sleeves.

1050
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,480
It shows off my sleeves on my white turtleneck right here.

1051
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
I got the head.

1052
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
The island vibe.

1053
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,660
I look a little, you know, I mean, I look a little conservative, right?

1054
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,480
You wouldn't look at me and think, "Oh, this man is peacocking," right?

1055
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
What?

1056
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,160
You wouldn't say, "Oh, this man's peacocking."

1057
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Not necessarily.

1058
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
I guess not.

1059
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
I guess I think you dress like this all the time.

1060
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Wait, wait.

1061
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
I'd say he's hitchcocking, classic.

1062
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Classic, classic.

1063
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Yeah.

1064
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
Wait, wait for it.

1065
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I got a gun on me.

1066
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Wow.

1067
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Damn.

1068
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,560
- That's when the girls be giving you them digits.

1069
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,600
- Yep. - Yeah.

1070
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,120
- They come up, they say, "Can I give that to him?"

1071
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,960
- Yeah. - Oh, okay.

1072
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,240
- I give them the gun.

1073
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,080
- If you don't like it, kill me.

1074
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,920
- And then I run away.

1075
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,880
(laughing)

1076
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,840
- If you don't wanna fuck me, just go ahead and kill me.

1077
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,280
(laughing)

1078
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,240
- Yeah, if you don't like this pickup line,

1079
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,160
just go ahead and shoot me.

1080
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,280
Are you from Tennessee?

1081
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,320
(laughing)

1082
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,520
- Are you from Tennessee?

1083
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,760
(laughing)

1084
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,240
'Cause you're making me crazy.

1085
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,280
I fucked it up.

1086
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,760
Ah, it's not loaded.

1087
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,800
- Oh, wow. - That is rich.

1088
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,120
- So they know that I'm psycho.

1089
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
- It's great to be carrying around something

1090
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,960
that's kind of a prop that you can use

1091
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,800
to start a conversation.

1092
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,620
- A totem, yeah.

1093
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,480
- 'Cause I actually, I have something like that too.

1094
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,320
- What's that?

1095
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,480
- Can you hold my mic for me?

1096
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,320
- Yeah.

1097
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,140
- So,

1098
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,320
what I do is I walk up to a girl,

1099
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,080
and I usually, I have this on me,

1100
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,640
and I walk up to her, and I walk up,

1101
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,760
and I hold this shirt up, and I say,

1102
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,320
"You like this shirt?"

1103
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,400
And she says, "Yeah."

1104
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,320
'Cause who's gonna say no?

1105
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,160
- Of course.

1106
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,680
- And I say, "Me and my friends made this shirt."

1107
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,360
- Damn. - The merch.

1108
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,320
- It says merch.

1109
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,160
- Damn. - Yeah.

1110
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,140
- I have merch.

1111
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,080
- Wow. - Yeah.

1112
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,560
- I also, I got some items for you guys too,

1113
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
for you guys to, I mean,

1114
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,400
you're already decked out right now, but--

1115
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,040
- You do look incredible. - You look amazing.

1116
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,300
I got you this you can put on over--

1117
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,880
- I don't think I'll be putting that on.

1118
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,720
- Why not?

1119
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,080
- It's covered in things.

1120
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,920
- That's dirt. - That's part of it.

1121
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,440
- No, that's dirt from the ground right here.

1122
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,760
- Can you explain what that is?

1123
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,600
- This is an Austin Powers costume.

1124
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,920
- Okay. - For Halloween.

1125
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,720
But don't you think that that is,

1126
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,760
'cause, okay, so real quick,

1127
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
can we go around and just say all of our,

1128
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,800
if we were doing our perfect Riz God techniques,

1129
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,480
I would want the charisma of Austin Powers,

1130
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,160
the style of Jidenna,

1131
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,040
and probably the sense of humor of Andy Samberg.

1132
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,880
- Yeah. - Right?

1133
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,400
- Wow. - I would probably go for,

1134
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm for more of like a working class perspective

1135
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,340
rather than celebrities,

1136
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,700
so I would say maybe like the style and elegance

1137
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,980
of a bellhop combined with the politeness of a chauffeur,

1138
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,740
but also maybe the gruffness, toughness

1139
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,340
of a construction worker and the intelligence of an author.

1140
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,460
- Wow.

1141
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,300
- See I would--

1142
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,420
- And I don't even need to pick specific people.

1143
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,100
- I would also go charisma of Austin Powers.

1144
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,020
- Yeah.

1145
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,140
- Maybe the confidence of Fat Bastard.

1146
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,980
- Okay. - Oh shit.

1147
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,260
- The jewelry of Goldmember.

1148
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,100
- Oh yeah.

1149
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,740
- And then the style of Dr. Evil.

1150
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,700
- And Mini-Me ain't even in this at all?

1151
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,540
- The height of Mini-Me.

1152
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,180
(laughing)

1153
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,680
- Well I had all these things I was gonna give up,

1154
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,320
then I realized there's a lot of dust and dirt. Yeah, don't touch it. So what would you know?

1155
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,680
What about you? I'd just be straight up Biden. Joe Biden. Every straight.

1156
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,440
Every foreign personality look. Dick size, whatever. He definitely has a huge one.

1157
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,360
Oh my goodness. Could you imagine getting dicked down by Biden? Amazing. By the goat?

1158
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:39,280
Amazing. His just sputtering tip of his penis. Like an old fucking car. Why do you think he can't speak right?

1159
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,040
all the blood's going down there.

1160
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,420
- 'Cause he's fucking noting every second,

1161
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,000
'cause he has some kind of hooked up thing

1162
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,560
and he's got hot babes in the other room

1163
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,460
pressing a button electronically making 'em cum.

1164
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,960
(laughing)

1165
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,360
Could be.

1166
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,940
- So here's a style guide from some of the members

1167
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,600
of this forum.

1168
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,360
I try to dress a bar casual, nice dress shirt, low jeans,

1169
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,100
and I have an LED belt as one of my peacocking items,

1170
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,900
which flashes stop staring at my penis

1171
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,140
when I swerve here.

1172
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,820
- Oh shit. - But it's kinda broke now.

1173
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,500
Very, and I'm really glad that you,

1174
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,860
what does this one say?

1175
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,260
I'm glad that you have the hat

1176
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,500
because you're basically doing exactly

1177
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,340
what this guy tells you to do.

1178
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,140
- It's a demonstration, right?

1179
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,340
- And what does this say?

1180
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,160
(laughing)

1181
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,100
Go ahead and say it.

1182
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,180
- Pussy rubber?

1183
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,020
- Yup.

1184
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,860
(laughing)

1185
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,680
Yup.

1186
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,620
- That's fire.

1187
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,440
- I'm rubbing it.

1188
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,280
- It's changing.

1189
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,500
I didn't even know. - I've got an app.

1190
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,340
- Oh my goodness.

1191
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,180
- Oh my god.

1192
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,180
We told you you weren't gonna expect this hat. I know you weren't gonna believe it. That is so wild.

1193
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:44,540
That is about to blow up 100%. Could you imagine dying while it said "pussy rubber" on it?

1194
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:50,780
It's like scanners like there's parts of my face are coming towards the camera.

1195
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,820
Because legally we have to consider that your last words. Yeah.

1196
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:02,860
This next person says, "I dress expensively. I peacock when I walk through the mall and grocery

1197
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,660
store. Dress lacks dry clean only type, high-end shoes, and a button-up shirt with

1198
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,300
sleeves unbuttoned and rolled just below my elbows, unless I'm wearing a suit top.

1199
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,160
No tie, leave the collar button loose. At night I wear a glow stick necklace

1200
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,060
and/or blinking LED necklace. If you're on the prowl, I try to be head and

1201
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,420
shoulders above all others. Night and day, Joshua.

1202
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,420
- Wow. - Muff Buster, is that his name?

1203
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,420
- Muff Buster, yeah.

1204
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,260
(laughing)

1205
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,740
Joshua Muff Buster, and that last person was Shaft.

1206
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,580
- Wow.

1207
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,180
- This next one is from Johnny Rage.

1208
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,780
I dress cool and trendy, LOL, such a bad word.

1209
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,820
I usually wear big belt buckles and edible jewelry.

1210
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,860
(laughing)

1211
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,620
- That is a big belt buckle.

1212
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,620
- Yeah.

1213
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,660
- Eat my bracelet. - Hey girl,

1214
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,980
you wanna eat this ice?

1215
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,100
- Yeah. - Ooh, man.

1216
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,220
- Check that out, that may look like gold

1217
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
I'm gonna add a little bit edible earrings

1218
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,640
Johnny dang laced me up with the full fucking

1219
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,500
Wrist made of Tums

1220
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,120
Then this next this is for midnight

1221
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:18,620
Should have an edible hat midnight says I once dressed like a smurf. I come from a fancy dress party

1222
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,540
I taught myself blue with food

1223
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,000
die and had a white smurf hat, blue shirt and white pants. I strolled straight into

1224
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,140
the club, passed stunned bouncers and patrons. Not only was I the center of attention of all

1225
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:38,300
night but paid for no drinks and got felt up constantly by HB 1 to 10.

1226
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:43,260
What's HB? Hot bitches? It's like the scale that you rate women on.

1227
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,300
HB 1 to 10. Okay. Being an AFC I accomplished nothing though, what a waste.

1228
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
Women love a six-foot-four smurf.

1229
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,300
[laughter]

1230
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,300
Dude, can you imagine, you're sitting at the club, right?

1231
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,300
And then just like, door busts open, saloon door for some reason.

1232
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,300
Damn.

1233
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,300
In walks a giant smurf, dirt off your shoulder, Jay-Z.

1234
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:06,300
[imitates Jay-Z's smurf music]

1235
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,300
Right, he's just fucking strutting, the bouncer's just jaw-dropping.

1236
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Women are screaming.

1237
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,300
Yeah, he's like playing that.

1238
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,300
Yeah, everybody has something in their mouth and it just falls out.

1239
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,800
- Oh my god, there's a poppin' champagne on 'em.

1240
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,640
(humming)

1241
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,940
- Yeah, this is the type of club that's got like food.

1242
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,780
- Yeah.

1243
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,820
- Okay, okay, but now, imagine--

1244
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,820
- I start choking on a chicken wing and I die,

1245
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,140
nobody notices 'cause there's a giant smurf.

1246
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,420
- Everybody, everybody has, was on the,

1247
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,660
every pickup artist has been reading this forum, right?

1248
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,860
You walk in with your Beats pill,

1249
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,100
you're playing Dirt Off Your Shoulder, you're smurfed up.

1250
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,620
You walk in, there's like five other smurfs already in there.

1251
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,460
They all read the same post.

1252
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,300
- Hell no.

1253
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,120
- Oh no.

1254
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,540
- But then you can start partying,

1255
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,940
you start ordering D'Ussé.

1256
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,260
(laughing)

1257
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,620
- All the Smurfs dancing together.

1258
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,500
We didn't even know each other before tonight.

1259
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,460
- And then all of a sudden you're fucking blowing backs out.

1260
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,300
I'll say that much.

1261
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,700
- Oh my God.

1262
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,940
- This next one, I don't really have to read it.

1263
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,820
Not that good.

1264
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,660
- Okay, you can skip to that.

1265
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,780
- But here's some photos.

1266
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,900
- These are some-- - Oh, photo bucket.

1267
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,020
- Photos from Ziggy.

1268
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,980
- Who's Ziggy?

1269
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,260
- I guess this is Ziggy.

1270
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,100
- He looks so good.

1271
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,380
- That's the name of my cat.

1272
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,220
- Damn. - Damn.

1273
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,340
- And this is the Motley Crew of Real Social Dynamics.

1274
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,140
- Oh, Sum 41, cool.

1275
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:20,260
Papa Zenus, Tyler Durden, Dreamweaver, The One, Sick Boy, Playboy LA, and 26.

1276
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,260
Amazing.

1277
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,260
And then this is how to spit game.

1278
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,260
Tell me.

1279
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,260
Okay, I'm ready to learn.

1280
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,500
This is some advice from people on the forums, right?

1281
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,580
These are just some things that you can say to some ladies to pick them up.

1282
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,940
Real and genuine online spellcaster, if you have any of the below problems, think no more

1283
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,980
because you have and call spam on this.

1284
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,340
No problems as far as Dr. Machinga is concerned.

1285
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,660
love spell, instant death spell to kill your enemies, spells to cancel/file divorce, spells

1286
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,700
to cure your HIV/AIDS, spells to make impotence protective, spells to get your ex back, spells

1287
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:00,680
to make your wife give birth, and there's a lot more stuff like this, like best African

1288
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,420
traditional healer with long distance healing powers, powerful astrologer, expert-

1289
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,420
Are these ads?

1290
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,340
No, this is not a spit game, this is stuff you say to women.

1291
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,380
These almost seem like ads for like, looking for-

1292
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,380
No.

1293
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:17,260
No. No? These are spells though? Money increasing and lottery spells. Okay.

1294
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:23,740
Spells with quick results called Dr. Madonna. Yeah that sounds like an ad. Others may notice a

1295
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,580
tingling sensation in the fingertips or lightheadedness that causes a smile or

1296
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,820
outright laughter. I have noticed that before when I see it when I watch TV

1297
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,740
sometimes I do get. Wow. I feel the urge to smile and laugh with some lightheadedness.

1298
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,220
Well guessing a spell on you man. Yeah, these spells work so well that

1299
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:48,820
So somebody kissed three girls in one night just by being confident due to the spells and Rachel touched their hand Rachel touched his hand

1300
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,980
Rachel's in hb9

1301
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,260
So now that I'm a pickup artist you can contact me

1302
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:03,860
Here's my phone number and my LinkedIn. Okay, that is my email address and that's just a photo. I took earlier. Thank you

1303
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,900
- That was a great tutorial. - Levitation Mail.

1304
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,380
- So now that we know-- - It's a new email site

1305
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,020
I've made up. - That's awesome.

1306
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,240
- Now that we know, now me and Cameron can kinda go

1307
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,380
into our pickup artist journeys, and you can too, Nate.

1308
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,260
- Yeah. - Well, you are right,

1309
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,220
we've been over this at your-- - Yeah, you are one of the--

1310
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,980
- You are a completely legend-- - One of the top dogs.

1311
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,120
- Dairy guy status. - The big cheese.

1312
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,300
- That's why we wanted you on,

1313
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,780
because we knew that you were such a--

1314
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,740
- See, like right now, you're rising up this fly.

1315
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,140
- Oh my God. - Yeah, there's a fly

1316
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,540
coming on me, and I'm like, "Hey, fly,

1317
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,180
"do you mind if I hit it slowly?

1318
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,260
so slow that I'm in slow motion and you think that I'm kind of frozen.

1319
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,020
But I'm actually like...

1320
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,020
God damn.

1321
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,740
Well, all movement to the fly is going to feel like slow motion because time slows down

1322
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,740
for you.

1323
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,740
Whoa.

1324
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,140
So when you're hitting it, there ain't no such thing as going to pound town with a fly.

1325
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,140
If you're big.

1326
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,140
If you're small.

1327
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,140
How do you say the way I do it?

1328
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,140
Dude, yeah.

1329
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:01,580
The experience of shrinking down to have fast sex with a fly would be otherworldly.

1330
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,900
To bust instantly.

1331
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:10,900
down busted

1332
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,180
flies are nasty

1333
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,140
the

1334
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,180
they got eight i was there always walk around like this they're like

1335
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,340
they can see it from the back and i'm not a human guy

1336
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,780
there's a nasty though each of our met right in front of you

1337
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,820
they always try to get in the poop to yeah which i don't play that line

1338
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,320
No, no, no, no, not for me. I draw the line at number one.

1339
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,460
I do not go into the number two world. No, thank you.

1340
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,860
All right. Um, so here's a, here's some,

1341
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,260
these are just some things I found on this pickup artist form.

1342
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,780
I thought were kind of interesting. Yeah. You didn't do a whole weird thing.

1343
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,600
I didn't do like a strange kind of thing. Yeah. So you can see,

1344
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,460
I didn't even experiment with the theme at all. I like it. I kind of, well,

1345
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,540
see I'm doing what's a pickup artist tactic. That's called not given a fuck.

1346
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,020
yeah world or even more specifically not giving a mother fuck yeah well

1347
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,660
old patrick not given a mother fuck but the i think i might think i may have

1348
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,540
uh... focus too much on the peacock you did you keep it you so what you did to

1349
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,180
you did something that's called being thirsty

1350
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,700
day

1351
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,940
which i'm not with a and then they'll have a lot here but

1352
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,020
which i would have read this before from you

1353
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,740
a girl's gonna kick you to the curb she's gonna do it's like in an m_m_o_ rpg you

1354
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,780
put all your points into the peacocking.

1355
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,620
- Yeah.

1356
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,020
- You should have put like 10 in thirstiness.

1357
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,860
- Yeah.

1358
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,680
(laughing)

1359
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,520
- Definitely.

1360
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,360
- True.

1361
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,620
- I fucked up today y'all.

1362
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,580
- It's a hey, another day?

1363
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,260
Well you know what, it's actually next year

1364
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,580
that you're gonna get another chance.

1365
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,420
- Okay.

1366
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,580
- It's only one Valentine's Day a year.

1367
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,600
So it's actually kind of, it's a big deal.

1368
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,340
It's kind of really bad.

1369
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,580
Game is like playing a Yu-Gi-Oh card game.

1370
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,420
- Shit.

1371
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,240
- C-Pix.

1372
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,300
Game is like playing Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

1373
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,360
Play your cards right and you win or hard in the end.

1374
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,180
Except instead of cards, you have one liners and gambits.

1375
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,900
you have to say the right things in the right way at the right time just like

1376
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,100
you have to play the right combination of cards in the correct sequence in this

1377
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
card game

1378
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,380
and actually attached a few uh... pictures to explain okay and is like

1379
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,620
playing you get to see if someone told me about game first and then told me is

00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,220

00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,380

1387
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,460
remind me of my ex and lame. Damn. So these are like different cards. I didn't realize

1388
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,540
that this is how I had to play it. Yeah. I'm playing it more like a sport. Yeah no it's

1389
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:48,620
definitely more like a card game. Yeah. I just dress up and then I hold my gun in

1390
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,660
in the club and no one comes up to me.

1391
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,500
They clear the club out.

1392
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,620
- The gun is a card.

1393
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,780
- Yeah, I'm standing in the club like this

1394
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,100
and everyone screams and runs.

1395
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,940
- That's so fucking weird.

1396
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,780
- Except for the one super freak girl though,

1397
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,260
who comes up to you when you're doing that.

1398
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,180
- Yeah, and she says, "Put down your weapon.

1399
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,980
"Put down your fucking weapon, put your hands up.

1400
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,780
"I'm gonna fucking put you in jail."

1401
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,620
She's a freak.

1402
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,220
- She tried to get the handcuffs out.

1403
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,780
- Yeah, damn, oh you weird.

1404
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,620
- Yeah.

1405
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,920
- She's wearing all blue too, a weird blue outfit.

1406
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,760
Which is your favorite Tom and Jerry game?

1407
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,580
And this is from Get Into The Game.

1408
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,180
New forum members start here, general questions.

1409
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,380
My top list of Tom and Jerry games are listed below.

1410
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,860
One, Tom and Jerry and Refrigerators.

1411
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,620
Two, Tom and Jerry Classroom Cleanup.

1412
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,940
Three, Tom and Jerry Tales.

1413
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,820
Four, Tom and Jerry and War of the Whiskers.

1414
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,900
From all of these games, Tom and Jerry Tales takes

1415
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,960
is my mind favorite.

1416
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,980
I mostly played this game when I am in funny mood.

1417
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,820
Which one is yours?

1418
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,380
Reply. - Damn, so.

1419
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,320
And then the signature that says, "Online Kids Games."

1420
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,660
- This is on the Pickup Artist website?

1421
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,020
We found two completely different corners of this world.

1422
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,260
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1423
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,100
I found--

1424
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,860
- I feel like we've only scratched the surface of this website.

1425
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,580
- I think what happened is that probably this person

1426
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,740
was a child and Googled game forum

1427
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:05,580
and found a spitting game and posted it.

1428
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,180
- Which could actually be very powerful

1429
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,020
to teach a child how to pick up women.

1430
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,860
- Oh my God.

1431
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,020
'Cause imagine how much that skill is gonna develop

1432
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,020
by the time they're an adult.

1433
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,780
they need some different type of information

1434
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,740
'cause they're all on this Andrew Tate bullshit right now.

1435
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,940
And they need some people really being honest about game.

1436
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,020
- They need more time and Jerry type shit.

1437
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,260
- Now that I'm looking at you, bald, right?

1438
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,220
And amazingly good looking and successful and rich.

1439
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,580
I'm not gonna even say that you could be,

1440
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,420
I'm saying how are you not the Andrew Tate replacement

1441
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,540
in the positive direction?

1442
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,340
- That's such a good fucking point.

1443
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,460
I think I definitely could kind of take over

1444
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,900
that I think maybe I should move to a foreign country.

1445
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,020
- Do something inspirational.

1446
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,300
- He left a power voice.

1447
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,140
- Do something inspirational.

1448
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,660
- Yeah, say something inspirational

1449
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,980
for the young viewers out there.

1450
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,560
Look directly at the camera.

1451
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,500
- Which camera, right here?

1452
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
- Right there, yeah.

1453
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,620
- Yo, if you're a young man right now,

1454
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,780
and you're alone, and you're single,

1455
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,940
and you're trying to hook up,

1456
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,380
and you're trying to date, you know what I'm saying?

1457
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,680
What I want you to do is, you don't need to be mean,

1458
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,960
You don't need to be aggressive, aggro, and alpha.

1459
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,760
You just need to be yourself, okay?

1460
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,180
And you need to be you.

1461
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,460
And I don't care if women hate you, they don't like you,

1462
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,300
they think you suck, they think you're weird,

1463
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,440
they think you're a fucking loser

1464
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,020
and they're saying that to your face constantly.

1465
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,920
You just need to just be you,

1466
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,440
even if that person is a bad person or you suck.

1467
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,920
You just have to keep going with it

1468
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,160
until you find somebody who kind of accepts you.

1469
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,700
And that might take a long time,

1470
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,140
an extremely long time for you to find somebody

1471
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,380
who can kind of put up with that bullshit.

1472
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,540
But you're gonna get it eventually.

1473
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,820
And yeah.

1474
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,620
- So be yourself. - That was inspiration.

1475
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,300
- I was really trying to be inspirational.

1476
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,260
- He's gonna go, we should cut that.

1477
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,060
- We're gonna see that on a TikTok or YouTube short.

1478
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,900
- Boom, doom, doom.

1479
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,140
- And there's gonna be like Lamborghinis

1480
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,980
and like B-roll going on.

1481
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,820
- And that song's like,

1482
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,860
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1483
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,940
- Yeah, it's gonna be amazing.

1484
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,860
- Oh my God.

1485
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,240
- I gotta go, we gotta go fast through these.

1486
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,140
- Okay.

1487
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,900
- Too much cocky, not enough comedy.

1488
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,820
I'm finding that when interacting with a set,

1489
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,380
I come off as cocky and arrogant and not very funny.

1490
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,380
I've never been a really funny guy.

1491
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,340
Any ideas on how to dial up the humor?

1492
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,020
The show "Californication" is a perfect example

1493
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,260
of mixing arrogance and humor,

1494
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,240
but even after watching the entire first season,

1495
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,940
I still can't seem to produce.

1496
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,460
Any other good shows or movies out there

1497
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,060
I can watch to get some examples?

1498
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,900
Thanks guys.

1499
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,860
I would say that the most, the highest riz possible fictional character is probably the Big Lebowski.

1500
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,860
Yeah.

1501
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,860
Oh, good.

1502
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,540
Women are attracted to him straight up.

1503
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,540
Yeah, yeah.

1504
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,540
Definitely.

1505
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,540
100%.

1506
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,540
Hi, Shayconzo.

1507
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,620
I'm still quite new here, but I hope I can help.

1508
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,820
I'm not very good at being cocky, but I'm okay when it comes to making people laugh.

1509
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,700
I think the best thing you can do is watch a lot of funny stuff.

1510
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,660
Most importantly, laugh at what you find funny and develop a sense of humor.

1511
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,660
I watch Simpsons every weekday and two episodes on a Saturday if I'm home.

1512
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,980
I really enjoy it and find the humor interesting and how it makes me laugh.

1513
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,800
Some other good shows are Friends, My Name is Earl, King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond,

1514
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,100
Will and Grace, Frasier, Futurama, Family Guy, Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck,

1515
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,100
etc.

1516
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,380
By watching shows like these on a regular basis, you will soon pick up structures on

1517
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,380
how to produce your own humor.

1518
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:26,740
Dude, walking up to a girl and doing Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.

1519
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,460
But there's an amazing entry here which is Family Guy.

1520
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,660
You pull up to the clam act.

1521
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,500
- Ooh.

1522
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,160
(laughing)

1523
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,660
- Well you don't want to pull up to the clam

1524
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,500
acting like Peter, 'cause Peter's gonna be like,

1525
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,340
"Hey, what's up?"

1526
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,340
- "I'm jacking my schwank."

1527
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,180
- That's true.

1528
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,000
- Oh, damn.

1529
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,520
The family guy impressions.

1530
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,140
(laughing)

1531
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,980
- That was good.

1532
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:45,800
- We were saving him.

1533
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,640
We were saving him for you.

1534
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,880
- That was so amazing, man.

1535
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,900
- Two things that I did to dial up my funny are,

1536
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,460
one, take an improv class/join an improv club.

1537
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,040
These are great ways to help you think on your feet

1538
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,600
in a funny way, and if you cannot join a class or club,

1539
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,120
look up on YouTube for how to improv.

1540
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,640
There's a pretty good series on there somewhere,

1541
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,160
also buy a book on improv, buy a mirror and practice. That's what you have to do,

1542
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,620
you have to buy the UCB 101 manual. I want to take an improv class where every dude

1543
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:14,720
in there is like looking like mystery. Yeah. Trying to do scenes where they're like hooking up.

1544
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:26,740
See a lot of whips. You look like fucking shit girl. That's the first line I've ever seen. You could do even improv

1545
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,860
- I love pickup lines.

1546
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,700
- Yeah.

1547
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,460
- You can be like, yeah, I can make that object work.

1548
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,300
You know, something like that.

1549
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,120
- Oh, wow.

1550
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:33,960
- Damn, wow.

1551
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,800
- Whoa.

1552
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,620
- That is good.

1553
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,460
- Talking about her.

1554
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,540
- I want you to be my scene partner.

1555
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,380
- Yeah, that's right.

1556
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,460
- Okay, maybe something like that.

1557
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,060
- Scene partner, no hot topic.

1558
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:42,900
That's what I would say.

1559
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,720
- Damn.

1560
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,560
- Yeah.

1561
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,400
- I'm gonna get my Dale.

1562
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,220
- I've never seen no partner like you.

1563
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,180
- I'm gonna get my Dale close to you.

1564
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,020
- You're gonna get what?

1565
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,340
- I'm gonna get my Dale close to you.

1566
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,180
- Oh, shit.

1567
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,020
- I'll show you videos of me fucking on my trampoline.

1568
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,860
- Oh, shit.

1569
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,460
- Wow, I wanna take you to a second city.

1570
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,020
Ooh, damn.

1571
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:57,860
- I'm trying to think.

1572
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,940
- Kind of trying to go to Paris.

1573
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,400
- Yeah, I think that you should be

1574
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,480
in the Improv Olympics, girl.

1575
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,220
- I wanna have sex with you a thousand times

1576
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,460
and you give birth to a bunch of little groundlings.

1577
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,500
- Yes, yes, that's good.

1578
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,020
I'm gonna fuck you so crazy

1579
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,540
that they have to put me in an asylum.

1580
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,380
(laughing)

1581
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,020
Or put you in an asylum, I don't know.

1582
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,860
- Both maybe.

1583
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,700
- Probably both of those.

1584
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,140
- And then we fuck in the asylum too.

1585
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,860
That's an improv asylum.

1586
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,900
How to set yourself apart from all the other guys.

1587
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,620
And this is by a Bart M. OK, that's important.

1588
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,000
Well, I don't have enough experience

1589
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,300
to say all nines are like that.

1590
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,740
But today I saw this gorgeous girl, absolute model,

1591
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,860
nicely dressed, nice teeth, big boobs, high heels, smelled good.

1592
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,400
She was doing something on her phone.

1593
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,780
I think texting Uber.

1594
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,140
I said, hey, I was just over there

1595
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,700
and I noticed you were checking me out.

1596
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,100
She didn't even bother looking in my eyes.

1597
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,220
She kept looking at her phone being disrespectful.

1598
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:50,940
I asked her name.

1599
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,500
She said it.

1600
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,940
I said, "Are you Indian?" She said, "No." I said, "Where are you from?" She didn't

1601
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,380
respond. She never looked at me once. She was on her phone all this time. I

1602
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,240
understand why this happens. I am just like that other guy that approached her

1603
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,420
five minutes ago, who was just like that other guy that approached her six minutes

1604
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,740
ago, who was just like that other guy that approached her seven minutes ago.

1605
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,700
But what's the solution to this? How do you approach such girls? How do you get

1606
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,740
rid of the bitch shield? Or it's better to just walk away and hear what people

1607
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:20,300
have to say to Bart. Bart, I've found out, is somewhat of a character

1608
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,440
on this forum. People know Bart and they address him very directly.

1609
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,940
Alright, let me see.

1610
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,900
Bart!

1611
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,780
We'll look past the conversation as you already know your words were weak.

1612
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,340
That's fucked.

1613
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,860
Bart, you have yet to develop the confidence, courage, and fervor to attract

1614
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,140
women of high quality.

1615
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,620
Whoa. Bart, you're missing the point. Lay off of Bart. Good luck, Bart.

1616
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,580
I thought I exiled Bart a long time ago at the time of his mental breakdown by

1617
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,660
highlighting his inaction by offering my help. Looks like we're both back in town.

1618
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:50,480
you're not a lion your field mouse very much low on the food chain and our

1619
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,900

01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,680
was steven spielberg or was that is a need to report are you for real

1622
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,860
part of your to respect women and stop calling the bitches part could it be

1623
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,620
that's why they have a shield when they see you part why did you approach a nine

1624
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,180
when you were smelly and sweaty bar why do you give women numbers when you don't

1625
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,500

1626
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,100

you know i really are

1636
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,660
here. You can do yours.

1637
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,660
All right.

1638
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:51,880
I can go to my thing. So I found a different, real quick, I found this one on the Pickup

1639
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,880
Artist subreddit. This is a Hooter game. Can you move that over? Somehow it got moved over.

1640
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
You can just scroll. There's a scroll bar at the bottom.

1641
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,600
Hi all. This will be my first post here. How do you guys approach a Hooter waitress? I

1642
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,200
mean, Hired Gun Game is a whole other level with thinking of ordering something and starting

1643
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,200
from there.

1644
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
That's a great opening.

1645
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,600
I was like, that's probably the number one way.

1646
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,160
I think so. I think you got it.

1647
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,000
- Yeah.

1648
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,820
- Like he already figured it out.

1649
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,740
He doesn't need any advice,

1650
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,020
but I just thought that that was some good advice.

1651
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,860
(laughing)

1652
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,500
Okay, so as far as the Pickup Artist Forum,

1653
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,660
I focused on NLP and hypnotic seduction,

1654
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,500
which NLP stands for, fuck, I already forgot it.

1655
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,340
- It's right there.

1656
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,400
- Oh yeah, neuro-linguistic programming.

1657
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,260
So it's basically hypnosis.

1658
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,340
It's hypnotizing women through something called sequences.

1659
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,080
So they tell you like, do this and then this and then this,

1660
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,460
and then you can have sex with this girl.

1661
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,620
- What's crazy about this is I've heard of this,

1662
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,780
but not from Pickup Artist

1663
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,620
because I downloaded a 900 page ebook about how the government is keeping

1664
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:51,140
slaves. Yeah, it's basically NLP is very popular with the New World Order. Yeah, I

1665
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,620
didn't know that. So let's check out some of these posts. So this one is make her

1666
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:59,340
come without touch her. Hey guys, it's my first post here and I want to ask you

1667
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:03,060
something. Once I had read about a very strong technique which allowed the user

1668
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:07,540
to make the HB come without even touching her using anchors, NLP and

1669
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,620
chakras to do this. Of course, when I studied about this, I wasn't even aware

1670
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,540
of what an anchor is so I thought it was bullshit. Now I want to ask you, do you

1671
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,920
know a technique or something similar to this, and I'm not talking about Shades

1672
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,720
hypnosis, but just using pure NLP I know it's possible. And this is a pretty

1673
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,740
common question. What is an HB? HB, I don't remember what it stands for. Probably a hot bitch, right?

1674
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,760
Yeah, it's probably something like that. Yeah. But I find that they use kind of more

1675
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,660
scientific terms than you would think. Okay. And then this is a basically the

1676
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:40,060
exact same post, make woman cream anytime she thinks of me. Is there any way to covertly

1677
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,480
hypnotize a woman to do the following,

1678
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,940
cream any time she thinks of me,

1679
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,000
and have the most intense orgasm of her life

1680
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,740
every five seconds when we're in bed.

1681
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,980
- I think there is a sect of the CIA that is working on this.

1682
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,860
- This is what, they were doing MKUltra

1683
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,620
to make people go fight in Vietnam,

1684
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,860
and then they were like, oh wait, no,

1685
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,860
we should be doing this to get some pussy.

1686
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:03,460
- And then they invented this whole other section of--

1687
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,820
- There literally is like a whole conspiracy theory thing

1688
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,380
about the Monarch Program that's exactly like,

1689
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:11,720
Yeah, it's like literally that's the same hypnosis thing, but it's for so they can

1690
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:15,240
have... I will say, I don't wanna jump too far into this, but I will say that

1691
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,200
there are parts of this that are so dangerous that I'm not even sure I wanna

1692
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,760
talk about them. There are some secrets that are gonna be revealed here. Some

1693
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:28,020
sensor bars flying into the video for sure. Blowjob pattern, does anybody know it? And this is from

1694
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:34,840
Romeo 7. Oh my God. So I was expecting nobody to know... There's not a blowjob. This is all the way back in 2007.

1695
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,440
- Yeah, dude. - So the level

1696
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,480
the techniques have gotten to now, 16 years later.

1697
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,720
- And this one has a script.

1698
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,240
There are three types of DJ patterns.

1699
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,360
- Okay, don't say this out loud here.

1700
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,000
I don't wanna give you a blowjob right now.

1701
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,280
- Well, no, you play the girl.

1702
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,080
Okay, so this is the one interesting blowjob pattern.

1703
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:53,920
I think this might work.

1704
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,440
Number one, ask her about anything she really loves to eat.

1705
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,900
Number two, describe the sensation of eating that food

1706
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,480
and amplify with gustatory gusto.

1707
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,120
Number three, link it to your dick using a quote dick point.

1708
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:05,960
- Okay, try it out. - Which is often--

1709
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,220
- Try it out. - As a dick.

1710
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,400
- All right, try it out. - So, hey Cameron,

1711
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,280
what do you love to eat?

1712
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,840
Something that really makes you salivate

1713
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,040
just by thinking of it.

1714
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,240
- Chocolate cake.

1715
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,000
- Mm, chocolate cake, mm, that's yummy.

1716
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I don't know if you can imagine sucking into one

1717
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,160
sweet, delicious, juicy chocolate cake now.

1718
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,440
Mm, can you taste the sweetness of the cake

1719
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,220
swishing inside your mouth?

1720
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,660
Mm, so tasty.

1721
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,580
doesn't that give you lots of pleasure and happiness? Just think about that.

1722
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:36,700
Mmm, I bet if there were a chocolate cake here now, you'd want it in your mouth.

1723
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:41,220
Point to Dicky. So then I'm like, so does that make you want to blow me?

1724
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:45,860
I am spending all my energy right now to not leap across the table.

1725
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,380
I am shaking to be honest.

1726
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,180
I can see. So I wouldn't try that at home though.

1727
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,180
Must suck Caleb's dick.

1728
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,380
It might be too powerful. Uh, speaking of too powerful, by the way. Okay. Okay.

1729
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:00,540
So this is where we get into sort of the ancient secret knowledge. Okay. Yes. All right.

1730
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:07,220
So this is from The Prophet in 2012. Whoa. Second thread I've read in

1731
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:12,040
which someone has recommended Octoberman. It's banned for a reason, guys. It's a

1732
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,140
forbidden technique because of how damaging it is. Stop suggesting it to

1733
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,420
people until you understand it's dangerous. I didn't even scratch the

1734
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,020
surface of this website. So Octoberman, dude, I saw Octoberman and I was like, that's kind of

1735
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,660
weird and then I saw it a couple more times so like here stop this shit

1736
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:31,460
already the October man is forbidden it is that way for a very good reason the

1737
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:35,580
pattern is extremely dangerous and in most cases very destructive you should

1738
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,140
know that posting any links about forbidden patterns will have

1739
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,900
consequences I'm not a whiny bitch so I won't call the mods but if they find

1740
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,980
out they will be pissed okay so I tried to look up October man and I found an

1741
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:52,380
e-book the October man's whoa looks fucking dangerous that girl could be

1742
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,920
dead. This needs to be adapted into a feature-length film. It has to. The

1743
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,440
Octoberman with Daniel Craig. That's such a good name for a movie too. Are you kidding me?

1744
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,080
HBO Max original. Unfortunately it was $6.99 and it was a pretty long book so I didn't read it.

1745
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:09,720
We'll get into it another day. Yeah, but I think that... but I would I would caution

1746
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:15,720
anybody who dares research The Octoberman. This is hidden, forbidden, kind of

1747
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:22,160
national treasure level. What? It says "The Mystery." No, it's

1748
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,880
mystery what could be the Octoberman sequence. Oh okay. I will say I'd looked it

1749
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,880
up and kind of confusing to make it the big mystery. Generally it's about

1750
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,120
basically hypnotizing a woman into thinking that if you she doesn't have

1751
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:45,000
sex with you she will die. Oh my god! That is basically what it is. Oh my god. That sounds dangerous.

1752
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,140
Yeah it does sound really dangerous. And people have tried it. Fucked up with a

1753
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:53,860
girl this is from Hercules so I told this girl I wanted to have anal sex with her

1754
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,580
and told her through text messages and she was stunned she was like WTF and

1755
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:01,040
said why would I say that I told her that's how I felt when I think about her

1756
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,620
she was like why do you say that and it's awkward talking to me now I told

1757
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:07,740
her what do you think what should I do should I just not talk to her anymore I

1758
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,820
haven't seen her in four months and then decided to tell her did I mess up she

1759
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:17,340
was like don't tell a girl that and other stuff any advice and then he just

1760
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:21,900
said I want to have anal sex with you. Yo, what up? Haven't seen you, when was this?

1761
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:26,780
2010. I haven't seen you at Blockbuster in a minute. This guy's had a pretty serious

1762
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:32,460
journey as a PUA. Yeah. So he wants to use an NLP to stop being

1763
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,620
obsessed. I'm assuming it's the same girl. Must be. I want to stop being obsessed

1764
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:39,180
with this girl. What NLP techniques can I use so I could stop being obsessed? I'm

1765
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,580
really obsessed. I always think about her and I even tried love spells

1766
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,900
which don't work and I was doing it out of ignorance. At least he can admit he was

1767
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,540
doing it out of ignorance. This guy had a tragic end to his story, right? Because

1768
01:08:50,540 --> 01:09:02,900
watch this. Hercules, October Man sequence, post redacted for breaking 4, posse. So he literally tried to ask for the sacred knowledge and they boomed him. They took him off the face of the fucking planet.

1769
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:08,380
So this shit is getting fucking real. This stuff has to work, right? This is like

1770
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:15,100
pyramid level style, geometric structure. I'm seeing mandalas. There's gonna be tool playing and shit.

1771
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:15,940
- Yeah, you can.

1772
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,220
(laughing)

1773
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,440
'Cause I can tell you anything that's ending

1774
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,560
with man like the Slender Man.

1775
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,400
- Yes.

1776
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,140
- The Bye Bye Man, which I shouldn't even say.

1777
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,100
- Don't even say that.

1778
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,260
- Bloody Mary Man.

1779
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,780
- Yeah, Candy Man.

1780
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,960
- Candy Man.

1781
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,900
- So this next person, I think October is Halloween.

1782
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,220
- Correct, I think this next person

1783
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:35,060
used the October Man sequence.

1784
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,540
- No, nevermind, this is creating own Tyler Durden.

1785
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,620
(laughing)

1786
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,500
Yeah, you heard me.

1787
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,900
Lately I've been thinking about creating

1788
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,720
a whole different person that becomes me

1789
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,440
when I only wear an earring.

1790
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,960
Good thing I never pierce my ear before,

1791
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,500
so I have to pierce my ear on top of my ear.

1792
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,080
So that's gonna be quite painful.

1793
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,080
And time I've pierced my ear time,

1794
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,920
my other identity will born.

1795
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,200
And when I wear my earrings, he will become me.

1796
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,160
He is absolutely alpha, but most importantly,

1797
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,040
he can do some nasty shits.

1798
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,480
He don't give a little shit about others.

1799
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,100
He is true asshole.

1800
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,640
That way I can do things I won't, scared to do.

1801
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,560
Any idea?

1802
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,280
This is AFC Aza.

1803
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,680
this person says, oh this is a different person,

1804
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,280
this person I think used the Octoberman sequence,

1805
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,480
my target died.

1806
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,640
(laughing)

1807
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,280
By mind programmer.

1808
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,880
I should have stopped, I really liked her,

1809
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,600
but I ended up going too far with it

1810
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,640
and she ended up taking her own life.

1811
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,440
Now I'm left with her friends whom I had no interest

1812
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,080
in calling me up to console me over the loss,

1813
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,640
even though they talked shit about her all the time.

1814
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,540
I was only using them to get to her.

1815
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,940
What I don't know is if she killed herself over my games,

1816
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,720
but the timing of it is all too coincidental to ignore.

1817
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,580
I won't lie, I'm crying like a baby now

1818
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,420
and I'm angry with myself.

1819
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:45,360
- Holy shit.

1820
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,120
- This is the dark side of the Octoberman sequence.

1821
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,960
- Yeah.

1822
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,520
- But this is a community, right?

1823
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,320
And we hold each other up.

1824
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,520
So this guy says, "Everything happens for a reason, man.

1825
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,520
Cheers to natural playboy."

1826
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,600
(laughing)

1827
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,520
- Wait, look at that, look at his name and his signature.

1828
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,600
- Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt.

1829
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,080
- The natural playboy.

1830
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,920
- That person is like Blackout Drone.

1831
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,160
(laughing)

1832
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:15,160
Everything happens for a reason man. Don't worry if your target died because you did October Man sequence to her

1833
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:21,080
I'm so I think I'm gonna go down a descent to madness and a dark rabbit hole of learning about the Arctic

1834
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,080
I think you've set me off

1835
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:29,640
Do not even look it up dude

1836
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:35,560
I you literally have exposed me to this and you know that I'm the type of guy that seeks truth and I look

1837
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,160
psychology

1838
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,340
I hate that I opened this rabbit hole. You should have told me to get out of the room for this

1839
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,340
part of the show. I should have.

1840
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,440
Because this is going to ruin my life. We should have just pumped that Goethe-A song

1841
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,760
into your headphones the whole time. Damn, you're right.

1842
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,280
That's the one song that I know you love to vibe to.

1843
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,280
And that was the, Goethe-A is basically the opposite of Dark.

1844
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,720
See now I'm going to be so fucked, I'm going to go home and I'm going to be listening to

1845
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,960
Radiohead and I'm going to be looking through books at the library on the microfiche.

1846
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,760
Radiohead is not October Man Seagulls. October Man Seagulls is like Breaking Benjamin, that

1847
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,760
I'm going to be listening to Apex Twin.

1848
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,760
I'm going to have an Apex Twin research montage.

1849
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,760
I'm going to be looking through newspapers.

1850
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:21,760
Oh my god, October 1998, October 1997, October 19, every year.

1851
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,760
Yes, to find the man.

1852
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,760
And then I just have one more post here, which is in the miscellaneous.

1853
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,760
This is "Where can I find good tires for my favorite car?"

1854
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,800
Can anyone tell me where I can find good tires for my car? I live in New York.

1855
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,800
Did they get an answer?

1856
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:44,800
